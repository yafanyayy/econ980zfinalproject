Before I turn to the results of the quarter, I want to take a moment to thank all of our teams again, especially our frontline colleagues. We have now passed the 1-year mark of working within this challenging COVID-19 environment, and I'm very proud of their continued performance and dedication. 
Campbell delivered strong second quarter results, with growth in all 3 key financial metrics. Organic net sales increased 5%, with continued demand across both divisions, fueled by accelerating in-market results, including positive share progress across most of the portfolio and a strong holiday period. Net sales were tempered by continued food service weakness following a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in December, which led to greater away-from-home restrictions, as well as some supply constraints given these cases led to increased absenteeism rate in our plants during the month. The food service weakness and supply constraints each created about 1 point a headwind in the quarter versus our expectations. 
The labor situation has since improved significantly, and we continued to make steady progress on supply going into the second half of the year. We reacted quickly to these headwinds, appropriately shifting spending to reflect this pressure. But where supply was available, we executed our planned increased investment in advertising and consumer promotion on our core brands. 
Taking everything into account, we had 8% adjusted EBIT growth and 17% adjusted EPS growth, leading to a very good quarter. 
By segment, Meals and Beverages posted 6% net sales growth, punctuated by a very successful soup season and the continued strong performance of brands like V8 and Prego. This was partially mitigated by declines in food service. The Snacks business delivered another solid quarter, with sales growth of 4%, largely driven by our power brands in salty snacks, including kettle brand potato chips, late July snacks and Cape Cod potato chips, as well as Pepperidge farm farmhouse bakery products. 
Most notably, we achieved the primary objective we outlined in our Q1 earnings call, to return to share growth. Nearly 75% of our portfolio held or increased share in the second quarter versus the prior year. This included meaningful share improvement in key focus areas like ready to serve soup, Prego and Snyder's of Hanover Pretzels, with continued momentum on condensed soup, V8, our Salty Snacks portfolio and Goldfish. There were a few exceptions such as Swanson Broth, where we knew we'd be challenged on supply. We feel very good about how we are addressing the challenges on broth by expanding overall capacity and growing Pacific Foods, which was the fastest growing broth brand in measured channels in the second quarter. 
E-commerce continued to be an important growth channel for us, with in-market dollar consumption increasing 89% over the prior year. With the click and collect fulfillment model representing slightly more than 1/3 of our e-commerce retail sales, we are sharply focused on partnering with our customers to deliver value to our consumers, including bundling products for easy meal prep and inspiring creative snacking options. 
Turning to Slide 7. 
Within the Meals and Beverages division, we had another strong quarter, with consumption growth of 9%, principally due to volume gains. We delivered on our objective of share growth and saw positive in-market consumption growth in almost all categories, led by condensed soups, Prego, V8 beverages, ready to serve soup and Pacific Foods soups and broth. 
We continued to execute our plans and feel great about our progress against our win in soup strategy, led by a great start to soup season and a strong holiday period. In fact, U.S. soup sales grew 10%, with strength across all categories. This was fueled by more than 1/3 of the end market consumption growth coming from new buyers. The number of retained soup buyers in this quarter is the highest since the pandemic started almost a year ago. Our condensed soups were once again the highlight of the quarter, with double-digit net sales growth and continued share gains, especially among millennials. 
With a 0.7 share increase, condensed had its eighth consecutive quarter of share gains, an amazing run that started well before the pandemic. This performance was driven by our quality improvements, strong advertising and the retention of new households. Additionally, during the important holiday season, the number of buyers of condensed cooking soups grew double-digits, and we continued to grow household penetration this quarter versus prior year. Year-to-date, our condensed soups have the highest household retention rate within the entire Meals and Beverage division. 
Within ready-to-serve, share improved this quarter, driven by strong base velocity growth in Chunky and improved availability. Chunky had an exceptional quarter, with double-digit net sales gains and in-market consumption growth, outpacing competition and increasing share nearly 2 points, with growth among all cohorts, including millennials. 
Pacific Foods is now the fastest-growing wet soup brand on a dollar share basis, outperforming its competitors on many fronts by delivering on trend innovation and impactful advertising. This important growth engine continues to perform above our expectations. In the second quarter, Pacific soup and broth outperformed the category, posting dollar consumption growth of 25%, the fifth consecutive quarter of share gains driven by brand strength and a meaningful increase in household penetration. We are thrilled with the performance of Pacific Foods and are equally excited about our robust innovation pipeline, that includes new canned offerings as well as additional plant-based products. 
As I mentioned earlier, Swanson broth struggled on share as we expected. We continue to recover on supply throughout the quarter, and we are making steady progress through a combination of expanding internal capacity and bringing on additional co manufacturing. In the most recent period, we are seeing both share and supply levels improve, a trend we expect to continue through the balance of the year. 
Beyond soup, a standout in the Meals and Beverages portfolio was Prego, which maintained its #1 share position in the Italian sauce category for the 21st consecutive month and has widened the gap against competitors. Prego sales growth came primarily from the gain of an additional 4 million new households across all demographic cohorts. 
Our V8 beverages also performed very well this quarter, delivering its fourth straight quarter of both share and household gains. Notably in Q2, these gains were across all sub-brands of the business. And we saw new households coming into the V8 portfolio, driven by both V8 original and V8 + Energy. 
Overall, Meals and Beverages delivered a strong quarter, as it continued to drive relevance with its brands to a younger consumer base and delivered share gains in many of its key categories. 
Let's turn to the Snacks segment, which represents about half of our total annual revenue. Our performance was again fueled by our power brands, which grew dollar consumption by 8% over the previous year. Within the power brands, our Salty Snacks brands grew dollar consumption by double-digits and realized share growth. This was in part due to the implementation of our capacity expansion projects as well as increased A&C investments to support our media campaigns and innovation, including Snyder's of Hanover Pretzel rounds and twisted sticks. 
On the Snyder's of Hanover brand, the combination of successful innovation, fundamental execution and brand activation led to share growth, double-digit dollar consumption and nearly 5 million new households, turning around what had been a challenging share period. 
Our Pepperidge Farm Farmhouse products also delivered exceptional results across bakery and cookies, growing dollar consumption by 41% and household penetration by 1.5 points. 
On Goldfish, we improved our performance according to the plan we outlined last quarter, returning to growth in net sales and improved dollar consumption. We adapted marketing content during the holidays, with digital partnerships focused on new ways for the consumer to enjoy Goldfish, such as movie night snack mixes or classic lunch combinations with Campbell's tomato soup, all leading to positive engagement metrics and increased purchase intent. Additionally, we are launching new flavors within Flavor Blasted Goldfish, which continued to grow consumption by double-digits. 
As you'll see on Slide 9, this is only the beginning of what is arguably our strongest slate of innovation yet, which includes twisted pretzel sticks and better-for-you options like late July veggie tortilla chips. We are very excited about the breadth of our snacks pipeline in the second half of the fiscal year, which will complement what we have on deck later this year for Meals and Beverages. 
Overall, we feel very good about our Snacks performance and the steady growth it delivered as we provide consumers with elevated snacking experiences through our unique and differentiated portfolio of power brands. We also made significant steps on value capture, including the recent transition to SAP to streamline and improve capabilities. Looking ahead, we believe we have additional runway to improve Snacks profitability with further network optimization opportunities. And we remain confident in our long-term strategy and our ability to deliver additional cost savings. 
With the strong results in the second quarter and our overall first half performance, we are confident in the outlook for the full year. 
With that, let me turn it over to Mick to discuss our second quarter and first half financial results."
258458,705513187,2233853,"Campbell Soup Company, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Mar 10, 2021",2021-03-10,"Earnings Calls","The Campbell's Company","Executives","Thanks, Mark. Good morning, everyone.

Good morning, everyone. 
Turning to Slide 11. As Mark just shared, we once again delivered strong results, with another quarter of sales growth, driven by continued elevated consumer demand, as well as growth in adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS. 
Our top line growth of 5% reflected healthy in-market consumption of approximately 8% in the quarter, tempered by declines in food servers and some COVID-19 related supply challenges that Mark discussed. 
Adjusted EBIT increased 8%, as higher sales volumes were only partially offset by higher adjusted administrative expenses. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations increased by 17% to $0.84 per share, reflecting an increase in adjusted EBIT as well as lower adjusted net interest expense. Year-to-date, our organic net sales, which excludes the impact from the sale of the European chips business, increased 7%, driven by strong in-market consumption growth in both Meals and Beverages and Snacks. Adjusted EBIT increased 13%, reflecting higher sales volume, improved adjusted gross margin performance and higher adjusted other income, offset partially by increased adjusted administrative expenses. Year-to-date, our adjusted EBIT margin increased year-over-year by 110 basis points to 18.5%. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations increased 23% to $1.86 per share, reflecting the increase in adjusted EBIT and lower adjusted net interest expense. 
I'll review in the next couple of slides our second quarter results in more detail and provide guidance for the full fiscal year 2021. 
Breaking down our net sales performance for the quarter. Reported and organic net sales increased 5% from the prior year. This performance was largely driven by a 4 point gain in volume across the majority of our retail brands, partially offset by declines in food service and in partner brands within the Snyder's-Lance portfolio. Additionally, we took a strategic approach to dialing back promotional spending in both segments where we faced supply constraints. And those actions, net of price and sales allowances, contributed 1 point to net sales growth. 
Our adjusted gross margin decreased by 10 basis points in the quarter to 34.3%. While product mix was slightly negative in the quarter, we're estimating a 50 basis point gross margin improvement from better operating leverage within our supply chain network, as we increased our overall production. Net pricing drove a 90 basis point improvement due to lower levels of promotional spending in the quarter. Inflation and other factors had a negative impact of 330 basis points. A little over half of the increase was driven by cost inflation, as overall input prices on a rate basis increased approximately 3%, which we expect to continue to be a headwind for the rest of the fiscal year. The remainder was driven by increases in other operational costs and continued COVID-19 related costs. 
Inflation in the quarter was partially offset by our ongoing supply chain productivity program, which contributed 140 basis point improvement and included initiatives, among others, within procurement and logistics optimization. Our cost savings program, which is incremental to our ongoing supply chain productivity program, added 50 basis points to our gross margin. 
Moving on to other operating items. 
Adjusted marketing and selling expenses decreased $3 million or 1% in the quarter. This decrease was driven primarily by the benefits of cost savings initiatives and lower marketing overhead costs, largely offset by an 8% increased investment in A&C. These investments primarily reflect higher levels of media spend to support our Salty snacks brands, including new product launches, as well as our soup business, as we continued to drive usage through new recipes, inspire meal solutions and support our innovation. 
Adjusted administrative expenses increased $17 million or 13%, driven primarily by higher benefit related costs and higher general administrative costs, partially offset by the benefits from our cost savings initiatives. Overall, our adjusted marketing and selling expenses represented 10.2% of net sales during the quarter, a 70 basis point decrease compared to last year. Adjusted administrative expenses represented 6.7% of net sales during the quarter, a 50 basis point increase compared to last year. 
Moving to the next slide. 
We have continued to successfully deliver against our multiyear enterprise cost savings initiatives. This quarter, we achieved just over $20 million in incremental year-over-year savings. We expect an additional $40 million to $50 million evenly spread over the balance of fiscal 2021, on track to deliver $75 million to $85 million of cost savings for the fiscal year, with the majority of the savings from the Snyder's-Lance integration. We remain on track to deliver a cumulative savings target of $850 million by the end of fiscal 2022. 
To help tie this all together, we are providing an adjusted EBIT bridge on Slide 16 to highlight the key drivers of performance this quarter. 
As discussed, adjusted EBIT grew by 8%. This was driven by the increase in demand for our products, with sales gains contributing $40 million of EBIT growth, which was partially offset by the previously described adjusted gross margin decline. In addition, the increase in adjusted administrative expenses was only partially offset by lower adjusted marketing and selling expenses, lower adjusted R&D expenses and higher adjusted other income. Our adjusted EBIT margin increased year-over-year by 40 basis points to 17.2%.  
The following chart breaks down our adjusted EPS growth between our operating performance and below the line items. Adjusted EPS increased $0.12 from $0.72 in the prior year quarter to $0.84 per share. Adjusted EBIT had a positive $0.07 impact on adjusted EPS. Adjusted net interest expense declined year-over-year by $17 million, delivering a $0.04 positive impact to adjusted EPS. As we have used proceeds from completed divestitures in fiscal 2020 and our strong cash flow to reduce debt, the impact from the adjusted tax rate was nominal, completing the bridge to $0.84 per share. 
In Meals and Beverages, net sales increased 6% to $1.3 billion, primarily reflecting strong volume growth, driven by in-market consumption for many of our U.S. retail products, including gains in U.S. soup, V8 Beverages, Prego Pasta sauces and Campbell's pasta, partially offset by declines in food service, driven by COVID-19 related restrictions. 
Net sales of U.S. soup, including Pacific Foods, increased 10% compared to the prior year, primarily due to volume gains in condensed soups and ready-to-serve soups. Across the division, we moderated promotional activity, in part due to supply constraints, particularly on broth. 
Operating earnings for Meals and Beverages increased 7% to $258 million. The increase was primarily driven by sales volume growth, offset partially by a lower gross margin and higher administrative expenses. 
Within Snacks, net sales increased 4%, driven by volume gains, fueled by the majority of our power brands and lower levels of promotional spending on supply-constrained brands. The sales gains were driven by our Salty Snacks brands within the power brand portfolio, namely Cattle brand potato chips, Late July snacks, Cape Cod potato chips and Pop Secret popcorn, as well as our fresh bakery products, including Pepperidge Farm Farmhouse products. Partially offsetting sales gains were declines in partner brands within the Snyder's-Lance portfolio as well as declines in Lance sandwich crackers, resulting from supply constraints in the quarter. 
Operating earnings for Snacks increased 6%, driven by sales volume gains and lower selling expenses, partially offset by higher marketing investment, administrative expenses and a lower gross margin. 
I'll now turn to our cash flow and liquidity. 
Fiscal year-to-date cash flow from operations decreased from $663 million in the prior year to $611 million, as changes in working capital were only partially offset by higher cash earnings. Although we continued to make progress on working capital, we are lapping significant benefits and accounts payable in the prior year. Our year-to-date cash [ for ] investing activities was largely reflective of the cash outlay for capital expenditures of $132 million, which was $35 million lower than the prior year, primarily driven by discontinued operations. Our year-to-date cash outflows for financing activities were $405 million, reflecting cash outlays due to dividends paid of $215 million, which were comparable to the prior year, reflecting our quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share. In December, we announced an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.37 per share or an increase of 6%, which, from a cash flow perspective, will be reflected in the third quarter. Additionally, we reduced our debt by $176 million. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $946 million. We expect to utilize the majority of this cash during the second half of the fiscal year for repayment of upcoming debt maturities of $721 million and $200 million in March and May, respectively. 
As covered in our press release, based on our strong first half performance, we are providing guidance for the full year fiscal 2021. 
We expect net sales for fiscal 2021 to decline 3.5% to 2.5%. Excluding the impacts from the 53rd week in fiscal 2020 and the impact of the European chips divestiture, we expect organic net sales to decline 1.5% to 0.5%. We expect adjusted EBIT of minus 1% to plus 1%, as we will lap the initial COVID-19 demand surge in the second half of our fiscal year, combined with headwinds from increased promotional activity, partially offset by lower year-over-year COVID-19 related expenses and last year's onetime marketing investments. We continue to expect net interest expense of $215 million to $220 million and an adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 24%. As a result, we expect adjusted EPS of $3.03 to $3.11 per share, representing year-over-year growth of 3% to 5%. The EPS impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2020 was estimated to be $0.04 per share. 
With respect to our guidance, let me add that we expect the third quarter to be somewhat more challenged from a net sales and EBIT perspective than Q4, as the before mentioned COVID-19 related Demand search was more pronounced in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 while the benefit from COVID-19 related costs and onetime marketing investments will disproportionately benefit our fourth quarter comparison. Additionally, we expect our third quarter to be impacted by some isolated supply challenges as we navigate the recent winter storms. In particular, we experienced about 2 weeks of disruption at our Paris, Texas plant, which produces paste and Prego. We expect improving momentum as we go forward. 
Regarding capital expenditures, in light of the current operating environment, with limited access to our factories, we now expect to spend 10% below the $350 million we had previously indicated for the full year, largely driven by the impacts from COVID-19 on the operating environment. 
Before I turn it back to Mark for some additional commentary, let me close by expressing how proud I am of the continued strong execution by our teams throughout the company. We delivered another strong quarter, with a return to positive share growth in the majority of our portfolio and growth in all 3 key financial metrics, despite all the challenges of COVID-19.

Before we conclude, I want to share my perspective on the key factors underpinning our confidence in our outlook beyond the pandemic.

Before we conclude, I want to share my perspective on the key factors underpinning our confidence in our outlook beyond the pandemic. 
By now, I know you have heard a great deal about the stickiness of all new households gained throughout the pandemic from essentially all of our peers, with a wide range of data, in fact, supporting that thesis. We very much agree, and we see similar trends in our own research and data. 
I'd like to conclude today with 3 critical and differentiating points, key factors that serve to underscore Campbell's advantaged position going forward and will fuel our future growth trajectory. Importantly, 2 of them have very little to do with COVID-19 or the stickiness of new households. 
The first is our Snacks business, which, as I mentioned earlier, consists of a unique and differentiated portfolio of brands that represent approximately 50% of the company's annual revenues. This business was growing before the pandemic, and we expect to sustain or exceed those historical growth rates going forward. Snacks also includes a margin structure which we believe still has significant opportunity for improvement versus the snacking peer group average, even after we deliver our current value capture. We are finalizing our plans to unlock more value, and we look forward to sharing more details with you as we move forward. 
Second, no matter where you stand on the retention of new households gained during the pandemic, it is undisputable the Campbell's business, particularly our Meals and Beverages division and especially soup, is coming out of this period more advantaged and with renewed relevance. Nearly 13 million new households purchased Campbell soup since the initial peak of the pandemic, of which almost 1/3 are millennials, outpacing both key competitors and the category average. We have also seen macro behaviors like quick scratch cooking, take root. And our research indicates more than 30% of consumers are cooking more with soups since the start of the pandemic. Additionally, we believe increased at-home launches will endure as many people are expected to work from home more often post pandemic. Beyond the role that our Meals and Beverages offerings play in the lunch occasion, Snack Foods accompany nearly 30% of all lunches, which bodes well for our entire portfolio. 
We've conducted extensive consumer research in an effort to determine sentiment, model consumer behavior exiting the pandemic and sharpen our plans to ensure the sustainability of our recent gains. The consumers who we've surveyed had an overall high level of satisfaction with Campbell's products in our Meals and Beverages and Snacks portfolio. In fact, about 4 out of 5 new users surveyed said they were very or extremely satisfied with our brands. As a result of this high satisfaction, those surveyed told us they'll continue to count on our brands going forward, turning to us for things like cooking solutions and quick lunches and meals. This gives us every reason to believe consumers will continue to purchase our brands well after the pandemic. Even more importantly, 70% of the consumer surveyed told us our brands better met their needs than competitive products. These same consumers also told us the taste and convenience of our brands were the top drivers of overall satisfaction. We feel this sets us up well for continued share progress going forward. The research also has provided us with actionable insights in our opportunities to strengthen the retention of our consumers. These include areas such as: adding more convenient packaging options and sizes across our portfolio; developing new and inspiring recipes; and satisfying consumers' need for permissible and more intense snacks by providing a variety of flavors and healthier ingredients. This specificity will focus our plans and innovation to target the areas with the highest probabilities of retaining these new consumers, particularly younger consumers for our brands. 
For the third and final differentiating point that underscores our strong position going forward, we look to the strength of our balance sheet. Given the cash-generative nature of our business and our reduced leverage, which is now below 3x, we are well positioned to generate significant cash flow, well above our ongoing commitment to base capital investments and dividends in the next 3 years. This can and will be a source of opportunity that can be invested in high ROI initiatives or other actions to drive value creation. 
So to wrap it up, our mission is clear: #1, sustain or accelerate our historical snacks growth while improving margins; #2, solidify our Meals and Beverages business as a steady and stable contributor behind recent transformational, consumer trends and trial; and #3, deploy what will be significant capital to fuel this growth and create differentiated value. 
We look forward to sharing more in the months ahead about this next chapter as Campbell moves from turnaround to sustainable growth. 
And with that, operator, let's open it up for questions."

You went through some of the factors that limited organic growth maybe relative to your ingoing assumptions. One would assume, obviously, food service recovers a bit, of course, as restrictions are lifted and such. 
But I'm trying to get a better handle on where the company is around supply and capacity. Is that largely behind the company at this point? Or does some of that still linger? And the reason I ask you is I'm trying to get a better handle on the relationship between sort of consumption and shipments as we go through the fiscal third quarter. 
Do those -- are those more consistent with each other? Is there the opportunity to rebuild inventory such that shipments maybe exceed consumption for a period of time? I'm just trying to get a handle on that, and then I've just got a quick follow-up."
258458,705513187,2233853,"Campbell Soup Company, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Mar 10, 2021",2021-03-10,"Earnings Calls","The Campbell's Company","Executives","Yes. So a couple of thoughts. First, again, I think as we said in our comments, a bit frustrating, of course, to see the top line when the underlying fundamentals are as strong as they are. In-market consumption was up 8%. And a really important step fo",601,"Yes. So a couple of thoughts. 
First, again, I think as we said in our comments, a bit frustrating, of course, to see the top line when the underlying fundamentals are as strong as they are. In-market consumption was up 8%. And a really important step forward for us was the shift in share performance, where we had 75% of the portfolio growing share, including some businesses that are really important for us to get back on our front foot, like ready-to-serve soup, for example, and Snyder's of Hanover pretzels. Both of which had been a bit challenged on share, and we wanted to make sure we turned them around. 
I guess the other good news about the timing and sequence of some of the pressure we experienced, we had all of the inventory in place for the holiday and kind of the key drive period, which is why we did so well during that time frame in-market. 
Where it hurt us was a bit in the replenishment of that as we were exiting the quarter. And as you said, driven really by 2 things. The significant step back up in COVID cases was the root cause, but it impacted both our food service business, as well as absenteeism specifically in our plants. We were in the month of December, we crossed the double-digit line on absenteeism, which was really the highest we had seen, which really did reduce a little bit of our firepower as we had expected to be able to get in front of consumption and ship a bit ahead of it. 
The good news is, both of them I would describe generally as episodic in nature, and that as we finish the quarter and went into Q3, both of those we're seeing normalize and improve. And remember, in Q3, one of the things that we're going to have as a dynamic is that we shipped about 12 points behind consumption a year ago in Q3. And so as you think about that overall shipment to consumption comparison, despite the fact that -- in the spirit of a lot of volatility in our world today, despite the fact we're going to have to navigate a little bit of this pressure out of Paris, Texas, where our plant was closed for a couple of weeks, that plant makes primarily pace and Prego, just as a reference point. But we expect the overall elements to be positive as it relates to shipments versus consumption, but with a little bit of choppiness as we go into Q3. As we roll through the back half, we're feeling very comfortable that we'll be back in a strong position. 
I think also of note, we've talked a bit about the recovery of the SKUs that we had swapped out for base business during the pandemic. All of those are back up and running. That we're going to return is -- if you look at our numbers today, you'll see about a 6% decline in TDPs. We expect that to be about 3% ongoing. The reason you're not seeing all of it is some of those items are still in pipeline. But as the quarter unfolds, we expect that all to be back in place as we manage through the back of the year. 
So a little bit of a longer answer, but I know a very important element to get your hands around. So I think there's reasons to believe that we'll see that room to catch up a little bit and kind of get back on our feet as it relates to inventory."

And -- but I would love for -- you ought to be right, all my CEOs, it will be much more fun to cover a space where things are growing and sales are good in the opposite. 
But is there any -- I guess what I'm getting with this, is there any particular data point that you have that gives you the amount of confidence that you might need to make the kind of confident statements that you're making today about stickiness? And I'm not trying to suspect. I really just want to understand it, Mark."

And certainly, this is not a unique conversation, and it happens pretty frequently these days in our industry. 
I will say we did a few things. And we have targeted our research in a few ways to try to inform certain thinking that's just simply different than how many people are going to continue to cook or how many people are claiming that they'll continue to use our products. 
I'd kind of give you 2 areas. One, we've gotten a lot sharper on how we feel using the survey work to really understand how we hold up against competitive choices. Because one of the things that I think will matter a lot here very quickly as we start to lap the initial surge and get into COVID is how do we feel about our comparative position, and therefore, our ability to manage through share positive performance or differentiated performance. And that was an important part of the work that we've been doing and trying to identify where we think we're in stronger positions. 
And I was pleased. I was really pleased with some of the items that are in more competitive spaces. And setting aside for a moment, whether you're going to continue to use us, did you feel we perform better than some of our competitors, I think is an important insight and a little different than just, are the households going to remain sticky? 
I think the other thing that we're doing a lot of is looking for places where we could be exposed where there may be dissatisfiers. So instead of just simply focusing our work on trying to build the case or prove the point that people are going to keep using it, we actually kind of spun it around the other way and really looked at why you wouldn't keep using it, what were the barriers, what were the things that we could be doing differently in our brands. And we're using that very rapidly as we try to inform things like innovation as well as our marketing to try to really kind of go at those areas a little bit more head on. 
So -- and again, as I've said a couple of times, I recognize that until we have facts and kind of points on the board, this remains theoretical. But it is hard to imagine that no matter where you are on that continuum, a business like our Meals and Beverage and our Soup business isn't going to be even in a modest interpretation in a better position than it would have been coming into this. And I think that is something that, obviously, quantifying it will be important. But I do feel very comfortable in suggesting that just through the trial and experience and the work we've done, and remember, we don't have the benefit of seeing how all that work would have done pre-pandemic, but I was fairly confident that a lot of the things that we had put in place before were going to help improve this business as well."

I mean, remember, we've got 50% of our business that is a Snacks business that has been growing pretty steadily before and through. And we really expect it to continue to grow afterwards. Not all of our peers have that particular composition. And further to that, again, I know I'm kind of baiting the hook here for conversation on margin around Snacks. But there is, I think, a continued opportunity for value creation. And with the work that we've done on our balance sheet, our ability to invest thoughtfully and in a disciplined way to create value, I think, gives you some reasons to think about the business differently, that doesn't require anything as it relates to stickiness of households. 
And so I want to -- I know a lot of discussions around household retention, but we've got a couple of really big things in the business that are far less related to that."

But maybe, Mark, if you could maybe tie that into also capital allocation, right? Because you've talked about that. And arguably, that's going to be the more important driver once we get past whatever the pandemic is. 
So I guess 2 related questions. One, does an acquisition that creates more scale in Snacks, is that a pass to higher margins? And then the second, just as it relates to capital allocation and I think what you're implying in terms of M&A, maybe could you think about how Campbell's -- and M&A strategy at Campbell's might line up relative to some of the companies you've been at before, right? Pinnacle was pretty good at it. Obviously, Mondelez was a creation of a lot of M&A. So just trying to get a sense of how you're thinking about that capital allocation."

So let me start a little bit with the Snacks question. And again, I really do expect us in the next few months, again, not to put a particular date, but I do imagine as we go into the fall, we're going to be in a good position to have a more ro",635,"Yes. Okay. So let me start a little bit with the Snacks question. And again, I really do expect us in the next few months, again, not to put a particular date, but I do imagine as we go into the fall, we're going to be in a good position to have a more robust dialogue with you about kind of this next chapter of the company's strategy, which will include, in my mind, a lot more granularity around some of the things that we're talking about now. 
But I will say this, on the margins on Snacks, if you look at kind of where we are in our journey right now, we're about 80% of the way through value capture. We're now up and running on SAP, which is a really important step, as many of you know, in these integrations and transitions. And so it's allowing us to continue to build our insights as we look forward. 
And where that value capture has put us, if you think about the beginning of the journey to where we are now, the gap between our margin and kind of the snacking averages, we've closed about 1/3 of that gap. So there's still about 2/3 of that remaining. 
And if you look at the reasons why, and you kind of start from manufacturing, all the way to the store, you see a fair amount of inefficiencies even after we complete the value capture, that gives us a lot of confidence that we're going to find opportunities. For example, we've got 1,300 locations holding inventory right now in our supply chain. And yes. No matter how you cut the pie, that is not our most efficient foot forward. 
And so our ability to go after each of those elements with kind of a next wave of plans gives me a lot of confidence that we can reduce that gap further. And again, quantifying that and giving you a little more clarity on the building blocks, we will do that, but not today. So we're working on it and more to come. But I think there's a lot of reasons to believe. 
And if you pair that with what the growth rate of this company is and what we continue to see as improved opportunities, as we move from integration orientation really to growth and focus on innovation, we feel very good about it. 
And so if you think about some of that work, there may be some investment opportunities that are there. So as we think about capital priorities, kind of pivoting now to your second question. First of all, our capital priorities as a company remain the same. We invest in the company. We pay our dividend. We continue. At this point, we've really done a good job of managing down debt. So we're quite happy with that progress. 
And then we're looking in a very disciplined way. I mean you mentioned some prior historical places that I've been that I think have had very good decision matrix, very good discipline. Our focus continues to be things that we believe are highly aligned or nearing adjacencies to our core strengths. And I think there is a role that M&A can play. But it's in conjunction with also evaluating where we can invest in the company and generate high returns. 
I think the important thing to note is that we will apply that discipline, but we're going to be applying it to an availability of capital that, as you say, I think, is going to be a very, very important indicator of value. And especially as you think competitively across places to go, I'm feeling very good about our flexibility and capability to generate a significant amount of value in that space. 
Does that make sense, Bryan?"

I hear you loud and clear, Mark, if we benchmark against some of the bell others in the space, like a Frito or a Mondelez, but that just seems like an unfair comparison. 
If I look at, say, your 18% to 19% EBITDA margins in Snacks, they look great, especially when I contemplate you're somewhat subscale relative to the big leaders, your profit sharing arrangement with independent distributors. Your portfolio is exceptionally complex. And you've got a decent chunk of of lap sales that are derived on a pretty low price point, suggesting that it's not really a cost per ounce issue. It's a price browns per ounce for much of that. 
So how is attacking costs like? Where are the opportunities? Because when I look from the outside looking in, I don't really see the opportunity. I see a business that's sort of already been rightsized in terms of margin and one that's probably where it should be. What am I missing? Can you put more teeth on this one, please?"

I mean, I think it's really, Jason, is if you look at the redundancy and the inefficiencies that exist in a network that was built independently and really not through the lens of efficiency.

I mean, I think it's really, Jason, is if you look at the redundancy and the inefficiencies that exist in a network that was built independently and really not through the lens of efficiency. I think the -- as you described, the complexity of our portfolio, there is no question that what is a little unique about us is the opportunity, I'd say, both the scale and strength of operating within 2 aisles of the store. But our portfolio is really not as complex as you may think. The partner brands is something we've been working hard on over the last 2 years. And we've got a little bit of work still ahead of us to make sure that we've got the right partnership model that enables us to eliminate a lot of that complexity while still generating the benefits. So still more work to do there. 
But I think if you really kind of go from our manufacturing footprint, to our distribution and warehousing footprint, all the way to our route to market, you're going to see opportunities across all 3 of those buckets where we're going to be able to drive greater levels of efficiency than what's there today. 
And again, the good news here is, it doesn't necessarily require us to get to a free to layer to the highest end of the Snacks margins. But even as we move into closing that gap, there's significant value to be created. And as you think about kind of our historical growth rate of 3%, with a headwind of about 1%, as we've navigated kind of the managing down of the partner brands, I think you could expect that growth rate to at least continue, if not improve, as we go forward. 
And so you put those pieces together, and I think the contribution of what represents 50% of our company becomes a significant benefit and a tailwind for us that I think can continue to contribute going forward. 
Now in fairness, Jason, I think you like others are going to want to see a little bit more of that blueprint, and I get that. And that's what we're working on now and certainly would anticipate sharing more granularity with you as we go forward. I kind of raised it now though because I think a lot of the conversation, rightfully so, is about what's coming next, where our company is focused in the future coming out of the pandemic. And I point to this, it's just an area that's not related, kind of to Ken's question earlier, on stickiness of households. This is really about our ability to execute into and to identify those areas within our own existing business model."

So I was curious. As you entered this year, in retrospect, is there more that the company could have done to either hire more or take on more co-packing capacity to meet this surge in demand? And did you choose not to? Did you say, we're going to choose not to do that? Maybe it's not the sustainable thing to do. 
And then the second part of this is, as you get more data on the stickiness, what happens next? Do you then have to take those steps? Do you have to expand soup? Do you have to expand sauce's capacity? There's a lot talking -- a lot of talk here about Snacks.

No. It's a very fair question and one that I can tell you, we've spent a fair amount of time asking ourselves. 
I think let me start with the labor standpoint. I really don't think there's any more we could have done on hiring. I mean we have hired 20%, an additional 20% of our entire workforce over the course of the pandemic. And we did that because we understood that we needed some flexibility as it related to our protocols around quarantining as well as the expanded demand that we were seeing. So when I think about, did we let up there at all or should we have pushed harder? There really was not anything more that I can see that we could have done on the hiring side. They simply ran into -- and if you think about where some of our facilities are, there just was a limit to how many -- how much availability we ultimately had to incrementally hire, but it was certainly not for lack of effort. I can tell you there are career fairs around the country. And I'm happy that we were able to hire 2,000 people. I think that was a -- it came at a good moment. But certainly, would it have been nice to continue to have a little bit of more flexibility? Certainly. In the month of December and January where we saw this renewed surge, it would have been helpful at that moment. But I think the teams have done a very good job at trying to maximize what that potential is. 
On the capacity side, so what have we been doing or what have we done? I think it's a little different by brand. If you really look under the hood and you say, okay, where is the real pressure on capacity? I mean notwithstanding a bump or 2 or a winter storm like we may be dealing within -- in Paris, Texas right now. The biggest concern that we've had is on broth. And there, we have already made the commitment to invest in capacity. We are in the process of putting that in place. It is -- I will say it's been a little tougher and a little slower through the pandemic installing new capital as it might have been in a normal period. But there's no question about the commitment and what that will mean for us when we have that up and running as well as creating a very healthy network of co-manufacturing that helps us ebb and flow. 
And Rob, you talked a little bit about the future. Remember, part of the dynamic on the Meals and Beverage businesses are these peaks and valleys as it relates to seasonality. And part of what we're doing is creating a network that allows us to create more flexibility and flex a bit more to the upside. Let's say, we're on the high end of our assumptions, that we can flex there. Let's say, we're on the lower end. We can flex to there and still be responsible as it relates to capital, while still enabling us to meet all of the ongoing dynamics of building inventory into soup season and matching kind of that footprint. So I do feel very good about the investments we've made and what we've done to add some flexibility to our business to be able to handle a variety of different situations. Part of the pressure has been to get back into some of these SKUs, that were B and C SKUs that honestly have been very, very important and key to us regaining share that we've had to put back in place. But we're now in a pretty good position on those and are really coming back fully. 
And so I feel good about the future, but that's kind of the dynamics that we've gone through as we've thought through that."

We have now passed the 1-year mark of working within this challenging COVID-19 environment, and I'm very proud of their continued performance and dedication.
Campbell delivered strong second quarter results, with growth in all 3 key financial metrics. Organic net sales increased 5% with continued demand across both divisions, fueled by accelerating in-market results, including positive share progress across most of the portfolio and a strong holiday period. Net sales were tempered by continued foodservice weakness following a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in December, which led to greater away-from-home restrictions as well as some supply constraints given these cases led to increased absenteeism rate in our plants during the month. 
The foodservice weakness and supply constraints each created about 1 point of headwind in the quarter versus our expectations. The labor situation has since improved significantly, and we continue to make steady progress on supply going into the second half of the year. 
We reacted quickly to these headwinds, appropriately shifting spending to reflect this pressure. But where supply was available, we executed our planned increased investment in advertising and consumer promotion on our core brands. Taking everything into account, we had 8% adjusted EBIT growth and 17% adjusted EPS growth, leading to a very good quarter.
By segment, Meals & Beverages posted 6% net sales growth, punctuated by a very successful soup season and the continued strong performance of brands like V8 and Prego. This was partially mitigated by declines in foodservice. The Snacks business delivered another solid quarter, with sales growth of 4%, largely driven by our power brands in salty snacks, including Kettle Brand potato chips, Late July snacks and Cape Cod potato chips, as well as Pepperidge Farm Farmhouse bakery products.
Most notably, we achieved the primary objective we outlined in our Q1 earnings call, to return to share growth. Nearly 75% of our portfolio held or increased share in the second quarter versus the prior year. This included meaningful share improvement in key focus areas like ready-to-serve soup, Prego and Snyder's of Hanover pretzels, with continued momentum on condensed soup, V8, our salty snacks portfolio and Goldfish. There were a few exceptions such as Swanson broth, where we knew we'd be challenged on supply. We feel very good about how we are addressing the challenges on broth by expanding overall capacity and growing Pacific Foods, which was the fastest growing broth brand in measured channels in the second quarter.
E-commerce continued to be an important growth channel for us, with in-market dollar consumption increasing 89% over the prior year. With the click-and-collect fulfillment model representing slightly more than 1/3 of our e-commerce retail sales, we are sharply focused on partnering with our customers to deliver value to our consumers, including bundling products for easy meal prep and inspiring creative snacking options.
Turning to Slide 7. Within the Meals & Beverages division, we had another strong quarter, with consumption growth of 9%, principally due to volume gains. We delivered on our objective of share growth and saw positive in-market consumption growth in almost all categories, led by condensed soups, Prego, V8 beverages, ready-to-serve soup and Pacific Foods soups and broth. 
We continued to execute our plans and feel great about our progress against our Win in Soup strategy, led by a great start to soup season and a strong holiday period. In fact, U.S. soup sales grew 10%, with strength across all categories. This was fueled by more than 1/3 of the end market consumption growth coming from new buyers. The number of retained soup buyers in this quarter is the highest since the pandemic started almost a year ago. 
Our condensed soups were once again the highlight of the quarter, with double-digit net sales growth and continued share gains, especially among millennials. With a 0.7 share increase, condensed had its eighth consecutive quarter of share gains, an amazing run that started well before the pandemic. This performance was driven by our quality improvements, strong advertising and the retention of the new households. Additionally, during the important holiday season, the number of buyers of condensed cooking soups grew double digits, and we continued to grow household penetration this quarter versus prior year. Year-to-date, our condensed soups have the highest household retention rate within the entire Meals & Beverage division.
Within ready-to-serve, share improved this quarter, driven by strong base velocity growth in Chunky and improved availability. Chunky had an exceptional quarter, with double-digit net sales gains and in-market consumption growth, outpacing competition and increasing share nearly 2 points with growth among all cohorts, including millennials.
Pacific Foods is now the fastest-growing wet soup brand on a dollar share basis, outperforming its competitors on many fronts by delivering on-trend innovation and impactful advertising. This important growth engine continues to perform above our expectations. In the second quarter, Pacific soup and broth outperformed the category, posting dollar consumption growth of 25%, the fifth consecutive quarter of share gains driven by brand strength and a meaningful increase in household penetration. We are thrilled with the performance of Pacific Foods and are equally excited about our robust innovation pipeline that includes new canned offerings as well as additional plant-based products.
As I mentioned earlier, Swanson broth struggled on share as we expected. We continue to recover on supply throughout the quarter, and we are making steady progress through a combination of expanding internal capacity and bringing on additional co-manufacturing. In the most recent period, we are seeing both share and supply levels improve, a trend we expect to continue through the balance of the year.
Beyond soup, a standout in the Meals & Beverages portfolio was Prego, which maintained its #1 share position in the Italian sauce category for the 21st consecutive month and has widened the gap against competitors. Prego sales growth came primarily from the gain of an additional 4 million new households across all demographic cohorts.
Our V8 beverages also performed very well this quarter, delivering its fourth straight quarter of both share and household gains. Notably in Q2, these gains were across all sub-brands of the business. And we saw new households coming into the V8 portfolio, driven by both V8 original and V8 + Energy. Overall, Meals & Beverages delivered a strong quarter, as it continued to drive relevance with its brands to a younger consumer base and delivered share gains in many of its key categories.
Let's turn to the Snacks segment, which represents about half of our total annual revenue. Our performance was again fueled by our power brands, which grew dollar consumption by 8% over the previous year. Within the power brands, our salty snacks brands grew dollar consumption by double digits and realized share growth. This was in part due to the implementation of our capacity expansion projects as well as increased A&C investments to support our media campaigns and innovation, including Snyder's of Hanover Pretzel Rounds and Twisted sticks. On the Snyder's of Hanover brand, the combination of successful innovation, fundamental execution and brand activation led to share growth, double-digit dollar consumption and nearly 5 million new households, turning around what had been a challenging share period.
Our Pepperidge Farm Farmhouse products also delivered exceptional results across bakery and cookies, growing dollar consumption by 41% and household penetration by 1.5 points. On Goldfish, we improved our performance according to the plan we outlined last quarter, returning to growth in net sales and improved dollar consumption. We adapted marketing content during the holidays, with digital partnerships focused on new ways for the consumer to enjoy Goldfish, such as movie night snack mixes or classic lunch combinations with Campbell's tomato soup, all leading to positive engagement metrics and increased purchase intent. Additionally, we are launching new flavors within Flavor Blasted Goldfish, which continued to grow consumption by double digits.
As you'll see on Slide 9, this is only the beginning of what is arguably our strongest slate of innovation yet, which includes Twisted Pretzel sticks and better-for-you options, like Late July veggie tortilla chips. We are very excited about the breadth of our snacks pipeline in the second half of the fiscal year, which will complement what we have on deck later this year for Meals & Beverages. Overall, we feel very good about our Snacks performance and the steady growth it delivered as we provide consumers with elevated snacking experiences through our unique and differentiated portfolio of power brands. 
We also made significant steps on value capture, including the recent transition to SAP to streamline and improve capabilities. Looking ahead, we believe we have additional runway to improve Snacks profitability with further network optimization opportunities. And we remain confident in our long-term strategy and our ability to deliver additional cost savings. With the strong results in the second quarter and our overall first half performance, we are confident in the outlook for the full year.
With that, let me turn it over to Mick to discuss our second quarter and first half financial results."

Turning to Slide 11. As Mark just shared, we once again delivered strong results with another quarter of sales growth, driven by continued elevated consumer demand as well as growth in adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS.",1799,"Thanks, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 11. As Mark just shared, we once again delivered strong results with another quarter of sales growth, driven by continued elevated consumer demand as well as growth in adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS. Our top line growth of 5% reflected healthy in-market consumption of approximately 8% in the quarter, tempered by declines in foodservice and some COVID-19-related supply challenges that Mark discussed. 
Adjusted EBIT increased 8%, as higher sales volumes were only partially offset by higher adjusted administrative expenses. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations increased by 17% to $0.84 per share, reflecting an increase in adjusted EBIT as well as lower adjusted net interest expense. 
Year-to-date, our organic net sales, which excludes the impact from the sale of the European chips business, increased 7%, driven by strong in-market consumption growth in both Meals & Beverages and Snacks. Adjusted EBIT increased 13%, reflecting higher sales volume, improved adjusted gross margin performance and higher adjusted other income, offset partially by increased adjusted administrative expenses. 
Year-to-date, our adjusted EBIT margin increased year-over-year by 110 basis points to 18.5%. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations increased 23% to $1.86 per share, reflecting the increase in adjusted EBIT and lower adjusted net interest expense. I'll review in the next couple of slides our second quarter results in more detail and provide guidance for the full fiscal year 2021.
Breaking down our net sales performance for the quarter. Reported and organic net sales increased 5% from the prior year. This performance was largely driven by a 4 point gain in volume across the majority of our retail brands, partially offset by declines in foodservice and in partner brands within the Snyder's-Lance portfolio. Additionally, we took a strategic approach to dialing back promotional spending in both segments where we faced supply constraints. And those actions, net of price and sales allowances, contributed 1 point to net sales growth. 
Our adjusted gross margin decreased by 10 basis points in the quarter to 34.3%. While product mix was slightly negative in the quarter, we're estimating a 50 basis point gross margin improvement from better operating leverage within our supply chain network as we increased our overall production. Net pricing drove a 90 basis point improvement due to lower levels of promotional spending in the quarter. 
Inflation and other factors had a negative impact of 330 basis points. A little over half of the increase was driven by cost inflation as overall input prices on a rate basis increased approximately 3%, which we expect to continue to be a headwind for the rest of the fiscal year. The remainder was driven by increases in other operational costs and continued COVID-19-related costs.
Inflation in the quarter was partially offset by our ongoing supply chain productivity program, which contributed 140 basis point improvement and included initiatives, among others, within procurement and logistics optimization. Our cost savings program, which is incremental to our ongoing supply chain productivity program, added 50 basis points to our gross margin.
Moving on to other operating items. Adjusted marketing and selling expenses decreased $3 million or 1% in the quarter. This decrease was driven primarily by the benefits of cost savings initiatives and lower marketing overhead costs, largely offset by an 8% increased investment in A&C. These investments primarily reflect higher levels of media spend to support our salty snacks brands, including new product launches as well as our soup business, as we continue to drive usage through new recipes, inspire meal solutions and support our innovation.
Adjusted administrative expenses increased $17 million or 13%, driven primarily by higher benefits-related costs and higher general administrative costs, partially offset by the benefits from our cost savings initiatives. Overall, our adjusted marketing and selling expenses represented 10.2% of net sales during the quarter, a 70 basis point decrease compared to last year. Adjusted administrative expenses represented 6.7% of net sales during the quarter, a 50 basis point increase compared to last year.
Moving to the next slide. We have continued to successfully deliver against our multiyear enterprise cost savings initiatives. This quarter, we achieved just over $20 million in incremental year-over-year savings. We expect an additional $40 million to $50 million evenly spread over the balance of fiscal 2021, on track to deliver $75 million to $85 million of cost savings for the fiscal year, with the majority of the savings from the Snyder's-Lance integration. We remain on track to deliver our cumulative savings target of $850 million by the end of fiscal 2022.
To help tie this all together, we are providing an adjusted EBIT bridge on Slide 16 to highlight the key drivers of performance this quarter. As discussed, adjusted EBIT grew by 8%. This was driven by the increase in demand for our products, with sales gains contributing $40 million of EBIT growth, which was partially offset by the previously described adjusted gross margin decline. In addition, the increase in adjusted administrative expenses was only partially offset by lower adjusted marketing and selling expenses, lower adjusted R&D expenses and higher adjusted other income. Our adjusted EBIT margin increased year-over-year by 40 basis points to 17.2%. 
The following chart breaks down our adjusted EPS growth between our operating performance and below-the-line items. Adjusted EPS increased $0.12 from $0.72 in the prior year quarter to $0.84 per share. Adjusted EBIT had a positive $0.07 impact on adjusted EPS. Adjusted net interest expense declined year-over-year by $17 million, delivering a $0.04 positive impact to adjusted EPS as we have used proceeds from completed divestitures in fiscal 2020 and our strong cash flow to reduce debt. The impact from the adjusted tax rate was nominal, completing the bridge to $0.84 per share.
In Meals & Beverages, net sales increased 6% to $1.3 billion, primarily reflecting strong volume growth, driven by in-market consumption for many of our U.S. retail products, including gains in U.S. soups, V8 beverages, Prego pasta sauces and Campbell's pasta, partially offset by declines in foodservice driven by COVID-19-related restrictions. Net sales of U.S. soup, including Pacific Foods, increased 10% compared to the prior year, primarily due to volume gains in condensed soups and ready-to-serve soups. Across the division, we moderated promotional activity, in part due to supply constraints, particularly on broth. 
Operating earnings for Meals & Beverages increased 7% to $258 million. The increase was primarily driven by sales volume growth, offset partially by a lower gross margin and higher administrative expenses.
Within Snacks, net sales increased 4%, driven by volume gains, fueled by the majority of our power brands and lower levels of promotional spending on supply-constrained brands. The sales gains were driven by our salty snacks brands within the power brand portfolio, namely Kettle Brand potato chips, Late July snacks, Cape Cod potato chips and Pop Secret popcorn as well as our fresh bakery products, including Pepperidge Farm Farmhouse products. Partially offsetting sales gains were declines in partner brands within the Snyder's-Lance portfolio as well as declines in Lance sandwich crackers resulting from supply constraints in the quarter. Operating earnings for Snacks increased 6%, driven by sales volume gains and lower selling expenses, partially offset by higher marketing investment, administrative expenses and a lower gross margin.
I'll now turn to our cash flow and liquidity. Fiscal year-to-date cash flow from operations decreased from $663 million in the prior year to $611 million as changes in working capital were only partially offset by higher cash earnings. Although we continue to make progress on working capital, we are lapping significant benefits and accounts payable in the prior year. 
Our year-to-date cash for investing activities was largely reflective of the cash outlay for capital expenditures of $132 million, which was $35 million lower than the prior year, primarily driven by discontinued operations. Our year-to-date cash outflows for financing activities were $405 million, reflecting cash outlays due to dividends paid of $215 million, which were comparable to the prior year, reflecting our quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share. In December, we announced an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.37 per share or an increase of 6%, which, from a cash flow perspective, will be reflected in the third quarter. Additionally, we reduced our debt by $176 million. 
We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $946 million. We expect to utilize the majority of this cash during the second half of the fiscal year for repayment of upcoming debt maturities of $721 million and $200 million in March and May, respectively.
As covered in our press release, based on our strong first half performance, we are providing guidance for the full year fiscal 2021. We expect net sales for fiscal 2021 to decline 3.5% to 2.5%, Excluding the impacts from the 53rd week in fiscal 2020 and the impact of the European chips divestiture, we expect organic net sales to decline 1.5% to 0.5%. We expect adjusted EBIT of minus 1% to plus 1%, as we will lap the initial COVID-19 demand surge in the second half of our fiscal year, combined with headwinds from increased promotional activity, partially offset by lower year-over-year COVID-19-related expenses and last year's onetime marketing investments. 
We continue to expect net interest expense of $215 million to $220 million and an adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 24%. As a result, we expect adjusted EPS of $3.03 to $3.11 per share, representing year-over-year growth of 3% to 5%. The EPS impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2020 was estimated to be $0.04 per share.
With respect to our guidance, let me add that we expect the third quarter to be somewhat more challenged from a net sales and EBIT perspective than Q4, as the before mentioned COVID-19-related demand surge was more pronounced in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 while the benefit from COVID-19-related costs and onetime marketing investments will disproportionately benefit our fourth quarter comparison. 
Additionally, we expect our third quarter to be impacted by some isolated supply challenges as we navigate the recent winter storms. In particular, we experienced about 2 weeks of disruption at our Paris, Texas plant, which produces Pace and Prego. We expect improving momentum as we go forward. Regarding capital expenditures, in light of the current operating environment, with limited access to our factories, we now expect to spend 10% below the $350 million we had previously indicated for the full year, largely driven by the impacts from COVID-19 on the operating environment.
Before I turn it back to Mark for some additional commentary, let me close by expressing how proud I am of the continued strong execution by our teams throughout the company. We delivered another strong quarter, with a return to positive share growth in the majority of our portfolio and growth in all 3 key financial metrics despite all the challenges of COVID-19.

Before we conclude, I want to share my perspective on the key factors underpinning our confidence in our outlook beyond the pandemic.By now, I know you have heard a great deal about the stickiness of all new households gained throughout th",817,"Thanks, Mick. Before we conclude, I want to share my perspective on the key factors underpinning our confidence in our outlook beyond the pandemic.
By now, I know you have heard a great deal about the stickiness of all new households gained throughout the pandemic from essentially all of our peers, with a wide range of data, in fact, supporting that thesis. We very much agree, and we see similar trends in our own research and data.
I'd like to conclude today with 3 critical and differentiating points, key factors that serve to underscore Campbell's advantaged position going forward and will fuel our future growth trajectory. Importantly, 2 of them have very little to do with COVID-19 or the stickiness of new households. 
The first is our Snacks business, which, as I mentioned earlier, consists of a unique and differentiated portfolio of brands that represent approximately 50% of the company's annual revenues. This business was growing before the pandemic, and we expect to sustain or exceed those historical growth rates going forward. Snacks also includes a margin structure which we believe still has significant opportunity for improvement versus the snacking peer group average, even after we deliver our current value capture. We are finalizing our plans to unlock more value, and we look forward to sharing more details with you as we move forward.
Second, no matter where you stand on the retention of new households gained during the pandemic, it is undisputable that Campbell's business, particularly our Meals & Beverages division and especially soup, is coming out of this period more advantaged and with renewed relevance. Nearly 13 million new households purchased Campbell soup since the initial peak of the pandemic, of which almost 1/3 are millennials, outpacing both key competitors and the category average. 
We have also seen macro behaviors, like quick scratch cooking, take root. And our research indicates more than 30% of consumers are cooking more with soups since the start of the pandemic. Additionally, we believe increased at-home launches will endure as many people are expected to work from home more often post pandemic. Beyond the role that our Meals & Beverages offerings play in the lunch occasion, snack foods accompany nearly 30% of all lunches, which bodes well for our entire portfolio.
We've conducted extensive consumer research in an effort to determine sentiment, model consumer behavior exiting the pandemic and sharpen our plans to ensure the sustainability of our recent gains. The consumers who we've surveyed had an overall high level of satisfaction with Campbell's products in our Meals & Beverages and Snacks portfolio. In fact, about 4 out of 5 new users surveyed said they were very or extremely satisfied with our brands. 
As a result of this high satisfaction, those surveyed told us they'll continue to count on our brands going forward, turning to us for things like cooking solutions and quick lunches and meals. This gives us every reason to believe consumers will continue to purchase our brands well after the pandemic. 
Even more importantly, 70% of the consumer surveyed told us our brands better met their needs than competitive products. These same consumers also told us the taste and convenience of our brands were the top drivers of overall satisfaction. We feel this sets us up well for continued share progress going forward. 
The research also has provided us with actionable insights in our opportunities to strengthen the retention of our consumers. These include areas such as: adding more convenient packaging options and sizes across our portfolio, developing new and inspiring recipes, and satisfying consumers' need for permissible and more intense snacks by providing a variety of flavors and healthier ingredients. This specificity will focus our plans and innovation to target the areas with the highest probabilities of retaining these new consumers, particularly younger consumers for our brands. 
For the third and final differentiating point that underscores our strong position going forward, we look to the strength of our balance sheet. Given the cash-generative nature of our business and our reduced leverage, which is now below 3x, we are well positioned to generate significant cash flow, well above our ongoing commitment to base capital investments and dividends in the next 3 years. This can and will be a source of opportunity that can be invested in high ROI initiatives or other actions to drive value creation. 
So to wrap it up, our mission is clear: number one, sustain or accelerate our historical snacks growth while improving margins; number two, solidify our Meals & Beverages business as a steady and stable contributor behind recent transformational consumer trends and trial; and number three, deploy what will be significant capital to fuel this growth and create differentiated value. We look forward to sharing more in the months ahead about this next chapter as Campbell moves from turnaround to sustainable growth.
And with that, operator, let's open it up for questions."

You went through some of the factors that limited organic growth maybe relative to your ingoing assumptions. One would assume, obviously, foodservice recovers a bit, of course, as restrictions are lifted and such. 
But I'm trying to get a better handle on where the company is around supply and capacity. Is that largely behind the company at this point? Or does some of that still linger? And the reason I ask you is I'm trying to get a better handle on the relationship between sort of consumption and shipments as we go through the fiscal third quarter. 
Do those -- are those more consistent with each other? Is there the opportunity to rebuild inventory such that shipments maybe exceed consumption for a period of time? I'm trying to get a handle on that, and then I've just got a quick follow-up."
258458,705513187,2233987,"Campbell Soup Company, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Mar 10, 2021",2021-03-10,"Earnings Calls","The Campbell's Company","Executives","Yes. So a couple of thoughts. First, again, I think as we said in our comments, a bit frustrating, of course, to see the top line when the underlying fundamentals are as strong as they are. In-market consumption was up 8%. And a really important step forw",599,"Yes. So a couple of thoughts. First, again, I think as we said in our comments, a bit frustrating, of course, to see the top line when the underlying fundamentals are as strong as they are. In-market consumption was up 8%. And a really important step forward for us was the shift in share performance, where we had 75% of the portfolio growing share, including some businesses that were really important for us to get back on our front foot, like ready-to-serve soup, for example, and Snyder's of Hanover pretzels. Both of which had been a bit challenged on share, and we wanted to make sure we turned them around.
I guess the other good news about the timing and sequence of some of the pressure we experienced, we had all of the inventory in place for the holiday and kind of the key drive period, which is why we did so well during that time frame in-market. Where it hurt us was a bit in the replenishment of that as we were exiting the quarter. And as you said, driven really by 2 things. The significant step back up in COVID cases was the root cause, but it impacted both our foodservice business as well as absenteeism specifically in our plants. We were -- in the month of December, we crossed the double-digit line on absenteeism, which was really the highest we had seen, which really did reduce a little bit of our firepower as we had expected to be able to get in front of consumption and ship a bit ahead of it.
The good news is, both of them I would describe generally as episodic in nature, and that as we finished the quarter and went into Q3, both of those we're seeing normalize and improve. And remember, in Q3, one of the things that we're going to have as a dynamic is that we shipped about 12 points behind consumption a year ago in Q3. 
And so as you think about that overall shipment-to-consumption comparison, despite the fact that -- in the spirit of a lot of volatility in our world today, despite the fact we're going to have to navigate a little bit of this pressure out of Paris, Texas, where our plant was closed for a couple of weeks, that plant makes primarily Pace and Prego, just as a reference point. But we expect the overall elements to be positive as it relates to shipments versus consumption, but with a little bit of choppiness as we go into Q3. As we roll through the back half, we're feeling very comfortable that we'll be back in a strong position. 
I think also of note, we've talked a bit about the recovery of the SKUs that we had swapped out for base business during the pandemic. All of those are back up and running that we're going to return is -- if you look at our numbers today, you'll see about a 6% decline in TDPs. We expect that to be about 3% ongoing. The reason you're not seeing all of it is some of those items are still in pipeline. But as the quarter unfolds, we expect that all to be back in place as we manage through the back of the year. 
So a little bit of a longer answer, but I know a very important element to get your hands around. So I think there's reasons to believe that we'll see that room to catch up a little bit and kind of get back on our feet as it relates to inventory."

I'd kind of give you 2 areas: One, we've gotten a lot sharper on how we feel using the survey work to really understand how we hold up against competitive choices. Because one of the things that I think will matter a lot here very quickly as we start to lap the initial surge and get into COVID is how do we feel about our comparative position and, therefore, our ability to manage through share-positive performance or differentiated performance. And that was an important part of the work that we've been doing and trying to identify where we think we're in stronger positions. 
And I was pleased. I was really pleased with some of the items that are in more competitive spaces. And setting aside for a moment whether you're going to continue to use us, did you feel we perform better than some of our competitors, I think is an important insight and a little different than just, are the households going to remain sticky? 
I think the other thing that we're doing a lot of is looking for places where we could be exposed where there may be dissatisfiers. So instead of just simply focusing our work on trying to build the case or prove the point that people are going to keep using it, we actually kind of spun it around the other way and really looked at why you wouldn't keep using it. What were the barriers? What were the things that we could be doing differently in our brands? And we're using that very rapidly as we try to inform things like innovation as well as our marketing to try to really kind of go at those areas a little bit more head on. 
So -- and again, as I've said a couple of times, I recognize that until we have facts and kind of points on the board, this remains theoretical. But it is hard to imagine that no matter where you are on that continuum, a business like our Meals & Beverage and our soup business isn't going to be -- even in a modest interpretation, in a better position than it would have been coming into this. And I think that is something that, obviously, quantifying it will be important. 
But I do feel very comfortable in suggesting that just through the trial and experience and the work we've done -- and remember, we don't have the benefit of seeing how all that work would have done pre-pandemic. But I was fairly confident that a lot of the things that we had put in place before were going to help improve this business as well."

I mean remember, we've got 50% of our business that is Snacks business that has been growing pretty steadily before and through. And we really expect it to continue to grow afterwards. Not all of our peers have that particular composition. 
And further to that, again, I know I'm kind of baiting the hook here for conversation on margin around Snacks. But there is, I think, a continued opportunity for value creation. And with the work that we've done on our balance sheet, our ability to invest thoughtfully and in a disciplined way to create value, I think gives you some reasons to think about the business differently that doesn't require anything as it relates to stickiness of households. And so I want to -- I know a lot of discussion is around household retention, but we've got a couple of really big things in the business that are far less related to that."

But maybe, Mark, if you could maybe tie that into also capital allocation, right? Because you've talked about that. And arguably, that's going to be the more important driver once we get past whatever the pandemic is. 
So I guess 2 related questions: One, does an acquisition that creates more scale in Snacks, is that a pass to higher margins? And then the second, just as it relates to capital allocation and I think what you're implying in terms of M&A, maybe could you think about how Campbell's -- and M&A strategy at Campbell's might line up relative to some of the companies you've been at before, right? Pinnacle was pretty good at it. Obviously, Mondelez was a creation of a lot of M&A. So just trying to get a sense of how you're thinking about that capital allocation."
258458,705513187,2233987,"Campbell Soup Company, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Mar 10, 2021",2021-03-10,"Earnings Calls","The Campbell's Company","Executives","Yes. Okay. So let me start a little bit with the Snacks question. And again, I really do expect us in the next few months, again, not to put a particular date, but I do imagine as we go into the fall, we're going to be in a good position to have a more ro",635,"Yes. Okay. So let me start a little bit with the Snacks question. And again, I really do expect us in the next few months, again, not to put a particular date, but I do imagine as we go into the fall, we're going to be in a good position to have a more robust dialogue with you about kind of this next chapter of the company's strategy, which will include, in my mind, a lot more granularity around some of the things that we're talking about now. 
But I will say this. On the margins on Snacks, if you look at kind of where we are in our journey right now, we're about 80% of the way through value capture. We're now up and running on SAP, which is a really important step, as many of you know, in these integrations and transitions. And so it's allowing us to continue to build our insights as we look forward. 
And where that value capture has put us, if you think about the beginning of the journey to where we are now, the gap between our margin and kind of the snacking averages, we've closed about 1/3 of that gap. So there's still about 2/3 of that remaining. 
And if you look at the reasons why, and you kind of start from manufacturing all the way to the store, you see a fair amount of inefficiencies even after we complete the value capture. That gives us a lot of confidence that we're going to find opportunities. For example, we've got 1,300 locations holding inventory right now in our supply chain. And yes, no matter how you cut the pie, that is not our most efficient foot forward. 
And so our ability to go after each of those elements with kind of a next wave of plans gives me a lot of confidence that we can reduce that gap further. And again, quantifying that and giving you a little more clarity on the building blocks, we will do that, but not today. So we're working on it and more to come. But I think there's a lot of reasons to believe. And if you pair that with what the growth rate of this company is and what we continue to see as improved opportunities, as we move from integration orientation really to growth and focus on innovation, we feel very good about it. 
And so if you think about some of that work, there may be some investment opportunities that are there. So as we think about capital priorities, kind of pivoting now to your second question, first of all, our capital priorities as a company remain the same. We invest in the company. We pay our dividend. We continue. At this point, we've really done a good job of managing down debt, so we're quite happy with that progress. 
And then we're looking in a very disciplined way. I mean you mentioned some prior historical places that I've been that I think have had very good decision matrix, very good discipline. Our focus continues to be things that we believe are highly aligned or nearing adjacencies to our core strengths. And I think there is a role that M&A can play. But it's in conjunction with also evaluating where we can invest in the company and generate high returns.
I think the important thing to note is that we will apply that discipline, but we're going to be applying it to an availability of capital that, as you say, I think, is going to be a very, very important indicator of value. And especially as you think competitively across places to go, I'm feeling very good about our flexibility and capability to generate a significant amount of value in that space. 
Does that make sense, Bryan?"

I hear you loud and clear, Mark, if we benchmark against some of the bellwhethers in the space, like a Frito or a Mondelez, but that just seems like an unfair comparison. 
If I look at, say, your 18% to 19% EBITDA margins in Snacks, they look great, especially when I contemplate you're somewhat subscale relative to the big leaders, your profit sharing arrangement with independent distributors. Your portfolio is exceptionally complex. And you've got a decent chunk of Lance sales that are derived on a pretty low price point, suggesting that it's not really a cost per ounce issue. It's a price per ounce for much of that. 
So how is attacking costs like -- where are the opportunities? Because when I look from the outside looking in, I don't really see the opportunity. I see a business that's sort of already been rightsized in terms of margin and one that's probably where it should be. What am I missing? Can you put more teeth on this one, please?"

I mean I think it's really, Jason, is if you look at the redundancy and the inefficiencies that exist in a network that was built independently and really not through the lens of efficiency. I think the -- as you described, the complexity of our portfolio, there is no question that what is a little unique about us is the opportunity, I'd say, both the scale and strength of operating within 2 aisles of the store. 
But our portfolio is really not as complex as you may think. The partner brands is something we've been working hard on over the last 2 years. And we've got a little bit of work still ahead of us to make sure that we've got the right partnership model that enables us to eliminate a lot of that complexity while still generating the benefits. So still more work to do there.
But I think if you really kind of go from our manufacturing footprint, to our distribution and warehousing footprint, all the way to our route to market, you're going to see opportunities across all 3 of those buckets where we're going to be able to drive greater levels of efficiency than what's there today.
And again, the good news here is, it doesn't necessarily require us to get to a Frito-Lay or to the highest end of the Snacks margins. But even as we move into closing that gap, there's significant value to be created. And as you think about kind of our historical growth rate of 3% with a headwind of about 1%, as we've navigated kind of the managing down of the partner brands, I think you could expect that growth rate to at least continue, if not improve, as we go forward. And so you put those pieces together, and I think the contribution of what represents 50% of our company becomes a significant benefit and a tailwind for us that I think can continue to contribute going forward. 
Now in fairness, Jason, I think you, like others, are going to want to see a little bit more of that blueprint, and I get that. And that's what we're working on now and certainly would anticipate sharing more granularity with you as we go forward. I kind of raise it now though because I think a lot of the conversation, rightfully so, is about what's coming next, where our company is focused in the future coming out of the pandemic. And I point to this as just an area that's not related, kind of to Ken's question earlier, on stickiness of households. This is really about our ability to execute and to identify those areas within our own existing business model."

You say a lot of it has to do with labor absenteeism but also just overall capacity. 
So I was curious. As you entered this year, in retrospect, is there more that the company could have done to either hire more or take on more co-packing capacity to meet this surge in demand? And did you choose not to? Did you say, we're going to choose not to do that? Maybe it's not the sustainable thing to do. 
And then the second part of this is, as you get more data on the stickiness, what happens next? Do you then have to take those steps? Do you have to expand soup? Do you have to expand sauces capacity? There's a lot been talking -- a lot of talk here about Snacks. But are the things that you're going to have to do in Meals & Beverage to cope with a higher demand plateau?"

I really don't think there's any more we could have done on hiring. I mean we have hired 2",653,"Yes. No. It's a very fair question and one that I can tell you we've spent a fair amount of time asking ourselves. 
I think let me start with the labor standpoint. I really don't think there's any more we could have done on hiring. I mean we have hired 20%, an additional 20% of our entire workforce over the course of the pandemic. And we did that because we understood that we needed some flexibility as it related to our protocols around quarantining as well as the expanded demand that we were seeing. So when I think about, did we let up there at all or should we have pushed harder, there really was not anything more that I can see that we could have done on the hiring side. There simply ran into -- and if you think about where some of our facilities are, there just was a limit to how many -- how much availability we ultimately had to incrementally hire. But it was certainly not for lack of effort. I can tell you the career fairs around the country, and I'm happy that we were able to hire 2,000 people. I think that was a -- it came at a good moment. 
But certainly, would it have been nice to continue to have a little bit of more flexibility? Certainly in the month of December and January where we saw this renewed surge, it would have been helpful at that moment. But I think the teams have done a very good job at trying to maximize what that potential is.
On the capacity side, so what have we been doing or what have we done? I think it's a little different by brand. If you really look under the hood and you say, okay, where is the real pressure on capacity? I mean notwithstanding a bump or 2 or a winter storm like we may be dealing with in Paris, Texas right now. The biggest concern that we've had is on broth. And there, we have already made the commitment to invest in capacity. We are in the process of putting that in place. It is -- I will say it's been a little tougher and a little slower through the pandemic installing new capital as it might have been in a normal period. But there's no question about the commitment and what that will mean for us when we have that up and running as well as creating a very healthy network of co-manufacturing that helps us ebb and flow.
And Rob, you talked a little bit about the future. Remember, part of the dynamic on the Meals & Beverage businesses are these peaks and valleys as it relates to seasonality. And part of what we're doing is creating a network that allows us to create more flexibility and flex a bit more to the upside. Let's say, we're on the high end of our assumptions, that we can flex there. Let's say, we're on the lower end. We can flex to there and still be responsible as it relates to capital, while still enabling us to meet all of the ongoing dynamics of building inventory into soup season and matching kind of that footprint. 
So I do feel very good about the investments we've made and what we've done to add some flexibility to our business to be able to handle a variety of different situations. Part of the pressure has been to get back into some of these SKUs, that were B and C SKUs that honestly have been very, very important and key to us regaining share that we've had to put back in place. But we're now in a pretty good position on those and are really coming back fully. And so I feel good about the future, but that's kind of the dynamics that we've gone through as we've thought through that."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Throughout the last year, we rallied through the pandemic and made decisions focused on prioritizing the safety and well-being of our employees while meeting the needs of our customers and consumers. This approach has served us well over the past 15 months as we progressed our strategy in a volatile operating environment. Our team pulled together, we executed with excellence, and we delivered strong results. 
As you saw in our press release this morning, our results this quarter reflected the challenging comparisons to the prior year as we cycled the demand surge that accompanied the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and navigated several current headwinds. However, you will also have seen the continued strength in market on market shares, underpinned by healthy retention of new and younger households and the full recovery of distribution levels. We did face a significant inflationary environment in the quarter as well as shorter-term increases in supply chain costs. 
We anticipated the vast majority of these drivers, but in certain areas, the pressures intensified, especially around inflation and some of the transitional costs moving out of the COVID-19 environment. We are confident that we can address these issues, and we have plans and pricing already in place as we exit the fiscal year and enter fiscal 2022. Our confidence is further strengthened by our continued in-market momentum and the structural health of our business and brands. 
I will first review our results and then share the context and actions we are taking to address these challenges and the improving trajectory we expect for the rest of the year as we head into fiscal 2022. As we outlined during our second quarter earnings call, we expected this would be a challenging quarter, and we recognized that there would be headwinds as we lap the peak of COVID-19 demand, manage the volatility of current market dynamics and continue to navigate our own transformation agenda. 
We delivered sales of $1.98 billion, in line with our expectations as we cycled a 17% organic growth comparison to a year ago. Our sales results benefited from the continued momentum of our Snacks power brands and our U.S. retail products in our Meals & Beverages division as well as the early signs of recovery from our Foodservice business. Importantly, our brands remain strong with nearly 3/4 of our portfolio gaining or holding share in the quarter. 
In our core categories, most of our brands grew at higher rates than prepandemic levels, and our brand consumption on a 2-year comparison grew 9%. These results were driven by our decision to invest in supply and service while preserving brand investments with advertising and consumer promotion expense as a percentage of net sales comparable to last year. 
Looking ahead, we expect organic sales in the fourth quarter to decline versus last year as the COVID-19 lap continues. We do expect a sequential improvement from the third quarter as the comparison to prior year eases a bit, and our Foodservice business continues to recover. From a margin perspective, our decline versus prior year, excluding the net benefit from mark-to-market adjustments on outstanding commodity hedges, stemmed from certain headwinds, which are grouped into 3 main buckets. 
First, external factors were larger than we had anticipated. We, like others, faced pronounced inflation related primarily to steeply higher transportation costs, some of which was an outcome from the strain of the Texas winter storms on supply chain logistics and the closure of our Pairs Texas facility for 2 weeks. These factors partially offset by our productivity improvements reflect about 1/3 of the gross margin erosion in the third quarter and will continue into fiscal 2022. We currently expect the benefit from pricing actions we have put in place across our portfolio and our strong productivity plans to mitigate this inflation pressure in fiscal 2022, while we remain vigilant monitoring the ongoing dynamic nature of the current environment. 
The second bucket I would characterize as transitional items that we are working our way through as we move out of the COVID-19 environment and fully recover on supply. This includes areas like lower fixed cost leverage as we lapped the year ago elevated levels of demand, sustained labor challenges and added investment in higher-cost co-manufacturers to recover fully on supply. We had factored these pressures into our plans, but in some cases, they were more significant than anticipated as either the time to recover or the magnitude of the impact were greater than expected. These transitional costs reflect about half of our gross margin erosion in the quarter. And while we expect the impact of these costs to moderate into the fourth quarter, they will continue to add pressure as we fully cycle the COVID-19 environment. 
The third bucket is execution related to the high degree of transformation we have underway in our Snacks division. Throughout my time at Campbell, we have taken significant steps to improve our execution as we have steadily advanced our agenda. However, this quarter, the convergence of multiple transformation efforts including systems, logistics and capacity all put additional executional pressure on the business in a tough third quarter environment. We have already taken decisive actions to allocate more resources and better phase projects to address these issues. We do not expect these elements will have a material impact on the fourth quarter. And more importantly, they do not alter our long-term expectations for the Snacks margin expansion opportunity we highlighted last quarter and will share in greater detail during our Investor Day later this year. 
Although all these headwinds put pressure on our near-end performance, they do not represent structural issues, and we remain confident in our strategic plans. As a result of the third quarter pressures on margin, adjusted earnings per share came in lower than we expected at $0.57. As Mick will discuss in more depth, we're updating our guidance accordingly. 
Turning to our division performance. Let me begin with Meals & Beverages. Our net sales decline of 14% and in-market performance of minus 24% in the third quarter reflect lapping the historically high consumption levels that we experienced during the onset of the pandemic last year. On a 2-year basis, we had net sales momentum in key categories with share gains over prior year in condensed soup, ready-to-serve soup, Swanson broth, Prego and Pacific Foods. Compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we delivered strong consumption growth of 9% against organic net sales growth of 3% with the gap driven by our Foodservice business, which continued to recover as governments gradually eased on-site dining restrictions in some markets. 
Overall, as we have invested in our service levels, they are stabilizing, and we are now in a better position on supply across the division. We have restored the shelf in the majority of our categories and our share of total points of distribution is consistent with pre-COVID-19 levels across U.S. soup, Prego and V8 beverages. In-market consumption for soup was strong versus 2 years ago, growing at 9% and gaining dollar share. We delivered record share growth in U.S. soup of nearly 2 points driven by condensed soups, Swanson broth, Chunky and Pacific Foods. We also made significant progress on the retention of new households since the onset of the pandemic. 
Soup gained dollar share in all 3 categories, with millennials driving strong growth in condensed cooking, broth and ready-to-serve soup. We are confident that the brand investments made are working as buyers and buy rate remain elevated compared to pre-COVID-19 levels. We continue to be encouraged by the sustainment of quick scratch cooking behaviors and in-home eating occasions even as COVID-19 restrictions are lifted. In fact, condensed delivered its ninth consecutive quarter of dollar share gains growing share nearly 3 points. Notably, with millennial consumers, condensed grew share by nearly 4 points. 
Within ready-to-serve, Chunky delivered double-digit end market consumption growth on a 2-year basis. Pacific Foods continued to be a powerful growth engine within our soup portfolio with end-market consumption growth of nearly 30% on a 2-year basis and continued share gains versus prior year, marking its sixth consecutive quarter of share improvement. On Swanson Broth, as we invested to restore distribution and service, we increased share by nearly 2 points versus prior year. 
On a 2-year basis, we grew household penetration by more than 1 point and saw higher repeat rates on our brand. Prego delivered its 24th consecutive month with the #1 share position in the Italian sauce category and achieved its strongest share gain in over 3 years. Compared to prepandemic levels, we are seeing strong repeat rates and buyer retention on this brand as well as strong resonance with millennial consumers. 
Overall, the Meals & Beverage division delivered a strong in-market quarter against difficult comparisons with share gains in key categories, especially among younger consumers, TPD gains and improved service levels continuing to support our confidence that it will emerge from the pandemic in a stronger position. 
Let's now turn to Snacks where our power brands continue to fuel performance with end market consumption growth of 14% on a 2-year basis despite being down 5% year-over-year. On a 2-year basis, total snacks consumption grew 10% against organic net sales growth of 3% with the gap driven by the decline in our partner brands and continued pressure in the convenience channels. We grew share on many of our power brands over prior year and repeat rates on 7 of 9 power brands are ahead of pre-COVID-19 levels. We delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of share growth on Late July snacks, Kettle Brand potato chips, Snack Factory Pretzel crisps and Lance sandwich crackers. 
On a 2-year comparison within the power brands, our salty snack brands grew in-market consumption nearly 20% and increased household penetration across the majority of these brands. Our Pepperidge Farm Farmhouse products also continued to deliver exceptional results with in-market consumption growth of 9% on top of the prior year increase. Turning to Goldfish. We returned to share growth, increasing by more than 1 point compared to prior year. This was in part due to an improved performance on multipacks, continued momentum on flavor blasted Goldfish and new broadened digital activation. We also exited the quarter with early momentum from the launch of limited edition Frank's RedHot Goldfish. 
With that, let me turn it over to Mick to discuss our third quarter results in more detail and our guidance for the full year."

As Mark just shared, our third quarter results were impacted by last year's demand surge related to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the gross margin impact due to pronounced inflatio",1952,"Thanks, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 12. As Mark just shared, our third quarter results were impacted by last year's demand surge related to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the gross margin impact due to pronounced inflation, our transition out of the COVID-19 environment and some executional pressure as we continued to advance our transformation agenda, primarily in our Snacks division. 
During the quarter, organic net sales declined 12% and adjusted EBIT decreased 27%, driven by lower sales volume and a lower adjusted gross margin partially offset by lower marketing and selling expenses. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations decreased 31% to $0.57 per share, primarily reflecting the decrease in adjusted EBIT. Year-to-date, our organic net sales increased 1%, driven by lower promotional spending in both divisions. Meals & Beverages increased 1%, mainly driven by growth in U.S. soup and V8 beverages, partially offset by declines in foodservice. 
In Snacks, organic net sales were flat as declines in Lance sandwich crackers and in partner brands within the Snyder's-Lance portfolio were offset by gains in our salty snacks portfolio and our fresh bakery product. Year-to-date adjusted EBIT of $1.14 billion was comparable to prior year, as a lower adjusted gross margin and increased adjusted administrative expenses were offset by lower adjusted marketing and selling expenses, higher adjusted other income and sales volume gains. 
Within marketing and selling expenses, lower selling and other marketing costs were partially offset by a 3% increase in advertising and consumer promotion expense or compared to 17.3%. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations increased 4% to $2.43 per share, primarily reflecting lower adjusted net interest expense. 
I'll review in the next couple of slides our third quarter results in more detail and provide revised guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2021, reflecting these results and our expectation for sustained inflationary pressures through the remainder of the year. Our organic net sales decreased 12% during the quarter, lapping the prior year organic net sales increase of 17% when the demand for at-home consumption surged at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019, organic net sales grew 3%. Our adjusted gross margin decreased by 290 basis points in the third quarter from 34.7% to 31.8%. On the slide, you'll see the various items bridging the year-over-year change in our overall gross margin. 
Now let me tie back to Mark's earlier comments, which excludes the 250 basis points net benefit from mark-to-market adjustments on outstanding commodity hedges included in inflation and other in the bridge. First, external factors led to about 1/3 of the year-over-year decrease in margin. These external factors included approximately 290 basis points of inflation and some temporary disruption from the Texas storm back in February, both reflected Inflation and Other in the bridge. Cost inflation was approximately 4% on a rate basis, which was higher than anticipated, largely driven by freight rates. Partially offsetting these headwinds was our ongoing supply chain productivity program, which contributed 150 basis points to gross margin and included initiatives, among others, within procurement and logistics optimization. 
Second, headwinds related to our transition into the post-COVID-19 operating environment represented about half of the gross margin decline. As we transitioned from last year's demand search, mix and operating leverage each had an approximate 110 basis point negative impact on gross margin in the third quarter. Net pricing drove a positive 30 basis point improvement. The remainder were incremental other supply chain costs within Inflation and Other such as increased costs associated with co-manufacturing to support supply and distribution recovery. 
Third, executional challenges, which represented the remainder of the decline were mostly incremental other supply chain costs within inflation and other. These costs were mainly related to the transformation of our Snacks division and were partially offset by a cost savings program, which added 60 basis points to our gross margin.
Moving on to other operating items. Marketing and selling expenses decreased $37 million or 15% in the quarter. This decrease was driven by lower A&C, lower incentive compensation, lower selling expenses and the benefits of cost savings initiatives. Overall, our marketing and selling expenses represented 10.2% of net sales during the quarter compared to 10.7% last year. As a percentage of net sales, total A&C was comparable to the prior year quarter. Adjusted administrative expenses decreased $2 million or 1%, driven primarily by lower incentive compensation, partially offset by higher benefit-related costs. Adjusted administrative expenses represented 7.2% of net sales during the quarter, an 80 basis point increase compared to last year.
Moving to the next slide. We have continued to successfully deliver against our multiyear enterprise cost savings initiatives. This quarter, we achieved $20 million in incremental year-over-year savings resulting in year-to-date savings of $55 million. We expect an additional $20 million in the fourth quarter to deliver an aggregate $75 million of cost savings for the fiscal year with the majority of the savings from the Snyder's-Lance integration. We remain on track to deliver our cumulative savings target of $850 million by the end of fiscal 2022. 
On Slide 17, we are providing a total company adjusted EBIT bridge to summarize the key drivers of performance this quarter. As previously mentioned, adjusted EBIT declined by 27%. The previously mentioned net sales decline resulted in a $88 million EBIT headwind while the 290 basis point gross margin decline resulted in a $58 million EBIT headwind. Both were partially offset by lower marketing and selling expenses. Overall, our adjusted EBIT margin decreased year-over-year by 290 basis points to 14.3%. 
The following chart breaks down our adjusted EPS growth between our operating performance and below-the-line items. Adjusted EPS decreased $0.26 from $0.83 in the prior year quarter to $0.57 per share due to the negative $0.26 impact of adjusted EBIT as slightly lower interest expense was offset by slightly higher adjusted taxes. In Meals & Beverages, organic net sales decreased 15% to $1 billion, primarily due to declines across U.S. retail products, including U.S. soup and Prego pasta sauces, as well as declines in Canada and Foodservice. 
Sales of U.S. soup decreased 21% due to volume declines in condensed soups, ready-to-serve soups and broth, lapping a 35% increase in the prior year quarter. For Meals & Beverages, volume decreased in U.S. retail, driven by lapping increased demand of food purchases for at-home consumption at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the prior year quarter when organic net sales increased 21%. Compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019, organic net sales in Meals & Beverages grew 3%. 
Operating earnings for Meals & Beverages decreased 35% to $179 million. The decrease was primarily due to sales volume declines and the lower gross margin, partially offset by lower marketing and selling expenses. The lower gross margin resulted from higher cost inflation including higher freight costs, other supply chain costs such as external sourcing and the weather-related disruption at the beginning of the quarter, reduced operating leverage and unfavorable product mix partially offset by the benefits of supply chain productivity improvements. Overall, within our Meals & Beverages division, the operating margin decreased year-over-year by 550 basis points to 17.2%. 
Within Snacks, organic net sales decreased 8%, driven by volume declines within our salty snacks portfolio, including Pop Secret popcorn, Cape Cod potato chips and Snyder's of Hanover pretzels, as well as in Lance sandwich crackers, Partner Brands and Fresh Bakery. Volume declines were partially driven by lapping increased demand of food purchases for at-home consumption at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the prior year quarter when organic net sales increased 12%. 
Compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019, Snacks organic net sales grew 3%. Operating earnings for Snacks decreased 29% for the quarter, driven by a lower gross margin and sales volume declines, partially offset by lower marketing and selling expenses and lower administrative expenses. The lower gross margin resulted from higher cost inflation and other supply chain costs, reduced operating leverage and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by the benefits of supply chain productivity improvements. Overall, within our Snacks division, the operating margin decreased year-over-year by 350 basis points to 11.5%. 
I'll now turn to our cash flow and liquidity. Fiscal year-to-date cash flow from operations decreased from $1.1 billion in the prior year to $881 million, primarily due to changes in working capital principally from lower accrued liabilities and lapping significant benefits in accounts payable in the prior year. Our year-to-date cash for investing activities were largely reflective of the cash outlay from capital expenditures of $190 million, which was $30 million lower than the prior year, primarily driven by discontinued operations. 
Our year-to-date cash outflows for financing activities were $1.4 billion, reflecting cash outlays due to dividends paid of $327 million. Additionally, we reduced our debt by $1 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $209 million. As you saw in our press release, given the continued strong cash flow generation and progress regarding the reduction of our leverage, in addition to the increase of our dividend announced in December, the Board of Directors authorized a new anti-dilutive share repurchase program of up to $250 million to offset the impact of dilution from shares issued under our stock compensation programs. The company's March 2017 strategic share repurchase program remains suspended. 
Turning to Slide 22. As covered in our press release, we are updating guidance to reflect our third quarter results and the impact of the sale of the Plum Baby Food and Snacks business, which was completed on May 3, 2021. In the fourth quarter, we expect more pronounced inflationary pressures to negatively impact margins while pricing actions take hold in the beginning of fiscal 2022. In addition, although we expect to make progress on the transition into the post-COVID-19 environment, it will remain a headwind from a margin perspective. 
While we expect gross margin headwinds to persist through the fourth quarter, we expect a sequential improvement of our EBIT margin relative to prior year, due to easier comparables, improved execution and normalizing marketing investments. We expect net sales for fiscal 2021 to decline 3.5% to 3% excluding the impact from the 53rd week in fiscal 2020 and the impact of the European Chips and Plum divestitures, we expect organic net sales to decline 1.2% and to minus 0.7%. 
To put our fiscal 2021 organic net sales guidance into perspective, at the midpoint of our guidance range, we expect fiscal 2021 to be 6% above fiscal 2019. We expect adjusted EBIT of minus 5% to minus 4%. We expect net interest expense of $210 million to $250 million and an adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 24%. As a result, we expect adjusted EPS of $2.90 to $2.93 per share, representing a year-over-year decline of minus 2% to minus 1% to the prior year. The EPS impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2020 was estimated to be $0.04 per share. 
To put our fiscal 2021 EPS guidance into perspective, at the midpoint of our guidance range, we expect fiscal 2021 to be in line with fiscal 2020, considering the impact of the 53rd week and 27% above fiscal 2019 adjusted EPS. Regarding capital expenditures, we now expect to spend approximately $300 million for the full year, which is below previous expectations, driven by the impact from COVID-19 on the operating environment. 
In closing, I want to reiterate Mark's conviction in the long-term performance of Campbell. We are working diligently to deliver the results we know we are capable of delivering. And I remain optimistic about our strategy, our team and the underlying strength of our brands. And with that, let me turn it back to Mark."

Finally, and most importantly for the long-term health of our business is the progress we are making on our categories and brands and the overwhelmingly positive indicators that we are seeing from consumers and customers. We will address the inflation and execution. And as we continue to demonstrate sustainable growth, we will unlock Campbell's full potential.

Given how fiscal 3Q played out, I'm trying to get a sense of maybe what gives you the confidence that you now have, I guess, the appropriate visibility for fiscal 4Q? And then maybe more important, it sounds like you have comfort that these issues are addressable and largely not structural. And so it's obviously early to be talking with any specificity about fiscal '22, but some of these challenges, I think you mentioned are likely to persist a bit and be margin headwinds next year. 
So I'm trying to get a sense of between the combination of pricing, productivity, some of the actions that you're taking in the Snacks segment and such, I mean do you anticipate you'll have sort of -- and obviously elevated sales potentially as well. Do you anticipate you'll have the firepower, so to speak, to at least help address or mitigate some of those costs to sort of protect profitability in a better way in '22? Or are those things that I mentioned maybe at this point not expected to be enough given some of the pressures you've gone into next year?"

Let me start with Q4. And then, obviously, we'll stop short to kind of giving a lot of detail on '22. But I'll give you a perspective on kind of how we see that and how we thought about the variables that we talked about for t",809,"Yes. Great question, Andrew. Let me start with Q4. And then, obviously, we'll stop short to kind of giving a lot of detail on '22. But I'll give you a perspective on kind of how we see that and how we thought about the variables that we talked about for this quarter affecting the business going forward. But first on Q4, I do -- again, I'm always -- in the current environment we're in, certainly, we've had a couple -- tough to predict a couple of the variables we've seen. But I do feel good that what we experienced in Q3 and how that translates into Q4, we've done a very good job of connecting those dots. And I do think you'll see sequential improvement for a variety of reasons. 
First, I think we're not going to have the winter storm. And just as a perspective, closing the Paris facility for 2 weeks in Texas, that ended up being right around the $10 million additional headwind in Q3 that we obviously have not anticipated is part of the reason that we were off our expectations. So clearly, we're not going to have that circumstance as we go into Q45. 
I think the second thing is the comparable numbers in Q4 are just an easier comp, right? So you've got higher COVID costs in Q4 a year ago, you also have the opportunity to, as we've said all along in the back half, that we'd moderate marketing spending to kind of equate to the percent of net sales. And so that will give us a bit of a tailwind as well in the fourth quarter. And as I talked about some of the transformational kind of execution issues on snacks, and again, just as a little bit of deeper perspective on that. In the third quarter, it was really -- I've been very proud of that team and done an amazing job through the integration from my perspective. I do think in the third quarter, the accumulation of initiatives, we cut over to SAP, we closed our Columbus, Georgia facility. We had 3 major capacity expansion projects going on in the backstop of COVID and not in a way of an excuse, but certainly, I think that put some added pressure on an already tough quarter for us as it related to Snacks. 
But as we look forward, we've added the right resources, we've staged this the right way. We're through some of that work. And so we expect that executional headwind that we saw in the third quarter to really kind of be behind us as we go through the fourth quarter. So that's really the reason why we see the sequential improvement. And even on operating leverage and some of the things that were a bit bigger in nature in third quarter, I think, for that, that carries over, we've got good estimates now. So we can kind of see how that operation works. We're now running all of the SKUs that we had simplified a year ago. I think that was a little bit of the dynamic as we added those back, introduced a little bit of new complexity back into the supply chain, continuing to push hard through some of the labor challenges that we've had. 
So I think you'll see that mitigate, but still be present. And so I think when you think about '22, obviously, the things I just described executionally, I think, will be behind us. As far as inflation goes, we feel very good about the progress we're making on pricing. The conversations that we're having with customers are very constructive. I'm really grateful that we've had this time to really build equity. I mean, this is probably the healthiest the portfolio has ever been going into that conversation. So that's a good thing. I would be remiss not to say though, that inflation is a little bit of a moving target right now. And so although I feel great about what we're doing, I think I kind of want to wait for the next quarter to see kind of where we're landing on a couple of the variables and a couple of the commodities. 
And then as it relates to kind of this transitional headwind, I think it's a little bit of a mixed bag. Obviously, we're going to be working hard to address those areas, but we will cycle through the COVID environment at least into the first half of next year. So we'll give you a lot more granularity on it, but I think it's a very balanced position. Certainly, I think Q3 very much is the outlier, but I do think some of these variables will continue, but we've got very good plans against them. So hopefully, that helps to put it into a little bit of context."

I think there are 3 distinct things that we're watching occur in that bucket. The first, it is really just lapping, right? That is the kind of cycling of a network that's fully loaded and that leverage from year-to-year. The second piece, I think, that we saw transitionally in Q3. And again, I think these become more mitigated cost going forward. But we have really continued to see labor as a bigger challenge than I think we had expected it to be. And of course, that has a bit of a knock-on effect that as that labor has not enabled us to kind of meet the full targets on production, we've had to go to some higher-cost co-mans that we consciously invested in to make sure that supply and inventory was where we needed it. 
But those 3 variables of kind of leverage, labor and the external investment in co-manufacturers, is what we're describing as that transitional bucket. And so I do think the lapping will continue. But the other two, we're going to get better and manage through that as we go into next year. Does that help, Andrew?"

As we start the first quarter of fiscal '22, I feel very good about how that was informed and kind of how we saw the environment. 
But I think kind of the name of the game for '22 is going to be to remain pretty agile and nimble.

We've got a very good plan that I think enables us to feel like -- well, first and foremost, that will remain competitive, but also that in some of these categories where we are a significant leader that we're also going to be able to sustain momentum where we've built it. I mean, the last thing we want to do is shut down growth and share that we've worked fairly hard to have in place. 
So we're going to be thoughtful about it, but it also enables us, I think, to model, if you will, based on historical elasticity. We're able to model a pretty good understanding of where those key thresholds are. We understand kind of how to balance this, what do you do in list price versus what you do in trade. Obviously, there's a full range of leverage that we're going to be using across revenue management to get that right. But I think for right now, we feel like given the historical significance, given our ability to protect certain price points, overall, as far as the health of the business going into it, we feel very good."

But it also, at the same time, were obviously lapping a significant marketing investment in last year. So as a result, we expect it to normalize more in Q4 for F20.

And so obviously, as we move forward through the fourth quarter, we start to set up '22 guidance and give another couple of months of coverage behind us as well as understanding where our commodities are coming in, we'll have a better sense. I know what everyone is trying to get at, which is, do you feel like you can fully cover inflation next year with the tools you've got? I can tell you, we feel good, but we're going to have to really watch what happens over these next couple of months to kind of solidify our position. 
As far as magnitude of pricing, as you might imagine, it's a little bit of a -- depending on which business it is, where the commodities are impacting it more. We've been very clear and transparent on kind of the translation of inflation to where that pricing resides. Obviously, as I said before, we're also overlaying a very detailed kind of strategic lens to it to make sure that we're not doing anything that we're going to regret as far as the health of the business. So it's a pretty broad range. I mean, kind of mid-single digits is probably a good assumption if you were trying to cost average it across all of our businesses, if that helps a little bit."

Well, I think a couple of things. One is, as Chris, as you'll remember, in the fourth quarter last year, we really invested into the opportunity that we had given the elevated demand and profitability that we were experiencing, and we did that for a variety of reasons, one of which was to solidify the equity of the businesses, continue to really work on building equity with those households, especially younger households. We also learned a lot during that time. So we used it as a bit of an opportunity to really fine-tune where the best ROIs were. 
And as an example, you would have seen in the third quarter, our digital spend went up almost 20 points. We're now over 60% of our spend is in digital, which I love for a variety of different reasons, but one of which is that it's a very high ROI and a very efficient spend. And so although I do think there are some key thresholds that we want to manage too, and as we've said, kind of the percent of net sales is a good proxy. When I look at that relative to where we've been, I feel like that's a good level. And we've been able to kind of manage to that through the last couple of quarters into this quarter. And certainly, we're going to try to apply that kind of standard of philosophy as we go into '22."

I think on the operating leverage, a little bit of it was us needing to understand exactly how much benefit we had gained a year ago when we were at our peak, how much the value of the simplicity of the portfolio versus adding those TDPs back in place we're going to take. And so I think what I would tell you is we've now calibrated that. I do think it will remain throughout the cycle of COVID-19, but some of these other elements, ones that are capable of being priced and the others that are more kind of unique to us, I think we'll work through those.

And I know what you're kind of noting here is that '22 or part of it feels like also sort of an exit transition period out of COVID that might hamper profitability. 
But big picture, we would think that you should be bridging to much significantly higher gross profit dollars versus pre-COVID particularly with the multiyear stacked organic revenue growth that you will have had from trial and repeat coming out of COVID.

But maybe this is a way to kind of give you a little bit of context, and Mick had mentioned this earlier, but I think it's a really important aspect. And obviously, We are disappointed with the quarter. I mean, our standard is that we do what we say and, in this particular quarter, we didn't do that. But I continue to see the challenges that were in the quarter as being very transitional in nature and the underpinning of the great in-market results and being ahead of expectations as it relates to share and the retention of these households all bode well for us for the future. 
And maybe to give a little context to your question, specifically, if you take the midpoint of our '21 guidance, and again, I'm going to repeat a little bit of what Nick said, but I think it's important. At the midpoint of our guidance, it represents versus that 2019 base, a top line growth of 6%, so a CAGR of about 3%. Obviously, we know that there's some foodservice in there and a little bit of partner brands, but in general, a 6% versus '19. Our EBIT during that same period with the midpoint of the range, so even with the adjustment in our guidance, is up 9% versus 2019 or at about a 5% CAGR for the 2 years. And as Mick had said earlier, EPS is up 27% since '19 with consumption up 9% during the same period. 
So if you look at that, all of those -- and again, I think people would expect this, but all of those are well above or well within our strategic plan targets. And I think that as we navigate into '22, we would expect to see, yes, some challenges as we continue to lap a few of these areas. I do want to kind of nail down a good number for inflation next year. But I feel very good about where we are on the journey. Don't love the quarter, but I love the progress that we're making and, in particular, what I think will be the longest lasting, which is the strength of the brands and the businesses. 
So I don't know if that helps with perspective. I know what you're looking for, for '22, and we will do a good job of providing you that bridge when we get together at the end of the year. But I think not a bad perspective to kind of close out a little bit of the discussion with."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 
Throughout the last year, we rallied through the pandemic and made decisions focused on prioritizing the safety and well-being of our employees while meeting the needs of our customers and consumers. This approach has served us well over the past 15 months as we progressed our strategy in a volatile operating environment. Our team pulled together, we executed with excellence, and we delivered strong results.  
As you saw in our press release this morning, our results this quarter reflected the challenging  comparisons to the prior year as we cycled the demand surge that accompanied the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and navigated several current headwinds. However, you will also have seen the continued strength in-market on market shares, underpinned by healthy retention of new and younger households and the full recovery of distribution levels. 
We did face a significant inflationary environment in the quarter as well as shorter-term increases in supply chain costs. We anticipated the vast majority of these drivers, but in certain areas, the pressures intensified, especially around inflation and some of the transitional costs moving out of the COVID-19 environment. We are confident that we can address these issues, and we have plans and pricing already in place as we exit the fiscal year and enter fiscal 2022. Our confidence is further strengthened by our continued in-market momentum and the structural health of our business and brands.  
I will first review our results and then share the context and actions we are taking to address these challenges and the improving trajectory we expect  for the rest of the year as we head into fiscal 2022. 
As we outlined during our second quarter earnings call, we expected this would be a challenging quarter, and we recognized that there would be headwinds as we lap the peak of COVID-19 demand, manage the volatility of current market dynamics and continue to navigate our own transformation agenda.  
We delivered sales of $1.98 billion, in line with our expectations as we cycled a 17% organic growth comparison to a year ago. Our sales results benefited from the continued momentum of our Snacks power brands and our U.S. retail products in our Meals & Beverages division as well as the early signs of recovery from our foodservice business. Importantly, our brands remain strong with nearly 3/4 of our portfolio gaining or holding share in the quarter. 
In our core categories, most of our brands grew at higher rates than prepandemic levels, and our brand consumption on a 2-year comparison grew 9%. These results were driven by our decision to invest in supply and service while preserving brand investments with advertising and consumer promotion expense as a percentage of net sales comparable to last year.  
Looking ahead, we expect organic sales in the fourth quarter to decline versus last year as the COVID-19 lap continues. We do expect a sequential improvement from the third quarter as the comparison to prior year eases a bit and our foodservice business continues to recover. 
From a margin perspective, our decline versus prior year, excluding the net benefit from mark-to-market adjustments on outstanding commodity hedges, stem from certain headwinds which are grouped into 3 main buckets.  
First, external factors were larger than we had anticipated. We, like others, faced pronounced inflation related primarily to steeply higher transportation costs, some of which was an outcome from the strain of the Texas winter storms on supply chain logistics and the closure of our Paris, Texas facility for 2 weeks. These factors, partially offset by our productivity improvements, reflect about 1/3 of the gross margin erosion in the third quarter and will continue into fiscal 2022.  
We currently expect to benefit from pricing actions we have put in place across our portfolio and our strong productivity plans to mitigate this inflation pressure in fiscal 2022, while we remain vigilant monitoring the ongoing dynamic nature of the current environment.  
The second bucket I would characterize as transitional items that we are working our way through as we move out of the COVID-19 environment and fully recover on supply. This includes areas like lower fixed cost leverage as we lap the year ago elevated levels of demand, sustained labor challenges and added investment in higher-cost co-manufacturers to recover fully on supply. We had factored these pressures into our plans, but in some cases, they were more significant than anticipated as either the time to recover or the magnitude of the impact were greater than expected. 
These transitional costs reflect about half of our gross margin erosion in the quarter. And while we expect the impact of these costs to moderate into the fourth quarter, they will continue to add pressure as we fully cycle the COVID-19 environment.  
The third bucket is execution related to the high degree of transformation we have underway in our Snacks division. Throughout my time at Campbell, we have taken significant steps to improve our execution as we have steadily advanced our agenda. However, this quarter, the convergence of multiple transformation efforts, including systems, logistics and capacity, all put additional executional pressure on the business in a tough third quarter environment. 
We have already taken decisive actions to allocate more resources and better phase projects to address these issues. We do not expect these elements will have a material impact on the fourth quarter. And more importantly, they do not alter our long-term expectations for the Snacks margin expansion  opportunity we highlighted last quarter and will share in greater detail during our Investor Day later this year.  
Although all these headwinds put pressure on our near-end performance, they do not represent structural issues, and we remain confident in our strategic plans. 
As a result of the third quarter pressures on margin, adjusted earnings per share came in lower than we expected at $0.57. As Mick will discuss in more depth, we're updating our guidance accordingly.  
Turning to our division performance, let me begin with Meals & Beverages. Our net sales decline of 14% and in-market performance of minus 24% in the third quarter reflect lapping the historically high consumption levels that we experienced during the onset of the pandemic last year. On a 2-year basis, we had net sales momentum in key categories with share gains over prior year in condensed soup, ready-to-serve soup, Swanson broth, Prego and Pacific Foods. 
Compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we delivered strong consumption growth of 9% against organic net sales growth of 3%, with the gap driven by our foodservice business, which continued to recover as governments gradually eased on-site dining restrictions in some markets.  
Overall, as we have invested in our service levels, they are stabilizing, and we are now in a better position on supply across the division. We have restored the shelf in the majority of our categories, and our share of total points of distribution is consistent with pre-COVID-19 levels across U.S. soup, Prego and V8 beverages. 
In-market consumption for soup was strong versus 2 years ago, growing at 9% and gaining dollar share. We delivered record share growth in U.S. soup of nearly 2 points driven by condensed soups, Swanson broth, Chunky and Pacific Foods. We also made significant progress on the retention of new households since the onset of the pandemic.  
Soup gained dollar share in all 3 categories, with millennials driving strong growth in condensed cooking, broth and ready-to-serve soup. We are confident that the brand investments made are working as buyers and buy rate remain elevated compared to pre-COVID-19 levels. 
We continue to be encouraged by the sustainment of quick-scratch cooking behaviors and in-home eating occasions even as COVID-19 restrictions are lifted. In fact, condensed delivered its ninth consecutive quarter of dollar share gains, growing share nearly 3 points. Notably, with millennial consumers, condensed grew share by nearly 4 points.  
Within ready-to-serve, Chunky delivered double-digit in-market consumption growth on a 2-year basis. Pacific Foods continued to be a powerful growth engine within our soup portfolio with in-market consumption growth of nearly 30% on a 2-year basis and continued share gains versus prior year, marking its sixth consecutive quarter of share improvement. On Swanson broth, as we invested to restore distribution and service, we increased share by nearly 2 points versus prior year. On a 2-year basis, we grew household penetration by more than 1 point and saw higher repeat rates on our brand. Prego delivered its 24th consecutive month with the #1 share position in the Italian sauce category and achieved its strongest share gain in over 3 years. Compared to prepandemic levels, we are seeing strong repeat rates and buyer retention on this brand as well as strong resonance with millennial consumers.  
Overall, the Meals & Beverage division delivered a strong in-market quarter against difficult comparisons with share gains in key categories, especially among younger consumers, TPD gains and improved service levels, continuing to support our confidence that it will emerge from the pandemic in a stronger position.  
Let's now turn to Snacks, where our power brands continued to fuel performance with in-market consumption growth of 14% on a 2-year basis despite being down 5% year-over-year. 
On a 2-year basis, total snacks consumption grew 10% against organic net sales growth of 3% with the gap driven by the decline in our partner brands and continued pressure in the convenience channels. We grew share on many of our power brands over prior year, and repeat rates on 7 of 9 power brands are ahead of pre-COVID-19 levels. We delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of share growth on Late July snacks, Kettle Brand potato chips, Snack Factory Pretzel Crisps and Lance sandwich crackers.  
On a 2-year comparison within the power brands, our salty snack brands grew in-market consumption  nearly 20% and increased household penetration across the majority of these brands. Our Pepperidge Farm Farmhouse products also continued to deliver exceptional results with in-market consumption growth of 9% on top of the prior year increase. Turning to Goldfish, we returned to share growth,  increasing by more than 1 point compared to prior year. This was in part due to an improved performance on multipacks, continued momentum on Flavor Blasted Goldfish and new, broadened digital activation. We also exited the quarter with early momentum from the launch of limited-edition Frank's RedHot Goldfish.  
With that, let me turn it over to Mick to discuss our third quarter results in more detail and our guidance for the full year."

Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 12. 
As Mark just shared, our third quarter results were impacted by last year's demand surge related to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the gross margin impact due to pronounced inflation, our transition out of the COVID-19 environment and some executional pressure as we continued to advance our transformation agenda primarily in our Snacks division.  
During the quarter, organic net sales declined 12% and adjusted EBIT decreased 27% driven by lower sales volume and a lower adjusted gross margin, partially offset by lower marketing and selling expenses. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations decreased 31% to $0.57 per share, primarily reflecting the decrease in adjusted EBIT. 
Year-to-date, our organic net sales increased 1% driven by lower promotional spending in both divisions. Meals & Beverages increased 1% mainly driven by growth in U.S. soup and V8 beverages, partially offset by declines in foodservice. In Snacks, organic net sales were flat as declines in Lance sandwich crackers and in partner brands within the Snyder's-Lance portfolio were offset by gains in our salty snacks portfolio and our fresh bakery product. 
Year-to-date adjusted EBIT of $1.14 billion was comparable to prior year as our lower adjusted gross margin and increased adjusted administrative expenses were offset by lower adjusted marketing and selling expenses, higher adjusted other income and sales volume gains.  
Within marketing and selling expenses, lower selling and other marketing costs were partially offset by a 3% increase in advertising and consumer promotion expense or A&C. 
Year-to-date, our adjusted EBIT margin was 17.2% compared to 17.3% in the prior year. 
Adjusted EPS from continuing operations increased 4% to $2.43 per share, primarily reflecting lower adjusted net interest expense.  
I'll review in the next couple of slides our third quarter results in more detail and provide revised guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2021, reflecting these results and our expectation for sustained inflationary pressures through the remainder of the year.
Our organic net sales decreased 12% during the quarter, lapping the prior year organic net sales increase of 17% when the demand for at-home consumption surged at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019, organic net sales grew 3%.
Our adjusted gross margin decreased by 290 basis points in the third quarter from 34.7% to 31.8%. On the slide, you'll see the various items bridging the year-over-year change in our overall gross margin. Now let me tie back to Mark's earlier comments, which excludes the 250 basis points net benefit from mark-to-market adjustments on outstanding commodity hedges included in inflation and other in the bridge.
First, external factors led to about 1/3 of the year-over-year decrease in margin. These external factors included approximately 290 basis points of inflation and some temporary disruption from the Texas storm back in February. Both reflected inflation and other in the bridge. Cost inflation was approximately 4% on a rate basis, which was higher than anticipated largely driven by freight rates. 
Partially offsetting these headwinds was our ongoing supply chain productivity program, which contributed 150 basis points to gross margin and included initiatives, among others, within procurement and logistics optimization.  
Second, headwinds related to our transition into the post-COVID-19 operating environment represented about half of the gross margin decline. As we transitioned from last year's demand surge, mix and operating leverage each had an approximate 110 basis point negative impact on gross margin in the third quarter. Net pricing drove a positive 30 basis point improvement. The remainder were incremental other supply chain costs within inflation and other such as increased costs associated with co-manufacturing to support supply and distribution recovery. 
 
Third, executional challenges, which represented the remainder of the decline, were mostly incremental other supply chain costs within inflation and other. These costs were mainly related to the transformation of our Snacks division and were partially offset by our cost savings program, which added 60 basis points to our gross margin.
Moving on to other operating items. Marketing and selling expenses decreased $37 million or 15% in the quarter. This decrease was driven by lower A&C, lower incentive compensation, lower selling expenses and the benefits of cost savings initiatives. Overall, our marketing and selling expenses represented 10.2% of net sales during the quarter compared to 10.7% last year. As a percentage of net sales, total A&C was comparable to the prior year quarter.. 
Adjusted administrative expenses decreased $2 million or 1% driven primarily by lower incentive compensation, partially offset by higher benefit- related costs. Adjusted administrative expenses represented 7.2% of net sales during the quarter, an 80 basis point increase compared to last year.
Moving to the next slide. We have continued to successfully deliver against our multiyear enterprise cost savings initiatives. This quarter, we achieved $20 million in incremental year-over-year savings, resulting in year-to-date savings of $55 million. We expect an additional $20 million in the fourth quarter to deliver an aggregate $75 million of cost savings for the fiscal year with the majority of the savings from the Snyder's-Lance integration. We remain on track to deliver our cumulative savings target of $850 million by the end of fiscal 2022.  
On Slide 17, we are providing a total company adjusted EBIT bridge to summarize the key drivers of performance this quarter. As previously mentioned, adjusted EBIT declined by 27%. The previously mentioned net sales decline resulted in a $88 million EBIT headwind, while the 290 basis point gross margin decline resulted in a $58 million EBIT headwind. Both were partially offset by lower marketing and selling expenses. Overall, our adjusted EBIT margin decreased year-over-year by  290 basis points to 14.3%.  
The following chart breaks down our adjusted EPS growth between our operating performance and below-the-line items. 
Adjusted EPS decreased $0.26 from $0.83 in the prior year quarter to $0.57 per share due to the negative $0.26 impact of adjusted EBIT as slightly lower interest expense was offset by slightly higher adjusted taxes. 
In Meals & Beverages, organic net sales decreased 15% to $1 billion primarily due to declines across U.S. retail products, including U.S. soup and Prego pasta sauces as well as declines in Canada and foodservice. Sales of U.S. soup decreased 21% due to volume declines in condensed soup, ready-to-serve soups and broth, lapping a 35% increase in the prior year quarter. 
For Meals & Beverages, volume decreased in U.S. retail driven by lapping increased demand of food purchases for at-home consumption at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the prior year quarter when organic net sales increased 21%. Compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019, organic net sales in Meals & Beverages grew 3%.  
Operating earnings for Meals & Beverages decreased 35% to $179 million. The decrease was primarily due to sales volume declines and the lower gross margin, partially offset by lower marketing and selling expenses. The lower gross margin resulted from higher cost inflation, including higher freight costs, other supply chain costs, such as external sourcing, and the weather-related disruption at the beginning of the quarter, reduced operating leverage and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by the benefits of supply chain productivity improvements.  Overall, within our Meals & Beverages division, the operating margin decreased year-over-year by 550 basis points to 17.2%. 
Within Snacks, organic net sales decreased 8% driven by volume declines within our salty snacks portfolio, including Pop Secret popcorn, Cape Cod potato chips and Snyder's of Hanover pretzels as well as in Lance sandwich crackers, partner brands and Fresh Bakery. Volume declines were partially driven by lapping increased demand of food purchases for at-home consumption at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the prior year quarter when organic net sales increased 12%. Compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019, Snacks organic net sales grew 3%. 
Operating earnings for Snacks decreased 29% for the quarter driven by a lower gross margin and sales volume declines, partially offset by lower marketing and selling expenses and lower administrative expenses. The lower gross margin resulted from higher cost inflation and other supply chain costs, reduced operating leverage and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by the benefits of supply chain productivity improvements. Overall, within our Snacks division, the operating margin decreased year-over-year by 350 basis points to 11.5%.  
I'll now turn to our cash flow and liquidity. Fiscal year-to-date cash flow from operations decreased from $1.1 billion in the prior year to $881 million primarily due to changes in working capital, principally from lower accrued liabilities and lapping significant benefits in accounts payable in the prior year. 
Our year-to-date cash for investing activities were largely reflective of the cash outlay for capital expenditures of $190 million, which was $30 million lower than the prior year primarily driven by discontinued operations.  
Our year-to-date cash outflows for financing activities were $1.4 billion, reflecting cash outlays due to dividends paid of $327 million. Additionally, we reduced our debt by $1 billion. 
We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $209 million. 
As you saw in our press release, given the continued strong cash flow generation and progress regarding the reduction of our leverage, in addition to the increase of our dividend announced in December, the Board of Directors authorized a new anti-dilutive share repurchase program of up to $250 million to offset the impact of dilution from shares issued under our stock compensation programs. The company's March 2017 strategic share repurchase program remains suspended. 
Turning to Slide 22. As covered in our press release, we are updating guidance to reflect our third quarter results and the impact of the sale of the Plum baby food and snacks business, which was completed on May 3, 2021. 
In the fourth quarter, we expect more pronounced inflationary pressures to negatively impact margins while pricing actions take hold in the beginning of fiscal 2022. In addition, although we expect to make progress on the transition into the post-COVID-19 environment, it will remain a headwind from a margin perspective.  
While we expect gross margin headwinds to persist through the fourth quarter, we expect a sequential improvement of our EBIT margin relative to prior year due to easier comparables, improved execution and normalizing marketing investments. 
We expect net sales for fiscal 2021 to decline 3.5% to 3%. Excluding the impact from the 53rd week in fiscal 2020 and the impact of the European Chips and Plum divestitures, we expect organic net sales to decline 1.2% and to minus 0.7%.  
To put our fiscal 2021 organic net sales guidance into perspective, at the midpoint of our guidance range, we expect fiscal 2021 to be 6% above fiscal 2019. We expect adjusted EBIT of minus 5% to minus 4%. We expect net interest expense of $210 million to $215 million and an adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 24%. 
As a result, we expect adjusted EPS of $2.90 to $2.93 per share, representing a year-over-year decline of minus 2% to minus 1% to the prior year. The EPS impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2020 was estimated to be $0.04 per share. To put our fiscal 2021 EPS guidance into perspective, at the midpoint of our guidance range, we expect fiscal 2021 to be in line with fiscal 2020 considering the impact of the 53rd week and 27% above fiscal 2019 adjusted EPS. 
Regarding capital expenditures, we now expect to spend approximately $300 million for the full year, which is below previous expectations driven by the impact from COVID-19 on the operating environment.  
In closing, I want to reiterate Mark's conviction in the long-term performance of Campbell. We are working diligently to deliver the results we know we are capable of delivering. And I remain optimistic about our strategy, our team and the underlying strength of our brands. 
And with that, let me turn it back to Mark."

And then maybe more important, it sounds like you have comfort that these issues are addressable and largely not structural. And so it's obviously early to be talking with any specificity about fiscal '22, but some of these challenges I think you mentioned are likely to persist a bit and be margin headwinds next year.  
So I'm trying to get a sense of between the combination of pricing, productivity, some of the actions that you're taking in the Snacks segment and such, I mean, do you anticipate you'll have sort of -- and obviously elevated sales potentially as well, do you anticipate you'll have the firepower, so to speak, to at least help address or mitigate some of those costs to sort of protect profitability in a better way in '22?

Let me start with Q4 and then, obviously, we'll stop short of kind of giving a lot of detail on '22. But I'll give you a perspective on kind of how we see that and how we thought about the variables that we talked about for this quarter affecting the business going forward. 
But first on Q4, I do -- again, I'm always -- in the current environment we're in, certainly we've had a couple -- tough to predict a couple of the variables we've seen. But I do feel good that what we experienced in Q3 and how that translates into Q4, we've done a very good job of connecting those dots. And I do think you'll see sequential improvement for a variety of reasons. 
First, I think we're not going to have the winter storm. And just as a perspective, closing the Paris facility for 2 weeks in Texas, that ended up being right around the $10 million additional headwind in Q3 that we obviously have not anticipated as part of the reason that we were off our expectations. So clearly, we're not going to have that circumstance as we go into Q4. 
I think the second thing is the comparable numbers in Q4 are just an easier comp, right? So you've got higher COVID costs in Q4 a year ago. You also have the opportunity to, as we've said all along in the back half, that we'd moderate marketing spending to kind of equate to the percent of net sales. And so that will give us a bit of a tailwind as well in the fourth quarter. 
And as I talked about some of the transformational kind of execution issues on Snacks, and again, just as a little bit of deeper perspective on that, in the third quarter, it was really -- I've been very proud of that team and done an amazing job through the integration from my perspective. I do think in the third quarter, the accumulation of initiatives, we cut over to SAP, we closed our Columbus, Georgia facility, we had 3 major capacity expansion projects going on in the backstop of COVID. And not in a way of an excuse, but certainly I think that put some added pressure on an already tough quarter for us as it related to Snacks. 
But as we look forward, we've added the right resources, we've staged this the right way. We're through some of that work, and so we expect that executional headwind that we saw in the third quarter to really kind of be behind us as we go through the fourth quarter. So that's really the reason why we see the sequential improvement. 
And even on operating leverage and some of the things that were a bit bigger in nature in third quarter, I think for that, that carries over. We've got good estimates now. So we can kind of see how that operation works. We're now running all of the SKUs that we had simplified a year ago. I think that was a little bit of the dynamic as we added those back, introduced a little bit of new complexity back into the supply chain, continuing to push hard through some of the labor challenges that we've had. 
So I think you'll see that mitigate but still be present. And so I think when you think about '22, obviously the things I just described executionally, I think, will be behind us. 
As far as inflation goes, we feel very good about the progress we're making on pricing. The conversations that we're having with customers are very constructive. I'm really grateful that we've had this time to really build equity. I mean this is probably the healthiest the portfolio has ever been going into that conversation, so that's a good thing. 
I would be remiss not to say, though, that inflation is a little bit of a moving target right now. And so although I feel great about what we're doing, I think I kind of want to wait for the next quarter to see kind of where we're landing on a couple of the variables and a couple of the commodities. 
And then as it relates to kind of this transitional headwind, I think it's a little bit of a mixed bag. Obviously, we're going to be working hard to address those areas, but we will cycle through the COVID environment at least into the first half of next year. 
So we'll give you a lot more granularity on it, but I think it's a very balanced position. Certainly, I think Q3 very much is the outlier, but I do think some of these variables will continue. But we've got very good plans against them. So hopefully, that helps to put it into a little bit of context."

That is the kind of cycling of a network  that's fully loaded and [ that ] leverage from year-to-year. 
The second piece, I think, that we saw transitionally in Q3, and again, I think these become more mitigated cost going forward, but we have really continued to see labor as a bigger challenge than I think we had expected it to be. And of course, that has a bit of a knock-on effect that as that labor has not enabled us to kind of meet the full targets on production, we've had to go to some higher-cost co-mans that we consciously invested in to make sure that supply and inventory was where we needed it. 
But those 3 variables of kind of leverage, labor and the external investment in co-manufacturers are what we're describing as that transitional bucket. And so I do think the lapping will continue. But the other two, we're going to get better and manage through that as we go into next year. Does that help, Andrew?"

But I would just say that as we've all been watching this, there have been ups and downs. And so we continue to try to calibrate it. And as we kind of went forward with our pricing actions that'll be in place the first quarter -- as we start the first quarter of fiscal '22, I feel very good about how that was informed and kind of how we saw the environment. 
But I think kind of the name of the game for '22 is going to be to remain pretty agile and nimble.

One of the other aspects in inflation is obviously freight costs, and we've seen that increase kind of from a year-over-year perspective to continue in Q3. We obviously saw already some of that in Q2. And although we're anticipating that we might see a little bit of relief there, we continue to see freight currently at an elevated level."

So we're going to be thoughtful about it, but it also enables us, I think, to model, if you will. Based on historical elasticity, we're able to model a pretty good understanding of where those key thresholds are. We understand kind of how to balance this. What do you do in list price versus what you do in trade. Obviously, there's a full range of leverage that we're going to be using across revenue management to get that right.

I think what you sense from us is a little bit of caution because of the volatility that we're watching on commodities.

I know what everyone is trying to get at, which is, do you feel like you can fully cover inflation next year with the tools you've got? I can tell you we feel good, but we're going to have to really watch what happens over these next couple of months to kind of solidify our position. 
As far as magnitude of pricing, as you might imagine, it's a little bit of a -- depending on which business it is, where the commodities are impacting it more. We've been very clear and transparent on kind of the translation of inflation to where that pricing resides. Obviously, as I said before, we're also overlaying a very detailed kind of strategic lens to it to make sure that we're not doing anything that we're going to regret as far as the health of the business.

Well, I think a couple of things. One is, as Chris, as you'll remember, in the fourth quarter last year, we really invested into the opportunity that we had given the elevated demand and profitability that we were experiencing, and we did that for a variety of reasons, one of which was to solidify the equity of the businesses, continue to really work on building equity with those households, especially younger households. 
We also learned a lot during that time. So we used it as a bit of an opportunity to really fine-tune where the best ROIs were. And as an example, you would have seen in the third quarter our digital spend went up almost 20 points. We're now over 60% of our spend is in digital, which I love for a variety of different reasons, but one of which is that it's a very high ROI and a very efficient spend. 
And so although I do think there are some key thresholds that we want to manage to, and as we've said, kind of the percent of net sales is a good proxy, when I look at that relative to where we've been, I feel like that's a good level. And we've been able to kind of manage to that through the last couple of quarters, into this quarter.

One is, Mark, I thought that I heard you last quarter talk about kind of a broader or more extensive rollout of the transformation plan in Snacks and capturing more savings and more actions to do it. Regarding what happened in this quarter, does that change at all what you're planning to do there? Or do you need to rethink how you go about it at all? 
And then secondly, on steel costs, maybe I'm unfamiliar with how your contracts work with your suppliers, but I thought that they tend to lock in a price pretty early like in midyear and then you go forward with that price for the fiscal year -- for your fiscal year. Is it just that it's not possible to lock in a price right now because the underlying commodity is jumping around so much? Or has something changed regarding the normal timing for locking in your steel costs?"

We are a bit behind, as you would expect, given the headwinds I just described for Q3 and Q4 on an absolute basis. But the underlying initiatives, the value capture, all of the foundational work that although may have created some strain on us in the quarter as far as execution and cost overall, as we normalize that over the -- really the months ahead, I expect us to be back on that trajectory. And again, I think as we said before, we'll kind of lay that out with a lot more granularity in Investor Day, but it doesn't change in any way structurally what I think we should be capable of doing.

I think you're right about labor and logistics. But the need for us to kind of invest in the supplement of co-manufacturers to kind of recover on supply, honestly that feels like kind of a unique item to us that was very much a kind of headwind that we'll navigate through. I expect that to be better in Q4 and obviously much better as we go forward. 
I think on the operating leverage, a little bit of it was us needing to understand exactly how much benefit we had gained a year ago when we were at our peak, how much the value of the simplicity of the portfolio versus adding those TDPs back in place we're going to take. And so I think what I would tell you is we've now calibrated that. 
I do think it will remain throughout the cycle of COVID-19, but some of these other elements, ones that are capable of being priced and the others that are more kind of unique to us, I think we'll work through those. We've got good plans in place, and I do see those, as we described them, transitional in nature. And I think on balance, we'll be able to address a great deal of those and just kind of be dealing with the leverage lap as we go into '22. Mick, anything?"

And I know -- what you're kind of noting here is that '22 or part of it feels like also sort of an exit transition period out of COVID that might hamper profitability. 
But big picture, we would think that you should be bridging to much significantly higher gross profit dollars versus pre-COVID particularly with the multiyear stacked organic revenue growth that you will have had from trial and repeat coming out of COVID. So I do wonder about some of the offsets that you're thinking about internally, the reinvestments that you've made and other friction costs that would offset those theoretical step-ups."

And I do think there's a couple of different important variables within that dialogue that we will spend time talking about when we're in our Investor Day. Obviously, one of those pieces is kind of bridging for folks the Snacks margin that we already talked about, how did the value capture work, where were the investments versus the upside, how are you -- how did the headwinds we're experiencing on inflation affect that. 
But maybe this is a way to kind of give you a little bit of context. And Mick had mentioned this earlier, but I think it's a really important aspect. And obviously, we are disappointed with the quarter. I mean our standard is that we do what we say and, in this particular quarter, we didn't do that. But I continue to see the challenges that were in the quarter as being very transitional in nature, and the underpinning of the great in-market results and being ahead of expectations as it relates to share and the retention of these households all bode well for us for the future. 
And maybe to give a little context to your question, specifically, if you take the midpoint of our '21 guidance -- and again I'm going to repeat a little bit of what Mick said, but I think it's important. At the midpoint of our guidance, it represents, versus that 2019 base, a top line growth of 6%. So a CAGR of about 3%. Obviously, we know that there's some foodservice in there and a little bit of partner brands. But in general, a 6% versus '19. Our EBIT during that same period with the midpoint of the range, so even with the adjustment in our guidance, is up 9% versus 2019 or at about a 5% CAGR for the 2 years. And as Mick had said earlier, EPS is up 27% since '19 with consumption up 9% during the same period. 
So if you look at that, all of those -- and again, I think people would expect this, but all of those are well above or well within our strategic plan targets. And I think that as we navigate into '22, we would expect to see, yes, some challenges as we continue to lap a few of these areas. I do want to kind of nail down a good number for inflation next year, but I feel very good about where we are on the journey. I don't love the quarter, but I love the progress that we're making and, in particular, what I think will be longest lasting, which is the strength of the brands and the businesses. 
So I don't know if that helps with perspective. I know what you're looking for, for '22, and we will do a good job of providing you that bridge when we get together at the end of the year. But I think not a bad perspective to kind of close out a little bit of the discussion with."

Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. In fiscal 2021, the pandemic continued to present challenges across North America, but I am so proud of how our teams, particularly our frontline and supply chain teams, adapted and rallied to keep each other safe and meet the sustained demand for our products. On behalf of the entire Campbell's leadership team, I am deeply grateful for their dedication, and we continue to make their safety and well-being paramount as they work to meet the needs of our customers, consumers and our communities. 
As difficult and complex as this time has been, it has also been an extraordinary period for Campbell, and we've made clear, meaningful progress advancing our strategic plan. We've evolved into a different company, one that is stronger, more agile and with growing, more relevant brands that are better positioned for the future. 
For the full year, I'm pleased to report that Campbell's organic net sales were comparable to fiscal 2020 and grew 3% on a 2-year compounded annual growth basis, driven by both divisions reflecting strong in-market performance. In fact, 3/4 of our portfolio grew or held market share for the year, reflecting our continued momentum. Adjusted EBIT lagged fiscal 2020 as we lapped dramatic scale and efficiency from a year ago, and navigated a much higher inflationary environment this year. However, on a 2-year CAGR, adjusted EBIT grew 5% and adjusted EPS grew 14% as we delevered and improved our balance sheet. 
Turning to Slide 7, full year organic net sales were comparable to prior year, which included a positive fourth quarter finish to fiscal 2021 in light of last year's remarkably strong performance. If you recall, our first half fiscal 2021 was driven by strong elevated in-market performance as we continued to gain share and made steady progress on supply to restore the shelf. The third quarter reflected the challenging comparisons to the prior year as we cycled the demand surge that accompanied the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and navigated several headwinds, including increased inflation and executional pressures in our Snacks division. 
In the fourth quarter, we delivered solid results ahead of our expectations across all 3 key metrics: net sales, adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS and address the executional pressures we experienced last quarter. Organic net sales declined 4% as we lapped 12% growth in the prior year and delivered 4% growth on a 2-year CAGR basis. Our fourth quarter performance accelerated relative to third quarter driven by strong in-market results, particularly in U.S. Soup and Goldfish and the continued recovery of our Foodservice business. 
In Snacks, we delivered sequential operating margin improvement of 270 basis points versus the third quarter despite the continued industry-wide supply chain challenges. 
An important barometer of the health of our brand portfolio is our in-market performance. For the full year, 75% of our brands grew or held share versus the prior year, and the majority of our brands in our 13 core categories grew ahead of pre-COVID levels. To note, repeat rates on our brands in all core categories are ahead on a 2-year basis. Total company in-market consumption was minus 1% compared to fiscal 2020 on a 52-week basis. Importantly, compared to the fiscal 2019 period, consumption grew 10%, driven equally by strength in both our Meals and Beverages and Snacks divisions as we continue to make material advances in attracting and retaining consumers, especially the critical millennial cohort. 
Turning to our division performance on Slide 9, let me begin with Meals & Beverages. Our fourth quarter organic net sales decline of 9% and in-market performance of minus 2% reflects cycling the partial inventory recovery and elevated consumption levels in the prior year quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we continued to grow share in Swanson broth, condensed soup, Prego ready-to-serve soup and Pacific Foods. On a 2-year basis, we delivered strong consumption growth of 13% against organic net sales growth of 10%, narrowing the gap as our Foodservice business continued to stabilize. 
On U.S. Soup, we delivered another quarter of record share growth of nearly 2 points, with gains in all segments. This included gains from Swanson broth, condensed soup, Well Yes, and Slow Kettle driven by the continued recovery in our total points of distribution or TPDs. Our share of TPDs grew for the fourth consecutive quarter this year. U.S. Soup 2-year dollar sales growth of 16% in the fourth quarter exceeded the growth in total shelfs-table meals and was just slightly behind total edible growth in that same time period. Household penetration and repeat rates remain elevated compared to pre-COVID levels. 
Condensed Soup increased dollar share for the tenth consecutive quarter, with the largest driver of share growth coming from condensed eating varieties as we nearly restored the full range of offerings to the shelf. As our ability to supply improved, we were also pleased to see household gains and ready-to-serve versus the prior year as a result of the shelf recovery and favorable at-home consumption behaviors, particularly for lunch occasions. 
Ready-to-serve end market consumption grew an impressive 21% on a 2-year basis, led by Chunky, Slow Kettle and the successful relaunch of Well Yes!. 
Pacific Foods continues to strengthen its position as the #1 organic soup brand, with the fourth quarter marking 7 straight quarters of share gains in measured channels. We expanded distribution and have recovered the majority of our supply while bringing in more millennials to the category than any other soup or broth brand. 
On Swanson Broth, we increased our share by 3.7 points, our highest quarter of share growth in over 3 years, driven by our investment in supply recovery. This is important as it demonstrates the strength of the brand as we recovered lost share to lower-priced players as our supply improved. 
Prego delivered its best year of dollar share gains in 4 years and maintained the #1 share position for 27 consecutive months. The brand grew in market consumption on a 2-year basis and delivered 5% growth over the prior year. Household penetration was elevated versus fiscal 2019 in every quarter and grew 1 point in the fourth quarter. 
Overall, the Meals & Beverages division delivered strong end market performance against a difficult comparisons to the prior year and achieved share gains in key categories, particularly with millennials. 
On Slide 11, we are excited to share with you a glimpse into our Meals and Beverages innovation plans for fiscal 2022. Our new items focus on new occasions and relevant wellness trends. Expanding on the relaunch of our better-for-you Well Yes! brand is the launch of Well Yes! Power Bowls with 5 unique varieties for both lunch and snack occasions. We have also expanded our successful Slow Kettle Crunch innovation with 4 varieties of Campbell's Red & White Crunch, including our iconic Classic Tomato Soup with Goldfish toppings. On our Pacific Foods business, we're launching additional plant-based products, including creamy oat milk soups and creamy plant-based protein broths. Finally, if you haven't tried the new Chunky Spicy Chicken Noodle, it's fantastic, and brings variety to the critical at-home lunch occasion. 
In addition to our relevant and consumer-driven innovation, another element of our win in soup strategy is a refresh of our Campbell's Condensed Soup. We are contemporizing the brand to better match our growing millennial consumer base while improving the product and its shopability as we continue to support our positioning as a starting point for delicious meals. We also have continued our journey of simplifying our ingredient lines and improving quality. It's always tricky when looking to evolve such an iconic design and product, but our new graphics and improved ingredient lines strike the right balance and have been met with a very positive customer and consumer response. 
Let's now turn to snacks. This quarter was the second highest 13-week quarter of net sales for the Snacks division since the Snyder's-Lance acquisition. Organic net sales grew 1% over the prior year quarter and 7% on a 2-year basis. In-market performance declined only 1% year-over-year but grew 11% on a 2-year basis. 
Turning to our Snacks power brands, which continue to fuel performance with in-market consumption growth of 2% this fiscal year and 15% on a 2-year basis driven by double-digit consumption growth in the majority of our brands. Compared to the prior year, we grew share on many of our power brands, most notably, Cape Cod Potato Chips, Snack Factory Pretzel Crisps, Goldfish Crackers and Late July snacks. Compared to pre-COVID levels, household penetration remains elevated and repeat rates are higher on all power brands. 
Turning to Goldfish, we delivered sustained share growth, increasing for a second quarter in a row by more than 1 point compared to this time last year. On a 1- and 2-year basis, Goldfish delivered strong results, including double-digit consumption growth, increased household penetration and higher repeat rates. This solid performance on Goldfish was due in part to the successful launch of Limited Edition Goldfish Frank's RedHot crackers, Additionally, the reinstatement of promotions, improved performance on multi bags and an effective marketing campaign contributed to our strong results. We are excited to continue to introduce on-trend limited editions on Goldfish with the launch this week of Goldfish Jalapeno Popper and plans for additional innovation later this fiscal year. 
Entering the fourth quarter amid rising inflation, labor shortages and some executional pressures, we better focused our agenda in the Snacks division, driving operational excellence and allocating additional resources throughout the supply chain network. We are very pleased with the speed and progress we have made to address the executional pressures we experienced in the third quarter. We head into fiscal 2022 with a stronger foundation and confidence we can continue our significant transformation on this important business. 
On Slide 17, we do expect a challenging environment in fiscal 2022 as COVID persists and inflation and labor availability remain highly volatile. However, we also anticipate our effective pricing actions, supply chain productivity programs and cost savings initiatives to be significant offsets resulting in an improvement in the second half of the fiscal year relative to the prior year, and exiting fiscal 2022 with momentum as we continue to make progress on our strategic plan. Mick will provide more details on our fiscal 2022 outlook and assumptions in a moment. 
With that, let me turn it over to Mick to discuss our fourth quarter and full year results in more detail."

Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 19. For the fourth quarter, organic net sales, which excludes the impact from the additional week and the impact of the sale of the Plum baby food and snacks business declined 4% as we cycled both the elevated demand in food purchases for at-home consumption and a partial retailer inventory recovery in the prior year. Compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, which we view to be more meaningful given the COVID-19 impact to the prior year, organic net sales increased 4% on a 2-year CAGR. 
Adjusted EBIT decreased 13% compared to prior year to $267 million, driven by lower sales volume, including the impact of the additional week in the prior year quarter, and lower adjusted gross margin, partially offset by lower adjusted marketing and selling expenses and lower adjusted administrative expenses. Our adjusted EBIT margin was 14.3% and compared to 14.6% in the prior year. 
Adjusted EPS from continuing operations decreased $0.08 or 13% for this prior year to $0.55 per share, partially driven by the estimated $0.04 contribution from the additional week in fiscal 2020.

Compared to prior year, Meals & Beverages organic net sales decreased 1%, driven by declines in Foodservice, partially offset by growth in V8 beverages. In Snacks, organic net sales were flat as gains in our salty snacks portfolio, including Late July and Snack Factory Pretzel Crisps and in Goldfish Crackers were offset by declines in Lance sandwich crackers and imported brands within the Snyder's-Lance portfolio. 
Full year adjusted EBIT decreased 3% versus the prior year to $1.4 billion. The decline reflected the lower adjusted gross margin and lower sales volume, including the impact of prior year's additional week, partially offset by lower adjusted marketing and selling expenses and higher adjusted other income. Our marketing and selling expenses represented 9.6% of net sales compared to 10.9% last year. 
Full year 2021 adjusted EBIT margin was 16.6% compared to 16.7% in the prior year. Full year adjusted EPS from continuing operations increased 1% to $2.98 per share. 
On the next slide, I'll break down our net sales performance for the fourth quarter. Organic net sales decreased 4% during the quarter lapping an increase of 12% in the prior year quarter when the demand for at-home consumption remained elevated and retailers partially recovered on the inventory. The organic net sales decline was driven by a 5-point headwind due to volume declines, partially offset by favorable price and sales allowances and lower promotional spending which each drove a 1 point gain in the quarter. The impact of 1 last week in the quarter subtracted 7 points, and the recent sale of Plum subtracted 1 point. All in, our reported net sales declined 11% from the prior year, stronger than anticipated as in-market demand remained elevated. 
Turning to Slide 22, our fourth quarter adjusted gross margin decreased by 420 basis points from 35.6% last year to 31.4% this year which was generally consistent with our expectations. Mix, an operating leverage and a negative impact of approximately 70 basis points and 40 basis points, respectively, on gross margin as we continue to transition from last year's elevated demand. Net pricing drove 100 basis points improvement due to lower levels of promotional spending in the quarter, as well as favorable price and sales allowances which do not yet reflect the price increases effective first quarter of fiscal 2022. 
Inflation and other factors had a negative impact of 640 basis points, with slightly more than half of the decline driven by cost inflation as overall input prices on a rate basis increased by approximately 5%. The remaining impact was driven by higher other supply chain costs, largely due to last year's manufacturing cost efficiencies related to higher production levels to service the elevated demand, as well as lower mark-to-market gain on outstanding commodity hedges, partially offset by lower COVID-19 related costs. 
Our ongoing supply chain productivity program contributed 150 basis points to gross margin, partially offsetting these inflationary headwinds. Our cost savings program which is incremental to our ongoing supply chain productivity program, added 80 basis points to our gross margin. 
Moving on to other operating items, adjusted marketing and selling expenses decreased $91 million or 34% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. This decrease was driven by lower advertising and consumer promotion expense, lower selling expenses and lower marketing overhead costs. A&C declined 52%, reflecting our elevated, pandemic-driven level of investment in the prior year to attract and retain new households. However, A&C was comparable to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Overall, our adjusted marketing and selling expenses represented 9.3% of net sales during the quarter, a 330 basis point decrease compared to last year. 
Adjusted administrative expenses decreased $30 million or 18%, with approximately 1/2 of the decrease driven by the estimated impact of the additional week in the prior year quarter. The balance of the decrease reflected lower general and administrative costs, higher charitable contributions in the prior year and benefits associated with our cost savings initiatives, partially offset by higher IT costs. 
Adjusted administrative expenses represented 7.4% of net sales during the quarter, a 60 basis point decrease compared to last year. 
Moving to the next slide, we have continued to successfully deliver against our multiyear enterprise cost savings initiatives. This quarter, we achieved $25 million in incremental year-over-year savings, which came in ahead of our expectations, resulting in a full year savings of $80 million with the majority of the savings from the Snyder's-Lance integration. We remain on track to deliver our cumulative savings target of $850 million by the end of fiscal 2022. 
On Slide 25, we are providing a total company adjusted EBIT bridge to summarize the key drivers of performance this quarter. As previously mentioned, adjusted EBIT declined by 13% as the net sales decline, including the impact of the additional week in the prior year quarter and the 420 basis point gross margin contraction, resulted in an $84 million and $77 million headwind, respectively. Partially offsetting this was lower adjusted marketing and selling expenses, contributing 330 basis points to adjusted EBIT margin and lower adjusted administrative and R&D expenses contributing 50 basis points. The estimated impact to EBIT from the additional week in fiscal 2020 was $22 million. Overall, our adjusted EBIT margin decreased year-over-year by only 30 basis points to 14.3%. 
The following chart breaks down our adjusted EPS change between our operating performance and below the line items, a $0.10 impact of lower adjusted EBIT and a $0.01 impact of higher adjusted taxes, partially offset by a $0.03 favorable impact from lower interest expense resulted in better-than-expected adjusted EPS of $0.55 down $0.08 from $0.63 per share in the prior year, of which an estimated $0.04 was driven by the additional week in fiscal 2020. 
In Meals & Beverages, declines across U.S. retail products, including U.S. Soup, Prego pasta sauces and Pace Mexican sauces led to a 9% decrease in fourth quarter organic net sales compared to the prior year. The decline was driven by volume decreases in U.S. Retail due to last year's partial retail inventory recovery and increased demand of food purchases for at-home consumption in the prior year quarter. However, versus the comparable period in fiscal 2019, organic net sales increased 10%. 
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, sales of U.S. Soups decreased 21%, 7 points of which were driven by the additional week in the prior year, while at the same time, cycling a 52% increase in the prior year quarter. Operating earnings for Meals & Beverages decreased 30% to $129 million. The decrease was primarily due to sales volume declines, including the additional week and a lower gross margin, partially offset by lower marketing and selling expenses as well as lower administrative expenses. The lower gross margin resulted from higher other supply chain costs, net of lower COVID-19-related costs, higher cost inflation, including higher freight costs and ingredient and packaging inflation; and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by the benefits of supply chain productivity improvements. 
Overall, within our Minerals & Beverage division, fourth quarter operating margin decreased year-over-year by 290 basis points to 15.2%. 
Within Snacks, organic net sales increased 1% to $1 billion, driven by volume gains in Goldfish crackers and our Salty Snacks portfolio, including Snack Factory Pretzel Crisps, Snyder's of Hanover pretzels and Cape Cod potato chips, partially offset by declines in partner brands and fresh bakery. Favorable price and sales allowances and lower promotional spending also contributed to sales growth. Compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, Snacks organic net sales grew 7%. 
Operating earnings for Snacks increased 7% for the quarter, driven by lower marketing and selling expenses, partially offset by sales volume declines, including the impact of the additional week and a lower gross margin. The lower gross margin resulted from higher cost inflation and other supply chain costs, net of lower COVID-19 related costs. Partially offset by the benefit of cost savings initiatives, supply chain productivity improvement, favorable price and sales allowances and lower promotional spending. 
Overall, within our Snacks division, fourth quarter operating margin increased year-over-year by 170 basis points to 14.2%. 
I'll now turn to cash flow and liquidity. Fiscal 2021 cash flow from operations decreased from $1.4 billion in the prior year to $1 billion, primarily due to changes in working capital, mostly from a significant increase in accounts payable in the prior year and lower accrued liabilities in the current year. Our year-to-date cash for investing activities was reflective of the cash outlay for capital expenditures of $275 million, which was slightly lower than the prior year driven by discontinued operations and the net proceeds from the sale of Plum. Our year-to-date cash outflows for financing activities were $1.7 billion, reflecting cash outlays due to dividends paid of $439 million as we continue to focus on delivering meaningful return of cash to our shareholders. Additionally, we reduced our debt by $1.2 billion. 
We ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $69 million. In June, the Board authorized a $250 million anti-dilutive share repurchase program to offset the impact of dilution from shares issued under our stock compensation programs. As you saw in today's press release, we reinstituted our strategic share repurchase program, with a $500 million program replacing the suspended $1.5 billion program which has been canceled. The company expects to fund the repurchases out of its existing cash flow generation. 
Turning to Slide 30, as covered in our press release, we're providing guidance for full year fiscal 2022. We expect continued uncertainty around the duration and effects of the pandemic on industry-wide supply chain networks, resulting in accelerating inflationary pressures and a constrained labor market. We expect to partially mitigate these headwinds with well-executed pricing and plant productivity initiatives as well as our cost savings program. First half margins, particularly in the first quarter, will continue to be impacted by transitional headwinds cycling prior year's elevated sales and scale efficiencies with comparisons easing in the second half of the fiscal year. We expect organic net sales to be minus 1% to plus 1%, adjusted EBIT of minus 8% to minus 5% and adjusted EPS of minus 8% to minus 4% versus the fiscal 2021 results. 
Fiscal 2021 results include a 12 [indiscernible] benefit from mark-to-market gains on outstanding commodity hedges, and an approximate $0.02 adjusted EPS contribution from Plum. For additional context on mark-to-market, please refer to today's Form 8-K. 
Importantly, when considering these items, the upper end of our fiscal 2022 adjusted EPS range is in line with fiscal 2021 performance. 
As you see on Slide 31, we expect core inflation for the year to be high single digits with a more pronounced impact in the second half of fiscal 2022, which we plan to address with price increases and trade optimization, supply chain productivity improvements and cost savings initiatives, and a continued focus on discretionary spending across the organization. 
Moving to additional assumptions, we expect ongoing supply chain productivity gains of approximately 2% to 3% for the year, excluding the benefit of our cost savings program. As previously mentioned, we expect continued progress on our cost savings program and expect to deliver an incremental $45 million in fiscal 2022, keeping us on track to deliver $850 million by the end of the fiscal year. Additionally, we expect net interest expense of $190 million to $195 million, and an adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 24%, which is largely in line with fiscal 2021. While cognizant of our current operating environment, we expect to continue to invest in the business, targeting capital expenditures of approximately $330 million, which includes carryover projects from fiscal 2021. Additionally, we expect the net of adjusted administrative expenses and adjusted other income to increase as a percentage of net sales, reflecting the planned information technology investments and related costs, and the cycling of lower administrative items in the prior year. All in, we expect year-over-year operating margin improvement in the second half of the year. 
Overall, as Mark said, we had a positive finish to the year. We are truly grateful to our teams and for their continued dedication and commitment as we head into fiscal 2022. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Mark."

That's a full question. So let me try to piece out a couple of different elements in there. First, why don't we talk a little bit about the kind of the basis of the assumptions for our guidance and how we're thinking about",1033,"Sure, yes. So thanks, Andrew. That's a full question. So let me try to piece out a couple of different elements in there. 
First, why don't we talk a little bit about the kind of the basis of the assumptions for our guidance and how we're thinking about it. So first, let's talk a little bit about top line. I think part of the composition of the year is going to be a little bit of a tale of 2 halfs because I do foresee a first half that's going to feel a little bit more like what we've been experiencing in the fourth quarter, while seeing sequential improvement as pricing comes into play, which is obviously a significant contributor as we go forward. And then in the back half, even though we do expect really driven on the back of the packaging, inflation as it relates to steel, in particular, as our contract terms on the calendar year, but even with that in mind, we're expecting improvement in the back half and overall momentum as we exit the year. 
So I think when you think about top line next year, I do think that we see terrific momentum on our business today. We accelerated that momentum in Q4, we expect to continue to see positive in-market performance as we move forward. We are going to lap a pretty significant inventory replenishment that occurred primarily in the first quarter, but through into the second quarter. But I think the underlying health of the business, we expect to continue to be positive. And of course, sadly, with COVID resurgence, I think some of the consumer dynamics that supported demand is likely going to be with us for a while longer. 
I also continue to be very encouraged by the retention of households and really the sustainment of repeat levels that's very broad-based across our portfolio. Obviously, soup is one that we're watching very closely. And again, I don't think we've ever had or at least not in recent history, a sustained period of progress so broadly across that part of our business. And with what we're bringing relative to innovation and other elements, we're feeling very good about that. 
I do think I'll govern a little bit on this and a recognition of a little bit of then well why is your guidance the way it is, is because we also have to be mindful of what is a very significant pressure on labor that we're experiencing right now. And as I talked about that a little bit in the last quarter, I think we've seen that sustain through the fourth quarter and expect to still be wrestling with that, although I think we're taking some terrific actions and we're seeing some progress in some areas, arguably one of the toughest moments certainly that I've seen as it relates to labor, we're running about 2x our normal vacancy rates. And as a translation into what that means, think about it as around somewhere in the neighborhood of 6% of our positions that are open either vacant or absent, and that is making it tougher to fully meet the demand. So I think you sense or feel a little bit of that balance in our top line projections for the year. 
And I'll say this a couple of times, but if you go top of the range to bottom of the range, it kind of reflects how we do on that -- in that area. And so that's how we've thought about the top line. 
When you get to margin, it's more distinctively a first half, second half discussion, where really primarily in the first half but really more so even in the first quarter as we see pricing come into fruition, of course, inflation now as we kind of leave the covered positions of '21 into '22, we definitely are seeing higher inflation but also feeling very good about the traction we're getting relative to the pricing actions that we put in place. We've got good strong productivity that we think will certainly help mitigate that as well. But certainly, you're going to be in that transitional quarter of pricing coming in with higher inflation. And then as pricing is fully in place, we expect that to stabilize. 
As we did note, as steel prices have gone up significantly, we are expecting a tick up in inflation in the back half, not enough to offset the progress in the other areas and the comparable numbers that we're going to be lapping, but generally, a little bit more mitigation. And that's, although we've got good programs, I think we've got a good plan for it. That's a pretty significant driver as we look through the balance of the year. And then what we've been calling transitional costs, which again, in the fourth quarter were fairly consistent with what we saw in the third quarter, we expect that to be consistent in the first quarter and then begin to mitigate as we move forward from there. 
So I do think as the year unfolds, I feel like we are assuming that as we both lap as well as see some relief in a couple of areas while we get pricing fully in place, I think we have a fairly balanced approach. And not unlike what I was talking about around top line, I think the high end and the low end of the ranges of guidance are a little bit reflective of what variability could occur relative to where we're seeing inflation or coverage of that inflation to give you a sense of kind of how we've thought about the year. And then, of course, as you drop to EPS, a little less difference between where EPS and EBIT is relative to what we see kind of happening below the line. 
So that -- I don't know, from a macro basis, that's kind of the way we're thinking about the pieces. Maybe worth just going back to you to see if you've got any specific element you want to dive into a little bit more. I know this is a big question for the day, though."

And maybe a good way to start with it is to give you a little bit of an explanation on Q4 because I know as you unpack the numbers, and again, I think we foreshadowed this. But it's important to remember",461,"Sure, yes, so let me kind of hit that one head on. And maybe a good way to start with it is to give you a little bit of an explanation on Q4 because I know as you unpack the numbers, and again, I think we foreshadowed this. But it's important to remember that in fourth quarter of '20 we were in a position where we had a significant opportunity to kind of double down and invest in a more significant way, which, by the way, I'm very glad that we did because as I've said before, I think it did 2 things, gave us some momentum as we were solidifying relationships with a lot of new consumers, especially millennials, but it also gave us a great opportunity to learn and figure out kind of what was working, what wasn't working, which helped us really kind of dial in to the most efficient or the highest returning spends. 
As you flip the page to Q4 of '21, you see a significant drop in marketing and selling, but underpinning that, what you have is essentially advertising and marketing that are at about the same level as Q4 '19. And as you've seen our results behind it, and again, arguably always a little bit of a lag, but as you see our results relative to it, I think I feel great about the investment levels overall that we have. 
And as you think about going into next year, I do think you may see a little bit of movement between the quarters. But overall, from a marketing spend, I think we're at a good level. We may have a little bit of incremental investment in a couple of areas as we're adding innovation and working through the balance of the year. But it will be a relatively stable investment year. We're not expecting marketing to be a source of opportunity to offset inflation at all, right? We feel good about the levels we're at, and we want to make sure that we continue to refine the effectiveness of it, but we're committed to spending behind the businesses. I mean I think the last thing in the world we want to do is slow down the momentum that we're seeing in market because it's certainly been, for us, a bit of an unprecedented period of really broad-based market share expansion and growth in key businesses. And so we want to -- we know long term coming out of this thing, that's what's going to matter most. And so we're going to be very guarded on it. Even though I recognize on paper Q4 needs a little bit of context, but relative to how we're thinking about it going forward, we're expecting very stable investment."

And then the second one, just in terms of trying to understand, we get a lot of questions about just how much of that high single-digit inflation expectation is more or less locked in and how much is variable, right? Meaning it could swing up or down depending on conditions. And I guess one of the things that we've been hearing consistently through the month of August, as we've touched base with companies is there's a lot of volatility in freight even if you've got contracts. I mean, it's not even -- the truck doesn't even show up, let alone paying higher for the contract. So it seems like there's just a lot of volatility there. And then anything resin-based, whether it's snack bags, bag liners, resin cups and [indiscernible] probably complicates that a little bit, just given what it's doing to the refining complex.

But we've got an economic forecast that I think is generally consistent with where prices are today. 
You are right. Resin is another area that we've seen some tick-up in costs as well, but I think we've covered that. And again, as we navigate through the balance of the year, I think you should expect us to continue to use the full tool bag to cover that, whether it's some combination of promotion and trade spending, some price pack architecture that we've worked on, as well as the likelihood that there may be some places where we're coming back with a second wave of pricing designed to match very clearly in a very transparent way where we have some of these more explicit costs. 
And I would say, I think that will be much more surgical and specific than the pricing that we already have in place. But I do think as we look at the outlook, we see a mix of those variables in our plan to help us cover that."

But as we said, as we think about some of these transitional costs in the first half, that's partly why we see a little bit more of that headwind in the beginning of the year as we've tried to be prudent in making the appropriate estimate as it relates to where those costs are going to come in based on kind of how we're seeing them today."

But one thing was that you were, I think, being thoughtful, strategic about reflecting critical price thresholds. I think you said the last thing you want is to shut down growth and share. And I think some people came away from that. Was the idea that you want to have some pricing but a little bit of a balanced approach. I'm just curious if your thoughts on that have evolved at all, right? Maybe you've seen elasticity a little bit lower than you expected across food at home, maybe a little bit more inflation. So I'm just trying to get a sense, are you willing to be a little bit more aggressive on pricing, just given some of the changes you've seen in the last few months? Or do you still want to kind of take that balanced approach to things?"

I think the first thing I would say is we definitely have been encouraged by what we're seeing early on as it relates to elasticity. And I think just perhaps the broad-based nature of the inflation is supporting perhaps a little lower than historical levels as it relates to what the elasticities are. I also think that the strength of our brands right now and the momentum relative to businesses, a great example is our Swanson business, which, as we've returned supply into the marketplace, as you might remember, over the last year, or so we lost a lot of share to lower-cost players, which I think for me was going to be an important test for that brand as we came back in the supply. And we've done extremely well on recovering the share that we had surrendered. 
And so I do think perhaps my view of where the boundaries are have expanded. However, I do think there still are some boundaries. And so I think although it's giving us perhaps permission to reflect and continue to do the best job we can in juggling the pressure relative to inflation with wanting to protect the franchises and the brands longer term. I think we've got more room. And I think that although there will be some places where I think we still want to make the right smart trade-off for the long-term health, there's no question that I am feeling more confident in our ability to carry pricing than I might have initially as we were talking in the third quarter."

Again, we talked a little bit earlier about elasticities and a little bit of a growing confidence as it relates to our ability to navigate pricing, perhaps without seeing some of the historical levels that would translate necessarily into the 5%. 
I think you're working a little bit of a couple of different puzzle pieces together. One, we continue to imagine that we'll be investing, we're adding innovation. We are on the flip side, lapping some inventory replenishment that we saw in the beginning of last year. But I think the net of it is we do expect that to be -- to result in a relatively flat year for top line, and that's kind of reflected in our ranges. And again, if we -- remember, in the backdrop of all this too, Rob, is a little bit of the labor situation and how how we are going to be able to meet the level of demand and our ability to navigate that. I think we're a lot smarter, a lot more experienced in that now than we were perhaps 1.5 years ago when the journey began. But at the same time, again, I would say, consistent with many of my peers, the labor challenges that we're seeing are certainly tougher than I ever remember. And I think the combination of those variables is how we're getting to the outlook. 
But I don't think we're leaning out on any of those assumptions. So I think we've been fairly, like I said, pragmatic or balanced in our view. But I think there's going to be puts and takes. And so although I think you may see pressure downward as it relates to pricing, I think there is likely going to continue to be a catalyst for growth and progress as well. Remember, some of our businesses, especially like our snacks businesses, have been pretty steady contributors of growth even through a little bit of the ups and downs as we've been navigating the pandemic. So I think there's going to be a mix of variables, but I think where we've kind of pegged it's probably about right."

But here's what I can tell you: I continue to believe very strongly in the potential for us to improve margins on snacks and for us to continue to close or reduce the gap between where we are today and where we see ourselves relative to kind of snacks margin averages. 
I think as time goes on, we continue to get better clarity and better understanding of the building blocks and the variables that will help us get there. And at the same time, I just would say that as you're looking at the here and now. If you think about kind of where we started the journey to where we find ourselves, there's probably somewhere around 150 basis points of margin that I would call just transitional cost that are dampening some of the productivity and savings that we've been generating over the last several years. Part of it is planned investments. So part of the kind of offsets to the productivity has been -- or the value capture has been planned investments in both the infrastructure and in marketing in some cases. But I think beyond that, we're probably looking at about 150, like I said, basis points that are dampening the baseline. And then as we project forward, I think what you're going to see is a combination of building blocks that will help us build off of that adjusted base. And hopefully, in December, I'll be able to give you greater confidence in what those look like. I know we've been kind of dripping that out for several quarters now, but it will be good to kind of get to the December period. And I think I felt like it was important to kind of keep playing through a little bit of the short-term kind of transitional pressure as we get ready for that conversation. But hopefully, that gives you a little bit of a sense of how we're looking at it and then how we're thinking about the future."

Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. In fiscal 2021, the pandemic continued to present challenges across North America, but I am so proud of how our teams, particularly our frontline and supply chain teams, adapted and rallied to keep each other safe and meet the sustained demand for our products. On behalf of the entire Campbell's leadership team, I am deeply grateful for their dedication, and we continue to make their safety and well-being paramount as they work to meet the needs of our customers, consumers and our communities. 
As difficult and complex as this time has been, it has also been an extraordinary period for Campbell, and we've made clear, meaningful progress advancing our strategic plan. We've evolved into a different company, one that is stronger, more agile and with growing, more relevant brands that are better positioned for the future. 
For the full year, I'm pleased to report that Campbell's organic net sales were comparable to fiscal 2020 and grew 3% on a 2-year compounded annual growth basis, driven by both divisions reflecting strong in-market performance. In fact, 3/4 of our portfolio grew or held market share for the year, reflecting our continued momentum. Adjusted EBIT lagged fiscal 2020 as we lapped dramatic scale and efficiency from a year ago, and navigated a much higher inflationary environment this year. However, on a 2-year CAGR, adjusted EBIT grew 5% and adjusted EPS grew 14% as we delevered and improved our balance sheet. 
Turning to Slide 7, full year organic net sales were comparable to prior year, which included a positive fourth quarter finish to fiscal 2021 in light of last year's remarkably strong performance. If you recall, our first half fiscal 2021 was driven by strong elevated in-market performance as we continued to gain share and made steady progress on supply to restore the shelf. The third quarter reflected the challenging comparisons to the prior year as we cycled the demand surge that accompanied the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and navigated several headwinds, including increased inflation and executional pressures in our Snacks division. 
In the fourth quarter, we delivered solid results ahead of our expectations across all 3 key metrics: net sales, adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS and addressed the executional pressures we experienced last quarter. Organic net sales declined 4% as we lapped 12% growth in the prior year and delivered 4% growth on a 2-year CAGR basis. 
Our fourth quarter performance accelerated relative to third quarter driven by strong in-market results, particularly in U.S. Soup and Goldfish and the continued recovery of our foodservice business. In Snacks, we delivered sequential operating margin improvement of 270 basis points versus the third quarter despite the continued industry-wide supply chain challenges. 
An important barometer of the health of our brand portfolio is our in-market performance. For the full year, 75% of our brands grew or held share versus the prior year, and the majority of our brands in our 13 core categories grew ahead of pre-COVID levels. To note, repeat rates on our brands in all core categories are ahead on a 2-year basis. 
Total company in-market consumption was minus 1% compared to fiscal 2020 on a 52-week basis. Importantly, compared to the fiscal 2019 period, consumption grew 10%, driven equally by strength in both our Meals & Beverages and Snacks divisions as we continue to make material advances in attracting and retaining consumers, especially the critical millennial cohort. 
Turning to our division performance on Slide 9, let me begin with Meals & Beverages. Our fourth quarter organic net sales decline of 9% and in-market performance of minus 2% reflects cycling the partial inventory recovery and elevated consumption levels in the prior year quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we continued to grow share in Swanson broth, condensed soup, Prego ready-to-serve soup and Pacific Foods. On a 2-year basis, we delivered strong consumption growth of 13% against organic net sales growth of 10%, narrowing the gap as our foodservice business continued to stabilize. 
On U.S. Soup, we delivered another quarter of record share growth of nearly 2 points, with gains in all segments. This included gains from Swanson broth, condensed soup, Well Yes!, and Slow Kettle driven by the continued recovery in our total points of distribution or TPDs. Our share of TPDs grew for the fourth consecutive quarter this year. U.S. Soup 2-year dollar sales growth of 16% in the fourth quarter exceeded the growth in total shelf-stable meals and was just slightly behind total edible growth in that same time period. 
Household penetration and repeat rates remain elevated compared to pre-COVID levels. Condensed Soup increased dollar share for the tenth consecutive quarter, with the largest driver of share growth coming from condensed eating varieties as we nearly restored the full range of offerings to the shelf. 
As our ability to supply improved, we were also pleased to see household gains and ready-to-serve versus the prior year as a result of the shelf recovery and favorable at-home consumption behaviors, particularly for lunch occasions. Ready-to-serve end market consumption grew an impressive 21% on a 2-year basis, led by Chunky, Slow Kettle and the successful relaunch of Well Yes!.
Pacific Foods continues to strengthen its position as the #1 organic soup brand, with the fourth quarter marking 7 straight quarters of share gains in measured channels. We expanded distribution and have recovered the majority of our supply while bringing in more millennials to the category than any other soup or broth brand. 
On Swanson broth, we increased our share by 3.7 points, our highest quarter of share growth in over 3 years, driven by our investment in supply recovery. This is important as it demonstrates the strength of the brand as we recovered lost share to lower-priced players as our supply improved. 
Prego delivered its best year of dollar share gains in 4 years and maintained the #1 share position for 27 consecutive months. The brand grew in market consumption on a 2-year basis and delivered 5% growth over the prior year. Household penetration was elevated versus fiscal 2019 in every quarter and grew 1 point in the fourth quarter. Overall, the Meals & Beverages division delivered strong end market performance against a difficult comparisons to the prior year and achieved share gains in key categories, particularly with millennials. 
On Slide 11, we are excited to share with you a glimpse into our Meals & Beverages innovation plans for fiscal 2022. Our new items focus on new occasions and relevant wellness trends. Expanding on the relaunch of our better-for-you Well Yes! brand is the launch of Well Yes! Power Bowls with 5 unique varieties for both lunch and snack occasions. We have also expanded our successful Slow Kettle Crunch innovation with 4 varieties of Campbell's Red & White Crunch, including our iconic Classic Tomato Soup with Goldfish toppings. 
On our Pacific Foods business, we're launching additional plant-based products, including creamy oat milk soups and creamy plant-based protein broths. Finally, if you haven't tried the new Chunky Spicy Chicken Noodle, it's fantastic, and brings variety to the critical at-home lunch occasion.  
In addition to our relevant and consumer-driven innovation, another element of our Win in Soup strategy is a refresh of our Campbell's Condensed Soup. We are contemporizing the brand to better match our growing millennial consumer base while improving the product and its shopability as we continue to support our positioning as a starting point for delicious meals. 
We also have continued our journey of simplifying our ingredient lines and improving quality. It's always tricky when looking to evolve such an iconic design and product, but our new graphics and improved ingredient lines strike the right balance and have been met with a very positive customer and consumer response. 
Let's now turn to Snacks. This quarter was the second highest 13-week quarter of net sales for the Snacks division since the Snyder's-Lance acquisition. Organic net sales grew 1% over the prior year quarter and 7% on a 2-year basis. In-market performance declined only 1% year-over-year but grew 11% on a 2-year basis. 
Turning to our Snacks power brands, which continue to fuel performance with in-market consumption growth of 2% this fiscal year and 15% on a 2-year basis driven by double-digit consumption growth in the majority of our brands. Compared to the prior year, we grew share on many of our power brands, most notably, Cape Cod potato chips, Snack Factory Pretzel Crisps, Goldfish crackers and Late July snacks. Compared to pre-COVID levels, household penetration remains elevated and repeat rates are higher on all power brands. 
Turning to Goldfish, we delivered sustained share growth, increasing for a second quarter in a row by more than 1 point compared to this time last year. On a 1- and 2-year basis, Goldfish delivered strong results, including double-digit consumption growth, increased household penetration and higher repeat rates. This solid performance on Goldfish was due in part to the successful launch of Limited Edition Goldfish Frank's RedHot crackers.
Additionally, the reinstatement of promotions, improved performance on multi packs and an effective marketing campaign contributed to our strong results. We are excited to continue to introduce on-trend limited editions on Goldfish with the launch this week of Goldfish Jalapeño Popper and plans for additional innovation later this fiscal year. 
Entering the fourth quarter amid rising inflation, labor shortages and some executional pressures, we better focused our agenda in the Snacks division, driving operational excellence and allocating additional resources throughout the supply chain network. We are very pleased with the speed and progress we have made to address the executional pressures we experienced in the third quarter. We head into fiscal 2022 with a stronger foundation and confidence we can continue our significant transformation on this important business. 
On Slide 17, we do expect a challenging environment in fiscal 2022 as COVID persists and inflation and labor availability remain highly volatile. However, we also anticipate our effective pricing actions, supply chain productivity programs and cost savings initiatives to be significant offsets, resulting in an improvement in the second half of the fiscal year relative to the prior year, and exiting fiscal 2022 with momentum as we continue to make progress on our strategic plan. Mick will provide more details on our fiscal 2022 outlook and assumptions in a moment. 
With that, let me turn it over to Mick to discuss our fourth quarter and full year results in more detail."

For the fourth quarter, organic net sales, which excludes the impact from the additional week and the impact of the sale of the Plum baby food and snacks business declined 4% as we cycled both the",2254,"Thanks, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 19. For the fourth quarter, organic net sales, which excludes the impact from the additional week and the impact of the sale of the Plum baby food and snacks business declined 4% as we cycled both the elevated demand in food purchases for at-home consumption and a partial retailer inventory recovery in the prior year. Compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, which we view to be more meaningful given the COVID-19 impact to the prior year, organic net sales increased 4% on a 2-year CAGR. 
Adjusted EBIT decreased 13% compared to prior year to $267 million, driven by lower sales volume, including the impact of the additional week in the prior year quarter, and lower adjusted gross margin, partially offset by lower adjusted marketing and selling expenses and lower adjusted administrative expenses. Our adjusted EBIT margin was 14.3% and compared to 14.6% in the prior year. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations decreased $0.08 or 13% for this prior year to $0.55 per share, partially driven by the estimated $0.04 contribution from the additional week in fiscal 2020. 
For the full year, organic net sales, which excludes the impact from the additional week, divestitures and the impact of currency were comparable to the prior year and grew 3% compared to fiscal 2019 on a 2-year CAGR basis. Compared to prior year, Meals & Beverages organic net sales decreased 1%, driven by declines in foodservice, partially offset by growth in V8 beverages. In Snacks, organic net sales were flat as gains in our salty snacks portfolio, including Late July and Snack Factory Pretzel Crisps and in Goldfish Crackers were offset by declines in Lance sandwich crackers and imported brands within the Snyder's-Lance portfolio. 
Full year adjusted EBIT decreased 3% versus the prior year to $1.4 billion. The decline reflected the lower adjusted gross margin and lower sales volume, including the impact of prior year's additional week, partially offset by lower adjusted marketing and selling expenses and higher adjusted other income. Our marketing and selling expenses represented 9.6% of net sales compared to 10.9% last year. Full year 2021 adjusted EBIT margin was 16.6% compared to 16.7% in the prior year. Full year adjusted EPS from continuing operations increased 1% to $2.98 per share. 
On the next slide, I'll break down our net sales performance for the fourth quarter. Organic net sales decreased 4% during the quarter, lapping an increase of 12% in the prior year quarter when the demand for at-home consumption remained elevated and retailers partially recovered on the inventory. The organic net sales decline was driven by a 5-point headwind due to volume declines, partially offset by favorable price and sales allowances and lower promotional spending which each drove a 1-point gain in the quarter. 
The impact of 1 less week in the quarter subtracted 7 points, and the recent sale of Plum subtracted 1 point. All in, our reported net sales declined 11% from the prior year, stronger than anticipated as in-market demand remained elevated. 
Turning to Slide 22, our fourth quarter adjusted gross margin decreased by 420 basis points from 35.6% last year to 31.4% this year, which was generally consistent with our expectations. Mix and operating leverage had a negative impact of approximately 70 basis points and 40 basis points, respectively, on gross margin as we continue to transition from last year's elevated demand. Net pricing drove 100 basis points improvement due to lower levels of promotional spending in the quarter, as well as favorable price and sales allowances which do not yet reflect the price increases effective first quarter of fiscal 2022. 
Inflation and other factors had a negative impact of 640 basis points, with slightly more than half of the decline driven by cost inflation as overall input prices on a rate basis increased by approximately 5%. The remaining impact was driven by higher other supply chain costs, largely due to last year's manufacturing cost efficiencies related to higher production levels to service the elevated demand, as well as lower mark-to-market gain on outstanding commodity hedges, partially offset by lower COVID-19 related costs. 
Our ongoing supply chain productivity program contributed 150 basis points to gross margin, partially offsetting these inflationary headwinds. Our cost savings program, which is incremental to our ongoing supply chain productivity program, added 80 basis points to our gross margin. 
Moving on to other operating items, adjusted marketing and selling expenses decreased $91 million or 34% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. This decrease was driven by lower advertising and consumer promotion expense, lower selling expenses and lower marketing overhead costs. 
A&C declined 52%, reflecting our elevated, pandemic-driven level of investment in the prior year to attract and retain new households. However, A&C was comparable to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Overall, our adjusted marketing and selling expenses represented 9.3% of net sales during the quarter, a 330 basis point decrease compared to last year. 
Adjusted administrative expenses decreased $30 million or 18%, with approximately 1/2 of the decrease driven by the estimated impact of the additional week in the prior year quarter. The balance of the decrease reflected lower general and administrative costs, higher charitable contributions in the prior year and benefits associated with our cost savings initiatives, partially offset by higher IT costs. Adjusted administrative expenses represented 7.4% of net sales during the quarter, a 60 basis point decrease compared to last year. 
Moving to the next slide, we have continued to successfully deliver against our multiyear enterprise cost savings initiatives. This quarter, we achieved $25 million in incremental year-over-year savings, which came in ahead of our of our expectations, resulting in full year savings of $80 million, with the majority of the savings from the Snyder's-Lance integration. We remain on track to deliver our cumulative savings target of $850 million by the end of fiscal 2022. 
On Slide 25, we are providing a total company adjusted EBIT bridge to summarize the key drivers of performance this quarter. As previously mentioned, adjusted EBIT declined by 13% as the net sales decline, including the impact of the additional week in the prior year quarter and the 420-basis point gross margin contraction, resulted in an $84 million and $77 million EBIT headwind, respectively. 
Partially offsetting this was lower adjusted marketing and selling expenses, contributing 330 basis points to adjusted EBIT margin and lower adjusted administrative and R&D expenses contributing 50 basis points. The estimated impact to EBIT from the additional week in fiscal 2020 was $22 million. Overall, our adjusted EBIT margin decreased year-over-year by only 30 basis points to 14.3%. 
The following chart breaks down our adjusted EPS change between our operating performance and below the line items, a $0.10 impact of lower adjusted EBIT and a $0.01 impact of higher adjusted taxes, partially offset by a $0.03 favorable impact from lower interest expense resulted in better-than-expected adjusted EPS of $0.55, down $0.08 from $0.63 per share in the prior year, of which an estimated $0.04 was driven by the additional week in fiscal 2020. 
In Meals & Beverages, declines across U.S. retail products, including U.S. Soup, Prego pasta sauces and Pace Mexican sauces led to a 9% decrease in fourth quarter organic net sales compared to the prior year. The decline was driven by volume decreases in U.S. Retail due to last year's partial retail inventory recovery and increased demand of food purchases for at-home consumption in the prior year quarter. However, versus the comparable period in fiscal 2019, organic net sales increased 10%. 
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, sales of U.S. Soups decreased 21%, 7 points of which were driven by the additional week in the prior year, while at the same time, cycling a 52% increase in the prior year quarter. Operating earnings for Meals & Beverages decreased 30% to $129 million. The decrease was primarily due to sales volume declines, including the additional week and a lower gross margin, partially offset by lower marketing and selling expenses as well as lower administrative expenses. 
The lower gross margin resulted from higher other supply chain costs, net of lower COVID-19-related costs; higher cost inflation, including higher freight costs and ingredient and packaging inflation; and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by the benefits of supply chain productivity improvements. Overall, within our Minerals & Beverage division, fourth quarter operating margin decreased year-over-year by 290 basis points to 15.2%. 
Within Snacks, organic net sales increased 1% to $1 billion, driven by volume gains in Goldfish crackers and our salty snacks portfolio, including Snack Factory Pretzel Crisps, Snyder's of Hanover pretzels and Cape Cod potato chips, partially offset by declines in partner brands and fresh bakery. Favorable price and sales allowances and lower promotional spending also contributed to sales growth. Compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, Snacks organic net sales grew 7%. 
Operating earnings for Snacks increased 7% for the quarter, driven by lower marketing and selling expenses, partially offset by sales volume declines, including the impact of the additional week and a lower gross margin. The lower gross margin resulted from higher cost inflation and other supply chain costs, net of lower COVID-19 related costs. 
Partially offset by the benefit of cost savings initiatives, supply chain productivity improvement, favorable price and sales allowances and lower promotional spending. Overall, within our Snacks division, fourth quarter operating margin increased year-over-year by 170 basis points to 14.2%. 
I'll now turn to cash flow and liquidity. Fiscal 2021 cash flow from operations decreased from $1.4 billion in the prior year to $1 billion, primarily due to changes in working capital, mostly from a significant increase in accounts payable in the prior year and lower accrued liabilities in the current year. Our year-to-date cash for investing activities was reflective of the cash outlay for capital expenditures of $275 million, which was slightly lower than the prior year driven by discontinued operations and the net proceeds from the sale of Plum. 
Our year-to-date cash outflows for financing activities were $1.7 billion, reflecting cash outlays due to dividends paid of $439 million as we continue to focus on delivering meaningful return of cash to our shareholders. Additionally, we reduced our debt by $1.2 billion. 
We ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $69 million. In June, the Board authorized a $250 million anti-dilutive share repurchase program to offset the impact of dilution from shares issued under our stock compensation programs. As you saw in today's press release, we reinstituted our strategic share repurchase program, with a $500 million program replacing the suspended $1.5 billion program which has been canceled. The company expects to fund the repurchases out of its existing cash flow generation. 
Turning to Slide 30, as covered in our press release, we're providing guidance for full year fiscal 2022. We expect continued uncertainty around the duration and effects of the pandemic on industry-wide supply chain networks, resulting in accelerating inflationary pressures and a constrained labor market. We expect to partially mitigate these headwinds with well-executed pricing and plant productivity initiatives as well as our cost savings program. 
First half margins, particularly in the first quarter, will continue to be impacted by transitional headwinds cycling prior year's elevated sales and scale efficiencies with comparisons easing in the second half of the fiscal year. We expect organic net sales to be minus 1% to plus 1%, adjusted EBIT of minus 8% to minus 5% and adjusted EPS of minus 8% to minus 4% versus the fiscal 2021 results. 
Fiscal 2021 results include a $0.12 benefit from mark-to-market gains on outstanding commodity hedges, and an approximate $0.02 adjusted EPS contribution from Plum. For additional context on mark-to-market, please refer to today's Form 8-K. Importantly, when considering these items, the upper end of our fiscal 2022 adjusted EPS range is in line with fiscal 2021 performance. 
As you see on Slide 31, we expect core inflation for the year to be high single digits with a more pronounced impact in the second half of fiscal 2022, which we plan to address with price increases and trade optimization, supply chain productivity improvements and cost savings initiatives, and a continued focus on discretionary spending across the organization. 
Moving to additional assumptions, we expect ongoing supply chain productivity gains of approximately 2% to 3% for the year, excluding the benefit of our cost savings program. As previously mentioned, we expect continued progress on our cost savings program and expect to deliver an incremental $45 million in fiscal 2022, keeping us on track to deliver $850 million by the end of the fiscal year. 
Additionally, we expect net interest expense of $190 million to $195 million, and an adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 24%, which is largely in line with fiscal 2021. While cognizant of our current operating environment, we expect to continue to invest in the business, targeting capital expenditures of approximately $330 million, which includes carryover projects from fiscal 2021. 
Additionally, we expect the net of adjusted administrative expenses and adjusted other income to increase as a percentage of net sales, reflecting the planned information technology investments and related costs, and the cycling of lower administrative items in the prior year. All in, we expect year-over-year operating margin improvement in the second half of the year. 
Overall, as Mark said, we had a positive finish to the year. We are truly grateful to our teams and for their continued dedication and commitment as we head into fiscal 2022. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Mark."

That's a full question. So let me try to piece out a couple of different elements in there. First, why don't we talk a little bit about the -- kind of the basis of the assumptions for our guidance and how we're thinking abo",1036,"Sure, yes. So thanks, Andrew. That's a full question. So let me try to piece out a couple of different elements in there. 
First, why don't we talk a little bit about the -- kind of the basis of the assumptions for our guidance and how we're thinking about it. So first, let's talk a little bit about top line. I think part of the composition of the year is going to be a little bit of a tale of 2 halves because I do foresee a first half that's going to feel a little bit more like what we've been experiencing in the fourth quarter, while seeing sequential improvement as pricing comes into play, which is obviously a significant contributor as we go forward and then in the back half, even though we do expect really driven on the back of the packaging, inflation as it relates to steel, in particular, as our contract terms on the calendar year. But even with that in mind, we're expecting improvement in the back half and overall momentum as we exit the year. 
So I think when you think about top line next year, I do think that we see terrific momentum on our business today. We accelerated that momentum in Q4, we expect to continue to see positive in-market performance as we move forward. We are going to lap a pretty significant inventory replenishment that occurred primarily in the first quarter, but through into the second quarter. But I think the underlying health of the business, we expect to continue to be positive. And of course, sadly, with COVID resurgence, I think some of the consumer dynamics that supported demand is likely going to be with us for a while longer. 
I also continue to be very encouraged by the retention of households and really the sustainment of repeat levels that's very broad-based across our portfolio. Obviously, soup is one that we're watching very closely. And again, I don't think we've ever had or at least not in recent history, a sustained period of progress so broadly across that part of our business. And with what we're bringing relative to innovation and other elements, we're feeling very good about that. 
I do think [ a governor ] a little bit on this and a recognition of a little bit of then, well why is your guidance the way it is, is because we also have to be mindful of what is a very significant pressure on labor that we're experiencing right now. And as I talked about that a little bit in the last quarter, I think we've seen that sustain through the fourth quarter and expect to still be wrestling with that, although I think we're taking some terrific actions and we're seeing some progress in some areas, arguably one of the toughest moments certainly that I've seen as it relates to labor, we're running about 2x our normal vacancy rates. 
And as a translation into what that means, think about it as around somewhere in the neighborhood of 6% of our positions that are open either vacant or absent, and that is making it tougher to fully meet the demand. So I think you sense or feel a little bit of that balance in our top line projections for the year. 
And I'll say this a couple of times, but if you go top of the range to bottom of the range, it kind of reflects how we do on that -- in that area. And so that's how we've thought about the top line. When you get to margin, it's more distinctively a first half, second half discussion, where really primarily in the first half but really more so even in the first quarter as we see pricing come into fruition, of course, inflation now as we kind of leave the covered positions of '21 into '22, we definitely are seeing higher inflation but also feeling very good about the traction we're getting relative to the pricing actions that we put in place. 
We've got good strong productivity that we think will certainly help mitigate that as well. But certainly, you're going to be in that transitional quarter of pricing coming in with higher inflation. And then as pricing is fully in place, we expect that to stabilize. 
As we did note, as steel prices have gone up significantly, we are expecting a tick up in inflation in the back half, not enough to offset the progress in the other areas and the comparable numbers that we're going to be lapping, but generally, a little bit more mitigation. And that's, although we've got good programs, I think we've got a good plan for it. 
That's a pretty significant driver as we look through the balance of the year. And then what we've been calling transitional costs, which again, in the fourth quarter were fairly consistent with what we saw in the third quarter, we expect that to be consistent in the first quarter and then begin to mitigate as we move forward from there. 
So I do think as the year unfolds, I feel like we are assuming that as we both lap as well as see some relief in a couple of areas while we get pricing fully in place, I think we have a fairly balanced approach. And not unlike what I was talking about around top line, I think the high end and the low end of the ranges of guidance are a little bit reflective of what variability could occur relative to where we're seeing inflation or coverage of that inflation to give you a sense of kind of how we've thought about the year. And then, of course, as you drop to EPS, a little less difference between where EPS and EBIT is relative to what we see kind of happening below the line. 
So that -- I don't know, from a macro basis, that's kind of the way we're thinking about the pieces. Maybe worth just going back to you to see if you've got any specific element you want to dive into a little bit more. I know this is a big question for the day, though."

And maybe a good way to start with it is to give you a little bit of an explanation on Q4 because I know as you unpack the numbers -- and again, I think we foreshadowed this. But it's important to remembe",462,"Sure, yes, so let me kind of hit that one head on. And maybe a good way to start with it is to give you a little bit of an explanation on Q4 because I know as you unpack the numbers -- and again, I think we foreshadowed this. But it's important to remember that in fourth quarter of '20, we were in a position where we had a significant opportunity to kind of double down and invest in a more significant way, which, by the way, I'm very glad that we did. Because as I've said before, I think it did 2 things, gave us some momentum as we were solidifying relationships with a lot of new consumers, especially millennials, but it also gave us a great opportunity to learn and figure out kind of what was working, what wasn't working, which helped us really kind of dial in to the most efficient or the highest returning spends. 
As you flip the page to Q4 of '21, you see a significant drop in marketing and selling. But underpinning that, what you have is essentially advertising and marketing that are at about the same level as Q4 '19. And as you've seen our results behind it, and again, arguably always a little bit of a lag, but as you see our results relative to it, I think I feel great about the investment levels overall that we have. 
And as you think about going into next year, I do think you may see a little bit of movement between the quarters. But overall, from a marketing spend, I think we're at a good level. We may have a little bit of incremental investment in a couple of areas as we're adding innovation and working through the balance of the year. But it will be a relatively stable investment year. 
We're not expecting marketing to be a source of opportunity to offset inflation at all, right? We feel good about the levels we're at, and we want to make sure that we continue to refine the effectiveness of it, but we're committed to spending behind the businesses. I mean I think the last thing in the world we want to do is slow down the momentum that we're seeing in market because it's certainly been, for us, a bit of an unprecedented period of really broad-based market share expansion and growth in key businesses. 
And so we want to -- we know long term coming out of this thing, that's what's going to matter most. And so we're going to be very guarded on it. Even though I recognize on paper, Q4 needs a little bit of context. But relative to how we're thinking about it going forward, we're expecting very stable investment."

And then the second one, just in terms of trying to understand, we get a lot of questions about just how much of that high single-digit inflation expectation is more or less locked in and how much is variable, right? Meaning it could swing up or down depending on conditions. And I guess one of the things that we've been hearing consistently through the month of August, as we've touched base with companies is there's a lot of volatility in freight even if you've got contracts. I mean, sometimes it's not even -- the truck doesn't even show up, let alone paying higher for the contract. 
So it seems like there's just a lot of volatility there. And then anything resin-based, whether it's snack bags, bag liners, resin cups and Ida probably complicates that a little bit, just given what it's doing to the refining complex. So anyway, just any context there in terms of how much is fixed and how much could be variable."

But we've got an economic forecast that I think is generally consistent with where prices are today. 
You are right. Resin is another area that we've seen some tick-up in costs as well, but I think we've covered that. And again, as we navigate through the balance of the year, I think you should expect us to continue to use the full tool bag to cover that, whether it's some combination of promotion and trade spending, some price pack architecture that we've worked on, as well as the likelihood that there may be some places where we're coming back with a second wave of pricing designed to match very clearly in a very transparent way where we have some of these more explicit costs. 
And I would say, I think that will be much more surgical and specific than the pricing that we already have in place. But I do think as we look at the outlook, we see a mix of those variables in our plan to help us cover that."

But I think as we've -- remember, you're also beginning to -- as you go into '22, begin to lap some of the volatility we were experiencing in fiscal '21. 
And so your comparables do get a little bit easier as the year unfolds. But as we said, as we think about some of these transitional costs in the first half, that's partly why we see a little bit more of that headwind in the beginning of the year as we've tried to be prudent in making the appropriate estimate as it relates to where those costs are going to come in based on kind of how we're seeing them today."

But one thing was that you were, I think, being thoughtful, strategic about reflecting critical price thresholds. I think you said the last thing you want is to shut down growth and share. And I think some people came away from that with the idea that you want to have some pricing but a little bit of a balanced approach. 
I'm just curious if your thoughts on that have evolved at all, right? Maybe you've seen elasticity a little bit lower than you expected across food at home, maybe a little bit more inflation. So I'm just trying to get a sense, are you willing to be a little bit more aggressive on pricing, just given some of the changes you've seen in the last few months? Or do you still want to kind of take that balanced approach to things?"

I think the first thing I would say is we definitely have been encouraged by what we're seeing early on as it relates to elasticity. And I think just perhaps the broad-based nature of the inflation is supporting perhaps a little lower than historical levels as it relates to what the elasticities are. 
I also think that the strength of our brands right now and the momentum relative to businesses, a great example is our Swanson business, which, as we've returned supply into the marketplace, as you might remember, over the last year, or so we lost a lot of share to lower-cost players, which I think for me was going to be an important test for that brand as we came back in the supply. And we've done extremely well on recovering the share that we had surrendered. 
And so I do think perhaps my view of where the boundaries are have expanded. However, I do think there still are some boundaries. And so I think although it's giving us perhaps permission to reflect and continue to do the best job we can in juggling the pressure relative to inflation with wanting to protect the franchises and the brands longer term, I think we've got more room. And I think that although there will be some places where I think we still want to make the right smart trade-off for the long-term health, there's no question that I am feeling more confident in our ability to carry pricing than I might have initially as we were talking in the third quarter."

Again, we talked a little bit earlier about elasticities and a little bit of a growing confidence as it relates to our ability to navigate pricing, perhaps without seeing some of the historical levels that would translate necessarily into the 5%. 
I think you're working a little bit of a couple of different puzzle pieces together. One, we continue to imagine that we'll be investing, we're adding innovation. We are on the flip side, lapping some inventory replenishment that we saw in the beginning of last year. But I think the net of it is we do expect that to be -- to result in a relatively flat year for top line, and that's kind of reflected in our ranges. 
And again, if we -- remember, in the backdrop of all this too, Rob, is a little bit of the labor situation and how we are going to be able to meet the level of demand and our ability to navigate that. I think we're a lot smarter, a lot more experienced in that now than we were perhaps 1.5 years ago when the journey began. But at the same time, again, I would say, consistent with many of my peers, the labor challenges that we're seeing are certainly tougher than I ever remember. And I think the combination of those variables is how we're getting to the outlook. 
But I don't think we're leaning out on any of those assumptions. So I think we've been fairly, like I said, pragmatic or balanced in our view. But I think there's going to be puts and takes. And so although I think you may see pressure downward as it relates to pricing, I think there is likely going to continue to be a catalyst for growth and progress as well. Remember, some of our businesses, especially like our snacks businesses, have been pretty steady contributors of growth even through a little bit of the ups and downs as we've been navigating the pandemic. So I think there's going to be a mix of variables, but I think where we've kind of pegged, it's probably about right."

But remember, you've got several tailwinds as you're getting to the back half of the year. So I think the ability to still show that sequential progress in margins as we get to the back half of the year, even with those assumptions relative to inflation, I think still will be positive."

But here's what I can tell you: I continue to believe very strongly in the potential for us to improve margins on snacks and for us to continue to close or reduce the gap between where we are today and where we see ourselves relative to kind of snacks margin averages. 
I think as time goes on, we continue to get better clarity and better understanding of the building blocks and the variables that will help us get there. And at the same time, I just would say that as you're looking at the here and now, if you think about kind of where we started the journey to where we find ourselves, there's probably somewhere around 150 basis points of margin that I would call just transitional cost that are dampening some of the productivity and savings that we've been generating over the last several years. 
Part of it is planned investments. So part of the kind of offsets to the productivity has been -- or the value capture has been planned investments in both the infrastructure and in marketing in some cases. But I think beyond that, we're probably looking at about 150, like I said, basis points that are dampening the baseline. And then as we project forward, I think what you're going to see is a combination of building blocks that will help us build off of that adjusted base. 
And hopefully, in December, I'll be able to give you greater confidence in what those look like. I know we've been kind of dripping that out for several quarters now, but it will be good to kind of get to the December period. And I think I felt like it was important to kind of keep playing through a little bit of the short-term kind of transitional pressure as we get ready for that conversation.

Following the conclusion of the Q&A session, a replay of the webcast will be available at the same location followed by a transcript of the call within 24 hours. 
On our call today, we will make forward-looking statements, which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on assumptions and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk. Please refer to Slide 3 for our SEC filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements. 
Because we use non-GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in the appendix of this presentation. As stated in the release from this quarter onwards, adjusted net earnings will exclude unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on outstanding undesignated commodity hedges until such time that the related exposure impacts operating results. 
Accordingly, fiscal 2021 adjusted results and guidance for adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS growth rates reflect this change. Also beginning this fiscal year, the foodservice and Canadian business formerly included in the snack segment is now managed as part of the Meals & Beverages segment. Segment results have been adjusted retrospectively to reflect this change. For additional information on these updates, please refer to today's Form 8-K. 
On Slide 4, you'll see today's agenda. Mark will share his overall thoughts on our first quarter performance as well as in-market performance by division. Mick will discuss the financial results of the quarter in more detail and then review our guidance for the full year fiscal 2022. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark."
258458,1758822299,2456900,"Campbell Soup Company, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Dec 08, 2021",2021-12-08,"Earnings Calls","The Campbell's Company","Executives","Thanks, Rebecca. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call for fiscal year 2022. As you saw in our press release, we reported solid performance in the quarter especially when compared to the significant growth in the prior year and cons",1785,"Thanks, Rebecca. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call for fiscal year 2022. As you saw in our press release, we reported solid performance in the quarter especially when compared to the significant growth in the prior year and considering the rapidly evolving macro environment in which we currently operate. Organic net sales were down 4% for the quarter, driven by the expected lapping of prior year retailer inventory replenishment as well as constrained supply in the current quarter. 
We were, however, up 5% versus fiscal 2020 and consumption was up 2% versus prior year and up 9% versus 2 years ago, signaling strong persistent consumer demand. This dynamic resulted in a 6-point difference in net sales versus consumption in measured channels, a relationship we do not expect to continue through the remainder of the year. 
Like many of our competitors and customers, we face supply chain pressures, particularly around labor constraints and transportation capacity, and our net sales results reflect those pressures. I am very proud of how our teams navigated costs related to this volatility. Their strong execution, combined with effective pricing actions across both segments led to adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS results consistent with our expectations and in line or ahead of 2 years ago. 
On Slide 7, with end market demand remaining strong across both of our segments and the pricing actions we announced at the end of our prior fiscal year now reflected on shelf, we feel confident about the outlook for the full fiscal year. We recently announced additional inflation-justified pricing actions to offset continuing increases in ingredient and packaging costs, logistics and labor. 
This second round of pricing should be effective in January and evident on shelf in the third quarter. This will result in some added pressure in Q2 as pricing catches up with more recent inflation. But moving into the second half, we expect margin progress and earnings recovery as we use all of our available mitigation tools. 
To address labor challenges in our network, we have taken specific actions and see early signs of improvement, such as increased onboarding, lower absenteeism and improved retention. We've seen a recent uptick in the volume produced across the plants, and we expect to begin to rebuild our inventories in the second quarter but not fully recover until the second half. 
Our ingredient and packaging spend, we are now over 85% covered, thereby reducing the variability in the upcoming quarters, while we continue to deliver on our supply chain productivity improvements and our cost savings initiatives. In addition, we've made selective supply-related reductions in marketing and selling investments in the first quarter which we expect to reverse and fully return to targeted levels as we move into the second half of the year. 
Labor and supply challenges are impacting certain brands to a greater extent than others, creating some short-term share and consumption pressure. We expect this to be evident, particularly through the second quarter as we cycle through recovery on labor and supply. With the strength of our brands and the share gains that have been so consistent and broaden our business over the last 2 years, we remain very confident that share positions will improve once we return to full capacity and investment in the second half of the fiscal year. 
Turning to our Meals & Beverages division. I continue to be pleased by the underlying health of the portfolio and the performance of the brands. Organic net sales were down 6% versus prior year, lapping 11% growth in the prior year and up 5% versus fiscal 2020. Consumption, though flat year-over-year was up 9% versus 2 years ago, reflecting the strength of demand for our products. 
Turning to soup on Slide 10. Our Win in Soup strategy continues to show positive results. We retained households and held share in the quarter. More people are participating and remaining in the soup category than pre-pandemic levels. Household penetration on ready-to-serve, condensed eating and swans and broth are all ahead of the prior year. Additionally, compared to prior year, the dollar spent per buyer increased as our pricing actions took effect while volume per buyer remained flat, reflecting the health, relevance and sustained momentum of our brands. 
These compelling data points provide evidence that we are retaining our expanded consumer base despite consumer mobility increasing, returning competition and our inflation driven higher price points. U.S. soup consumption grew 2% over elevated levels in the prior year, bringing growth versus 2 years ago to 9%. Repeat rates and household penetration remained ahead of 2 years ago on Pacific Foods ready to serve, condensed and Swanson broth. 
Condensed dollar share was down slightly in the quarter. However, we continue to be encouraged by evidence that quick scratch cooking behavior continues. In our consumer tracking studies, more than 1/3 of the people surveyed indicated that they cook more compared to the prior month. Additionally, we are seeing the need for quicker meal preparation as consumers shift to hybrid work arrangements leading to the need for quicker lunches while working from home and preparing dinners after returning from the workplace. 
This is driving an overall increase in our eating share interestingly with our strongest growth in condensed eating coming from millennials. As you may have noted, in more recent periods, we are seeing some recovery of private label in the condensed segment. This is not unexpected, given their recovery from an extended period of supply constraints. It's important to note our 2-year share gains remain very strong, and we remain very confident in our overall competitive position versus private label as we move forward with continued strong support and programming. 
Ready-to-serve increased share in the quarter, including over 3 points of share gains among millennials. Within ready-to-serve, Chunky had a very strong quarter, increasing consumption 8% and on top of 2% growth in the prior year quarter and grew share by 0.6 points versus prior year. This is despite elevated promotional levels from competition. 
On Swanson broth, we also grew share by 1.6 points, representing the third consecutive quarter of growth as supply recovery continued. Our Pacific Foods growth engine delivered its eighth consecutive quarter of holding or growing share, driven by sustained momentum on broth despite remaining supply challenges due to labor pressures paired with high demand. 
Turning to sauces. Prego remained the #1 share leader for 30 straight months. However, short-term material availability is adding pressure on supply and creating more recent pressure on shares, which we expect to improve as we fully recover on inventory in the second half. Pace share began to improve in Q1 and grew households compared to prior year. We see Pace continuing to improve throughout the year. 
I want to conclude my comments on Meals & Beverages by highlighting an important underlying trend. Across the Meals & Beverages portfolio, we continued to show strong performance with younger households. The percentage of buyers under the age of 35 has increased versus the prior year quarter on nearly all key brands. Specifically, on U.S. soup, the percentage of buyers under 35 increased almost 2 points this quarter, and the average age of Campbell Soup consumers are getting younger. 
The millennial cohort is the fastest-growing segment in condensed eating, ready-to-serve and broth, Importantly, as we look beyond the current short-term volatility and begin to assess the ability for meals and beverages to continue to contribute growth into the future. This dynamic is a very important indicator and supports our efforts to increase relevance with a new generation of consumers. 
Turning to Snacks. Organic net sales were down 1%, primarily due to labor-related supply constraints, but grew 4% compared to fiscal 2020. End market performance was strong, growing 5% over the prior year quarter and 9% on a 2-year basis. This dynamic has resulted in low levels of retail inventory that we're working on and expect to recover through the second half of the fiscal year. 
Our power brands continue to fuel performance with in-market consumption growth of 6% this fiscal year and 13% on a 2-year basis, driven by double-digit consumption growth across the majority of our brands. We are pleased to see repeat rates on all 8 power brands ahead of the prior year and compared to fiscal 2020. Goldfish performed very well in the quarter, increasing share by 0.5 point and growing consumption high single digits versus prior year behind strong marketing activation, improved performance in multipacks and continued successful limited edition flavor innovations resulting in improved base velocities and increased household penetration. 
We are winning with consumers, gaining share and driving significant consumption increases. Innovation continues to be a key growth driver, with limited edition Goldfish jalapeno popper being the #1 velocity new item launched in the cracker category in the quarter. marking the second quarter in a row, we achieved this metric with our limited edition flavor innovations. We also continue to increase the relevance of this brand and broaden its appeal beyond our traditional kids audience with 60% of new buyers being households without kids. 
We continue to drive share growth on other brands as well, including Snack Factory Pretzel Chris by 2.5 points, Kettle brand potato chips by more than 1 point and Cape Cod potato chips 2.6 points. However, as previously mentioned, labor availability on certain snack segments is putting pressure on share in several areas. In particular, Cookies, Lance Crackers, Late July and Snyder's of Hanover Pretzels in the quarter. 
We are making good progress on recovering but do expect some of these headwinds to persist into Q2, more broadly recovering in the second half. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to be pleased with the speed and progress we have made to address the executional pressures experienced last year. Although we will still lap a challenging Q2 as we deal with the macro environment we expect a very strong second half of the year with progress on margins and shares. 
Given our solid first quarter results and their consistency with our expectations, as well as our line of sight to the balance of the fiscal year, we are reaffirming our full year guidance. Mick will provide more details in a moment. As previously mentioned, while we expect to still have a difficult comparison in Q2, and as we lap year-ago strength and begin to recover on labor and supply pressures, we remain very confident in our expectations of positive second half performance and momentum exiting the year. 
We look forward to sharing our strategy to unlock our longer-term full growth potential next week at our Investor Day. With that, let me turn it over to Mick to discuss our first quarter results in more detail."
258458,1758822299,2456900,"Campbell Soup Company, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Dec 08, 2021",2021-12-08,"Earnings Calls","The Campbell's Company","Executives","Thanks, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 17. As Rebecca mentioned at the start of the call, from this quarter onwards, we will exclude from adjusted net earnings, unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on outstanding undesignated commodi",1954,"Thanks, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 17. As Rebecca mentioned at the start of the call, from this quarter onwards, we will exclude from adjusted net earnings, unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on outstanding undesignated commodity hedges until such time that the related exposure impacts operating results. Our adjusted financial results and guidance reflect this change. 
For the first quarter, as we left 8% growth in the prior year, organic net sales declined 4% due to the anticipated cycling of year ago retailer inventory recovery and supply pressures. The resulting year-over-year volume decline more than offset the favorable impact of net pricing in the quarter. As Mark highlighted earlier, consumer demand remained strong. In fact, in measured channels it was 6 points above our total net sales performance. 
All said, this past quarter, our organic net sales on a comparable basis were 5% higher compared to 2 years ago or the first fiscal quarter of 2020. Adjusted EBIT decreased 15% compared to prior year, which was 1% higher on a 2-year basis despite the significant levels of inflation on ingredients packaging, labor, warehousing and logistics. 
Our adjusted EBIT margin was 17.4% compared to 19.5% in the prior year and slightly down from fiscal 2020. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations decreased $0.12 or 12% versus prior year to $0.89 per share, which remains well ahead of fiscal 2020. 
On the next slide, I'll break down our net sales performance for the first quarter. As I mentioned, the impact of lapping the post-COVID search retailer inventory recovery and supply constraints, largely related to industry-wide labor challenges along with select material constraints, held back our ability to meet the continued elevated demand. 
The operations team continued to execute well in a challenging environment. Organic net sales decreased 4% during the quarter, driven by a 6-point volume headwind, which reflects lapping of the prior year retailer inventory recovery and the beforementioned supply constraints. Favorable price and sales allowances drove a 4-point gain in the quarter, which was partially offset by a 2-point headwind due to some span back on promotional spending in the quarter closer to pre-pandemic levels. The impact of the sale plan subtracted 1 point. All in, our reported net sales declined 4% from the prior year. 
Turning to Slide 19. Our first quarter adjusted gross margin decreased by 200 basis points from 34.5% last year to 32.5% this year. Mix had a negative impact of approximately 70 basis points on gross margin as we cycled last year's retailer inventory recovery and favorable operating leverage. Net price realization drove a 190 basis point improvement due to the benefits of our recent pricing actions, partially offset by increased promotional spending. 
Inflation and other factors had a negative impact of 470 basis points, with the majority of the decline driven by cost inflation as overall input prices on a rate basis increased by approximately 6%. Along with other industry participants, we experienced significant inflation across all input cars categories, including ingredients, packaging, labor, warehousing and logistics. That said, our ongoing supply chain productivity program contributed 120 basis points to gross margin, partially offsetting these inflationary headwinds. 
Our cost savings program, which is incremental to our ongoing supply chain productivity program, added 30 basis points to our gross margin. The previously described initiatives to mitigate inflation highlighted on the next page include price increases and trade optimization, supply chain productivity improvements and cost-saving initiatives and a continued focus on discretionary spending across the organization. We remain focused on inflation mitigation as we continue to expect core inflation for the year to be high single digits with a more pronounced impact in the second half of fiscal 2022. As you saw on the previous page, the progress we made in the first quarter to mitigate these inflationary pressures reduced the impact to 130 basis points on our adjusted gross margin. 
Moving to the next slide. We have continued to successfully deliver against our multiyear enterprise cost savings initiatives. This quarter, we achieved $15 million in incremental year-over-year savings and remain on track to deliver our cumulative savings target of $850 million by the end of fiscal year. We are working towards expanding our plan to $1 billion and we'll share more details next week at our Investor Day. 
Moving on to other operating items. Marketing and selling expenses decreased $38 million or 18% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. This decrease was driven by lower advertising and consumer promotion expense or A&C and lower selling expenses. Although A&C declined 31% as investment was moderated to reflect supply pressure, we expect it to normalize as supply strengthens throughout the year. Overall, our marketing and selling expenses represented 7.6% of net sales during the quarter, a 130 basis point decrease compared to last year. 
Adjusted administrative expenses increased $17 million or 12%, largely due to expenses related to the settlement of certain legal claims as higher general administrative costs were largely offset by the benefits of cost savings initiatives. Adjusted administrative expenses represented 6.9% of net sales during the quarter, a 100 basis point increase compared to last year. 
On Slide 23, we are providing a total company adjusted EBIT bridge to summarize the key drivers of performance this quarter. As previously mentioned, adjusted EBIT declined 15% as the net sales decline and the 200 basis point gross margin contraction resulted in a $36 million and $44 million EBIT headwinds, respectively. Partially offsetting this was lower marketing and selling expenses, contributing 130 basis points to our adjusted EBIT margin. This was a short-term action targeted in areas where supply constraints were most significant and we expect to fully return to targeted investment levels as soon as labor is in place and supply recovers, higher adjusted administrative and R&D expenses had a negative impact of 110 basis points and lower adjusted other income had a 30 basis point impact. 
Overall, our adjusted EBIT margin decreased year-over-year by 210 basis points to 17.4%. The following chart breaks down our adjusted EPS change between our operating performance and below-the-line items. A $0.17 impact of lower adjusted EBIT was partially offset by a $0.02 favorable impact from lower interest expense and a $0.04 impact of lower adjusted taxes due to the favorable resolution of several tax matters in the quarter. This resulted in better-than-expected adjusted EPS of $0.89, which was down $0.12 per share compared to the prior year. 
Turning to the segments. In Meals & Beverages, organic net sales decreased 6% as favorable price and sales allowances in the quarter were more than offset by volume declines across U.S. retail products, including V8 beverages, Prego pasta sauces in U.S. soup as well as in Canada. Volume decreased primarily as a result of cycling the retailer inventory recovery in the prior year quarter and due to supply constraints. 
Increased promotional spending relative to moderated levels in the prior year, partially offset the impact of recent price increases. Sales of U.S. Soup decreased 2% and cycling a 21% increase in the prior year quarter. Operating earnings for Meals & Beverages decreased 17% to $280 million. The decrease was primarily due to a lower gross margin and sales volume declines, partially offset by lower marketing and selling expenses. 
The lower gross margin resulted from higher cost inflation, higher levels of promotional spending, higher other supply chain costs and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by the benefits of recent pricing actions and supply chain productivity improvements. Overall, within our Meals and Beverage division, the first quarter operating margin decreased year-over-year by 260 basis points to 22.1%. 
Within Snacks, organic net sales decreased 1% and to $1 billion as favorable price and sales allowances were more than offset by volume declines and increased promotional spending compared to moderated levels in the prior year quarter. Declines in partner brands Pop Secret popcorn driven by elevated prior year demand and late July snacks due to supply pressures were partially offset by gains in Goldfish crackers and Pepperidge Farm cookies. 
Sales of power brands increased 3%. Operating earnings for Snacks decreased 5% for the quarter, driven by increased administrative expenses due to the settlement of certain legal claims and a slightly lower gross margin, partially offset by lower marketing and selling expenses. The slight decline in gross margin resulted from higher cost inflation, unfavorable product mix and higher level of promotional spending, largely offset by the benefits of recent pricing actions, supply chain productivity improvements and cost savings initiatives and lower other supply chain costs. Overall, within our Snacks division, first quarter operating margin decreased year-over-year by 60 basis points to 13.2%. 
I'll now turn to cash flow and liquidity. Fiscal 2022 cash flow from operations increased from $180 million in the prior year to $288 million, primarily due to lower working capital related outflows and mostly from accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by lower cash earnings. Our year-to-date cash outflows for investing activities were reflective of the cash outlay for capital expenditures of $69 million, which was comparable to prior year. 
In light of the current operating environment, we are reducing our planned full year capital expenditures from $330 million to approximately $300 million for fiscal 2022. Our year-to-date cash outflows from financing activities were $220 million, the vast majority of which or $179 million represented the return of capital to our shareholders, including $160 million of dividends paid and $63 million of share repurchases during the quarter. 
At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $475 million remaining under the current $500 million strategic share repurchase program. We also have a $250 million anti-dilutive share repurchase program, of which approximately $176 million is remaining. We ended the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $69 million. 
Turning to Slide 28. As covered earlier, adjusted net earnings now excludes unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on outstanding undestinated commodity hedges and the guidance for adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS growth rates reflect this change. We continue to expect full year fiscal 2020 net sales adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS performance to be consistent with the guidance we provided during our fiscal year-end earnings call. Overall, we expect accelerating inflationary pressures and higher labor-related costs to be partially mitigated with sustained in-market momentum, well-executed pricing and planned productivity initiatives as well as our cost savings program. 
Although we will be lapping strong prior year results in the second quarter, we expect top line performance to improve sequentially year-over-year as supply begins to recover. However, with respect to margin, we expect continued pressure driven by additional core inflation across commodities and higher labor-related costs without the benefit of our second wave of pricing, which will not be in place until the end of the second quarter. As we move into the second half of the year, we expect our inflation mitigation actions collectively along with the continued recovery of labor to result in margin progress and earnings recovery through the year. 
For the full year, we expect organic net sales to be minus 1% to plus 1%. And adjusted EBIT of minus 4.5% to minus 1.5% and adjusted EPS of minus 4% to flat. First, the adjusted fiscal 2021 results. The sum is estimated to have an impact of 1 percentage point on fiscal 2022 net sales. Overall, we had a positive start to the fiscal year, which was generally in line with our expectations, thanks to all the hard work by our teams. 
I'm truly grateful for their continued dedication and commitment and look forward to sharing our strategy to unlock our full growth potential at our Investor Day next week. We will now turn it over to the operator to take your questions. Thank you."

But it gross margin contraction was certainly less severe than we've modeled. So I'm trying to get a sense whether this was better than your sort of internal expectations? And if so, what drove that? And it sounds to me like your expectation is for year-over-year margin compression to be worse in 2Q than 1Q. I just want to make sure I'm sort of hearing that correctly and perhaps what are the key drivers there?"

I'd say generally, the results came in pretty aligned with our expectations. As we had pointed out in the Q4 earnings, we had a pretty significant lap of retail inventory replenishment as we were kind of -- if you remember at that time, coming out of what I would describe as kind of the initial surge -- first few quarters of surge of COVID. And we had a lot of recovery, especially in our Meals & Beverages business, which in the first quarter a year ago was up 11%. Soup was up 21%. And that's what we were lapping. And so we generally expected that and it came in fairly consistent. 
I do think on the supply side, especially as it related to Snacks, there was a little more pressure than we probably expected as labor was a bit more significant I think the good news is we've taken a lot of corrective actions, especially over the last 30 to 60 days, and we're seeing real progress. So our vacancy rates are down about 30% from where they were a month or so ago, and we expect that to continue to progress as we go into the second quarter and then more completely, I'd say, in the second half. So top line, pretty close, a little more pressure on supply. 
On the gross margin side, I feel great about how the team is navigating this moment. It's -- as you know, a lot of moving parts as you go into trying to predict what these quarters are going to entail. And I think we've done a very good job executing both on our pricing strategy as well as our productivity and the performance of the vast majority of our plants reflecting, again, just a terrific job by a lot of those frontline workers that have been out there for a long time, working very, very hard did a very good job, and it was pretty close to what we expected on margins. 
I think our EPS was a little bit better as we did see some tax favorability that we do not think will repeat throughout the year. But I think a little bit of upside there. Everything else pretty close to where we expected. I do think you're hearing us right as it relates to Q2. I think the dynamic you should expect there is some recovery within our supply, which should help a better comp to a year ago on top line. I still think some pressure as we recover, but certainly better than the 4% that we saw in Q1. 
I think on margin, you're right. The dynamic that you see there is kind of the ramp-up of inflation into the second quarter. With our second wave of pricing, we feel very good about that. We've communicated very justified in the face of inflation, but not going to be in place until we get to the very end of Q2 and into January. And that's why, as we've said a couple of different times, and both Mick and I in our prepared remarks today, we do expect Q2 to be a tough both comp as well as some of this dynamic on pricing and inflation. 
But as you get to the back half of the year, most of those elements will come into a more positive posture. And as we look at the back half, -- We're feeling very good about the combination of pricing, productivity, our enterprise cost savings, all of that coming together for a fairly positive outlook and 1 that we think will help us really build momentum into the back half as we exit the year."

I think a couple of things in that question that are interesting. I think the first thing I would just say is the good news is, although we do have a supply constraints in certain areas, they tend not to be right now in our soup and our core broth businesses, which are obviously very, very important as we go into this the kind of back half of the holiday season and into soup season. So we're feeling good on supply there. The team has done a really good job in continuing to build capacity. Execution has been very good in those facilities. And so we're feeling pretty good about our ability to supply into the season. 
I also feel good about the programming that we have. We've got some good innovation coming in, in a couple of areas. The execution on the marketing side for both our Chunky business as well as our condensed soup business has been very, very good. I do think, though, kind of on the back end of your question, I do think it will be a competitive environment, as we had expected or anticipated. And as I mentioned earlier, private label is a little bit more prevalent. I'm not worried about it, but it is going to add a little bit of pressure as we've seen them a little bit more broadly speaking, absent for a while, and they'll be back in the mix, and you see a little bit of that in the shares now. 
And I think ready-to-eat soup is always a pretty competitive segment, and I certainly wouldn't expect that to change right now, but I feel very good about how we're positioned and how we're set up going into the kind of heart of the season. And I do think from a supply standpoint, far more consistent with a normal kind of level playing field. So looking forward to that part of it, for sure."

Does that impact our Snacking business or some of the other segments we're in. And there is a little bit of that dynamic that I think we've modeled as we look at the the balance of the year. But we also do well on the flip side where people have to be a little bit more pragmatic in decision-making or they may be trading down from other categories into a category like soup, as an example. And traditionally speaking, one of the last things to always come off the list or some of the comfort items that we have in our snacking bundle. And so I think although there will be some puts and takes, I feel pretty good about the balance of how our portfolio hold up in that kind of economic dynamic and profile. And as you rightfully said, it's a little bit given the duration of this period, it's a little bit of new territory that we're watching very, very closely and trying to make sure that those expectations are consistent with what we're seeing. But we've put a lot of thought into that and trying to reflect that in our outlook for the balance of the year. But I think, overall, I'd say a fairly balanced outlook."

I think I'll give you the kind of explanation first because I think that's important. And I'll let Mick kind of give you an outlook for the year. But as we navigated through Q1, we anticipated that we were going to have some supply challenges in select areas. And so although you see a decline in the first quarter, it's fairly surgical in nature. It really is against the places where we knew that we were going to be in a position where it was going to be a little bit harder to meet demand. At the same time, what we don't want to do is go below certain threshold levels that are going to put in any way, shape or form a jeopardy the progress that we've made in kind of the first kind of acquiring, but more importantly, the retention of a lot of these incremental households. 
And so even in Q1 on business, important businesses like Goldfish or Soup, Chunky in particular, if you haven't seen our Chunky ads, I'm not sure you've had any media on, but it's been really effective as you heard in our shares. And we want to make sure that we keep the pressure on there. I do think as supply comes back fully, and as we roll through the balance of the year, you'll see it more as a return to normality. And just to put that in perspective, our marketing and sales in the first quarter was right around 8% of net sales. We would prefer that from an ongoing basis to be in the 9% to 10% range. And I think that's closer to what you'll see as we go forward through the year. But Mick, maybe you can give a little bit of color on that outlook."

And although we're, in some cases, lapping pretty healthy growth from a year ago. And when you think about certain categories, that's why we continue to kind of look through this lens of 2-year growth rates, they're very healthy across the board. And I think for us, it's more of a function of some of those macro behavioral trends that are perhaps bigger than some of the policy impacted trends that are continuing to elevate demand. We've talked about a lot this idea of the stability of in-home eating even as people are going back to work, a lot of companies, organizations in the hybrid model are still maintaining a portion of their work time at home, which is a huge correlation to our Soup business and our Snack business. In addition to that, even on the cooking side, it's changing. It's evolving a little bit from where it was in the heart of the pandemic to now where much more important in this particular moment is the speed of preparation we've seen a very distinct move to very quick. How do I get dinner done in 15 minutes? Actually, 18 minutes appears to be the kind of target for most consumers as we've done a lot of research on this. But that also plays quite well into our portfolio as a dynamic that's very, very helpful as you think about our condensed soup businesses like Cream opf Mushroom, Cream of Chicken or Prego pasta sauces. I think also elasticity continues to be a lot more favorable than what we've seen historically. And so I think that in addition to those macro trends, are what's keeping an elevated level on demand. I do think, as I said, to Ken's answer, there are some places where you do see some movement. But I think on the kids brands, in particular, brands like Goldfish as an example, are very, very healthy. One of the stronger sustained periods we had if you from my comments earlier, we've continued to do very, very well. And what's really interesting on businesses like that is, if you remember back in the pandemic, we were feeling a lot of pressure on the reduction on away-from-home snacking, so our portion packs are on-the-go packs. 
What's interesting now is we've kind of held on to the bigger bulk pack demand, but we've also seen a resurgence in those portion packs as kids are going back to school and activities are starting to come back. So I think there's always a variety of drivers influencing it. But I would say more broadly, the pros are outweighing any of the cons. And so that the net of that all is a generally positive outlook as it relates to sustainment of elevated levels of demand going forward."

I don't know if it's possible, but at what point do you think your inflation will lap and turn closer to low single digit. Or -- and then maybe you can just give us a little more color as to why it keeps escalating during the year is because of packaging contracts rolling over? Is it because of labor contracts that are going higher? What are the main drivers?"

So it's not a change compared to what our previous expectation was and is very much in line with what we've been looking at for fiscal 2022 all along. If you look at -- to your point, the underlying drivers there, you see about 6% in Q1, high single digits for the full year. So you do have that accelerating pattern throughout the year. Why is that, that's largely driven by the fact that obviously our fiscal year breaks over 2 calendar years. And we have various contracts that reset in the second half of our fiscal year. So you see particularly in the January time frame, a lot of the ingredients and pack contracts that are being reset. And they obviously reset of a different commodity environment that they previously we said that. And that's what we are experiencing. So as a result, various of these contracts are obviously or at least, call it, a calendar year basis. 
So we are experiencing that I expect to do out the next calendar year. And maybe the other point to add to that is if you look at our overall coverage, is we're probably currently about 85% covered, which is a little bit higher than typically, but because of the volatility in the current environment, we thought that's prudent."

So maybe just 2 other small points to build on Mick's answer. One is how long do you think it is until we begin to lap and although I would say that's always a little bit tough to predict in the environment we're in right now. But -- as you can imagine, some of the contract elements that we're talking about that are on a calendar year, you have the natural kind of carryover into the first half of fiscal '23 for us that would be that same contract. So as you think about relief going forward, and you can imagine, too, that in this kind of volatile environment, we're working really closely to supplier -- with suppliers to make sure if there is a dramatic change that we can reflect that without having to necessarily wait 12 months to kind of revisit a contract. 
So we've created a lot of that dynamic that should help us be a little bit more nimble, but that's the dynamic that Mick's talking about. But I just would say to counter that, though, although I do -- as we pointed out, some pressure in Q2, even though you have that escalating inflation, you also have an escalation of our mitigating actions. And so as we look at the back half of the year, we actually feel very good about how we line up our position versus inflation, arguably better than we'd necessarily do in Q2 as we're in that kind of transitional moment. So although on the one hand, there will be likely more inflation. I also fully expect us to be in a much better position to mitigate it, and we're feeling very good, and that's a big part of the confidence that we have in the balance of the year and why we're pointing to a more favorable back half."

Yes. Great. I'm glad you asked that question because it will allow me to give a little bit of color on a bit of the dynamic in Q2 as it relates to share, which I think is important to -- I mentioned it in my comments, but I wanted to give you a little bit more flavor on that. So essentially, what I would tell you is in the first quarter, you had a dynamic that we're certainly not unfamiliar with where we were going into the quarter with a fair amount of inventory, demand remained elevated and so you saw a stronger consumption number. Now part of that, again, was the lap of the inventory component. 
But if you look at our top line, we were down about 4% versus a year ago with an in-market consumption of 2%. You have a little bit of unmeasured channel elements that are there. But let's more or less talk about 6-point delta between the 2. The way we see this is a little bit more -- half to a little bit more than half was related to the inventory lap and then the balance was really supply. So in the places that we had supply pressure, that's really anchored in a couple of categories. And a little bit of the labor issue that we talk about is not just our labor, but some of our suppliers' labor. 
So you have some material pressure. So if I were to break the businesses apart a little bit and give you a little more detail, our Snacks business inherently is more labor-intensive, just the nature of the manufacturing. So a little bit more of that supply-related pressure is on our snack businesses and in particular, several of our Snyder's-Lance businesses. So late July, we talked about as well as Snyder's and Hanover and also pressure on our Lance sandwich crackers. 
Pepperidge Farm were generally in a better position, although cookies is a little bit pressured as it is pretty labor-intensive as well. So those 4 categories are where we're seeing the pressure. On Meals & Beverages, it's much more about the material availability as it relates to certain parts of Prego and aluminum cans in particular on V8. And so that's where you see the pressure occurring. 
As you go into Q2, labor is recovering. And so we already see production levels going up as that labor moves into place. It is important to note that when we hire someone, in the manufacturing role. It takes about 4 to 6 weeks for a new hire to begin to kind of deliver at an effectiveness level that allows us to really realize the additional labor. So it does take a little bit of time. But as we go into Q2, I think the dynamic you should expect is that we'll be recovering on inventory levels, recovering on our supply, probably taking us some time in certain areas. But what you will see is a little bit of short-term pressure on share and in-market consumption in a couple of the places where we have gotten lower on inventory. It's really those businesses that I just described, we see it very short term in nature. That share pressure is not related to anything that is brand-driven, consumer demand-driven. It really is a very, very high correlation to where the supply is pressured. It's also -- it happens to be where you're also a little bit lower on investment as we're managing through that. But as we come into the second half, we expect those to be back in a stronger position and a really healthy back half. And if you think about the last couple of years on our business, we've done very, very well and has made a major priority on driving growth and end market performance, and that doesn't change even with a little bit of the bump that we expect here in the near term. And as we get through the balance of the year, we think a lot of great momentum as we exit '22 and head into '23 as well."

I am Rebecca Gardy, Head of Investor Relations at Campbell Soup Company. Joining me today are Mark Clouse, Campbell's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mick Beekhuizen, Campbell's Chief Financial Officer. Today's remarks have been prerecorded. Once we conclude the prepared remarks, we will transition to a live webcast Q&A session. The slide deck and today's earnings press release have been posted to the Investor Relations section on our website, campbellsoupcompany.com. Following the conclusion of the Q&A session, a replay of the webcast will be available at the same location followed by a transcript of the call within 24 hours.  
On our call today, we will make forward-looking statements, which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on assumptions and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk. Please refer to Slide 3 or our SEC filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements.  
Because we use non-GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in the appendix of this presentation. As stated in the release from this quarter onwards, adjusted net earnings will exclude unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on outstanding undesignated commodity hedges until such time that the related exposure impacts operating results.  
Accordingly, fiscal 2021 adjusted results and guidance for adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS growth rates reflect this change. Also beginning this fiscal year, the foodservice and Canadian business formerly included in the snack segment is now managed as part of the Meals & Beverages segment. Segment results have been adjusted retrospectively to reflect this change. For additional information on these updates, please refer to today's Form 8-K.  
On Slide 4, you'll see today's agenda. Mark will share his overall thoughts on our first quarter performance as well as in-market performance by division. Mick will discuss the financial results of the quarter in more detail and then review our guidance for the full year fiscal 2022. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark."

Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call for fiscal year 2022. As you saw in our press release, we reported solid performance in the quarter especially when compared to the significant growth in the prior year and cons",1785,"Thanks, Rebecca. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call for fiscal year 2022. As you saw in our press release, we reported solid performance in the quarter especially when compared to the significant growth in the prior year and considering the rapidly evolving macro environment in which we currently operate. Organic net sales were down 4% for the quarter, driven by the expected lapping of prior year retailer inventory replenishment as well as constrained supply in the current quarter.  
We were, however, up 5% versus fiscal 2020 and consumption was up 2% versus prior year and up 9% versus 2 years ago, signaling strong persistent consumer demand. This dynamic resulted in a 6-point difference in net sales versus consumption in measured channels, a relationship we do not expect to continue through the remainder of the year.  
Like many of our competitors and customers, we face supply chain pressures, particularly around labor constraints and transportation capacity, and our net sales results reflect those pressures. I am very proud of how our teams navigated costs related to this volatility. Their strong execution, combined with effective pricing actions across both segments led to adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS results consistent with our expectations and in line or ahead of 2 years ago.  
On Slide 7, with end market demand remaining strong across both of our segments and the pricing actions we announced at the end of our prior fiscal year now reflected on shelf, we feel confident about the outlook for the full fiscal year. We recently announced additional inflation-justified pricing actions to offset continuing increases in ingredient and packaging costs, logistics and labor.  
This second round of pricing should be effective in January and evident on shelf in the third quarter. This will result in some added pressure in Q2 as pricing catches up with more recent inflation. But moving into the second half, we expect margin progress and earnings recovery as we use all of our available mitigation tools. To address labor challenges in our network, we have taken specific actions and see early signs of improvement, such as increased onboarding, lower absenteeism and improved retention. We've seen a recent uptick in the volume produced across the plants, and we expect to begin to rebuild our inventories in the second quarter but not fully recover until the second half.  
Our ingredient and packaging spend, we are now over 85% covered, thereby reducing the variability in the upcoming quarters, while we continue to deliver on our supply chain productivity improvements and our cost savings initiatives. In addition, we've made selective supply-related reductions in marketing and selling investments in the first quarter which we expect to reverse and fully return to targeted levels as we move into the second half of the year.  
Labor and supply challenges are impacting certain brands to a greater extent than others, creating some short-term share and consumption pressure. We expect this to be evident, particularly through the second quarter as we cycle through recovery on labor and supply. With the strength of our brands and the share gains that have been so consistent and broaden our business over the last 2 years, -- We remain very confident that share positions will improve once we return to full capacity and investment in the second half of the fiscal year.  
Turning to our Meals & Beverages division. I continue to be pleased by the underlying health of the portfolio and the performance of the brands. Organic net sales were down 6% versus prior year, lapping 11% growth in the prior year and up 5% versus fiscal 2020. Consumption, though flat year-over-year was up 9% versus 2 years ago, reflecting the strength of demand for our products.  
Turning to soup on Slide 10. Our Win in Soup strategy continues to show positive results. We retained households and held share in the quarter. More people are participating and remaining in the soup category than pre-pandemic levels. Household penetration on ready-to-serve, condensed eating and Swanson broth are all ahead of the prior year. Additionally, compared to prior year, the dollar spent per buyer increased as our pricing actions took effect while volume per buyer remained flat, reflecting the health, relevance and sustained momentum of our brands.  
These compelling data points provide evidence that we are retaining our expanded consumer base despite consumer mobility increasing, returning competition and our inflation driven higher price points. U.S. soup consumption grew 2% over elevated levels in the prior year, bringing growth versus 2 years ago to 9%. Repeat rates and household penetration remained ahead of 2 years ago on Pacific Foods ready to serve, condensed and Swanson broth.  
Condensed dollar share was down slightly in the quarter. However, we continue to be encouraged by evidence that quick scratch cooking behavior continues. In our consumer tracking studies, more than 1/3 of the people surveyed indicated that they cook more compared to the prior month. Additionally, we are seeing the need for quicker meal preparation as consumers shift to hybrid work arrangements leading to the need for quicker lunches while working from home and preparing dinners after returning from the workplace.  
This is driving an overall increase in our eating share interestingly with our strongest growth in condensed eating coming from millennials. As you may have noted, in more recent periods, we are seeing some recovery of private label in the condensed segment. This is not unexpected, given their recovery from an extended period of supply constraints. It's important to note our 2-year share gains remain very strong, and we remain very confident in our overall competitive position versus private label as we move forward with continued strong support and programming.  
Ready-to-serve increased share in the quarter, including over 3 points of share gains among millennials. Within ready-to-serve, Chunky had a very strong quarter, increasing consumption 8% and on top of 2% growth in the prior year quarter and grew share by 0.6 points versus prior year. This is despite elevated promotional levels from competition.  
On Swanson broth, we also grew share by 1.6 points, representing the third consecutive quarter of growth as supply recovery continued. Our Pacific Foods growth engine delivered its eighth consecutive quarter of holding or growing share, driven by sustained momentum on broth despite remaining supply challenges due to labor pressures paired with high demand.  
Turning to sauces. Prego remained the #1 share leader for 30 straight months. However, short-term material availability is adding pressure on supply and creating more recent pressure on shares, which we expect to improve as we fully recover on inventory in the second half. Pace share began to improve in Q1 and grew households compared to prior year. We see PACE continuing to improve throughout the year.  
I want to conclude my comments on Meals & Beverages by highlighting an important underlying trend. Across the Meals & Beverages portfolio, we continued to show strong performance with younger households. The percentage of buyers under the age of 35 has increased versus the prior year quarter on nearly all key brands. Specifically, on U.S. soup, the percentage of buyers under 35 increased almost 2 points this quarter, and the average age of Campbell Soup consumers are getting younger.  
The millennial cohort is the fastest-growing segment in condensed eating, ready-to-serve and broth, Importantly, as we look beyond the current short-term volatility and begin to assess the ability for meals and beverages to continue to contribute growth into the future. This dynamic is a very important indicator and supports our efforts to increase relevance with a new generation of consumers.  
Turning to Snacks. Organic net sales were down 1%, primarily due to labor-related supply constraints, but grew 4% compared to fiscal 2020. End market performance was strong, growing 5% over the prior year quarter and 9% on a 2-year basis. This dynamic has resulted in low levels of retail inventory that we're working on and expect to recover through the second half of the fiscal year.  
Our power brands continue to fuel performance with in-market consumption growth of 6% this fiscal year and 13% on a 2-year basis, driven by double-digit consumption growth across the majority of our brands. We are pleased to see repeat rates on all 8 power brands ahead of the prior year and compared to fiscal 2020. Goldfish performed very well in the quarter, increasing share by 0.5 point and growing consumption high single digits versus prior year behind strong marketing activation, improved performance in multipacks and continued successful limited edition flavor innovations resulting in improved base velocities and increased household penetration.  
We are winning with consumers, gaining share and driving significant consumption increases. Innovation continues to be a key growth driver, with limited edition Goldfish jalapeno popper being the #1 velocity new item launched in the cracker category in the quarter. Marking the second quarter in a row, we achieved this metric with our limited edition flavor innovations. We also continue to increase the relevance of this brand and broaden its appeal beyond our traditional kids audience with 60% of new buyers being households without kids.  
We continue to drive share growth on other brands as well, including Snack Factory Pretzel Chris by 2.5 points, Kettle brand potato chips by more than 1 point and Cape Cod potato chips 2.6 points. However, as previously mentioned, labor availability on certain snack segments is putting pressure on share in several areas. In particular, Cookies, Lance Crackers, Late July and Snyder's of Hanover Pretzels in the quarter.  
We are making good progress on recovering but do expect some of these headwinds to persist into Q2, more broadly recovering in the second half. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to be pleased with the speed and progress we have made to address the executional pressures experienced last year. Although we will still lap a challenging Q2 as we deal with the macro environment, we expect a very strong second half of the year with progress on margins and shares.  
Given our solid first quarter results and their consistency with our expectations, as well as our line of sight to the balance of the fiscal year, we are reaffirming our full year guidance. Mick will provide more details in a moment. As previously mentioned, while we expect to still have a difficult comparison in Q2, and as we lap year-ago strength and begin to recover on labor and supply pressures, we remain very confident in our expectations of positive second half performance and momentum exiting the year.  
We look forward to sharing our strategy to unlock our longer-term full growth potential next week at our Investor Day. With that, let me turn it over to Mick to discuss our first quarter results in more detail."

Turning to Slide 17.

Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 17. As Rebecca mentioned at the start of the call, from this quarter onwards, we will exclude from adjusted net earnings, unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on outstanding undesignated commodity hedges until such time that the related exposure impacts operating results. Our adjusted financial results and guidance reflect this change.  
For the first quarter, as we left 8% growth in the prior year, organic net sales declined 4% due to the anticipated cycling of year ago retailer inventory recovery and supply pressures. The resulting year-over-year volume decline more than offset the favorable impact of net pricing in the quarter. As Mark highlighted earlier, consumer demand remained strong. In fact, in measured channels it was 6 points above our total net sales performance.  
All said, this past quarter, our organic net sales on a comparable basis were 5% higher compared to 2 years ago or the first fiscal quarter of 2020. Adjusted EBIT decreased 15% compared to prior year, which was 1% higher on a 2-year basis despite the significant levels of inflation on ingredients packaging, labor, warehousing and logistics.  
Our adjusted EBIT margin was 17.4% compared to 19.5% in the prior year and slightly down from fiscal 2020. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations decreased $0.12 or 12% versus prior year to $0.89 per share, which remains well ahead of fiscal 2020.  
On the next slide, I'll break down our net sales performance for the first quarter. As I mentioned, the impact of lapping the post-COVID search retailer inventory recovery and supply constraints, largely related to industry-wide labor challenges along with select material constraints, held back our ability to meet the continued elevated demand.  
The operations team continued to execute well in a challenging environment. Organic net sales decreased 4% during the quarter, driven by a 6-point volume headwind, which reflects lapping of the prior year retailer inventory recovery and the beforementioned supply constraints. Favorable price and sales allowances drove a 4-point gain in the quarter, which was partially offset by a 2-point headwind due to some spent back on promotional spending in the quarter closer to pre-pandemic levels. The impact of the sale plan subtracted 1 point. All in, our reported net sales declined 4% from the prior year.  
Turning to Slide 19. Our first quarter adjusted gross margin decreased by 200 basis points from 34.5% last year to 32.5% this year. Mix had a negative impact of approximately 70 basis points on gross margin as we cycled last year's retailer inventory recovery and favorable operating leverage. Net price realization drove a 190 basis point improvement due to the benefits of our recent pricing actions, partially offset by increased promotional spending.  
Inflation and other factors had a negative impact of 470 basis points, with the majority of the decline driven by cost inflation as overall input prices on a rate basis increased by approximately 6%. Along with other industry participants, we experienced significant inflation across all input costs categories, including ingredients, packaging, labor, warehousing and logistics. That said, our ongoing supply chain productivity program contributed 120 basis points to gross margin, partially offsetting these inflationary headwinds.  
Our cost savings program, which is incremental to our ongoing supply chain productivity program, added 30 basis points to our gross margin. The previously described initiatives to mitigate inflation highlighted on the next page include price increases and trade optimization, supply chain productivity improvements and cost-saving initiatives and a continued focus on discretionary spending across the organization. We remain focused on inflation mitigation as we continue to expect core inflation for the year to be high single digits with a more pronounced impact in the second half of fiscal 2022.  
As you saw on the previous page, the progress we made in the first quarter to mitigate these inflationary pressures reduced the impact to 130 basis points on our adjusted gross margin.  
Moving to the next slide. We have continued to successfully deliver against our multiyear enterprise cost savings initiatives. This quarter, we achieved $15 million in incremental year-over-year savings and remain on track to deliver our cumulative savings target of $850 million by the end of fiscal year. We are working towards expanding our plan to $1 billion and we'll share more details next week at our Investor Day.  
Moving on to other operating items. Marketing and selling expenses decreased $38 million or 18% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. This decrease was driven by lower advertising and consumer promotion expense or A&C and lower selling expenses. Although A&C declined 31% as investment was moderated to reflect supply pressure, we expect it to normalize as supply strengthens throughout the year. Overall, our marketing and selling expenses represented 7.6% of net sales during the quarter, a 130 basis point decrease compared to last year.  
Adjusted administrative expenses increased $17 million or 12%, largely due to expenses related to the settlement of certain legal claims as higher general administrative costs were largely offset by the benefits of cost savings initiatives. Adjusted administrative expenses represented 6.9% of net sales during the quarter, a 100 basis point increase compared to last year.  
On Slide 23, we are providing a total company adjusted EBIT bridge to summarize the key drivers of performance this quarter. As previously mentioned, adjusted EBIT declined 15% as the net sales decline and the 200 basis point gross margin contraction resulted in a $36 million and $44 million EBIT headwinds, respectively. Partially offsetting this was lower marketing and selling expenses, contributing 130 basis points to our adjusted EBIT margin. 
This was a short-term action targeted in areas where supply constraints were most significant and we expect to fully return to targeted investment levels as soon as labor is in place and supply recovers, higher adjusted administrative and R&D expenses had a negative impact of 110 basis points and lower adjusted other income had a 30 basis point impact.  
Overall, our adjusted EBIT margin decreased year-over-year by 210 basis points to 17.4%. The following chart breaks down our adjusted EPS change between our operating performance and below-the-line items. A $0.17 impact of lower adjusted EBIT was partially offset by a $0.02 favorable impact from lower interest expense and a $0.04 impact of lower adjusted taxes due to the favorable resolution of several tax matters in the quarter. This resulted in better-than-expected adjusted EPS of $0.89, which was down $0.12 per share compared to the prior year.  
Turning to the segments. In Meals & Beverages, organic net sales decreased 6% as favorable price and sales allowances in the quarter were more than offset by volume declines across U.S. retail products, including V8 beverages, Prego pasta sauces in U.S. soup as well as in Canada. Volume decreased primarily as a result of cycling the retailer inventory recovery in the prior year quarter and due to supply constraints.  
Increased promotional spending relative to moderated levels in the prior year, partially offset the impact of recent price increases. Sales of U.S. Soup decreased 2% and cycling a 21% increase in the prior year quarter. Operating earnings for Meals & Beverages decreased 17% to $280 million. The decrease was primarily due to a lower gross margin and sales volume declines, partially offset by lower marketing and selling expenses.  
The lower gross margin resulted from higher cost inflation, higher levels of promotional spending, higher other supply chain costs and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by the benefits of recent pricing actions and supply chain productivity improvements. Overall, within our Meals and Beverage division, the first quarter operating margin decreased year-over-year by 260 basis points to 22.1%.  
Within Snacks, organic net sales decreased 1% to $1 billion as favorable price and sales allowances were more than offset by volume declines and increased promotional spending compared to moderated levels in the prior year quarter. Declines in partner brands Pop Secret popcorn driven by elevated prior year demand and late July snacks due to supply pressures were partially offset by gains in Goldfish crackers and Pepperidge Farm cookies.  
Sales of power brands increased 3%. Operating earnings for Snacks decreased 5% for the quarter, driven by increased administrative expenses due to the settlement of certain legal claims and a slightly lower gross margin, partially offset by lower marketing and selling expenses. The slight decline in gross margin resulted from higher cost inflation, unfavorable product mix and higher level of promotional spending, largely offset by the benefits of recent pricing actions, supply chain productivity improvements and cost savings initiatives and lower other supply chain costs.  
Overall, within our Snacks division, first quarter operating margin decreased year-over-year by 60 basis points to 13.2%. I'll now turn to cash flow and liquidity. We Fiscal 2022 cash flow from operations increased from $180 million in the prior year to $288 million, primarily due to lower working capital related outflows and mostly from accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by lower cash earnings. Our year-to-date cash outflows for investing activities were reflective of the cash outlay for capital expenditures of $69 million, which was comparable to prior year.  
In light of the current operating environment, we are reducing our planned full year capital expenditures from $330 million to approximately $300 million for fiscal 2022. Our year-to-date cash outflows from financing activities were $220 million, the vast majority of which or $179 million represented the return of capital to our shareholders, including $160 million of dividends paid and $63 million of share repurchases during the quarter.  
At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $475 million remaining under the current $500 million strategic share repurchase program. We also have a $250 million anti-dilutive share repurchase program, of which approximately $176 million is remaining. We ended the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $69 million.  
Turning to Slide 28. As covered earlier, adjusted net earnings now excludes unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on outstanding undestinated commodity hedges and the guidance for adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS growth rates reflect this change. We continue to expect full year fiscal [ 2022 ] net sales adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS performance to be consistent with the guidance we provided during our fiscal year-end earnings call. Overall, we expect accelerating inflationary pressures and higher labor-related costs to be partially mitigated with sustained in-market momentum, well-executed pricing and planned productivity initiatives as well as our cost savings program.  
Although we will be lapping strong prior year results in the second quarter, we expect top-line performance to improve sequentially year-over-year as supply begins to recover. However, with respect to margin, we expect continued pressure driven by additional core inflation across commodities and higher labor-related costs without the benefit of our second wave of pricing, which will not be in place until the end of the second quarter. As we move into the second half of the year, we expect our inflation mitigation actions collectively along with the continued recovery of labor to result in margin progress and earnings recovery through the year.  
For the full year, we expect organic net sales to be minus 1% to plus 1%. And adjusted EBIT of minus 4.5% to minus 1.5% and adjusted EPS of minus 4% to flat. First, the adjusted fiscal 2021 results. The sale of Plum is estimated to have an impact of 1 percentage point on fiscal 2022 net sales. Overall, we had a positive start to the fiscal year, which was generally in line with our expectations, thanks to all the hard work by our teams.  
I'm truly grateful for their continued dedication and commitment and look forward to sharing our strategy to unlock our full growth potential at our Investor Day next week. We will now turn it over to the operator to take your questions. Thank you."

But it gross margin contraction was certainly less severe than we've modeled. So I'm trying to get a sense whether this was better than your sort of internal expectations? And if so, what drove that? And it sounds to me like your expectation is for year-over-year margin compression to be worse in 2Q than 1Q.

258458,1758822299,2457029,"Campbell Soup Company, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Dec 08, 2021",2021-12-08,"Earnings Calls","The Campbell's Company","Executives","Sure. Yes. Thanks, Andrew. I'd say generally, the results came in pretty aligned with our expectations. As we had pointed out in the Q4 earnings, we had a pretty significant lap of retail inventory replenishment as we were kind of -- if you remember at th",615,"Sure. Yes. Thanks, Andrew. I'd say generally, the results came in pretty aligned with our expectations. As we had pointed out in the Q4 earnings, we had a pretty significant lap of retail inventory replenishment as we were kind of -- if you remember at that time, coming out of what I would describe as kind of the initial surge -- first few quarters of surge of COVID. And we had a lot of recovery, especially in our Meals & Beverages business, which in the first quarter a year ago was up 11%. Soup was up 21%. And that's what we were lapping. And so, we generally expected that and it came in fairly consistent. 
I do think on the supply side, especially as it related to Snacks, there was a little more pressure than we probably expected as labor was a bit more significant I think the good news is we've taken a lot of corrective actions, especially over the last 30 to 60 days, and we're seeing real progress. So our vacancy rates are down about 30% from where they were a month or so ago, and we expect that to continue to progress as we go into the second quarter and then more completely, I'd say, in the second half.  
So top-line, pretty close, a little more pressure on supply.  
On the gross margin side, I feel great about how the team is navigating this moment. It's -- as you know, a lot of moving parts as you go into trying to predict what these quarters are going to entail. And I think we've done a very good job executing both on our pricing strategy as well as our productivity and the performance of the vast majority of our plants reflecting, again, just a terrific job by a lot of those frontline workers that have been out there for a long time, working very, very hard did a very good job, and it was pretty close to what we expected on margins.  
I think our EPS was a little bit better as we did see some tax favorability that we do not think will repeat throughout the year. But I think a little bit of upside there. Everything else pretty close to where we expected. I do think you're hearing us right as it relates to Q2. I think the dynamic you should expect there is some recovery within our supply, which should help a better comp to a year ago on top-line. I still think some pressure as we recover, but certainly better than the 4% that we saw in Q1.  
I think on margin, you're right. The dynamic that you see there is kind of the ramp-up of inflation into the second quarter. With our second wave of pricing, we feel very good about that. We've communicated very justified in the face of inflation, but not going to be in place until we get to the very end of Q2 and into January. And that's why, as we've said a couple of different times, and both Mick and I in our prepared remarks today, we do expect Q2 to be a tough both comp as well as some of this dynamic on pricing and inflation.  
But as you get to the back half of the year, most of those elements will come into a more positive posture. And as we look at the back half, -- We're feeling very good about the combination of pricing, productivity, our enterprise cost savings, all of that coming together for a fairly positive outlook and 1 that we think will help us really build momentum into the back half as we exit the year."

I think a couple of things in that question that are interesting. I think the first thing I would just say is the good news is, although we do have a supply constraints in certain areas, they tend not to be right now in our soup and our core broth businesses, which are obviously very, very important as we go into this the kind of back half of the holiday season and into soup season. So, we're feeling good on supply there. The team has done a really good job in continuing to build capacity. Execution has been very good in those facilities. And so, we're feeling pretty good about our ability to supply into the season.  
I also feel good about the programming that we have. We've got some good innovation coming in, in a couple of areas. The execution on the marketing side for both our Chunky business as well as our condensed soup business has been very, very good. I do think, though, kind of on the back end of your question, I do think it will be a competitive environment, as we had expected or anticipated. And as I mentioned earlier, private label is a little bit more prevalent. I'm not worried about it, but it is going to add a little bit of pressure as we've seen them a little bit more broadly speaking, absent for a while, and they'll be back in the mix, and you see a little bit of that in the shares now.  
And I think ready-to-eat soup is always a pretty competitive segment, and I certainly wouldn't expect that to change right now, but I feel very good about how we're positioned and how we're set up going into the kind of heart of the season. And I do think from a supply standpoint, far more consistent with a normal kind of level playing field. So looking forward to that part of it, for sure."

We've talked about this a little bit before, but we are, I think, somewhat a unique portfolio in the sense that we have kind of this almost duality of benefit where economic factors more broadly and certainly snap I'd put into that bucket where we have puts and takes going kind of both ways. So you tend to see what I think a lot of people are referring to or talking about, which is pressure to perhaps trade down as those benefits move away or the just lower discretionary spend in general. Does that impact our Snacking business or some of the other segments we're in. And there is a little bit of that dynamic that I think we've modeled as we look at the balance of the year.
But we also do well on the flip side where people have to be a little bit more pragmatic in decision-making or they may be trading down from other categories into a category like soup, as an example. And traditionally speaking, one of the last things to always come off the list or some of the comfort items that we have in our snacking bundle. And so, I think although there will be some puts and takes, I feel pretty good about the balance of how our portfolio hold up in that kind of economic dynamic and profile. 
And as you rightfully said, it's a little bit given the duration of this period, it's a little bit of new territory that we're watching very, very closely and trying to make sure that those expectations are consistent with what we're seeing. But we've put a lot of thought into that and trying to reflect that in our outlook for the balance of the year. But I think, overall, I'd say a fairly balanced outlook."

But as we navigated through Q1, we anticipated that we were going to have some supply challenges in select areas. And so although you see a decline in the first quarter, it's fairly surgical in nature. It really is against the places where we knew that we were going to be in a position where it was going to be a little bit harder to meet demand. At the same time, what we don't want to do is go below certain threshold levels that are going to put in any way, shape or form a jeopardy the progress that we've made in kind of the first kind of acquiring, but more importantly, the retention of a lot of these incremental households. 
And so even in Q1 on business, important businesses like Goldfish or Soup, Chunky in particular, if you haven't seen our Chunky ads, I'm not sure you've had any media on, but it's been really effective as you heard in our shares. And we want to make sure that we keep the pressure on there. I do think as supply comes back fully, and as we roll through the balance of the year, you'll see it more as a return to normality. And just to put that in perspective, our marketing and sales in the first quarter was right around 8% of net sales. We would prefer that from an ongoing basis to be in the 9% to 10% range. And I think that's closer to what you'll see as we go forward through the year. But Mick, maybe you can give a little bit of color on that outlook."

So we, in essence, contemplated a bit of that is a necessity as we were already looking at the outlook for the balance of the year. So it's not a materially different number as it relates to the back half of the year. 
Perhaps a few puts and takes in different places. Remember, as I said, too, what's really important as we navigate this is to be quite strategic and how we're working through these pricing actions, making sure that we're mindful of certain thresholds and the second wave that we have coming in January reflects that as well.

And although we're, in some cases, lapping pretty healthy growth from a year ago. And when you think about certain categories, that's why we continue to kind of look through this lens of 2-year growth rates, they're very healthy across the board. And I think for us, it's more of a function of some of those macro behavioral trends that are perhaps bigger than some of the policy impacted trends that are continuing to elevate demand. 
We've talked about a lot this idea of the stability of in-home eating even as people are going back to work, a lot of companies, organizations in the hybrid model are still maintaining a portion of their work time at home, which is a huge correlation to our Soup business and our Snack business. In addition to that, even on the cooking side, it's changing. It's evolving a little bit from where it was in the heart of the pandemic to now where much more important in this particular moment is the speed of preparation, we've seen a very distinct move to very quick. How do I get dinner done in 15 minutes? Actually, 18 minutes appears to be the kind of target for most consumers as we've done a lot of research on this. 
But that also plays quite well into our portfolio as a dynamic that's very, very helpful as you think about our condensed soup businesses like Cream of Mushroom, Cream of Chicken or Prego pasta sauces. I think also elasticity continues to be a lot more favorable than what we've seen historically. And so I think that in addition to those macro trends, are what's keeping an elevated level on demand. I do think, as I said, to Ken's answer, there are some places where you do see some movement. But I think on the kids brands, in particular, brands like Goldfish as an example, are very, very healthy. One of the stronger sustained periods we had if you from my comments earlier, we've continued to do very, very well. 
And what's really interesting on businesses like that is, if you remember back in the pandemic, we were feeling a lot of pressure on the reduction on away-from-home snacking, so our portion packs are on-the-go packs. What's interesting now is we've kind of held on to the bigger bulk pack demand, but we've also seen a resurgence in those portion packs as kids are going back to school and activities are starting to come back. So I think, there's always a variety of drivers influencing it. But I would say more broadly, the pros are outweighing any of the cons. And so that the net of that all is a generally positive outlook as it relates to sustainment of elevated levels of demand going forward."

I don't know, if it's possible, but at what point do you think your inflation will lap and turn closer to low single digit.

So it's not a change compared to what our previous expectation was and is very much in line with what we've been looking at for fiscal 2022 all along. If you look at -- to your point, the underlying drivers there, you see about 6% in Q1, high single digits for the full year. So you do have that accelerating pattern throughout the year. Why is that, that's largely driven by the fact that obviously our fiscal year breaks over 2 calendar years. And we have various contracts that reset in the second half of our fiscal year. 
So you see particularly in the January time frame, a lot of the ingredients and pack contracts that are being reset. And they obviously reset of a different commodity environment that they previously were [indiscernible] that. And that's what we are experiencing. So as a result, various of these contracts are obviously or at least, call it, a calendar year basis. So we are experiencing that I expect to do out the next calendar year. And maybe the other point to add to that is if you look at our overall coverage, is we're probably currently about 85% covered, which is a little bit higher than typically, but because of the volatility in the current environment, we thought that's prudent."

So maybe just 2 other small points to build on Mick's answer. One is how long do you think it is until we begin to lap and although I would say that's always a little bit tough to predict in the environment we're in right now. But -- as you can imagine, some of the contract elements that we're talking about that are on a calendar year, you have the natural kind of carryover into the first half of fiscal '23 for us that would be that same contract. So as you think about relief going forward, and you can imagine, too, that in this kind of volatile environment, we're working really closely to supplier -- with suppliers to make sure, if there is a dramatic change that we can reflect that without having to necessarily wait 12 months to kind of revisit a contract. 
So we've created a lot of that dynamic that should help us be a little bit more nimble, but that's the dynamic that Mick's talking about. But I just would say to counter that, though, although I do -- as we pointed out, some pressure in Q2, even though you have that escalating inflation, you also have an escalation of our mitigating actions. And so, as we look at the back half of the year, we actually feel very good about how we line up our position versus inflation, arguably better than we'd necessarily do in Q2 as we're in that kind of transitional moment. So although on the one hand, there will be likely more inflation. I also fully expect us to be in a much better position to mitigate it, and we're feeling very good, and that's a big part of the confidence that we have in the balance of the year and why we're pointing to a more favorable back half."

So as I said before, I think what you have the benefit of in the second half is kind of all of those tools coming to bear. So even though the backdrop is higher inflation, we've got more of the pieces of the mitigation in place. And so yes, we look at the back half and we feel good about where we are. Also, of course, we're going to start lapping some easier comps that will just give the overall lower base benefit of being able to lap that. But yes, we're overall feeling good about that, Chris, going into the second half."

I'm glad you asked that question because it will allow me to give a little bit of color on a bit of the dynamic in Q2 as it relates to share, which I think is important to -- I mentioned it in my comments, but I wanted to give you a littl",687,"Yes. Yes. Great. I'm glad you asked that question because it will allow me to give a little bit of color on a bit of the dynamic in Q2 as it relates to share, which I think is important to -- I mentioned it in my comments, but I wanted to give you a little bit more flavor on that. So essentially, what I would tell you is in the first quarter, you had a dynamic that we're certainly not unfamiliar with where we were going into the quarter with a fair amount of inventory, demand remained elevated and so you saw a stronger consumption number. Now part of that, again, was the lap of the inventory component. 
But if you look at our top-line, we were down about 4% versus a year ago with an in-market consumption of 2%. You have a little bit of unmeasured channel elements that are there. But let's more or less talk about 6-point delta between the 2. The way we see this is a little bit more -- half to a little bit more than half was related to the inventory lap and then the balance was really supply. So in the places that we had supply pressure, that's really anchored in a couple of categories. And a little bit of the labor issue that we talk about is not just our labor, but some of our suppliers' labor. 
So you have some material pressure. So if I were to break the businesses apart a little bit and give you a little more detail, our Snacks business inherently is more labor-intensive, just the nature of the manufacturing. So a little bit more of that supply-related pressure is on our snack businesses and in particular, several of our Snyder's-Lance businesses. So late July, we talked about as well as Snyder's and Hanover and also pressure on our Lance sandwich crackers. 
Pepperidge Farm were generally in a better position, although cookies is a little bit pressured as it is pretty labor-intensive as well. So those 4 categories are where we're seeing the pressure. On Meals & Beverages, it's much more about the material availability as it relates to certain parts of Prego and aluminum cans in particular on V8. And so that's where you see the pressure occurring. 
As you go into Q2, labor is recovering. And so we already see production levels going up as that labor moves into place. It is important to note that when we hire someone, in the manufacturing role. It takes about 4 to 6 weeks for a new hire to begin to kind of deliver at an effectiveness level that allows us to really realize the additional labor. So it does take a little bit of time. But as we go into Q2, I think the dynamic you should expect is that we'll be recovering on inventory levels, recovering on our supply, probably taking us some time in certain areas. But what you will see is a little bit of short-term pressure on share and in-market consumption in a couple of the places where we have gotten lower on inventory. 
It's really those businesses that I just described, we see it very short term in nature. That share pressure is not related to anything that is brand-driven, consumer demand-driven. It really is a very, very high correlation to where the supply is pressured. It's also -- it happens to be where you're also a little bit lower on investment as we're managing through that. But as we come into the second half, we expect those to be back in a stronger position and a really healthy back half.
And if you think about the last couple of years on our business, we've done very, very well and has made a major priority on driving growth and end market performance, and that doesn't change even with a little bit of the bump that we expect here in the near-term. And as we get through the balance of the year, we think a lot of great momentum as we exit '22 and head into '23 as well."
