HP had an exceptional start to the year with strong revenue and profit growth in Q1. We are benefiting from the strength of our portfolio and the diversity of our businesses. We continue to evolve our business model to meet changing customer needs while expanding into adjacencies to grow our addressable market. And we are driving an aggressive transformation agenda by rigorously managing our costs while investing to drive future growth. 
Simply put, we are doing what we said we would do and our strategy is working. 
Our Q1 results are impressive across many dimensions. We delivered strong top line growth with net revenue up 7% to $15.6 billion and balanced growth across Personal Systems and Print. 
We delivered strong bottom line growth with $295 million in non-GAAP operating profit dollar flow through and double-digit profit growth in both Personal Systems and Print. We delivered non-GAAP net earnings of $1.2 billion, up 24% with $0.92 of non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share. 
This is up $0.27 compared to Q1 of last year. 
And finally, we delivered $908 million of free cash flow in the quarter. We also remain committed to a significant return of capital. We returned $1.6 billion to shareholders, including $1.4 billion in share repurchases and $250 million in dividends. Over the last 3 quarters, we have returned $4.4 billion to shareholders and repurchased approximately 13% of our shares. 
At the onset of the pandemic, I told our teams that this is a time when strong companies find ways to emerge stronger. And last quarter results show that exactly what we are doing. HP's broad and differentiated portfolio and leadership across consumer and commercial markets, make us more resilient across business cycles. We continue to capitalize on the strong demand for our offering, particularly in consumer to drive profitable growth. 
Yes, the impact of the pandemic is ongoing and the pace of the economic recovery remains uneven. We are continuing to manage our business in a disciplined and prudent manner while remaining agile in the face of change. This means capitalizing on opportunities when they arise while also managing volatility when it occurs. 
As we balance all of these dynamics, we have stayed focused on executing against our strategy to advance our leadership in Personal Systems and Print by optimizing our core and expanding into attractive adjacencies. industries with our technology to create new businesses in areas like 3D, industrial print and microfluidics. And transform the way we work to be more digitally enabled and cost efficient. 
Our continued progress against these strategic priorities is reflected in the strong revenue and profit growth, free cash flow and capital returns we delivered in Q1 and in the positive momentum in each of our businesses. 
I will start with Personal Systems, which had another strong quarter with revenue of $10.6 billion. We shipped more than 18 million units and generated operating margins of 7.1%. Consumer revenue growth accelerated to 34% with consumer premium up 34%, gaming up 29% and consumer accessories, up 22%. And on top of this, Chromebook revenue quadruple. 
We exited the quarter with a record backlog as we continue to operate with component supply shortages that are expected to constrain our growth through at least Q3. It's clear we have entered a new era of innovation and growth for PCs. They have become an essential part of how people work, learn and play. And we continue to innovate to create new experiences. 
It's funny to say that the PC is personal once again. And we are seeing this in the awards we are receiving. At last month, Consumer Electronics Show, we introduced new devices and solutions to power hybrid work environment and personal creative studios. And we were recognized with over 70 awards for our latest launches, including our new 5G-enabled products. 
Looking ahead, we expect to see continued PC unit growth through 2021, which we anticipate will create additional opportunities for us to drive profitable growth. We are also accelerating in attractive adjacencies, such as gaming and peripherals. As with every market in which we play, our goal is to be a leader in this space. This week, we announced the acquisition of HyperX, the market leader in gaming headsets. The addition of expands our presence in the growing peripheral market with a brand that is trusted by gamings around the world. 
Our existing strength in gaming hardware, combined with portfolio spanning gaming headsets, microphones and other peripherals will further expand our ecosystem and create another growth engine in Personal Systems. 
Much like Personal Systems, trend is off to a terrific start to the year. This quarter demonstrated the power of print to help people learn, create and perform with 7% revenue growth, 16% unit growth and 32% profit growth. 
In Q1, our Printing business generated revenue of $5 billion and operating profit of $1 billion. Similar to the Personal Systems business, we remain supply constrained, particularly in consumer printer hardware and supplies. While the COVID-19 related impacts on our manufacturing and supply chain have diminished, we anticipate these constraints to continue into the third quarter. 
HP is outperforming its printing peers and remain uniquely well positioned given our leadership across both consumer and commercial print. Our strong consumer business is a clear competitive advantage as hybrid work and school becomes the norm. We have seen that people who didn't have home printers went and bought them and people sign up for Instant Ink in record numbers, accelerating and already growing part of our business. In Instant Ink we added 1 million new subscribers, surprising 9 million enrollees in the first quarter. 
Commercial print improved in Q1 with most product categories showing sequential revenue growth. In Q4, total print market units grew 6%. We continue to expect a gradual recovery in the overall commercial print market, though the price might be an even given the very pace of economic recovery. And we expect that the strength in consumer will gradually subside as more schools and offices reopen. 
We continue to execute on our strategy to modernize print and evolve our print business models. In Q1, we roll out our end-to-end platform strategy called HP Plus that combines convenient Instant Ink and HP Markup Services with innovative hardware. It's early days but we are already seeing positive adoption. In the coming quarters, we will be rolling HP Plus out more broadly across multiple markets and product lines. 
New value propositions like HP Plus are indicative of the opportunities ahead as we continue to innovate to meet evolving customer needs. This also applies to our contractual businesses, such as managed, print services. Where we see attractive opportunities to deliver services designed for the hybrid workforce of the future. 
One example is our HP Flex worker service. This service can be added to a company existing MPS contract to help remote workers maintain their productivity. This means being able to seamlessly print scan and copies securely, all while working from home. With leadership in both consumer and commercial and a strong track record of innovation HP is positioned to define and lead the future of printing in a post pandemic world. 
In city printing and industrial graphics, we continue to innovate across the portfolio to position ourselves for future growth. Customers continue to use Multi Jet fusion for production grade output, and we are seeing more than 30% growth in the number of 3D printed parts across our customer base. We are also seeing strong early traction in our new molded fiber business that leverages our 3D printing technology to create an end-to-end service for quick, customized and environmentally sustainable packaging. In industrial printing, we continue to see growth in digital labels and packaging, with double-digit growth in impressions and square meters printed. 
Georgia Pacific, 1 of the world's largest packaging and paper goods providers is deploying their third Inkjet web press to expand their digital printing business. This is a great milestone and validation of our technology. We are excited for the disruptive potential in this sector as our innovative technology opens up entirely new possibilities in personalization and digital manufacturing. We are doing all this while continuing to transform the company to unlock value and become a leaner, more digitally enabled company. Our transformation journey continues to be ahead of plan. We have significantly reduced structural costs and driven productivity savings. 
At the same time, we are enabling enhanced digitization, and we are shifting investments to attractive growth areas where we see opportunities for us to continue driving innovation and long-term sustainable growth. We are focused on both reducing structural costs and accelerating investments for the future. 
Recently, we announced several new appointments to further strengthen HP's innovation capabilities and support its long-term growth strategy. Tavi Baweja joined as our Chief Strategy and Incubation Officer, and Tolga had joined HP as Chief Technology Officer. 
In this role, they will drive cutting-edge research and incubate new business opportunities, working together with the leadership team. 
And last week, we named Marie Myers as our Chief Financial Officer. Marie is a veteran of HP, having held a number of leadership positions at the company, including as our controller and most recently, as our Chief Transformation Officer.  Marie and I have worked together for many years, and she's a truly outstanding leader. 
I know you will all enjoy getting to know her better. 
Overall, I am very pleased with the way we have started the year. We built on our momentum from the end of 2020, and our teams are performing at a very high level. And on top of delivering strong results, we are also staying true to HP's values. 
Last quarter, HP was recognized by Newsweek as America's most responsible company for the second straight year. And we appear on the Barron's list of 100 most sustainable companies for the third straight year. 
In December, we were named 1 of the 10 best managed companies by the Wall Street Journal. This accolade simply means that we continue to ensure that making a sustainable impact remains an integrated part of our business strategy. Let me close by saying Q1 was a strong quarter that increases our confidence about the opportunities ahead. We have a diverse and resilient business model. We are leading in our core Print and Personal Systems market while taking the steps necessary to create and scale new businesses for the future. 
And our strong cash flow generation provides us flexibility to return significant capital to shareholders and reinvest in businesses while also exploring disciplined M&A. We believe this is a time when strong successful companies like HP can get stronger. We are not running our business to achieve incremental improvements. We are driving a much bolder transformation agenda that will expand our portfolio, fuel innovation and unlock attractive new sources of long-term growth and value creation. That is our ambition. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Marie, who will take you through the details of the quarter and our fiscal year outlook. Marie, over to you."

I'm excited to take on the CFO role after more than 2 decades at HP. I'm looking forward to getting to know the investment community as I settle into my new role. 
It's clear that HP remains focused on executing each quarter while also positioning the company for the future. And our results demonstrate this balance of delivering in the near-term while investing in growth and leading through this dynamic environment. Q1 was a very strong quarter, we grew revenue, non-GAAP operating profit dollars faster than revenue and non-GAAP EPS even faster. We are off to a strong start for the year. And overall, we are very pleased with our results. 
Now let's look at the details of the first quarter. Q1 net revenue was $15.6 billion, up 7%, both nominally and in constant currency. Regionally, in constant currency, Americas increased 17%, EMEA increased 3% and APJ decreased 5%. Gross margin was 21.2% and up 1.6 points year-on-year. The increase was driven by favorable pricing and commodity costs in Personal Systems and favorable pricing in printing, particularly in consumer hardware. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.8 billion, up $157 million. The increase in operating expenses was driven by investments to position for future growth and an increase in certain onetime expenses. 
Non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $63 million for the quarter, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share increased 42% to $0.92 with a diluted share count of approximately 1.3 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes a net expense totaling $120 million, primarily related to restructuring and other charges, amortization of intangible assets, other tax adjustments and partially offset by nonoperating retirement related credits. 
As a result, Q1 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.83.
Turning to segment performance. In Q1, peripheral systems benefited from strong demand related to working and learning from home. With revenue of $10.6 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Our top line remained constrained due to industry-wide component shortages. Drilling into the details, we continue to see differing results by customer segment, with consumer revenue up 34%, while commercial revenue was down 6%. By product category, revenue was up 23% for notebooks, down 18% for desktops and down 36% for workstations. 
Strong demand for notebooks drove total unit growth of 15% year-over-year, with Chromebooks representing 16% of our total Personal Systems units as the need for technology and education continued to grow. Personal Systems delivered a record $758 million in operating profit and operating margins of 7.1%, much higher than our outlook. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to favorable pricing, including fewer promotions and favorable commodity cost. 
In Print, our results reflected very strong execution as we continue to benefit from the strength of our portfolio as a leader across both consumer and commercial print. Q1 total Print revenue was $5 billion, up 7%. By customer segment, consumer revenue was up 55%, with units up 18%, and commercial revenue was down 11% and flat in units. 
In total, hardware units were very strong at 11.1 million units, up 16%. Supplies revenue was $3.1 billion, up 3%.  In the first quarter, ongoing consumer demand, combined with favorable pricing and inventory replenishment, more than offset lower commercial demand. Sequentially, supplies revenue was flat. 
Print operating profit was very strong at $1 billion, and operating margins were 19.8%. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to favorable pricing, including fewer promotions. 
Let me now turn to our transformation efforts, and specifically our cost savings opportunities. In Q1, about 700 people exited the company as we continue to be ahead of plan against our 3 year $1.2 billion gross run rate structural cost-reduction plan. During the quarter, we continued to execute real estate site optimization activities at 6 sites that are aligned with our location and mobility strategies. 
In addition, we have achieved additional efficiency improvements in customer service and support as we continue to shift to digitization and automation. Finally, we continue to be focused on further digital enablement and driving a lean cost structure as it provides us the flexibility to reinvest in other areas of our business. 
Shifting to cash flow and capital allocation. First quarter cash flow for operations and free cash flow were solid at $1 billion and $908 million, respectively. In Q1, the cash conversion cycle was minus 30 days. 
Sequentially, the cash conversion cycle was flat as growth in inventory, primarily driven by strategic buys and finished goods drove increases in days of inventory, offset by increases in days payable outstanding. 
Days sales outstanding also decreased during the quarter. For the quarter, we returned a total of $1.6 billion to shareholders, which represented 179% of free cash flow. This included $1.4 billion in share repurchases and and $250 million in cash dividends. 
Looking forward, we expect to continue buying back shares at elevated levels of at least $1 billion per quarter in the coming quarters unless higher return opportunities emerge. Looking forward to the second quarter and the rest of fiscal '21, keep the following in mind related to our overall financial outlook. 
While we expect year-over-year revenue growth in FY '21 to reflect our continued progress on our strategy, it is also important to note that growth trends in Q2 and Q3 will also reflect the easier year-over-year comparisons due to the unusual COVID related impacts we saw last year. And in the second half of the year, we expect to see a more normalization of the market environment as more people return to the office and kids returned to school and as the pricing environment normalizes. 
Our outlook range is broader than usual given the current market environment. We are modeling multiple scenarios related to supply availability, pricing dynamics and the pace of economic reopening. Our comments for Q2 are the following: in Personal Systems, our backlog remains elevated as demand in consumer and education remains very strong, and we expect industry-wide component constraints to continue to negatively impact our ability to meet demand especially for notebooks, which will constrain top line growth. 
We expect the cost from the overall basket of commodities to be slightly higher compared to Q1 levels. And from a margin perspective, we expect Q2 operating margins to be in the range of Q1 margins. 
In Printing, from a demand perspective, we expect to continue to see strong demand for home printing as well as the continued economic pressure in commercial printing. We expect to have to navigate supply constraints and the need to replenish stock so that our ecosystem of partners are well positioned to satisfy the strong demand that we see in printers and supplies. 
We expect that our operating margin for Q2 to be at the high end of our long-term range of 16% to 18%. Taking these considerations into account we are providing the following guidance for Q2 and FY '21. 
We expect second quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.84 to $0.90. And second quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.82 to $0.88. We expect FY '21 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.15 a to $3.25. And FY '21 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.98 to $3.08. 
For FY '21, we expect our free cash flow to be at least $4 billion. 
And now I would like to hand it back to the operator and open the call for your questions."

I was wondering, Enrique, can you talk a bit about sustainability and sort of beyond the quarter that you've guided to? And that's 1 of the big questions I think people have right now. 
Maybe if you can -- you put it to shortages in PCs lasting until third quarter. So maybe you can talk on the PC side a little bit about what you see long-term for the market and what might support the PC business sort of in future quarters. And then if you could turn to printing, if you can talk a bit about what Print Plus means for the long-term model and how you see that impacting margins as well as discussing a bit because I think maybe it's underappreciated how the shift to Inkjet is going to help margins long-term since you own the whole Inkjet stack and have to partner with Canon for laser. 
So if you could maybe address those 2 parts that is my -- completes my question."

So let me start with sustainability of the momentum that we see. And I would say that we are very optimistic about what we -- what are our expectations for the market for the coming quart",486,"Okay. Thank you, Shannon, and I will try to answer all your points. So let me start with sustainability of the momentum that we see. And I would say that we are very optimistic about what we -- what are our expectations for the market for the coming quarters. We think that many of the underlying trends that are driving demand today are going to stay. 
I think the pandemic has made technology clear necessary for people to work, to entertain, to live. And this is going to continue to drive very strong demand for PCs and for home printers for the foreseeable future, but especially for PC. 
We also think that as offices will reopen, we are going to see an increase of demand on the PC space because will have to invest on PCs again to make their employees productive. And we are going to continue to see a shift towards notebooks that also helps on the demand side as the renewal cycles are shorter. We also think that the need to -- the hybrid model of working between office and home, opens new opportunities for us on the printing side to offer new services, create new services by combining both. 
So overall, again, we see that this is creating an opportunity for us not only to leverage new opportunities, but really to continue to drive change and to continue to gain momentum. 
If I go now to the second part of your question on PCs. We expect to continue to see very strong demand for PCs in the coming quarters. And this strong demand is what is creating the supplies, the component shortages that you were mentioning. We have provided strong guidance today, both for the quarter and for the year. And this is based, of course, on the visibility that we have today for components, what we think we are going to be able to hit if we get more components, we could do even better. 
And then your final question on Print. As you know, we launched HP Plus during last quarter, the reception has been very positive in terms of both adoption of the end-to-end model and also feedback from customers in terms of the value proposition and feedback from partners. So going, I would say, we are optimistic about the results we have seen. And as you know, we are going to expand into more countries and more categories during the coming months until we complete the rollout in the middle of 2022. 
You were also asking about the impact on margins. Let me start there, and maybe Marie will complement that. Clearly, we see a benefit from the mix moving into India later because as you know, we end the full end-to-end system. But this quarter, we are also seeing a strong benefit from pricing. Especially on hardware that is really helping to increase the profitability on print."

Or are you expecting it because you expect margins to go down to lower levels in the second half? And then I have a follow-up, please."

In fact, we expect revenue growth in FY '21 and EPS to be up 38% to 43%, and free cash flow growth as well. So while, to your point, this is front-end loaded in the first half, the second half EPS growth is actually 23% to 32% of the 111 that we actually delivered last year. And this actually includes earnings growth as well as the benefit of lower shares. 
So given the current environment, as you could imagine, we are modeling multiple scenarios for the second half. So look, all in all, we believe that this is a prudent guide based on what we know today. And clearly, if we can do better, we absolutely will."

So I presume your stock is going down on the corporate side since demand is much weaker and your channel inventory in dollars is going up on the consumer side, and that's obviously very, very favorable. But you talked about this being a benefit last quarter, this being a benefit this quarter, that's potentially being a benefit next quarter. I'd like to understand exactly what that benefit is. And then maybe you could kind of zoom out a bit and just talk about how we should think about normalized supplies growth. I think over the last 8 or 9 years, it's gone down about 4% per year. The aspiration was to get to flat supplies growth. I think it took you a little longer to get there. 
You haven't really provided an update on how you think about supplies growth sort of in a more normalized environment, how should we think about that?"

So that's -- this is where we are today. And all this is driven by the very strong demand that we continue to see especially on our home products.

So Tony, looking at supplies performance, there's sort of really 3 key dynamics to discuss. First of all, ongoing demand in consumer supplies with work-from-home and learn-from-home, and there are ongoing challenges in commercial print, as you know. 
And then secondly, there's that favorable pricing environment, which was actually a tailwind. And then thirdly, the year-over-year compares also benefited from that replenishment of stock which was consistent with what we had indicated on the call in Q4. 
Now if you adjust for the impact of inventory movements, we estimate that supplies revenue was down roughly a 1% year-on-year. As you know, we have a multi-tiered channel. So this is our best estimate based on the data we have, including our estimates for product across the channel and end-user stock. So this replenishment should have a short-term benefit to supplies revenue."

So we had a very strong quarter in absolute terms on PCs, revenue growth, unit growth, profit growth, but we didn't on relative terms. And being as competitive as we are, this is not something that we are satisfied about. As I explained before, we are looking at what can we do and what will we do to improve our relative performance. We have already taken some actions to do that by increasing inventory and changing how the connections that we have with certain component providers, and this will be helping us to improve our performance going forward. 
We are really using this as a catalyst to optimize even further our operational capabilities, and this is what great company too and what we will continue to do because, again, we like to win, and this is what we will continue to do going forward. 
So having said that, I think we are close to time. So let me use this as an opportunity to wrap up. First of all, I want to repeat some of the comments I made during the prepared remarks. 
We are doing what we said we would do. And our strategy is working. We have had a very strong start of the year, and we are confident in the projections that we have for '21 and beyond. We see growth opportunities in our core markets, in the adjacencies and also in the new businesses that we are creating. And we are really leveraging the opportunities that we see to accelerate our strategy, accelerate our growth, which gives us great confidence in the future of the company. 
So again, thank you for joining us today and looking forward to continue to talk to all of you in the future. Thank you."

HP had an exceptional start to the year with strong revenue and profit growth in Q1. We are benefiting from the strength of our portfolio and the diversity of our businesses. We continue to evolve our business model to meet changing customer needs while expanding into adjacencies to grow our addressable market. And we are driving an aggressive transformation agenda by rigorously managing our costs while investing to drive future growth. Simply put, we are doing what we said we would do, and our strategy is working. 
Our Q1 results are impressive across many dimensions. We delivered strong top line growth with net revenue up 7% to $15.6 billion and balanced growth across Personal Systems and Print. 
We delivered strong bottom line growth with $295 million in non-GAAP operating profit dollar flow-through and double-digit profit growth in both Personal Systems and Print. We delivered non-GAAP net earnings of $1.2 billion, up 24% with $0.92 of non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share. This is up $0.27 compared to Q1 of last year. And finally, we delivered $908 million of free cash flow in the quarter. 
We also remain committed to a significant return of capital. We returned $1.6 billion to shareholders, including $1.4 billion in share repurchases and $250 million in dividends. Over the last 3 quarters, we have returned $4.4 billion to shareholders and repurchased approximately 13% of our shares. 
At the onset of the pandemic, I told our teams that this is a time when strong companies find ways to emerge stronger, and last quarter results show that's exactly what we are doing. HP's broad and differentiated portfolio and leadership across consumer and commercial markets make us more resilient across business cycles. We continue to capitalize on the strong demand for our offering, particularly in Consumer to drive profitable growth. 
Yet, the impact of the pandemic is ongoing and the pace of the economic recovery remains uneven. We are continuing to manage our business in a disciplined and prudent manner while remaining agile in the face of change. This means capitalizing on opportunities when they arise while also managing volatility when it occurs. 
As we balance all of these dynamics, we have stayed focused on executing against our strategy to advance our leadership in Personal Systems and Print by optimizing our core and expanding into attractive adjacencies. We attract industries with our technology to create new businesses in areas like 3D, industrial print and microfluidics and transform the way we work to be more digitally enabled and cost efficient. Our continued progress against these strategic priorities is reflected in the strong revenue and profit growth, free cash flow and capital returns we delivered in Q1 and in the positive momentum in each of our businesses. 
I will start with Personal Systems, which had another strong quarter with revenue of $10.6 billion. We shipped more than 18 million units and generated operating margins of 7.1%. Consumer revenue growth accelerated to 34%, with consumer premium up 34%, gaming up 29% and consumer accessories up 22%. And on top of this, Chromebook revenue quadrupled. 
We exited the quarter with a record backlog as we continue to operate with component supply shortages that are expected to constrain our growth through at least Q3. It's clear we have entered a new era of innovation and growth for PCs. They have become an essential part of how people work, learn and play, and we continue to innovate to create new experiences. 
It's funny to say, but the PC is personal once again. And we are seeing this in the awards we are receiving. At last month's consumer Electronics Show, we introduced new devices and solutions to power hybrid work environment and personal creative studios. And we were recognized with over 70 awards for our latest launches, including our new 5G-enabled products. Looking ahead, we expect to see continued PC unit growth through 2021, which we anticipate will create additional opportunities for us to drive profitable growth. 
We are also accelerating in attractive adjacencies such as gaming and peripherals. As with every market in which we play, our goal is to be a leader in this space. This week, we announced the acquisition of HyperX, the market leader in gaming headsets. The addition of HyperX expands our presence in the growing peripherals market with a brand that is trusted by gamers around the world. Our existing strength in gaming hardware combined with HyperX' portfolio spanning gaming headsets, microphones and other peripherals will further expand our ecosystem and create another growth engine in Personal Systems. 
Much like Personal Systems, Print is off to a terrific start to the year. This quarter demonstrated the power of print to help people learn, create and perform, with 7% revenue growth, 16% unit growth and 32% profit growth. 
In Q1, our Printing business generated revenue of $5 billion and operating profit of $1 billion. Similar to the Personal Systems business, we remain supply constrained, particularly in consumer printer hardware and supplies. While the COVID-19-related impacts on our manufacturing and supply chain have diminished, we anticipate these constraints to continue into the third quarter. 
HP is outperforming its printing peers and remain uniquely well positioned given our leadership across both consumer and commercial print. Our strong Consumer business is a clear competitive advantage as hybrid work and school becomes the norm. We have seen that people who didn't have home printers went and bought them. And people signed up for Instant Ink in record numbers, accelerating an already growing part of our business. In Instant Ink we added 1 million new subscribers, surpassing 9 million enrollees in the first quarter.
Commercial print improved in Q1, with most product categories showing sequential revenue growth. In Q4, total print market units grew 6%. We continue to expect a gradual recovery in the overall commercial print market, although the pace might be uneven given the varying pace of economic recovery. And we expect that the strength in Consumer will gradually subside as more schools and offices reopen. 
We continue to execute on our strategy to modernize Print and evolve our Print business model. In Q1, we rolled out our end-to-end platform strategy called HP+ that combines convenient Instant Ink and HP Smart App services with innovative hardware. It's early days, but we are already seeing positive adoption. In the coming quarters, we will be rolling HP+ out more broadly across multiple markets and product lines. 
New value propositions like HP+ are indicative of the opportunities ahead as we continue to innovate to meet evolving customer needs. This also applies to our contractual businesses such as Managed Print Services, where we see attractive opportunities to deliver services designed for the hybrid workforce of the future. One example is our HP Flexworker Service. This service can be added to a company's existing MPS contract to help remote workers maintain their productivity. This means being able to seamlessly print, scan and copy securely all while working from home. With leadership in both consumer and commercial and a strong track record of innovation, HP is positioned to define and lead the future of printing in a post-pandemic world. 
In 3D printing and industrial graphics, we continue to innovate across the portfolio to position ourselves for future growth. Customers continue to use Multi Jet Fusion for production-grade output, and we are seeing more than 30% growth in the number of 3D-printed parts across our customer base. We are also seeing strong early traction in our new molded fiber business that leverages our 3D printing technology to create an end-to-end service for quick, customized and environmentally sustainable packaging. 
In industrial printing, we continue to see growth in digital labels and packaging, with double-digit growth in impressions and square meters printed. Georgia-Pacific, one of the world's largest packaging and paper goods providers, is deploying their third Inkjet web press to expand their digital printing business. This is a great milestone and validation of our technology. We are excited for the disruptive potential in this sector as our innovative technology opens up entirely new possibilities in personalization and digital manufacturing. 
We are doing all this while continuing to transform the company to unlock value and become a leaner, more digitally enabled company. Our transformation journey continues to be ahead of plan. We have significantly reduced structural costs and driven productivity savings. At the same time, we are enabling enhanced digitization, and we are shifting investments to attractive growth areas where we see opportunities for us to continue driving innovation and long-term sustainable growth. We are focused on both reducing structural costs and accelerating investments for the future. 
Recently, we announced several new appointments to further strengthen HP's innovation capabilities and support its long-term growth strategy. Savi Baveja joined as our Chief Strategy and Incubation Officer, and Tolga Kurtoglu has joined HP as Chief Technology Officer. In these roles, they will drive cutting-edge research and incubate new business opportunities, working together with the leadership team. 
And last week, we named Marie Myers as our Chief Financial Officer. Marie is a veteran of HP, having held a number of leadership positions at the company, including as our controller and most recently, as our Chief Transformation Officer. Marie and I have worked together for many years, and she's a truly outstanding leader. I know you will all enjoy getting to know her better. 
Overall, I am very pleased with the way we have started the year. We built on our momentum from the end of 2020, and our teams are performing at a very high level. And on top of delivering strong results, we are also staying true to HP's values. Last quarter, HP was recognized by Newsweek as America's most responsible company for the second straight year. And we appeared on the Barron's list of 100 Most Sustainable Companies for the third straight year. In December, we were named one of the 10 best managed companies by The Wall Street Journal. These accolades simply mean that we continue to ensure that making a sustainable impact remains an integrated part of our business strategy. 
Let me close by saying Q1 was a strong quarter that increases our confidence about the opportunities ahead. We have a diverse and resilient business model. We are leading in our core print and personal systems market while taking the steps necessary to create and scale new businesses for the future. 
And our strong cash flow generation provides us flexibility to return significant capital to shareholders and reinvest in businesses while also exploring disciplined M&A. We believe this is a time when strong successful companies like HP can get stronger. We are not running our business to achieve incremental improvements. We are driving a much bolder transformation agenda that will expand our portfolio, fuel innovation and unlock attractive new sources of long-term growth and value creation. That is our ambition. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Marie, who will take you through the details of the quarter and our fiscal year outlook. Marie, over to you."

I'm excited to take on the CFO role after more than 2 decades at HP. I'm looking forward to getting to know the investment community as I settle into my new role. 
It's clear that HP remains focused on executing each quarter while also positioning the company for the future. And our results demonstrate this balance of delivering in the near term while investing in growth and leading through this dynamic environment. Q1 was a very strong quarter, we grew revenue, non-GAAP operating profit dollars faster than revenue and non-GAAP EPS even faster. We are off to a strong start for the year. And overall, we are very pleased with our results. 
Now let's look at the details of the first quarter. Q1 net revenue was $15.6 billion, up 7%, both nominally and in constant currency. Regionally, in constant currency, Americas increased 17%, EMEA increased 3% and APJ decreased 5%. Gross margin was 21.2%, up 1.6 points year-on-year. The increase was driven by favorable pricing and commodity costs in Personal Systems and favorable pricing in Printing, particularly in consumer hardware. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.8 billion, up $157 million. The increase in operating expenses was driven by investments to position for future growth and an increase in certain onetime expenses. 
Non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $63 million for the quarter. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share increased 42% to $0.92 with a diluted share count of approximately 1.3 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes a net expense totaling $120 million primarily related to restructuring and other charges, amortization of intangible assets, other tax adjustments and partially offset by nonoperating retirement-related credits. As a result, Q1 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.83.
Turning to segment performance. In Q1, peripheral systems benefited from strong demand related to working and learning from home with revenue of $10.6 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Our top line remained constrained due to industry-wide component shortages. Drilling into the details, we continue to see differing results by customer segment, with consumer revenue up 34% while commercial revenue was down 6%. By product category, revenue was up 23% for notebooks, down 18% for desktops and down 36% for workstations. 
Strong demand for notebooks drove total unit growth of 15% year-over-year, with Chromebooks representing 16% of our total Personal Systems units as the need for technology and education continue to grow. Personal Systems delivered a record $758 million in operating profit and operating margins of 7.1%, much higher than our outlook. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to favorable pricing, including fewer promotions and favorable commodity cost. 
In Print, our results reflected very strong execution as we continue to benefit from the strength of our portfolio as a leader across both consumer and commercial print. Q1 total Print revenue was $5 billion, up 7%. By customer segment, consumer revenue was up 55% with units up 18%, and commercial revenue was down 11% and flat in units. In total, hardware units were very strong at 11.1 million units, up 16%. 
Supplies revenue was $3.1 billion, up 3%. In the first quarter, ongoing consumer demand, combined with favorable pricing and inventory replenishment, more than offset lower commercial demand. Sequentially, Supplies revenue was flat. 
Print operating profit was very strong at $1 billion, and operating margins were 19.8%. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to favorable pricing, including fewer promotions. 
Let me now turn to our transformation efforts and specifically, our cost savings opportunities. In Q1, about 700 people exited the company as we continue to be ahead of plan against our 3-year $1.2 billion gross run rate structural cost reduction plan. During the quarter, we continue to execute real estate site optimization activities at 6 sites that are aligned with our location and mobility strategies. 
In addition, we have achieved additional efficiency improvements in customer service and support as we continue to shift to digitization and automation. 
Finally, we continue to be focused on further digital enablement and driving a lean cost structure as it provides us the flexibility to reinvest in other areas of our business. 
Shifting to cash flow and capital allocation. First quarter cash flow from operations and free cash flow were solid at $1 billion and $908 million, respectively. In Q1, the cash conversion cycle was minus 30 days. Sequentially, the cash conversion cycle was flat as growth in inventory, primarily driven by strategic buys and finished goods, drove increases in days of inventory offset by increases in days payable outstanding. Days sales outstanding also decreased during the quarter. 
For the quarter, we returned a total of $1.6 billion to shareholders, which represented 179% of free cash flow. This included $1.4 billion in share repurchases and $250 million in cash dividends. 
Looking forward, we expect to continue buying back shares at elevated levels of at least $1 billion per quarter in the coming quarters unless higher-return opportunities emerge. 
Looking forward to the second quarter and the rest of fiscal '21, keep the following in mind related to our overall financial outlook. While we expect year-over-year revenue growth in FY '21 to reflect our continued progress on our strategy, it is also important to note that growth trends in Q2 and Q3 will also reflect the easier year-over-year comparisons due to the unusual COVID-related impacts we saw last year. And in the second half of the year, we expect to see a more normalization of the market environment as more people return to the office and kids return to school and as the pricing environment normalizes. 
Our outlook range is broader than usual given the current market environment. We are modeling multiple scenarios related to supply availability, pricing dynamics and the pace of economic reopening. Our comments for Q2 are the following: in Personal Systems, our backlog remains elevated as demand in consumer and education remains very strong, and we expect industry-wide component constraints to continue to negatively impact our ability to meet demand, especially for notebooks, which will constrain top line growth. We expect the cost from the overall basket of commodities to be slightly higher compared to Q1 levels. And from a margin perspective, we expect Q2 operating margins to be in the range of Q1 margins. 
In Printing, from a demand perspective, we expect to continue to see strong demand for home printing as well as the continued economic pressure in commercial printing. We expect to have to navigate supply constraints and the need to replenish stock so that our ecosystem of partners are well positioned to satisfy the strong demand that we see in printers and supplies. We expect that our operating margin for Q2 to be at the high end of our long-term range of 16% to 18%. 
Taking these considerations into account we are providing the following guidance for Q2 and FY '21. We expect second quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.84 to $0.90 and second quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.82 to $0.88. We expect FY '21 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.15 to $3.25 and FY '21 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.98 to $3.08. For FY '21, we expect our free cash flow to be at least $4 billion. 
And now I would like to hand it back to the operator and open the call for your questions."

I was wondering, Enrique, can you talk a bit about sustainability and sort of beyond the quarter that you've guided to? And that's one of the big questions I think people have right now. Maybe if you can -- you've pointed to shortages in PCs lasting until third quarter. So maybe you can talk on the PC side a little bit about what you see long term for the market and what might support the PC business sort of in future quarters. 
And then if you could turn to Printing, if you can talk a bit about what Print Plus means for the long-term model and how you see that impacting margins as well as discussing a bit, because I think maybe it's underappreciated, how the shift to Inkjet is going to help margins long term since you own the whole Inkjet stack and have to partner with Canon for laser. So if you could maybe address those 2 parts, that is my -- completes my question."

W",488,"Thank you, Shannon, and I will try to answer all your points. So let me start with sustainability of the momentum that we see. And I would say that we are very optimistic about what we -- what are our expectations for the market for the coming quarters. We think that many of the underlying trends that are driving demand today are going to stay. I think the pandemic has made technology a clear necessary for people to work, to entertain, to live. And this is going to continue to drive very strong demand for PCs and for home printers for the foreseeable future, but especially for PCs. 
We also think that as offices will reopen, we are going to see an increase of demand on the PC space because CIOs will have to invest on PCs again to make their employees productive. And we are going to continue to see a shift towards notebooks that also helps on the demand side as the renewal cycles are shorter. 
We also think that the need to -- the hybrid model of working between office and home opens new opportunities for us on the printing side to offer new services, create new services by combining both. So overall, again, we see that this is creating an opportunity for us not only to leverage new opportunities, but really to continue to drive change and to continue to gain momentum. 
If I go now to the second part of your question on PCs. We expect to continue to see very strong demand for PCs in the coming quarters. And this strong demand is what is creating the supplies, the component shortages that you were mentioning. We have provided strong guidance today both for the quarter and for the year. And this is based, of course, on the visibility that we have today for components, what we think we are going to be able to hit. If we get more components, we could do even better. 
And then your final question on Print. As you know, we launched HP+ during last quarter. The reception has been very positive in terms of both adoption of the end-to-end model and also feedback from customers in terms of the value proposition and feedback from partners. So going -- I would say, we are optimistic about the results we have seen. And as you know, we are going to expand into more countries and more categories during the coming months until we complete the rollout in the middle of 2022. 
You were also asking about the impact on margins. Let me start there, and maybe Marie will complement that. Clearly, we see a benefit from the mix moving into Inkjet versus laser because, as you know, we own the full end-to-end system. But this quarter, we are also seeing a strong benefit from pricing, especially on hardware, that is really helping to increase the profitability on print."

First, if I look at your guidance for the full year, it implies an EPS decline at the midpoint, down more than 20% in the second half versus the first half.

Because it sounds like you're going to be supply-constrained through potentially Q3. Or are you believing that this very favorable price environment is going to come off? So are you expecting this deceleration because of conservatism? Are you expecting it because of weaker-than-normal sequential revenue growth?

So I presume your stock is going down on the corporate side since demand is much weaker and your channel inventory in dollars is going up on the consumer side, and that's obviously very, very favorable. But you talked about this being a benefit last quarter, this being a benefit this quarter, this potentially being a benefit next quarter. I'd like to understand exactly what that benefit is. 
And then maybe you could kind of zoom out a bit and just talk about how we should think about normalized Supplies growth. I think over the last 8 or 9 years, it's gone down about 4% per year. The aspiration was to get to flat Supplies growth. I think it took you a little longer to get there.

And then secondly, there's that favorable pricing environment, which was actually a tailwind. And then thirdly, the year-over-year compare also benefited from that replenishment of stock, which was consistent with what we had indicated on the call in Q4. 
Now if you adjust for the impact of inventory movements, we estimate that Supplies revenue was down roughly 1% year-on-year. As you know, we have a multi-tiered channel. So this is our best estimate based on the data we have, including our estimates for product across the channel and end-user stock. So this replenishment should have a short-term benefit to Supplies revenue."

We have already taken some actions to do that by increasing inventory and changing how -- the connections that we have with certain component providers, and this will be helping us to improve our performance going forward. We are really using this as a catalyst to optimize even further our operational capabilities. And this is what great companies do and what we will continue to do because, again, we like to win, and this is what we will do -- continue to do going forward. 
So having said that, I think we are close to time so let me use this as an opportunity to wrap up. First of all, I want to repeat some of the comments I made during the prepared remarks. 
We are doing what we said we would do, and our strategy is working. We have had a very strong start of the year, and we are confident in the projections that we have for '21 and beyond. We see growth opportunities in our core markets, in the adjacencies and also in the new businesses that we are creating. And we are really leveraging the opportunities that we see to accelerate our strategy, accelerate our growth, which gives us great confidence in the future of the company.

I want to start by acknowledging the state of the pandemic particularly in countries such as India. We are doing everything we can for our employees, customers and partners during this difficult time. 
While some parts of the world are beginning to improve foundry open, there is much more work to do. Turning to our results. It was another exceptional quarter of double-digit top and bottom line growth in which we delivered well above our guided range. Our performance reflects the relevance of our technology in an increasingly hybrid loan, the resilience of our business model and the operational excellence of our team. 
In addition to summarizing our results, I also want to highlight secular trends driving sustained demand across our portfolio. HP Technology and Services are at the heart of hybrid work. We are accelerating our strategy to drive long-term sustainable growth. This includes continuing to transform the way we operate and deploy our substantial cash flow to maximize value creation. 
But let me start with the quarter. In Q2, we saw exceptional demand for our products and delivered record revenue of $15.9 billion, an increase of 27% with balanced growth across Print and Personal Systems. Our non-GAAP net earnings increased 56% to $1.2 billion. And we generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow, returning $1.8 billion to shareholders. 
These results reflect continued strong growth in consumer as well as improvement in our commercial businesses as economic activity increased. In our Consumer segment, we delivered 72% growth in Personal Systems and 77% growth in print. Commercial PC revenue grew 10% and commercial print was up 34%, including 45% growth in our industrial printing businesses. 
It is important to note that these results are against the backdrop of industry-wide component shortages and supply chain challenges. Currently, there is not enough supply to keep up with the robust demand and the resurgence of COVID in Southeast Asia is creating additional pressure on our supply chain. We expect supply constraints to continue at least through the end of 2021. 
Although the environment will likely remain dynamic, we are taking actions to navigate through the challenges, enabling us to deliver strong results and increase our outlook for the second half. As we remain focused on delivering in the short term, we are equally focused on capitalizing on attractive long-term opportunities. It is clear that the world will not simply go back to the way it was prior to COVID. 
There has been a fundamental shift in the way people work, learn, play and create. And this shift is here to stay. The future of work and education will be more hybrid. According to recent survey, more than 60% of employees want flexibility in where and how they work. As these future emerges, it will open the opportunity to create new products and services for our customers. 
Unless consumers and businesses see greater mobility, convenience and value, this supports our strategy to accelerate new business models geared toward more services and subscriptions enabled by the integration of our hardware and software. 
Underpinning all of this is the growing importance of cybersecurity. 88% of IT decision makers tell they work with their cyber risk has increased during the pandemic. This presents a huge opportunity for us to expand our security offerings and deliver the most secure and resilient pieces and printers. 
With our brand differentiated portfolio, HP is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this secular trend. And as we have said, this is a time for strong companies to get stronger and we are innovating across our portfolio to strengthen and grow our businesses. 
In Personal Systems, our innovation is driving growth in key segments, including remote work, education and gaming. The PC continues to be essential in daily life. We're already capitalizing on this trend in a number of ways. 
Our latest award-winning PC include features purpose built for hybrid work, and we are developing new services like HP Provisioning Connect that make it easier for IT teams to set up and support devices in employees' homes as well as in the office. 
In the education market, where HP is the #1 vendor, PC sales have more than doubled due to remote learning. At the same time, however, The number of PCs per 100 students remains in the single digits. As an industry, we still have a long way to go to close this digital device. And as a company, we have a big opportunity to be part of the solution. 
The importance of the PC extends beyond work and school. In many cases, it has become the entertainment center of the home from streaming and content creation to the rise of gaming and esports. In Q2, revenue growth in gaming outpaced overall consumer PC growth. 
We are building on these trends to expand into attractive adjacencies, including peripheral. We are on track to close the HyperX acquisition in Q3, which we expect to be accretive in year 1. 
In printer, we are leveraging our leadership across consumer and commercial market to provide innovative solutions needed in today's hybrid world. This includes accelerating the evolution of our business model and subscription services. 
We recently announced the expansion of HP+ and Instant Ink, which are now in 35 countries across North America and Europe. We believe HP+ will help us to optimize system profitability and provide a better customer experience. Additionally, employers are looking for more distributed printing environment, which plays to HP's strength in A4 printers. 
The new LaserJet Enterprise 400 series is designed to deliver seamless remote management for both hybrid workers and new office configurations here to our collaboration. At the same time, greater workforce mobility is a catalyst for our print services portfolio. 
Within our managed print services, we have introduced HP Flexworker Service to incorporate remote workers and brand offices into a company's NPS contracts. This is allowing companies such as General Motors to have better visibility and manageability, across their printer fleet. 
In our industrial businesses, new innovation is enabling production to be more agile and more personalized. In industrial graphics, we are seeing improvements in the market and growth in hardware installations. Among the customer wins this quarter for the installation of the 100 Indigo press at CCL our leader in label security and packaging solutions. We also continue to see consistent double-digit growth in print impressions and square meters. 
In 3D, we are creating more vertical go-to-market solutions, spanning equipment, software and services across industries from industrial tooling to automotive to health and wellness. For example, our molded fiber tooling solution has strong customer engagement and adoption, including numerous prepaid purchases, and we enable them to achieve significant process and cost efficiency. 
In addition, we are partnering with Ford motor company to extend the life of already used 3D printed parts by turning them into auto components for their F250 trucks creating a close loop on waste. With our strong and diverse portfolio, we also continue to generate meaningful free cash flow and we remain focused on deploying our cash to maximize value creation. 
We have the flexibility to return significant capital to shareholders and reinvest in our businesses while also explaining disciplined M&A. We will continue to look for opportunities to strengthen our core, expand into attractive adjacencies and create additional growth engines. 
As always, we will take a rigorous approach to evaluating M&A requiring strategic fit, attractive financial returns that exceed those of buying our own stock and a strong operational plan to execute on the value proposition. 
And an important enabler of our strategy is continuing to transform the company to become leaner and more digitally enabled. For HP, there is a continued focus on both reducing structural costs and reinvesting for the future. 
To help us accelerate our progress, we announced 3 new leadership appointments, [indiscernible] is joining HP as the President of Personalization and 3D Printing. Greg Baxter will be our next Chief Transformation Officer. And Christian Lodge is joining in HP as our Chief People Officer. Working together with our leadership team, they will strengthen our innovation capabilities and help drive our long-term strategy. And a key part of our strategy is to deliver strong results while staying true to HP's values. 
Last month, we announced an ambitious set of climate action goals. By 2025, we aim to achieve carbon neutrality, 0 waste in HP operations and 0 differentiation for HP paper and paper-based packaging. We are also committed to achieving net leader in carbon emissions across our entire value chain by 2040. 
And last week, we announced a new set of diversity and inclusion goals. This includes a pledge to achieve 50-50 gender equality in HP leadership by 2030, making us the first Fortune 100 tech company to make such a commitment. I am proud to say our partners are joining us in these efforts. 
Today, over 1,400 partners have signed the Amplify impact play to set their own long-term objective to drive a sustainable impact. This is where the size and scale of HP's ecosystem truly shines. Overall, I am very pleased with our performance this quarter and excited for what lies ahead. 
We continue to drive our relentless focus on execution while taking decisive actions to capitalize on attractive opportunities to advance our leadership in personal systems and print, expand into attractive adjacencies, disrupt new markets and transform the way we operate. 
And I am confident that our strategy will continue to create significant shareholder value. I know I speak for our more than 50,000 employees when I say we are not content simply maintaining our current position. We have a much bigger ambition. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to Marie, who will take you through the details of our quarter and our fiscal year outlook. Marie, over to you."

HP's second quarter results highlights both our operational strength and the breadth of our portfolio. We are demonstrating our ability to meet customer needs and continuing on our transformation journey, all while growing operating profits, generating strong free cash flow and maintaining a robust capital returns while continuing to make investments in the company for our future. 
Turning to the details of the second quarter. Q2 net revenue was $15.9 billion, up 27% nominally and 25% in constant currency. Regionally, in constant currency, Americas increased 32%, EMEA increased 19% and and APJ increased 23%. The year-on-year growth rate benefited from the prior year impact of COVID and supply chain disruptions. 
Demand continued to outpace supply and we ended the quarter with elevated backlog in both Personal Systems and printing. At the highest since the split, gross margin was 21.7% and up 1.7 points year-on-year. The increase was primarily driven by favorable pricing, including historically low promotion expense and favorable currency partially offset by higher costs. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $2 billion, up 12.6% of revenue, up 10 basis points year-on-year. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by higher variable compensation as a result of the very strong performance this year as compared to Q2 2020 as well as increased investments in innovation and go-to-market. 
Non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $64 million for the quarter. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share increased 82% to $0.93, with a diluted share count of approximately 1.2 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes net benefits totaling $70 million primarily related to other tax adjustments and nonoperating retirement-related credits partially offset by restructuring and other charges as well as amortization of intangible assets. As a result, Q2 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.98. 
Turning to segment performance. In Q2, Personal Systems benefited from strong demand related to working and learning from home. Revenue was $10.6 billion, up 27% year-over-year. Demand for our products remained very strong with backlog increasing again quarter-on-quarter. 
Drilling into the details, we saw strength across consumer and commercial with revenue up 72% and 10%, respectively. By product category, revenue was up 47% for notebooks, down 8% for desktops and down 7% for workstations. Strong demand for notebooks drove total unit growth of 44% with Chromebooks representing 20% of our total Personal Systems units as the need for technology and education continued to grow. 
We also saw solid services attached with particular strength in commercial and significant double-digit growth in consumer peripherals. Personal Systems delivered $710 million in operating profit and operating margins of 6.7%. The year-over-year improvement was primarily due to favorable pricing, including lower promotion expenses as well as currency, partially offset by unfavorable mix and higher costs, including variable compensation, commodity costs as well as investments in innovation and go-to-market. 
In print, our results reflected continued focus on execution and the strength of our portfolio. We are uniquely positioned as leaders in both consumer and commercial and have the hardware supplies and services to deliver value in a hybrid world. Q2 total group revenue was $5.3 billion, up 28% and total hardware units grew 42% to $10.6 million. By customer segment, Consumer revenue was up 77%, with units up 45%; and commercial revenue and units were up 34% and 22%, respectively. 
In commercial, the recovery momentum continued, with revenue up 13% sequentially, but we continue to expect the recovery to be gradual and uneven at times across segments and geographies. Supplies revenue was $3.3 billion, up 17%. The year-on-year growth was primarily driven by favorable pricing as well as ongoing consumer demand and improving commercial demand. 
Our contractual business is a key element of our print strategy in both consumer and commercial printing. In Consumer, our Instant Ink business continue to resonate well with customers with cumulative enrollees growing 7% sequentially to $9.7 million. On the commercial side, we drove growth in Managed Print Services revenue and new TCV bookings for the first time since the pandemic took hold and strong renewal TCV bookings again this quarter. 
Grid operating profit increased $403 million to $951 million and operating margins were 17.9%. This year-over-year increase was driven by increased volume and favorable pricing across hardware and supplies, including less promotional expense, partially offset by unfavorable mix and higher costs. 
Let me now turn to our transformation efforts and specifically our cost savings initiatives. In the second year of our program, we continue to look at new cost savings opportunities and remain ahead of our $1.2 billion gross run rate structural cost reduction plan. 
During the quarter, we continued our efforts to optimize our factory footprint to enable a best-in-class supply chain network and enhanced supply resiliency while reducing our cost structure. In addition, we continue to enhance and leverage our digital capabilities to transform ways in which we operate and deliver value to our customers. 
The structural cost savings from our transformation efforts give us the flexibility to reinvest in our business for long-term growth and profitability. Shifting to cash flow and capital allocation. Second quarter cash flow from operations and free cash flow were better than expected at $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, 
In Q2, the cash conversion cycle was minus 28 days. Sequentially, the cash conversion cycle was up 2 days as growth in inventory, primarily due to strategic buys, drove increased days of inventory, partially offset by a reduction in days sales outstanding and higher days payable outstanding. 
For the quarter, we returned a total of $1.8 billion to shareholders which represented 137% of free cash flow. This included $1.6 billion in share repurchases and $239 million in cash dividends. Looking forward, we expect to continue buying back shares at elevated levels of at least $1 billion per quarter in the coming quarters and less higher return opportunities emerge. 
Looking forward to the third quarter and the rest of fiscal '21, we continue to model multiple scenarios related to supply availability, pricing dynamics and the pace of economic reopening. In particular, keep the following in mind related to our overall financial outlook. 
From a demand perspective, we expect to continue to see strong demand for our PCs, particularly in consumer. In print, We expect solid demand in consumer and continued improvement in commercial as offices reopen. While we expect year-on-year revenue growth in FY '21 to reflect our continued progress on our strategy. It is also important to note that growth trends in Q3 will also reflect the tougher year-over-year comparisons, particularly in Personal Systems. 
We expect supply constraints to continue to negatively impact our ability to meet demand in PCs and printers at least through the end of calendar 2021. We expect gross margin pressure in the second half of the year in both Personal Systems and Print due to increased costs in commodities and logistics as compared to Q2 levels and as we expect to see some more normalization in the market and pricing environment. 
We expect operating expenses in the second half of the year to be more similar to Q1 run rate. Finally, we continue to closely monitor the current coded resurgence and its potential impact to our supply chain, particularly in Southeast Asia. Taking these considerations into account, we are providing the following guidance for Q3 at FY '21. 
We expect third quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.81 to $0.85. And third quarter A diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.77 to $0.81. We expect FY '21 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.40 on to $3.50. And FY '21 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.24 to $3.34. For FY '21, we expect our free cash flow to be at least $4 billion. And now I would like to hand it back to the operator and open the call for your questions."

And as we look ahead into the future, we do expect our margins to be in the long-term range of 16% to 18%. And let me give you just a few things to think about as you think about the second half. So Obviously, the full year was very strong in the first half. So we expect to be towards the higher end of the range. And just a couple of other points I would add is, some of the exceptional benefit that we saw in H1, particularly in favorable pricing will start to diminish. And so we would expect that our mix as well would normalize as the office opens. We're likely to see higher commodity costs, logistics costs, and that will potentially impact our ability to meet demand. And then finally, there is some seasonal mix headwinds in Q2, as in supplies as Q2 is typically our strongest quarter for supply. So just keep that in mind as you're thinking about the second half, and I would just conclude that we're in the business of generating incremental OP dollars."

We expect it to continue to happen through the second half, but we are going to be limited by supply given the shortages that we see in the market. And this is a fundamental part of what is driving our guide. As we have done in the past, we are prudent when we guide. We have been in the past, and we will continue to be. If we can do better, we will, we could be better because of better pricing because we could do better because of better capacity. So again, prudent guide, we have demonstrated that if we can do better, we will do better. And therefore, given all the anomalies that we see and the supply constraints, I don't think we should be using the Q4 numbers to project the business in the future."

I just want to just try and square the circle on a couple of things, particularly around your guidance. So seasonally, your you're typically up in EPS and you're guiding for EPS to be down about 10% sequentially. Revenue is typically up 3% or 4%. Are you suggesting that revenue is going to be lower than normal seasonal? Or is this all margin pressure? And the reason I struggle with the margin question is it sounds like your backlog is even bigger. You should be able to sell whatever you have, you have incremental inventory, so that should allow you to arguably meet demand better. So if you're in a situation where people are chasing demand and the mix doesn't fundamentally change, why do you expect pricing to abate? So I guess a couple of questions in there. One, do you expect an impact to top line that's different from normal seasonal? Or is it all margin in terms of your way below normal seasonal EPS guidance? And then how do we square that margin pressure with the fact that there's really strong demand. You have better inventory to fulfill that demand and you should be able to continue to take price?"

So let me walk you through how to think about our guide and specifically I'll give you a sense of what the headwinds and the tailwinds are looking like. So first of all, with respect to your comments on revenue, we do expect that revenue will be driven more by available supply than demand, and there are increasing margin headwinds versus the first half. With all that said, as Enrique said, right at the onset of the call, we are guiding for double-digit operating profit and EPS growth in Q3. And frankly, we believe that this is a prudent guide in the context of the current environment. Obviously, If we can do better, we always will. But let me walk you through what we're seeing from the headwinds and tailwinds to give you some of that color. So on the headwinds, we're seeing component costs and logistics costs in both peers and print, and they will be an incremental headwind, both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year. And those overall basket of commodities, particularly in panels, ICs and PS And then ICs and resins and print. And then there are the tailwinds that we've had in the first half around the favorable pricing dynamics, they will start to dissipate as we lap the onset of those historically low promotion expenses. Then getting into your comments on tailwinds and how we're thinking about it, demand in both PS and print continue obvious to be very strong, as you mentioned. We're seeing those trends of hybrid work continue. But obviously, they're constrained by supply. So -- and in addition, just to kind of wrap up here, as we said, we're going to continue to return capital to shareholders. So we expect that repo of at least about $1 billion a quarter. So for the full year, we expect PS margins will be slightly above the high end of our longer-term range of 3.5% to 5.5% and print for the full year at the higher end of 16 to 18. So at this point, we remain very confident of our guide. And if we can do better, like I said, we will."

Or is it -- we're actually raising price because we can because demand is constrained.

And obviously, we continue to monitor that very carefully so that we can maintain healthy and appropriate levels. But this quarter, given you wind it back a year ago, we had the sort of the onset of the pandemic. So we've had that channel depletion that occurred last year. And so we did see some benefit in the year-on-year compare. And from that impact of the inventory movements, we estimate that to be approximately 3% year-on-year. And as you know, we have a multi-tiered channel. So this is our best estimate based on the data we have, including our channels for product across our channel and end-user stock."

And I think these are -- this shows kind of the potential that this business has in the long term. As we had announced before, we are complementing our strategy on CD to also focus on some end-to-end applications where we think we can get even more value than just by selling printers or are consumables. And we were mentioning on our prepared remarks, the work that we are doing on molded fiber as an example. But we really think that More and more, we will be focusing on applications to capture value in this business. And this is why we selected the Del tour to lead this business. He comes from the health and wellness industry. So he comes from an industry that will be disrupted by 3D, and we think this will be adding significant value to the definition of our strategy. And then in terms of when we will be more transparent on the 3D business, I think as I have said before, there are 2 major things. One is we want the business to have higher scale. And second and probably most important, we need to have a better defined business model. And this is where this combination of selling printers or supplies or going after end-to-end applications is so important. So once we will have a complete perspective of where this will be going longer term is when we will be providing more visibility."

I want to start by acknowledging the state of the pandemic particularly in countries such as India. We are doing everything we can for our employees, customers and partners during this difficult time. While some parts of the world are beginning to improve and reopen, there is much more work to do. 
Turning to our results. It was another exceptional quarter of double-digit top and bottom line growth in which we delivered well above our guided range. Our performance reflects the relevance of our technology in an increasingly hybrid world, the resilience of our business model and the operational excellence of our team.  
In addition to summarizing our results, I also want to highlight secular trends driving sustained demand across our portfolio. HP Technology and Services are at the heart of hybrid work. We are accelerating our strategy to drive long-term sustainable growth. This includes continuing to transform the way we operate and deploy our substantial cash flow to maximize value creation. 
But let me start with the quarter. In Q2, we saw exceptional demand for our products and delivered record revenue of $15.9 billion, an increase of 27%, with balanced growth across Print and Personal Systems. Our non-GAAP net earnings increased 56% to $1.2 billion, and we generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow, returning $1.8 billion to shareholders. These results reflect continued strong growth in consumer as well as improvement in our commercial businesses as economic activity increased. In our Consumer segment, we delivered 72% growth in Personal Systems and 77% growth in print. Commercial PC revenue grew 10% and commercial print was up 34%, including 45% growth in our industrial printing businesses.  
It is important to note that these results are against the backdrop of industry-wide component shortages and supply chain challenges. Currently, there is not enough supply to keep up with the robust demand. And the resurgence of COVID in Southeast Asia is creating additional pressures on our supply chain. We expect supply constraints to continue at least through the end of 2021.  
Although the environment will likely remain dynamic, we are taking actions to navigate through the challenges, enabling us to deliver strong results and increase our outlook for the second half. As we remain focused on delivering in the short term, we are equally focused on capitalizing on attractive long-term opportunities. It is clear that the world will not simply go back to the way it was prior to COVID.  
There has been a fundamental shift in the way people work, learn, play and create. And this shift is here to stay. The future of work and education will be more hybrid. According to recent survey, more than 60% of employees want flexibility in where and how they work. As these future emerges, it will open the opportunity to create new products and services for our customers. Unless consumers and businesses see greater mobility, convenience and value, this supports our strategy to accelerate new business models geared toward more services and subscriptions enabled by the integration of our hardware and software.  
Underpinning all of this is the growing importance of cybersecurity. 88% of IT decision-makers tell us they worry their cyber risk has increased during the pandemic. This presents a huge opportunity for us to expand our security offerings and deliver the most secure and resilient PCs and printers. With our brand-differentiated portfolio, HP is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this secular trend. And as we have said, this is a time for strong companies to get stronger, and we are innovating across our portfolio to strengthen and grow our businesses.  
In Personal Systems, our innovation is driving growth in key segments, including remote work, education and gaming. The PC continues to be essential in daily life. We're already capitalizing on this trend in a number of ways. Our latest award-winning PCs include features purpose built for hybrid work, and we are developing new services like HP Provisioning Connect that make it easier for IT teams to set up and support devices in employees' homes as well as in the office.  
In the education market, where HP is the #1 vendor, PC sales have more than doubled due to remote learning. At the same time, however, The number of PCs per 100 students remains in the single digits. As an industry, we still have a long way to go to close this digital divide. And as a company, we have a big opportunity to be part of the solution.
The importance of the PC extends far beyond work and school. In many cases, it has become the entertainment center of the home, from streaming and content creation, to the rise of gaming and eSports. In Q2, revenue growth in gaming outpaced overall consumer PC growth. We are building on these trends to expand into attractive adjacencies, including peripherals. We are on track to close the HyperX acquisition in Q3, which we expect to be accretive in year 1.  
In printer, we are leveraging our leadership across consumer and commercial market to provide innovative solutions needed in today's hybrid world. This includes accelerating the evolution of our business model and subscription services. We recently announced the expansion of HP+ and Instant Ink, which are now in 35 countries across North America and Europe. We believe HP+ will help us to optimize system profitability and provide a better customer experience. Additionally, employers are looking for more distributed printing environment, which plays to HP's strength in A4 printers. The new LaserJet Enterprise 400 series is designed to deliver seamless remote management for both hybrid workers and new office configurations geared toward collaboration. 
At the same time, greater workforce mobility is a catalyst for our print services portfolio. Within our managed print services, we have introduced HP Flexworker Service to incorporate remote workers and branch offices into a company's MPS contract. This is allowing companies such as General Motors to have better visibility and manageability across their printer fleet.  
In our industrial businesses, new innovation is enabling production to be more agile and more personalized. In industrial graphics, we are seeing improvements in the market and growth in hardware installations. Among the customer wins this quarter were the installation of the 100 Indigo press at CCL, a world leader in label, security and packaging solutions. We also continue to see consistent double-digit growth in print impressions and square meters.  
In 3D, we are creating more vertical go-to-market solutions spanning equipment, software and services across industries, from industrial tooling, to automotive, to health and wellness. For example, our molded fiber tooling solution has strong customer engagement and adoption, including numerous prepaid purchases, and we enable them to achieve significant process and cost efficiency.  
In addition, we are partnering with Ford Motor Company to extend the life of already used 3D-printed parts by turning them into auto components for their F-250 trucks, creating a closed loop on waste. 
With our strong and diverse portfolio, we also continue to generate meaningful free cash flow, and we remain focused on deploying our cash to maximize value creation. We have the flexibility to return significant capital to shareholders and reinvest in our businesses, while also exploring disciplined M&A. We will continue to look for opportunities to strengthen our core, expand into attractive adjacencies and create additional growth engines.  
As always, we will take a rigorous approach to evaluating M&A, requiring strategic fit, attractive financial returns that exceed those of buying our own stock and a strong operational plan to execute on the value proposition.  
And an important enabler of our strategy is continuing to transform the company to become leaner and more digitally enabled. For HP, there is a continued focus on both reducing structural costs and reinvesting for the future. To help us accelerate our progress, we announced 3 new leadership appointments, Didier Deltort is joining HP as the President of Personalization and 3D Printing; Greg Baxter will be our next Chief Transformation Officer; and Kristen Ludgate is joining in HP as our Chief People Officer. Working together with our leadership team, they will strengthen our innovation capabilities and help drive our long-term strategy. And a key part of our strategy is to deliver strong results while staying true to HP's values.  
Last month, we announced an ambitious set of climate action goals. By 2025, we aim to achieve carbon neutrality, 0 waste in HP operations and 0 differentiation for HP paper and paper-based packaging. We are also committed to achieving net 0 carbon emissions across our entire value chain by 2040. And last week, we announced a new set of diversity and inclusion goals. This includes a pledge to achieve 50-50 gender equality in HP leadership by 2030, making us the first Fortune 100 tech company to make such a commitment. I am proud to say our partners are joining us in these efforts.  
Today, over 1,400 partners have signed the Amplify Impact pledge to set their own long-term objective to drive a sustainable impact. This is where the size and scale of HP's ecosystem truly shines. Overall, I am very pleased with our performance this quarter and excited for what lies ahead. 
We continue to drive a relentless focus on execution, while taking decisive actions to capitalize on attractive opportunities to advance our leadership in personal systems and print, expand into attractive adjacencies, disrupt new markets and transform the way we operate. And I am confident that our strategy will continue to create significant shareholder value. I know I speak for our more than 50,000 employees when I say we are not content simply maintaining our current position. We have a much bigger ambition. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to Marie, who will take you through the details of our quarter and our fiscal year outlook. Marie, over to you."

HP's second quarter results highlights both our operational strength and the breadth of our portfolio. We are demonstrating our ability to meet customer needs and continuing on our transformation journey, all while growing operating profits, generating strong free cash flow and maintaining a robust capital returns while continuing to make investments in the company for our future.  
Turning to the details of the second quarter. Q2 net revenue was $15.9 billion, up 27% nominally and 25% in constant currency. Regionally, in constant currency, Americas increased 32%, EMEA increased 19%, and APJ increased 23%. The year-on-year growth rate benefited from the prior year impact of COVID and supply chain disruptions.  
Demand continued to outpace supply and we ended the quarter with elevated backlog in both Personal Systems and Printing. At the highest since the split, gross margin was 21.7%, up 1.7 points year-on-year. The increase was primarily driven by favorable pricing, including historically low promotion expense and favorable currency partially offset by higher costs.  
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $2 billion or 12.6% of revenue, up 10 basis points year-on-year. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by higher variable compensation as a result of the very strong performance this year as compared to Q2 2020 as well as increased investments in innovation and go-to-market.  
Non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $64 million for the quarter. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share increased 82% to $0.93, with a diluted share count of approximately 1.2 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes net benefits totaling $70 million primarily related to other tax adjustments and nonoperating retirement-related credits partially offset by restructuring and other charges as well as amortization of intangible assets. As a result, Q2 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.98.  
Turning to segment performance. In Q2, Personal Systems benefited from strong demand related to working and learning from home. Revenue was $10.6 billion, up 27% year-over-year. Demand for our product remained very strong with backlog increasing again quarter-on-quarter. Drilling into the details, we saw strength across Consumer and Commercial, with revenue up 72% and 10%, respectively. By product category, revenue was up 47% for notebooks, down 8% for desktops, and down 7% for workstations. Strong demand for notebooks drove total unit growth of 44%, with Chromebooks representing 20% of our total Personal Systems units as the need for technology and education continued to grow.  
We also saw solid services attached with particular strength in commercial and significant double-digit growth in consumer peripherals. Personal Systems delivered $710 million in operating profit and operating margins of 6.7%. The year-over-year improvement was primarily due to favorable pricing, including lower promotion expenses as well as currency, partially offset by unfavorable mix and higher costs, including variable compensation, commodity costs as well as investments in innovation and go-to-market.  
In Print, our results reflected continued focus on execution and the strength of our portfolio. We are uniquely positioned as leaders in both consumer and commercial and have the hardware supplies and services to deliver value in a hybrid world. Q2 total Print revenue was $5.3 billion, up 28%, and total hardware units grew 42% to 10.6 million. By customer segment, Consumer revenue was up 77%, with units up 45%; and commercial revenue and units were up 34% and 22%, respectively.  
In Commercial, the recovery momentum continued, with revenue up 13% sequentially, but we continue to expect the recovery to be gradual and uneven, at times across segments and geographies. Supplies revenue was $3.3 billion, up 17%. The year-on-year growth was primarily driven by favorable pricing as well as ongoing consumer demand and improving commercial demand. 
Our contractual business is a key element of our Print strategy in both consumer and commercial printing. In Consumer, our Instant Ink business continue to resonate well with customers, with cumulative enrollees growing 7% sequentially to 9.7 million. On the commercial side, we drove growth in Managed Print Services revenue, and new TCV bookings for the first time since the pandemic took hold and strong renewal TCV bookings again this quarter.  
Print operating profit increased $403 million to $951 million, and operating margins were 17.9%. This year-over-year increase was driven by increased volume and favorable pricing across hardware and supplies, including less promotional expense, partially offset by unfavorable mix and higher costs.  
Let me now turn to our transformation efforts and specifically our cost savings initiatives. In the second year of our program, we continue to look at new cost savings opportunities and remain ahead of our $1.2 billion gross run rate structural cost reduction plan. During the quarter, we continued our efforts to optimize our factory footprint to enable a best-in-class supply chain network and enhanced supply resiliency while reducing our cost structure. 
In addition, we continue to enhance and leverage our digital capabilities to transform ways in which we operate and deliver value to our customers. The structural cost savings from our transformation efforts give us the flexibility to reinvest in our business for long-term growth and profitability. 
Shifting to cash flow and capital allocation. Second quarter cash flow from operations and free cash flow were better than expected at $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. In Q2, the cash conversion cycle was minus 28 days. Sequentially, the cash conversion cycle was up 2 days as growth in inventory, primarily due to strategic buys, drove increased days of inventory, partially offset by a reduction in days sales outstanding and higher days payable outstanding.  
For the quarter, we returned a total of $1.8 billion to shareholders, which represented 137% of free cash flow. This included $1.6 billion in share repurchases and $239 million in cash dividends. Looking forward, we expect to continue buying back shares at elevated levels of at least $1 billion per quarter in the coming quarters, unless higher return opportunities emerge.  
Looking forward to the third quarter and the rest of fiscal '21, we continue to model multiple scenarios related to supply availability, pricing dynamics and the pace of economic reopening. In particular, keep the following in mind related to our overall financial outlook. From a demand perspective, we expect to continue to see strong demand for our PCs, particularly in consumer. In Print, We expect solid demand in consumer and continued improvement in commercial as offices reopen. While we expect year-on-year revenue growth in FY '21 to reflect our continued progress on our strategy, it is also important to note that growth trends in Q3 will also reflect the tougher year-over-year comparisons, particularly in Personal Systems.  
We expect supply constraints to continue to negatively impact our ability to meet demand in PCs and printers, at least through the end of calendar 2021. We expect gross margin pressure in the second half of the year in both Personal Systems and Print due to increased costs in commodities and logistics as compared to Q2 levels and as we expect to see some more normalization in the market and pricing environment. We expect operating expenses in the second half of the year to be more similar to Q1 run rate. 
Finally, we continue to closely monitor the current COVID resurgence and its potential impact to our supply chain, particularly in Southeast Asia. Taking these considerations into account, we are providing the following guidance for Q3 and FY '21. We expect third quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.81 to $0.85, and third quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.77 to $0.81. We expect FY '21 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.40 on to $3.50, and FY '21 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.24 to $3.34.

So the decline we saw in the Print operating rate was really driven by several factors. So first of all, some of the unfavorable costs in commodities, factory and logistics; and secondly, by investments that we made in OpEx across R&D, marketing to support future growth and higher variable comp. And look, overall, I'd just say, we have seen strength in resiliency in our broad -- in our Print portfolio, which really positions us well against the competition. 
And as we look ahead into the future, we do expect our margins to be in the long-term range of 16% to 18%. And let me give you just a few things to think about as you think about the second half. So obviously, the full year was very strong in the first half. So we expect to be towards the higher end of the range. 
And just a couple of other points I would add is, some of the exceptional benefit that we saw in H1, particularly in favorable pricing will start to diminish. And so we would expect that our mix as well would normalize as the office reopens. We're likely to see higher commodity costs, logistics costs, and that will potentially impact our ability to meet demand. And then finally, there is some seasonal mix headwinds in Q2, as -- in supplies as Q2 is typically our strongest quarter for supplies. So just keep that in mind as you're thinking about the second half, and I would just conclude that we're in the business of generating incremental OP dollars."

As we have done in the past, we are prudent when we guide. We have been in the past, and we will continue to be. If we can do better, we will.

I just want to just try and square the circle on a couple of things, particularly around your guidance. So seasonally, you're typically up in EPS, and you're guiding for EPS to be down about 10% sequentially. Revenue is typically up 3% or 4%. Are you suggesting that revenue is going to be lower than normal seasonal? Or is this all margin pressure? And the reason I struggle with the margin question is it sounds like your backlog is even bigger. You should be able to sell whatever you have, you have incremental inventory, so that should allow you to arguably meet demand better. 
So if you're in a situation where people are chasing demand and the mix doesn't fundamentally change, why do you expect pricing to abate? So I guess a couple of questions in there. One, do you expect an impact to top line that's different from normal seasonal? Or is it all margin in terms of your way below normal seasonal EPS guidance? And then how do we square that margin pressure with the fact that there's really strong demand. You have better inventory to fulfill that demand and you should be able to continue to take price?"

So let me walk you through how to think about our guide, and specifically, I'll give you a sense of what the headwinds and the tailwinds are looking like. So first of all, with respect to your comments on revenue, we do expect that revenue will be driven more by available supply than demand, and there are increasing margin headwinds versus the first half. 
With all that said, as Enrique said right at the onset of the call, we are guiding for double-digit operating profit and EPS growth in Q3. And frankly, we believe that this is a prudent guide in the context of the current environment. Obviously, If we can do better, we always will. But let me walk you through what we're seeing from the headwinds and tailwinds to give you some of that color. 
So on the headwinds, we're seeing component costs and logistics costs in both PS and Print, and they will be an incremental headwind, both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year. And those overall basket of commodities, particularly in panels, ICs and PS, and then ICs and resins and Print. And then there are other tailwinds that we've had in the first half around those favorable pricing dynamics, they will start to dissipate as we lap the onset of those historically low promotion expenses. 
Then getting into your comments on tailwinds and how we're thinking about it, demand in both PS and Print continue obviously to be very strong, as you mentioned. Again, we're seeing those trends of hybrid work continue. But obviously, they're constrained by supply. So -- and in addition, just to kind of wrap up here, as we said, we're going to continue to return capital to shareholders. So we expect that repo of at least about $1 billion a quarter. So for the full year, we expect PS margins will be slightly above the high end of our longer-term range of 3.5% to 5.5%, and Print for the full year at the higher end of 16% to 18%. So at this point, we remain very confident of our guide. And if we can do better, like I said, we will."

And therefore, we expect the shift mix from desktops into notebooks to continue, which as we have talked in the past, overall has a positive impact for the business because of both pricing but also because of the recycle -- the recycle time that PC -- that notebook has compared to desktops."

And so we did see some benefit in the year-on-year compare. And from that impact of the inventory movements, we estimate that to be approximately 3% year-on-year.

And I think these are -- this shows kind of the potential that this business has in the long term. 
As we had announced before, we are complementing our strategy on 3D to also focus on some end-to-end applications where we think we can get even more value than just by selling printers or consumables. And we were mentioning on our prepared remarks the work that we are doing on molded fiber as an example. But we really think that, more and more, we will be focusing on applications to capture value in this business. 
And this is why we selected the Didier Deltort to lead this business. He comes from the health and wellness industry. So he comes from an industry that will be disrupted by 3D, and we think this will be adding significant value to the definition of our strategy. 
And then in terms of when we will be more transparent on the 3D business, I think as I have said before, there are 2 major things. One is we want the business to have higher scale. And second and probably most important, we need to have a better defined business model. And this is where this combination of selling printers or supplies or going after end-to-end applications is so important. So once we will have a complete perspective of where this will be going longer term is when we will be providing more visibility."

I hope that you and your families are safe and well. 
It's an important time for us to connect. The hybrid world taking shape is expanding our addressable market and creating new opportunities to drive profitable growth. We have already started to capitalize on this and have a long runway ahead. 
This is evident in our Q3 performance. We delivered another quarter of top and bottom line growth, with EPS growing substantially faster than revenue. This reflects continued progress against our strategic priorities and strong and sustained demand for our products and services. In Q3, we delivered revenue of $15.3 billion, an increase of 7%. Our non-GAAP net earnings increased 71% to $1.2 billion. Non-GAAP EPS increased to $1 compared to $0.49 in Q3 last year. And we generated $1 billion of free cash flow, returning $1.7 billion to shareholders. 
Before I take you through the highlights, I want to first share 3 key points of context as you think about our performance and outlook. First, as I mentioned, we continue to see strong demand for our products and services. The hybrid world is accelerating trends in our segments and our leadership across commercial and consumer categories, positions us well even as demand continues to outpace supply. 
The second point is that we continue to hit our match products as we can while navigating a complex operational environment. We are managing through component shortages, COVID-related factory lockdowns in Southeast Asia and congested ports and transportation disruptions. Even under these conditions, we delivered solid financial results. 
And third, we are performing while transforming our business models and service offerings to capitalize on emerging growth opportunities. We have continued to make progress reducing our fixed cost structure, evolving our business model and creating new growth businesses. And we are expanding our time in key segments to drive additional top and bottom line growth. In Personal Systems, this will be driven by our focus on peripheral and new compute models. In Printing, we are expanding our services and subscription offerings. I will talk about all of this in more detail by looking at the progress we are making across our portfolio. 
In Personal Systems, demand for our products continue to be strong with our backlog increasing again quarter-on-quarter. PC penetration rates are growing across our markets as devices become increasingly essential in today's hybrid world. While we delivered strong operating profit, PS revenue was less than we expected, primarily because of our supply chain constraints. We expect industry-wide supply shortages, particularly in IC, to continue into 2022. Given this, we have identified the necessary improvements we need to make and are accelerating their execution to drive stronger top line performance. We expect that it will take more than 1 quarter to show results. 
As we run supply, our PS portfolio is extremely well positioned for the hybrid world, and we see significant opportunities for market expansion. And our leading share in commercial PCs positions us well as more businesses reopen. In the commercial market, we launched a new all-in-one and expanded our ZBook portfolio of high-performance PCs for creative professionals. This includes the ZBook Studio G8, the world's most powerful mobile workstation for its size. And our new ZBook power brings ZBook performance to students, SMB and the public sector. 
In Q3, we also launched a new Pavilion lineup that brings premium computing experiences into the main theme. We allowed a series of new displays that are purpose-built for home office and entertainment setups. And we continued to drive momentum outside of our core hardware businesses. 
This quarter, we completed our acquisition of HyperX, giving us a leading position in gaming peripherals and a platform from which to accelerate our peripherals leadership more broadly. We also continue to advance our Device-as-a-Service business, which grew 32% in the quarter. And we are investing to meet emerging customer needs in the commercial space. This is highlighted by our recent agreement to acquire Teradici Corporation.  Teradici's software is widely used by leading organizations around the world to deliver superior remote computing solutions. We expect this deal will accelerate new compute models and services tailored for hybrid work environment. 
In Printing, revenue was up 24%, driven by recovery in commercial and strength in consumer. As in Personal Systems, the rise of all things hybrid plays towards strength and is creating new opportunities for print innovation and growth. Specifically, we are expanding our services and subscription offerings, each of which delivered double-digit growth this quarter. 
We continue to scale HP+ and Instant Ink across North America and Europe, including the addition of HP+ on the EV and [indiscernible] product family. We have seen positive response to HP+ to date and HP Instant Ink hit a major milestone by surprising 10 million subscribers. Our subscription services are providing a simple and seamless experience for today's hybrid workers, paving the way for new offerings in the future. 
We also continue to evolve our hardware portfolio, with success in our award-winning HP Laser Jet 400 and 500 cities. HP continues to be recognized as a best managed print vendor, helping SMB solution providers thrive in a competitive market where quality and security are essential. The strength of our position in the commercial market is significant as more people return to the office. 
In our industrial businesses, we drove very strong hardware revenue growth in the quarter. Importantly, our number of pages printed is at or above 2019 levels. We once again saw double-digit growth in print impressions and square meters, as well as trends in key categories like labels and packaging. And in 3D, we remain focused on driving high-value end-to-end applications in strategic vertical markets. 
This quarter, we launched the new Arize for orthotic solution. It leverages HP's CD printing and cloud-based software to help the millions of patients who suffer from foot pain. It is a great example of the opportunity we see to disrupt industries with highly personalized solutions. 
Our combination of innovation and execution enables us to continue making progress across our business and portfolio. And we remain committed to generating strong cash flow and to value-creating capital allocation. This includes our robust share repurchase and dividend program and disciplined organic and inorganic investment. 
In Q3, we returned $1.7 billion to shareholders and have returned $6.8 billion over the past 12 months. We believe our shares remain undervalued and are committed to aggressive repurchase levels of at least $1.5 billion in Q4. 
As part of our value creation strategy, we also remain focused on M&A that can accelerate our growth in strategic areas. HyperX and Teradici are 2 great examples. We will continue using our rigorous returns-based framework to evaluate and pursue deals that complement our strategy and accelerate new sources of value creation. 
As we drive our portfolio strategy and transformation agenda, we continue to prioritize making a sustainable impact. This quarter, we released our 20th Annual Sustainable Impact Report that highlights the work we are doing in climate action, human rights and digital equity and outlined new 2030 goals. Not only is this the right thing to do, it's also driving business success. In 2020, our sustainable impact initiatives help us win more than $1 billion in new sales for the second consecutive year. 
Aligned with this, we recently issued $1 billion in sustainability bonds. We are allocating these proceeds to ESG-related initiatives consistent with our strategy and values. Looking ahead to Q4, our backlog remains significantly elevated. We expect robust demand to continue, and we are taking decisive steps to address operational headwinds. Our portfolio is strong and resilient, and we remain on track to significantly exceed the full year EPS target we set in February. And today, we are raising our Q4 outlook. And more importantly, we plan to build on this performance and expect to grow full year EPS in fiscal year '22. 
Longer term, the hybrid world plays to our strength and creates attractive opportunities across our categories. We are well positioned to drive sustained performance as we innovate, improve and continue to reinvent for our customers, partners and shareholders. I look forward to our upcoming October analyst meeting to discuss our strategy and our plans to drive continued business success. 
Let me now turn the call over to Marie, who will take you through the details of the quarter and our fiscal year outlook. Marie, over to you."

[Audio Gap] 
Net revenue was $15.3 billion, up 7% nominally and 4% in constant currency effect of both Print and Personal Systems revenue, and this was particularly impactful in EMEA and APJ in Personal Systems. Across Personal Systems and Print, we continue to see strong demand for our products and solutions, capitalizing on opportunities we see as the hybrid world take shape. 
The gross margin was 22.2%, up 5.5 points year-on-year. The increase was primarily driven by continued favorable pricing, including lower promotions as well as a reduction to previously estimated sales and marketing program incentives as well as currency, partially offset by higher costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.9 billion or 12.4% of revenue. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by increased investments in go-to-market and innovation, as well as higher variable compensation due to the very strong performance this fiscal year as compared to 2020. Non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $78 million for the quarter. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share increased $0.51 to $1, including $0.25 related to the reduction in previously estimated incentives, of which $0.12 were reinvested during the quarter primarily in accelerating R&D, incremental marketing and our hybrid work strategy. 
Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes net expense totaling $90 million, primarily related to restructuring and other charges, amortization of intangibles, acquisition-related charges, debt extinguishment costs, other tax adjustments, partially offset by nonoperating retirement-related credits. As a result, Q3 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.92. 
Before I get into the details of the segments, let me briefly address the reduction in previously estimated sales and marketing program incentives. Consistent with our policies, we review these estimates every quarter. We estimate incentives based on a number of factors like historical experience, customer behavior and market conditions. The change in estimate is a result of lower-than-expected incentives due to increased supply constraints, shifts in customer behavior and the evolving impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, it became clear that we had to make an unusually large change in estimate in Q3. 
Now let me turn to segment performance. In Q3, Personal Systems revenue was $10.4 billion, flat year-over-year as supply chain challenges continue to constrain our growth. Demand for our products remain strong with backlog increasing again sequentially despite substantially clearing the [indiscernible] backlog. 
Drilling into the details. Consumer and Commercial revenue was up 3% and down 1%, respectively. By product category, revenue was flat for notebooks, up 1% for desktops and down 9% for workstations. Total units were flat year-over-year. We also drove double-digit growth in both consumer peripherals and services attach across consumer and commercial. 
Personal Systems delivered $869 million in operating profit and operating margins of 8.4%. The operating margin improved 2.9 points primarily due to favorable pricing, including the reduction in estimated incentives and currency, partially offset by higher costs including commodity costs, investments in innovation in go-to-market and variable compensation. 
In Print, our results reflected continued focus on execution and the strength of our portfolio. We are uniquely positioned as leaders in both consumer and commercial and have the hardware, support and services to deliver value in a hybrid world. Q3 total group revenue was $4.9 billion, up 24%, driven by strong growth in supply, hardware and services. Total hardware units declined 4% and due to manufacturing and component constraints, primarily in consumer produce. We expect these Q3 constraints to impact Q4 as well. 
By customer segment, Consumer revenue was up 15%, with units down 8% and commercial revenue in units were up 46% and 29%, respectively. Consumer demand remained strong, however, revenues, particularly A4 laser, was constrained by supply and factory disruptions. The commercial recovery continued with double-digit hardware revenue growth in office and triple-digit increases in industrial printing hardware. Given what we're seeing with the Delta variant and evolving hybrid models, we still expect recovery to be gradual and uneven at times across segments and geographies. 
Supply revenue was $3.1 billion. The 20% year-on-year growth was driven by inventory replenishment stronger commercial demand and favorable pricing. Our contractual business is a key element of our print strategy in both consumer and commercial printing. In Consumer, our Instant Ink business model continued to resonate well with customers with strong double-digit revenue and subscriber growth. 
On the commercial side, we drove growth in Managed Print Services revenue and total contract value with particular strength in new TCV bookings. Print operating profit increased $377 million to $857 million, and operating margins were 17.6%. Operating margin grew 5.4 points, driven primarily by favorable pricing including the reduction in estimated incentives, higher volumes in commercial hardware, including graphics and 3D, partially offset by unfavorable mix and higher costs including commodity costs, investments in innovation and go-to-market and variable compensation. 
Let me now turn to our transformation efforts and our cost savings initiatives. In the second year of our program, we continue to look at new cost savings opportunities and remain ahead of our $1.2 billion gross run rate structural cost reduction plan. Our hybrid work strategy is one example. It has enabled us to accelerate our location strategy while providing a more flexible workspace. Going forward, we are enabling HP's hybrid work strategy by monetizing our sites to be critical hubs for collaboration and innovation. This will also deliver savings in our real estate portfolio. 
In addition to our progress on our location strategy, we are making progress in our digital transformation. We are enhancing and leveraging our digital capabilities to transform the ways we operate and deliver value to our customers. In the third quarter, we completed the initial deployment of our SAP S/4HANA system, one of the largest ERP implementations. Also, as part of our end-to-end business planning and forecasting efforts, we also went live with our new cloud-based platform, which we believe will improve our forecasting agility as part of our digital transformation. The structural cost savings from our transformation efforts are a key enabler of reinvesting in our business for long-term growth and profitability. 
Shifting to cash flow and capital allocation. Third quarter cash flow from operations and free cash flow were $1.1 billion and $1 billion, respectively. In Q3, the cash conversion cycle was minus 29 days. Sequentially, the cash conversion cycle improved 1 day as higher days payable outstanding more than offset the increased days of inventory due to growth in inventory across PS and Print, and the 1-day increase in days sales outstanding. 
For the quarter, we returned a total of $1.7 billion to shareholders, which represented 178% of free cash flow. This included $1.5 billion in share repurchase and $230 million in cash dividends. Looking forward, we expect to continue to aggressively buy back shares at elevated levels of at least $1.5 billion in Q4. 
Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we continue to navigate supply availability and logistics constraints, pricing dynamics and the pace of economic reopening. In particular, keep the following in mind related to our overall financial outlook. For Personal Systems, we continue to see strong demand for our PCs, particularly in commercial. In Print, we expect solid demand in consumer and a mix shift of commercial continues to improve. For both Personal Systems and Print, we expect that component shortages as well as some manufacturing, port and transit disruptions will continue to constrain revenue due to the ongoing pandemic and resurgence driven by the Delta variant. 
Taking these considerations into account, we are increasing our Q4 and FY '21 EPS. We expect fourth quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.84 to $0.90, and fourth quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.82 to $0.88. We expect full year non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.69 to $3.75, and FY '21 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.56 to $3.62. For FY '21, we expect our free cash flow to be at least $4 billion.

And overall, we expect that PS will be well above our long-term range of 3.5% to 5.5% in Q4. So think about it in terms of being similar to half 1 levels. And we'll talk more about that when we get to SAM. 
Now to address your question with respect to the change in incentive, in terms of the impact on PS margin with respect to OP quarter-on-quarter, the net impact of the reduction in the previously estimated sales and marketing incentive was approximately about 1.5 points, and we're talking about that net of investments.

And what we saw is very strong demand from both commercial and consumer categories. In both cases, we saw increase of demand. 
The area you were mentioning where we saw some weakness was on the Chromebook space, because many -- and it was mostly in the U.S., because many school districts decided to stop their purchase activities until they had clarity on what type of new funds they were going to be getting from the federal government and the timing of those funds. And now this has been clarified, we expect that now, demand on the education space in Chromebooks will pick up at the end of this quarter or at the beginning of this quarter.

On the PC side, what we saw is we clearly have some areas where we need to improve operationally to be able to optimize our performance given the delta between supply and demand. 
And there are 3 areas where specifically we need to -- we are working and we need to do some more work. First of all, as you know, we have an outsourced model, where the majority of our production is managed by ODM. This means that also ODMs were managing until now the relationship with the providers of the components that we are missing. We have been changing that, signing now direct relationship and direct supply agreements with them, so this is addressing that gap. 
Second important factor is one of the key strengths of our PC business is the breadth of our portfolio. We lead both in consumer and commercial. But this portfolio has not been designed to optimize for low-cost components, which is what we are missing now. We have been changing that. And what you will -- as we will introduce our new products going forward, you will see an increase of leverage of components across multiple products, so we can really optimize our de-utilization of components. 
And third, as we -- as Marie mentioned during the prepared remarks, we have been working to deploy a new ERP system, that the ERP system is now in place. And now we have the ability to create tools that will help us to optimize the allocation of orders, not only based on business priorities but also on component availability. And this is something that until now, because we were in the middle of the ERP change, we had to do manually. 
So when I look at all these 3 areas, explain kind of the improvements that you are going to see on this side and give us confidence on how we will continue to optimize, how we manage the current situation. 
Then the second part of your question around Chromebooks, I think that an important factor to realize is that during the quarter, we closed the backlog because the shipments of Chromebooks were 100% higher than shipments that we made before. When we look at the backlog that is led, we analyzed it customer by customer, retailer by retailer, partner by partner. And this gives us very strong confidence on the value and the solidity of that backlog. 
If we look at cancellations, with the exception of Chromebooks coming from some of the changes in the U.S. School District, we are not seeing cancellations of the backlog. And as we mentioned before, it is more than 1 full quarter of demand what we have in backlog."

And at the same time, we are starting to see some light slowdown on the consumer side, which again is what we were expecting. And in any case, the consumer business today continues to be above the projections that we have for this time before the pandemic started. And this is a structural change that has happened. 
Additionally to that, we have been able to accelerate the transition of our business models, both rebalancing profitability but also significantly growing our subscription businesses.

Why don't I explain to you, just walk you through this change in estimate, then I'll address your question specifically around the accrual and the reserves. 
So we typically look at these estimates every quarter. So we estimate our sales and marketing incentives based on a number of different factors. So for example, historical experience, expected customer behavior, acceptance rates. And a very important driver is market conditions, which, as you know, we've experienced a lot of volatility since the COVID-19 began. 
It's also worth noting that some of these programs take several months, from 6 to 12 months for partners to claim. So with the impact of these market dynamics, combined with the lower claims that we've seen from our partners, it became clear that we had to make this unusually large change in estimate in Q3. And frankly, we don't expect future changes of this size. But if it changes, we'll make the appropriate disclosures. 
Now typically, reserves -- just to answer your question, you asked me about the reserve, and then I'll address your structural component. Reserves are typically liabilities for estimated future payments. So a reserve can occur for a variety of reasons. One of those can actually be a change in estimate. 
And in terms of structural, as you know, we have in place a transformation plan. We are expecting to be at 75% of our $1.2 billion plan. And we're always looking for opportunities to drive efficiency in our pricing. And we've been very effective, actually, in pricing for the current market environment as you see in the results that we've delivered. So certainly, in terms of structural, we're looking for opportunities to continually improve our pricing and our ability to price effectively in this dynamic period."

It is going to be what is the maximum amount of product that we can produce every day, every week, every month."

But the trend is positive in terms of office growth, and we see further growth on the SMB side than on the enterprise side. When I say growth, I mean recovery. 
On the other side, on the home side, again, as we were expecting, we are starting to see a slowdown, kids are starting to go back to the 2 schools in many countries, and the balance of work between home and office is also changing.

We are constantly evaluating opportunities in our core businesses, in adjacencies to support our new growth strategies. 
And this quarter, we had 2 great examples that show how do we approach and how do we think about M&A. We closed the HyperX deal that is really allowing us to accelerate our growth into the peripheral space. And now we have a leading position in peripheral for gaming. And we did also a very exciting opportunity on the services space, with the acquisition of Teradici Corporation, that will allow us to integrate into our services, remote compute for highly complex environments, which many of our customers are utilizing today.

So we ended the quarter with a higher backlog than what we had when the quarter started. 
The mix of the backlog was different. As I said before, we basically fulfill all the orders that we had with Chromebooks, but the rest of the commercial business and consumer grew significantly. And today, when we closed the quarter, more than 60% of the backlog was coming from commercial customers, which is where margins are higher and where we -- and this is really an important factor to have in mind. 
As we look at the future, we expect the Chromebook business to accelerate again at the end of Q3 and at the end of Q4. But I think it's important to have in mind that Chromebooks represents around 10% of our total PC business, even slightly below that. 
So it's a relatively small business for us.

I hope that you and your families are safe and well.  
It's an important time for us to connect. The hybrid world taking shape is expanding our addressable market and creating new opportunities to drive profitable growth. We have already started to capitalize on this and have a long runway ahead.  
This is evident in our Q3 performance. We delivered another quarter of top and bottom line growth, with EPS growing substantially faster than revenue. This reflects continued progress against our strategic priorities and strong and sustained demand for our products and services. In Q3, we delivered revenue of $15.3 billion, an increase of 7%. Our non-GAAP net earnings increased 71% to $1.2 billion. Non-GAAP EPS increased to $1 compared to $0.49 in Q3 last year. And we generated $1 billion of free cash flow, returning $1.7 billion to shareholders.  
Before I take you through the highlights, I want to first share 3 key points of context as you think about our performance and outlook. First, as I mentioned, we continue to see strong demand for our products and services. The hybrid world is accelerating trends in our segments and our leadership across commercial and consumer categories, positions us well even as demand continues to outpace supply.  
The second point is that we continue to hit our match products as we can while navigating a complex operational environment. We are managing through component shortages, COVID-related factory lockdowns in Southeast Asia and congested ports and transportation disruptions. Even under these conditions, we delivered solid financial results.  
And third, we are performing while transforming our business models and service offerings to capitalize on emerging growth opportunities. We have continued to make progress reducing our fixed cost structure, evolving our business model and creating new growth businesses. And we are expanding our time in key segments to drive additional top and bottom line growth. In Personal Systems, this will be driven by our focus on peripheral and new compute models. In Printing, we are expanding our services and subscription offerings. I will talk about all of this in more detail by looking at the progress we are making across our portfolio.  
In Personal Systems, demand for our products continue to be strong with our backlog increasing again quarter-on-quarter. PC penetration rates are growing across our markets as devices become increasingly essential in today's hybrid world. While we delivered strong operating profit, PS revenue was less than we expected, primarily because of our supply chain constraints. We expect industry-wide supply shortages, particularly in IC, to continue into 2022. Given this, we have identified the necessary improvements we need to make and are accelerating their execution to drive stronger top line performance. We expect that it will take more than 1 quarter to show results.  
As we run supply, our PS portfolio is extremely well positioned for the hybrid world, and we see significant opportunities for market expansion. And our leading share in commercial PCs positions us well as more businesses reopen. In the commercial market, we launched a new all-in-one and expanded our ZBook portfolio of high-performance PCs for creative professionals. This includes the ZBook Studio G8, the world's most powerful mobile workstation for its size. And our new ZBook power brings ZBook performance to students, SMB and the public sector.  
In Q3, we also launched a new Pavilion lineup that brings premium computing experiences into the main theme. We allowed a series of new displays that are purpose-built for home office and entertainment setups. And we continued to drive momentum outside of our core hardware businesses.  
This quarter, we completed our acquisition of HyperX, giving us a leading position in gaming peripherals and a platform from which to accelerate our peripherals leadership more broadly. We also continue to advance our Device-as-a-Service business, which grew 32% in the quarter. And we are investing to meet emerging customer needs in the commercial space. This is highlighted by our recent agreement to acquire Teradici Corporation.  Teradici's software is widely used by leading organizations around the world to deliver superior remote computing solutions. We expect this deal will accelerate new compute models and services tailored for hybrid work environment.  
In Printing, revenue was up 24%, driven by recovery in commercial and strength in consumer. As in Personal Systems, the rise of all things hybrid plays towards strength and is creating new opportunities for print innovation and growth. Specifically, we are expanding our services and subscription offerings, each of which delivered double-digit growth this quarter.  
We continue to scale HP+ and Instant Ink across North America and Europe, including the addition of HP+ on the ENVY and DeskJet product family. We have seen positive response to HP+ to date and HP Instant Ink hit a major milestone by surprising 10 million subscribers. Our subscription services are providing a simple and seamless experience for today's hybrid workers, paving the way for new offerings in the future.  
We also continue to evolve our hardware portfolio, with success in our award-winning HP Laser Jet 400 and 500 series. HP continues to be recognized as a best managed print vendor, helping SMB solution providers thrive in a competitive market where quality and security are essential. The strength of our position in the commercial market is significant as more people return to the office.  
In our industrial businesses, we drove very strong hardware revenue growth in the quarter. Importantly, our number of pages printed is at or above 2019 levels. We once again saw double-digit growth in print impressions and square meters as well as strength in key categories like labels and packaging. And in 3D, we remain focused on driving high-value end-to-end applications in strategic vertical markets.  
This quarter, we launched the new Arize for orthotic solution. It leverages HP's CD printing and cloud-based software to help the millions of patients who suffer from foot pain. It is a great example of the opportunity we see to disrupt industries with highly personalized solutions.  
Our combination of innovation and execution enables us to continue making progress across our business and portfolio. And we remain committed to generating strong cash flow and to value-creating capital allocation. This includes our robust share repurchase and dividend program and disciplined organic and inorganic investment.  
In Q3, we returned $1.7 billion to shareholders and have returned $6.8 billion over the past 12 months. We believe our shares remain undervalued and are committed to aggressive repurchase levels of at least $1.5 billion in Q4.  
As part of our value creation strategy, we also remain focused on M&A that can accelerate our growth in strategic areas. HyperX and Teradici are 2 great examples. We will continue using our rigorous returns-based framework to evaluate and pursue deals that complement our strategy and accelerate new sources of value creation.  
As we drive our portfolio strategy and transformation agenda, we continue to prioritize making a sustainable impact. This quarter, we released our 20th Annual Sustainable Impact Report that highlights the work we are doing in climate action, human rights and digital equity and outlined new 2030 goals. Not only is this the right thing to do, it's also driving business success. In 2020, our sustainable impact initiatives help us win more than $1 billion in new sales for the second consecutive year.  
Aligned with this, we recently issued $1 billion in sustainability bonds. We are allocating these proceeds to ESG-related initiatives consistent with our strategy and values. Looking ahead to Q4, our backlog remains significantly elevated. We expect robust demand to continue, and we are taking decisive steps to address operational headwinds. Our portfolio is strong and resilient, and we remain on track to significantly exceed the full year EPS target we set in February. And today, we are raising our Q4 outlook. And more importantly, we plan to build on this performance and expect to grow full year EPS in fiscal year '22.  
Longer term, the hybrid world plays to our strength and creates attractive opportunities across our categories. We are well positioned to drive sustained performance as we innovate, improve and continue to reinvent for our customers, partners and shareholders. I look forward to our upcoming October analyst meeting to discuss our strategy and our plans to drive continued business success.  
Let me now turn the call over to Marie, who will take you through the details of the quarter and our fiscal year outlook. Marie, over to you."

Looking at our third quarter financial results, we delivered another solid quarter of revenue growth, with operating profit and EPS growing substantially faster. We are continuing our transformation journey while generating strong free cash flow, returning significant capital to shareholders and investing for long term value creation.  
Looking at the details of Q3. Net revenue was $15.3 billion, up 7% nominally and 4% in constant currency. Regionally, in constant currency, Americas increased 12%, EMEA increased 1%,  and APJ declined 6%. Supply chain constraints affected both Print and Personal Systems revenue. And this was particularly impactful in EMEA and APJ in Personal Systems. Across Personal Systems and Print, we continue to see strong demand for our products and solutions, capitalizing on opportunities we see as the hybrid world take shape.  
The gross margin was 22.2%, up 5.5 points year-on-year. The increase was primarily driven by continued favorable pricing, including lower promotions as well as a reduction to previously estimated sales and marketing program incentives as well as currency, partially offset by higher costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.9 billion or 12.4% of revenue. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by increased investments in go-to-market and innovation as well as higher variable compensation due to the very strong performance this fiscal year as compared to 2020. 
Non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $78 million for the quarter. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share increased $0.51 to $1, including $0.25 related to the reduction in previously estimated incentives, of which $0.12 were reinvested during the quarter primarily in accelerating R&D, incremental marketing and our hybrid work strategy.  
Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes net expense totaling $90 million, primarily related to restructuring and other charges, amortization of intangibles, acquisition-related charges, debt extinguishment costs, other tax adjustments, partially offset by nonoperating retirement-related credits. As a result, Q3 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.92.  
Before I get into the details of the segments, let me briefly address the reduction in previously estimated sales and marketing program incentives. Consistent with our policies, we review these estimates every quarter. We estimate incentives based on a number of factors like historical experience, customer behavior and market conditions. The change in estimate is a result of lower-than-expected incentives due to increased supply constraints, shifts in customer behavior and the evolving impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, it became clear that we had to make an unusually large change in estimate in Q3.  
Now let me turn to segment performance. In Q3, Personal Systems revenue was $10.4 billion, flat year-over-year as supply chain challenges continue to constrain our growth. Demand for our products remain strong with backlog increasing again sequentially despite substantially clearing the Chrome backlog.  
Drilling into the details. Consumer and Commercial revenue was up 3% and down 1%, respectively. By product category, revenue was flat for notebooks, up 1% for desktops and down 9% for workstations. Total units were flat year-over-year. We also drove double-digit growth in both consumer peripherals and services attach across consumer and commercial.  
Personal Systems delivered $869 million in operating profit and operating margins of 8.4%. The operating margin improved 2.9 points primarily due to favorable pricing, including the reduction in estimated incentives and currency, partially offset by higher costs, including commodity costs, investments in innovation in go-to-market and variable compensation.  
In Print, our results reflected continued focus on execution and the strength of our portfolio. We are uniquely positioned as leaders in both consumer and commercial and have the hardware, support and services to deliver value in a hybrid world. Q3 total group revenue was $4.9 billion, up 24%, driven by strong growth in supply, hardware and services. Total hardware units declined 4% due to manufacturing and component constraints, primarily in consumer produce. We expect these Q3 constraints to impact Q4 as well.  
By customer segment, Consumer revenue was up 15%, with units down 8% and commercial revenue in units were up 46% and 29%, respectively. Consumer demand remained strong, however, revenues, particularly A4 laser, was constrained by supply and factory disruptions. The commercial recovery continued with double-digit hardware revenue growth in office and triple-digit increases in industrial printing hardware. Given what we're seeing with the Delta variant and evolving hybrid models, we still expect recovery to be gradual and uneven at times across segments and geographies.  
Supply revenue was $3.1 billion. The 20% year-on-year growth was driven by inventory replenishment, stronger commercial demand and favorable pricing. Our contractual business is a key element of our print strategy in both Consumer and commercial printing. In Consumer, our Instant Ink business model continued to resonate well with customers with strong double-digit revenue and subscriber growth.  
On the commercial side, we drove growth in Managed Print Services revenue and total contract value with particular strength in new TCV bookings. Print operating profit increased $377 million to $857 million, and operating margins were 17.6%. Operating margin grew 5.4 points, driven primarily by favorable pricing, including the reduction in estimated incentives, higher volumes in commercial hardware, including graphics and 3D, partially offset by unfavorable mix and higher costs, including commodity costs, investments in innovation and go-to-market and variable compensation.  
Let me now turn to our transformation efforts and our cost savings initiatives. In the second year of our program, we continue to look at new cost savings opportunities and remain ahead of our $1.2 billion gross run rate structural cost reduction plan. Our hybrid work strategy is one example. It has enabled us to accelerate our location strategy while providing a more flexible workspace. Going forward, we are enabling HP's hybrid work strategy by monetizing our sites to be critical hubs for collaboration and innovation. This will also deliver savings in our real estate portfolio.  
In addition to our progress on our location strategy, we are making progress in our digital transformation. We are enhancing and leveraging our digital capabilities to transform the ways we operate and deliver value to our customers. In the third quarter, we completed the initial deployment of our SAP S/4HANA system, one of the largest ERP implementations. Also, as part of our end-to-end business planning and forecasting efforts, we also went live with our new cloud-based platform, which we believe will improve our forecasting agility as part of our digital transformation.  
The structural cost savings from our transformation efforts are a key enabler of reinvesting in our business for long-term growth and profitability.  
Shifting to cash flow and capital allocation. Third quarter cash flow from operations and free cash flow were $1.1 billion and $1 billion, respectively. In Q3, the cash conversion cycle was minus 29 days. Sequentially, the cash conversion cycle improved 1 day as higher days payable outstanding more than offset the increased days of inventory due to growth in inventory across PS and Print, and the 1-day increase in days sales outstanding.  
For the quarter, we returned a total of $1.7 billion to shareholders, which represented 178% of free cash flow. This included $1.5 billion in share repurchase and $230 million in cash dividends. Looking forward, we expect to continue to aggressively buy back shares at elevated levels of at least $1.5 billion in Q4.  
Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we continue to navigate supply availability and logistics constraints, pricing dynamics and the pace of economic reopening. In particular, keep the following in mind related to our overall financial outlook. For Personal Systems, we continue to see strong demand for our PCs, particularly in commercial. In Print, we expect solid demand in consumer and a mix shift of commercial continues to improve. For both Personal Systems and Print, we expect that component shortages as well as some manufacturing, port and transit disruptions will continue to constrain revenue due to the ongoing pandemic and resurgence driven by the Delta variant.  
Taking these considerations into account, we are increasing our Q4 and FY '21 EPS. We expect fourth quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.84 to $0.90, and fourth quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.82 to $0.88. We expect full year non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.69 to $3.75, and FY '21 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.56 to $3.62. For FY '21, we expect our free cash flow to be at least $4 billion.

And overall, we expect that PS will be well above our long-term range of 3.5% to 5.5% in Q4. So think about it in terms of being similar to half 1 levels. And we'll talk more about that when we get to SAM.  
Now to address your question with respect to the change in incentive, in terms of the impact on PS margin with respect to OP quarter-on-quarter, the net impact of the reduction in the previously estimated sales and marketing incentive was approximately -- about 1.5 points, and we're talking about that net of investments.

What we saw was that when we finished the quarter, our backlog orders that we had at one customer that wanted us to ship were significantly larger than what it was at the beginning of the quarter. And what we saw is very strong demand from both commercial and consumer categories. In both cases, we saw increase of demand.  
The area you were mentioning where we saw some weakness was on the Chromebook space because many -- and it was mostly in the U.S., because many school districts decided to stop their purchase activities until they had clarity on what type of new funds they were going to be getting from the federal government and the timing of those funds. And now this has been clarified. We expect that now, demand on the education space in Chromebooks will pick up at the end of this quarter or at the beginning of next quarter.  
But in any case, very strong demand on the PC side, faster growth on the commercial, but very strong growth for some consumer."

On the PC side, what we saw is we clearly have some areas where we need to improve operationally to be able to optimize our performance given the delta between supply and demand.  
And there are 3 areas where specifically we need to -- we are working and we need to do some more work. First of all, as you know, we have an outsourced model, where the majority of our production is managed by ODM. This means that also ODMs were managing it until now, the relationship with the providers of the components that we are missing. We have been changing that, signing now direct relationship and direct supply agreements with them, so this is addressing that gap.  
Second important factor is one of the key strengths of our PC business is the breadth of our portfolio. We lead both in consumer and commercial. But this portfolio has not been designed to optimize for low-cost components, which is what we are missing now. We have been changing that. And what you will -- as we will introduce our new products going forward, you will see an increase of leverage of components across multiple products, so we can really optimize our de-utilization of components.  
And third, as we -- as Marie mentioned during the prepared remarks, we have been working to deploy a new ERP system. That -- the ERP system is now in place. And now we have the ability to create tools that will help us to optimize the allocation of orders, not only based on business priorities but also on component availability. And this is something that until now, because we were in the middle of the ERP change, we had to do manually.  
So when I look at all these 3 areas, explain kind of the improvements that you are going to see on this side and give us confidence on how we will continue to optimize, how we manage the current situation.  
Then the second part of your question around Chromebooks. I think that an important factor to realize is that during the quarter, we closed the backlog because the shipments of Chromebooks were 100% higher than shipments that we made before. When we look at the backlog that is left, we analyzed it customer by customer, retailer by retailer, partner by partner. And this gives us very strong confidence on the value and the solidity of that backlog.  
If we look at cancellations, with the exception of Chromebooks coming from some of the changes in the U.S. School District, we are not seeing cancellations of the backlog. And as we mentioned before, it is more than one full quarter of demand what we have in backlog."

And at the same time, we are starting to see some light slowdown on the consumer side, which again is what we were expecting. And in any case, the consumer business today continues to be above the projections that we have for this time before the pandemic started. And this is a structural change that has happened. 
Additionally to that, we have been able to accelerate the transition of our business models, both rebalancing profitability but also significantly growing our subscription businesses.

Then I'll address your question specifically around the accrual and the reserves. 
So we typically look at these estimates every quarter. So we estimate our sales and marketing incentives based on a number of different factors. So for example, historical experience, expected customer behavior, acceptance rates. And a very important driver is market conditions, which, as you know, we've experienced a lot of volatility since the COVID-19 pandemic began. 
It's also worth noting that some of these programs take several months, from 6 to 12 months for partners to claim. So with the impact of these market dynamics, combined with the lower claims that we've seen from our partners, it became clear that we had to make this unusually large change in estimate in Q3. And frankly, we don't expect future changes of this size. But if it changes, we'll make the appropriate disclosures. 
Now typically, reserves, just to answer your question, you asked me about the reserve, and then I'll address your structural component. Reserves are typically liabilities for estimated future payments. So a reserve can occur for a variety of reasons. One of those can actually be a change in estimate. 
And in terms of structural, as you know, we have in place a transformation plan. We are expecting to be at 75% of our $1.2 billion plan. And we're always looking for opportunities to drive efficiency in our pricing. And we've been very effective, actually, in pricing for the current market environment, as you see in the results that we've delivered.

And this quarter, we had 2 great examples that show how do we approach and how do we think about M&A. We closed the HyperX deal that is really allowing us to accelerate our growth into the peripheral space. And now we have a leading position in peripheral for gaming. And we did also a very exciting opportunity on the services space, with the acquisition of Teradici Corporation, that will allow us to integrate into our services, remote compute for highly complex environments, which many of our customers are utilizing today.

And today, when we closed the quarter, more than 60% of the backlog was coming from commercial customers, which is where margins are higher and where we -- and this is really an important factor to have in mind. 
As we look at the future, we expect the Chromebook business to accelerate again at the end of Q3 and at the end of Q4. But I think it's important to have in mind that Chromebooks represents around 10% of our total PC business, even slightly below that.

At our Securities Analyst Meeting last month, we shared our plans to continue building a stronger HP, one that delivers sustained revenue, operating profit, EPS and free cash flow growth. This quart",1436,"Thanks, Ori, and thank you all for joining today's call. At our Securities Analyst Meeting last month, we shared our plans to continue building a stronger HP, one that delivers sustained revenue, operating profit, EPS and free cash flow growth. This quarter's results reflect our continued momentum against this plan and great confidence in our future.
Let me talk through the details. In Q4, Revenue grew 9% to $16.7 billion. Non-GAAP EPS grew 52% to [indiscernible]. And we generated more than $900 million of free cash flow while returning $2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Our Q4 results are a great finish to an exceptional year. For the full year, we grew revenue 12% to $63.5 billion and generated $1.7 billion of incremental non-GAAP operating profit.
[indiscernible] grew 66%. This means that we exceeded our value creation plan target for operating profit and EPS, a full year ahead of plan. And we returned a record $7.2 billion to shareholders while continuing to invest in strategic growth opportunities across the business.
Our Q4 and full year performance shows a company on its own food and hitting its side. Long-term secular trends such as hybrid to our competitive. Our leadership across our market and the innovation agenda we are driving are enabling us to turn these trends into tailwinds. We are making organic and inorganic investments to drive our growth. And we are accelerating information, building new digital capabilities, we are also reducing structural costs and driving efficiencies.
The progress we are making against our priorities is creating a more growth-oriented portfolio. At our Analyst Day, I said that we expect our 5 key growth areas to grow double digits and generate over $10 billion in revenue in fiscal '22. These businesses collectively grew 12% this quarter. This includes more than 30% growth for our Instant Ink business, as well as more than 20% growth for our industrial graphics portfolio. We see our key growth areas becoming a bigger part of overall revenue and profit mix moving forward. We are driving this growth even as we continue to navigate a complex and dynamic operational environment that includes robust demand and persistent supply constraints.
The actions we have been taking to mitigate industry-wide headwinds are paying off. There is no quick fix, but we are strengthening our operational execution and making continued progress quarter-by-quarter.
And I just want to say how proud I am of the way our teams are stepping up. It has not been easy, but the challenges we have faced have not deterred from driving our business forward and the fact that we deliver double-digit revenue and profit growth for the year gives us confidence as we enter 2022.
Let me now talk about the strength we see across each of our business units. In Personal Systems, there continues to be very strong demand. Here, revenue and operating profit it grew double digits in Q4. And our disciplined execution and pricing strategy allowed us to effectively manage costs and components headwinds. A big part of our success is improved mix, we are driving given our leadership in the commercial PC market. And more offices reopened, we led a shift toward Windows-based commercial products where we saw the strongest demand and highest profitability. We continue to see  significantly elevated order backlog.
As I shared last month, we expect component shortages, particularly in ISC to persist in at least the first half of '22. The operational actions we outlined in our Q3 call are generating positive results. We continue to increase this engagement with Tier 2 and Tier 3. We have expanded long-term agreements to security and our digital transformation initiatives are enabling greater real-time visibility to optimize our speed, agility and mix. This work remains a daily priority and we expect our trajectory to continue to improve. 
We are also creating important innovation as we design for all things hybrids. This includes a new lineup of Windows 11 devices that enable premium computing experiences for work and home. We are also expanding into valuable adjacencies. Last quarter, we introduced HP Presence, the world's most advanced video conferencing system. This is a large opportunity that will continue to grow as our physical world converged. 7 out of 10 companies are already investing in technologies that improve hybrid work experience for their employees.
HP Presence combines our hardware, software, imaging operational capabilities to create a more immersive experience so that distributed teams fully feel they are in the same room, even if they are not. You will see us continuing to innovate and expand our presence in the growing hybrid collaboration space.
We also delivered another quarter of double-digit Device-as-a-Service revenue growth the launch of new digital services to help commercial customers simplify the complexity of hybrid IT environment. And following the close of our Teradici acquisition, we launched a lineup of new HP Teradici and NVIDIA subscription offer to enable high-performance remote collaboration.
Turning to Print. We grew revenue 1% in the quarter. This was primarily driven by our disciplined pricing strategy as well as our continuing services and subscriptions which offset expected volume decline driven by limited supply. Like others in the industry, we continue to operate in a supply-constrained environment driven by COVID-related broader logistics issues.
Against this backdrop, demand our print hardware and supply remains strong. The fact is we had more hardware order that we could fulfill in the quarter. And as we said last month, we expect this to impact trend growth in fiscal year '22. But this is not stopping us from advancing our strategic priorities. We continue to grow our HP Plus portfolio globally, including a rollout to our HP Inspire 7000 series that is designed for families working, learning and creating new memories from home. Importantly, it is built with sustainability in mind and made from over 45% recycled plastic content. We are also growing our digital services to enable hybrid office printing.
A great [indiscernible] this quarter's launch of HP Sprint Flex, a new cloud-first NPS subscription plan or hook environment. In Q4, we drove double-digit growth of NPS revenue and total contract value. And this supports our workforce solutions momentum. We're increasingly integrating our offerings across print and personal systems to meet new customer needs and unlock new growth opportunities. Our recently launched HP Work from Home Service is [indiscernible] of how we are leveraging our divest portfolio to win in the hybrid office.
As I mentioned earlier, we are also driving Industrial Graphics and 3D printing growth. In Industrial Graphics, we drove double-digit revenue growth in the quarter and have built a healthy backlog of industrial presence. This continued the positive recovery trend from prior quarter. We also continue to see a mix shift towards more productive industrial presence with significant growth ports and packaging. And in 3D, our focus on high-value end-to-end applications is paving the way for entirely new growth businesses. For molded fiber, footwear and orthotics initiatives are on track. Our progress against our strategic priorities is also driving strong cash flow, and we continue to be disciplined stewards of capital. We have a robust returns-based approach that we are applying to every aspect of our capital allocation. We will continue to invest in areas where we see growth opportunities while continuing to return capital to our shareholders.
We believe our shares remain undervalued. And we are committed to aggressive repurchase levels of at least $4 billion in fiscal year '22. We also expect M&A will continue to play an important role. Specifically, we plan to pursue deals that accelerate our strategies and drive profitable growth. And we are making ongoing progress against our sustainable impact agenda.
ESG is a driver of long-term value creation for all stakeholders and we continue to pursue an ambitious agenda. The latest example is our expanded partnership with World Wildlife Fund. We are working to restore, protect and improve the management of nearly 1 million acres of forest landscape. This supports our focus on making every page printed forest positive.
[indiscernible], our portfolio is innovative and resilient. Our strategy is driving revenue, operating profit, EPS and free cash flow growth. We are returning highly attractive levels of capital to shareholders, and we are confident fiscal year '22 guidance that we shared at our Analyst Day. We are entering the new year from a position of great strength, and I look forward to continuing to share our progress.
Let me now turn the call over to Marie who will take you through the details of the quarter and our fiscal Q1 outlook. Marie, over to you."

I want to start by building on something Enrique said a moment ago. Q4 was strong [indiscernible] to a very strong year. It builds on our proven track record of meeting or exceeding the goals we set, and it underscores our confidence in our '22 and long-term financial outlook. Let me begin by providing some additional color on [indiscernible] starting with the full year. Revenue was $63.5 billion, up 12%. Non-GAAP operating profit was $5.8 billion, up 42%. Non-GAAP EPS even faster, up 66% to $3.79. This continues our trend of growing non-GAAP EPS every year since separation.
Our $4.2 billion of free cash flow was consistent with our full year guidance and adjusting for the net migration proceeds and we returned a record $7.2 billion to shareholders. That's 72% of free cash flow. What's especially important to note is how well balanced our performance is. We are growing up the bottom line. We are returning capital to shareholders and investing in the business. We are accelerating new growth businesses and driving efficiencies.
This reflects the company geared towards both short- and long-term value creation as we enter a new period of growth for HP. This is supported by our Q4 numbers. Net revenue was $16.7 billion in the quarter, up 9% nominally and 7% in constant currency. Regionally, in constant currency, Americas declined 4%, EMEA increased 15% and APJ increased 18%. As Enrique mentioned, supply chain constraints continue to impact both Print and Personal Systems revenue and this was particularly impactful to our print hardware results this quarter. That said, demand remains strong as hybrid work creates sustained tailwinds.
Gross margin was 19.6% in the quarter, up 2 points year-on-year. The increase was primarily driven by continued favorable pricing, including currency, partially offset by higher costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.9 billion or 11.5% of revenue. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by increased investments in market and innovation.
Non-GAAP operating profit was $1.3 billion, up 28% and non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $64 million for the quarter. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share increased $0.32 or 52% to $0.94, with a diluted share count of approximately 1.1 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes Oracle litigation gains, defined benefit plan settlement gains, nonoperating retirement-related credits partially offset by restructuring and other charges, amortization of intangibles, acquisition initiatives, other tax adjustments. As a result, Q4 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $2.71.
Now let's turn to segment performance. In Q4, Personal Systems revenue was $11 billion, up 13% year-on-year. Total units were down 9%, given the expected supply chain challenges and lower chrome mix. The fact we still grew revenue double digits in this environment reflected the strength of demand and positive impact of our mix shifts towards mainstream and premium commercial.
Drilling into the details, Consumer revenue was down 3% and Commercial was up 25%. By product category, revenue was up 13% for notebooks, 11% for desktops and 39% for boards. We also continued to drive double-digit growth across peripherals and services. Personal Systems delivered $764 million in operating profit with operating margins of 6.5%. Our margin improved 1.4 points, primarily due to continued favorable pricing, product mix and currency, partially offset by higher costs, including commodity costs and investments in innovation and go-to-market.
In Print, our results reflected consecution and the strength of our portfolio as we navigated the supply environment. Q4 total print revenue was $4.9 billion, up 1%, driven by favorable pricing in hardware and growth in services, partially offset by a decline in supplies. Total hardware units declined 26% due to consumer replenishment last year in Q4 and increased manufacturing and component constraints. We expect these print hardware constraints to extend at least into the first half of 2022.
By Customer segment, Consumer revenue was down 6% with units down 28% and Commercial revenue grew 19% with units down 12%. Consumer demand remains solid. However, revenue across both home and office was constrained by the current supply and factory environment. The commercial recovery showed further progress with double-digit hardware revenue growth with triple-digit increases in industrial printing hardware. We expect to see a continued gradual and uneven recovery in commercial extending into FY '22.
Supplies revenue was $3.1 billion, declining 2% year-on-year, driven primarily by prior year channel inventory replenishment. We also saw steady normalization of ink and turn mix, partially offset by favorable pricing. We saw continued momentum in our contractual business. As we discussed at our Analyst Day, this is a key part of our broader services strategy. Instant Ink delivered double-digit increases in both cumulative subscriber growth and revenues. We also drove growth in Managed Print Services revenue and total contract value with strength in both renewals and new TCV bookings.
Print operating profit increased $117 million to $813 million, and operating margins was 17%. Operating margin grew 2.2 points, driven primarily by favorable pricing and improved performance in Industrial, including graphics and 3D partially offset by unfavorable mix and higher costs, including commodity cost and investments in innovation and go-to-market.
Now let me turn to our transformation efforts. As we completed the second year of our cost savings, we have now delivered more than 80% of our $1.2 billion gross run rate structural cost reduction plan and we continue to look at new cost savings opportunities. Transformation is not only about [indiscernible] but about also creating new capabilities and long-term value creation. One example I'd like to highlight is our ongoing digital transformation. By leveraging our new digital platforms, we are enhancing our capabilities and trends fully operate to deliver new solutions to us.
With this capability, we recently launched Wolf Pro Security and a new subscription service that enables customers to digitally manage their software on an [indiscernible] basis. The structural cost savings from our transformation efforts are enabling us to invest in these types of strategic growth drivers. And we see many more opportunities like this to drive business enablement through additional sub services and solutions offerings.
Let me now move to cash flow and capital allocation. Q4 cash flow from operations was $2.8 billion and free cash flow of $0.9 billion, after the additional adjustment for the net article litigation proceeds of $1.8 billion. The cash conversion cycle was minus 25 days in the quarter. This deteriorated 4 days sequentially as lower days [indiscernible] and higher days sales outstanding was only partially offset by the decrease in days of inventory.
For the quarter, we returned a total of $2 billion to shareholders, which represented $200 [indiscernible] of free cash flow. This included $1.75 billion in shares and $219 million in cash dividends. For FY '21, we returned a record $7.2 billion to shareholders or 172% of free cash flow.
Looking to FY '22. We expect to continue aggressively buying back shares at elevated levels of at least $4 billion. Our share repurchase program lined with our recently increased annual dividend of $1 per share has us on track to exceed our $16 billion return of capital target set in our value creation plan.
Looking forward to Q1 and FY '22, we continue to navigate supply availability, logistics constraints, pricing dynamics and the pace of the economic recovery. In particular, keep the following in mind related to our Q1 and overall fiscal 2022 financial outlook.
For Personal Systems, we continued long demand for our PCs, particularly in commercial as well as favorable pricing. We expect solid PS revenue growth to continue into fiscal '22 with the shift to higher growth categories, including commercial, premium and peripherals. We expect PS margins to be towards the high end of our 5% to 7% long-term range.
In Print, we expect solid demand in consumer, a continued normalization and mix as commercial gradually improves through 2022 and disciplined cost management. We expect print margins to be towards the higher end of our 16% to 18% long-term range.
For Personal Systems, we expect the component shortages as well as manufactured transit disruptions will continue to constrain revenue due to the ongoing pandemic in many parts of the world. In Print, we expect similar but more acute challenges, particularly with regard to factory disruptions and component shortages. We expect these challenges across peers and print to persist at least through the first half of 2022.
Furthermore, normal sequential seasonality doesn't apply for FY '22, and we expect our revenue performance to be more by quarter, particularly driven by PS. In addition, we expect a slight headwind year-on-year, approximately $20 million per quarter from corporate investments and others.
Taking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook. We expect first quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.99 to $1.05. And first quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.92 and to $0.98. We expect full year non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $4.07 to $4.27 and FY '22 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.86 to $4.06. For FY '22, we expect free cash flow to be at least $4.5 billion.
Overall, I feel very good about our performance and our outlook. I am confident in our ability to deliver consistent, long-term sustainable growth. And we look forward to taking your questions. So let me hand it back to the operator."

And then somewhat related to that, you -- I think, Marie, you basically said we should sort of ignore traditional seasonality and kind of think a flattish growth throughout the year. But if you're actually going to make any progress in drawing down your backlog and demand remains strong, your seasonality actually should be above normal seasonality because demand is continuing at the same rate, but you're getting a tailwind from backlog ultimately, if you're able to draw that down.

So our sequential revenue growth in '22 is, therefore, going to be more consistent quarter-to-quarter. And I just -- like I did -- I think at the SAM meeting that we don't expect normal seasonality. And then with respect to the PS operating margins in the quarter, PS was actually. The rate was actually down slightly quarter-on-quarter, and that was just really due to, you might recall the material change in estimate that we had back in Q3.

At our Securities Analyst Meeting last month, we shared our plans to continue building a stronger HP, one that delivers sustained revenue, operating profit, EPS and free cash flow growth. This quarter's results reflect our continued momentum against this plan, and they give us great confidence in our future.
Let me talk through the details. In Q4, revenue grew 9% to $16.7 billion. Non-GAAP EPS grew 52% to $0.94. And we generated more than $900 million of free cash flow while returning $2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Our Q4 results are a great finish to an exceptional year.
For the full year, we grew revenue 12% to $63.5 billion and generated $1.7 billion of incremental non-GAAP operating profit. Non-GAAP EPS grew 66%. This means that we exceeded our value creation plan target for non-GAAP operating profit and EPS a full year ahead of plan. And we returned a record $7.2 billion to shareholders while continuing to invest in strategic growth opportunities across the business.
Our Q4 and full year performance shows a company on its front foot and hitting its stride. Long-term secular trends such as hybrid play to our competitive strength. Our leadership across our market and the innovation agenda we are driving are enabling us to turn these trends into tailwinds. We are making organic and inorganic investments to drive profitable growth. And we are accelerating our transformation, building new digital capabilities while also reducing structural costs and driving efficiencies. The progress we are making against our priorities is creating a more growth-oriented portfolio.
At our Analyst Day, I shared that we expect our 5 key growth areas to grow double digits and generate over $10 billion in revenue in fiscal '22. These businesses collectively grew 12% this quarter. This includes more than 30% growth for our Instant Ink business as well as more than 20% growth for our industrial graphics portfolio. We see our key growth areas becoming a bigger part of overall revenue and profit mix moving forward. We are driving this growth even as we continue to navigate a complex and dynamic operational environment that includes robust demand and persistent supply constraints.
The actions we have been taking to mitigate industry-wide headwinds are paying off. There is no quick fix, but we are strengthening our operational execution and making continued progress quarter-by-quarter. And I just want to say how proud I am of the way our teams are stepping up. It has not been easy, but the challenges we have faced have not deterred us from driving our business forward and the fact that we delivered double-digit revenue and profit growth for the year gives us confidence as we enter 2022.
Let me now talk about the strength we see across each of our business units. In Personal Systems, there continues to be very strong demand. Here, revenue and operating profit, each grew double digits in Q4. And our disciplined execution and pricing strategy allowed us to effectively manage costs and component headwinds. A big part of our success is the improved mix we are driving given our leadership in the commercial PC market. As more offices reopen, we led a shift toward Windows-based commercial products where we saw the strongest demand and highest profitability. We continue to see a significantly elevated order backlog.
As I shared last month, we expect component shortages, particularly in IC, to persist into at least the first half of '22. The operational actions we outlined in our Q3 call are generating positive results. We continue to increase our direct engagement with Tier 2 and Tier 3 suppliers. We have expanded long-term agreements to secure capacity. And our digital transformation initiatives are enabling greater real-time visibility to optimize our speed, agility and mix. This work remains a daily priority and we expect our trajectory to continue to improve.
We are also creating important innovation as we design for all things hybrid. This includes a new lineup of Windows 11 devices that enable premium computing experiences for work and home. We are also expanding into valuable adjacencies. Last quarter, we introduced HP Presence, the world's most advanced video conferencing system. This is a large opportunity that will continue to grow as our digital and physical world converge. Seven out of 10 companies are already investing in technologies that improve hybrid work experience for their employees. HP Presence combines our hardware, software, imaging and peripheral capabilities to create a more immersive experience so that distributed teams can truly feel they are in the same room, even if they are not. You will see us continuing to innovate and expand our presence in the growing hybrid collaboration space.
We also delivered another quarter of double-digit Device as a Service revenue growth. This included the launch of new digital services to help commercial customers simplify the complexity of hybrid IT environment. And following the close of our Teradici acquisition, we launched a lineup of new Z by HP, Teradici and NVIDIA Omniverse subscription offer to enable high-performance remote collaboration.
Turning to Print. We grew revenue 1% in the quarter. This was primarily driven by our disciplined pricing strategy as well as our continued growth in services and subscriptions which offset expected volume decline driven by limited supply. Like others in the industry, we continue to operate in a supply-constrained environment driven by COVID-related disruption and broader logistics issues.
Against this backdrop, demand for our print hardware and supply remains strong. The fact is we had more hardware order than we could fulfill in the quarter. And as we said last month, we expect this to impact print growth in fiscal year '22. But this is not stopping us from advancing our strategic priorities. We continue to grow our HP+ portfolio globally, including the rollout of our ENVY Inspire 7000 series that is designed for families working, learning and creating new memories from home. Importantly, it is built with sustainability in mind and made from over 45% recycled plastic content.
We are also growing our digital services to enable hybrid office printing. A great example is this quarter's launch of HP Managed Print Flex, a new cloud-first MPS subscription plan for hybrid work environment. In Q4, we drove double-digit growth of MPS revenue and total contract value. And this supports our workforce solutions momentum. We're increasingly integrating our offerings across print and personal systems to meet new customer needs and unlock new growth opportunities. Our recently launched HP Work From Home Service is a great example of how we are leveraging our diverse portfolio to win in the hybrid office.
As I mentioned earlier, we are also driving industrial graphics and 3D printing growth. In industrial graphics, we drove double-digit revenue growth in the quarter and have built a healthy backlog of industrial presence. This continued the positive recovery trend from prior quarter. We also continue to see a mix shift towards more productive industrial presence with significant growth in labels and packaging. And in 3D, our focus on high-value end-to-end applications is paving the way for entirely new growth businesses. Our molded fiber, footwear and orthotics initiatives are on track.
Our progress against our strategic priorities is also driving strong cash flow, and we continue to be disciplined stewards of capital. We have a robust returns-based approach that we are applying to every aspect of our capital allocation. We will continue to invest in areas where we see growth opportunities while continuing to return capital to our shareholders. We believe our shares remain undervalued. And we are committed to aggressive repurchase levels of at least $4 billion in fiscal year '22. We also expect M&A will continue to play an important role. Specifically, we plan to pursue deals that accelerate our strategies and drive profitable growth.
And we are making ongoing progress against our sustainable impact agenda. ESG is a driver of long-term value creation for all stakeholders and we continue to pursue an ambitious agenda. The latest example is our expanded partnership with World Wildlife Fund. We are working to restore, protect and improve the management of nearly 1 million acres of forest landscape. This supports our focus on making every page printed forest positive.
To sum up, our portfolio is innovative and resilient. Our strategy is driving sustained revenue, operating profit, EPS and free cash flow growth. We are returning highly attractive levels of capital to shareholders, and we are confident in the fiscal year '22 guidance that we shared at our Analyst Day. We are entering the new year from a position of great strength, and I look forward to continuing to share our progress.
Let me now turn the call over to Marie who will take you through the details of the quarter and our fiscal Q1 outlook. Marie, over to you."
108856,1686891765,2447958,"HP Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 23, 2021",2021-11-23,"Earnings Calls","HP Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Enrique, and hello, everyone. It's good to be back together and it was great to connect with so many of you following our Analyst Day.I want to start by building on something Enrique said a moment ago. Q4 was a strong finish to a very strong yea",1621,"Thanks, Enrique, and hello, everyone. It's good to be back together and it was great to connect with so many of you following our Analyst Day.
I want to start by building on something Enrique said a moment ago. Q4 was a strong finish to a very strong year. It builds on our proven track record of meeting or exceeding the goals we set, and it underscores our confidence in our FY '22 and long-term financial outlook. Let me begin by providing some additional color on our results, starting with the full year. Revenue was $63.5 billion, up 12%. Non-GAAP operating profit was $5.8 billion, up 42%. We grew non-GAAP EPS even faster, up 66% to $3.79. This continues our trend of growing non-GAAP EPS every year since separation.
Our $4.2 billion of free cash flow was consistent with our full year guidance and adjusting for the net Oracle litigation proceeds. And we returned a record $7.2 billion to shareholders. That's 172% of free cash flow. What's especially important to note is how well balanced our performance is. We are growing our top and bottom line. We are returning capital to shareholders and investing in the business. We are accelerating new growth businesses and driving efficiencies.
This reflects a company geared towards both short and long-term value creation as we enter a new period of growth for HP. This is supported by our Q4 numbers. Net revenue was $16.7 billion in the quarter, up 9% nominally and 7% in constant currency. Regionally, in constant currency, Americas declined 4%, EMEA increased 15% and APJ increased 18%. As Enrique mentioned, supply chain constraints continue to impact both print and personal systems revenue, and this was particularly impactful to our print hardware results this quarter. That said, demand remains strong as hybrid work creates sustained tailwinds.
Gross margin was 19.6% in the quarter, up 2 points year-on-year. The increase was primarily driven by continued favorable pricing, including currency, partially offset by higher costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.9 billion or 11.5% of revenue. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by increased investments in go to market and innovation.
Non-GAAP operating profit was $1.3 billion, up 28% and non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $64 million for the quarter. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share increased $0.32 or 52% to $0.94, with a diluted share count of approximately 1.1 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes Oracle litigation gains, defined benefit plan settlement gains, nonoperating retirement-related credits, partially offset by restructuring and other charges, amortization of intangibles, acquisition-related charges, other tax adjustments. As a result, Q4 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $2.71.
Now let's turn to segment performance. In Q4, Personal Systems revenue was $11.8 billion, up 13% year-on-year. Total units were down 9% given the expected supply chain challenges and lower Chrome mix. The fact we still grew revenue double digits in this environment reflected the strength of demand and positive impact of our mix shift towards mainstream and premium commercial.
Drilling into the details, consumer revenue was down 3% and commercial was up 25%. By product category, revenue was up 13% for notebooks, 11% for desktops and 39% for workstations. We also continue to drive double-digit growth across peripherals and services. Personal Systems delivered $764 million in operating profit with operating margins of 6.5%. Our margin improved 1.4 points, primarily due to continued favorable pricing, product mix and currency, partially offset by higher costs, including commodity costs and investments in innovation and go to market.
In Print, our results reflected continued focus on execution and the strength of our portfolio as we navigated the supply chain environment. Q4 total print revenue was $4.9 billion, up 1%, driven by favorable pricing in hardware and growth in services, partially offset by a decline in supplies. Total hardware units declined 26% due to consumer replenishment last year in Q4 and increased manufacturing and component constraints. We expect these print hardware constraints to extend at least into the first half of 2022.
By customer segment, consumer revenue was down 6% with units down 28%. Commercial revenue grew 19% with units down 12%. Consumer demand remains solid. However, revenue across both home and office was constrained by the current supply and factory environment. The commercial recovery showed further progress with double-digit hardware revenue growth with triple-digit increases in industrial printing hardware. We expect to see a continued gradual and uneven recovery in commercial extending into FY '22.
Supplies revenue was $3.1 billion, declining 2% year-on-year, driven primarily by prior year channel inventory replenishment. We also saw steady normalization of ink and toner mix, partially offset by favorable pricing. We saw continued momentum in our contractual business. As we discussed at our Analyst Day, this is a key part of our broader services strategy. Instant Ink delivered double-digit increases in both cumulative subscriber growth and revenues. We also drove growth in Managed Print Services revenue and total contract value with strength in both renewals and new TCV bookings.
Print operating profit increased $117 million to $813 million, and operating margins was 17%. Operating margin grew 2.2 points driven primarily by favorable pricing and improved performance in industrial, including graphics and 3D, partially offset by unfavorable mix and higher costs, including commodity cost and investments in innovation and go to market.
Now let me turn to our transformation efforts. As we completed the second year of our cost savings program, we have now delivered more than 80% of our $1.2 billion gross run rate structural cost reduction plan and we continue to look at new cost savings opportunities. Transformation is not only about cost savings, but about also creating new capabilities and long-term value creation. One example I'd like to highlight is our ongoing digital transformation. By leveraging our new digital platforms, we are enhancing our capabilities and transforming the way we operate to deliver new solutions to our customers.
With this capability, we recently launched Wolf Pro Security, a new subscription service that enables customers to digitally manage their software on an annual subscription basis. The structural cost savings from our transformation efforts are enabling us to invest in these types of strategic growth drivers. And we see many more opportunities like this to drive business enablement through additional software, services and solutions offerings.
Let me now move to cash flow and capital allocation. Q4 cash flow from operations was $2.8 billion and free cash flow was $0.9 billion after the additional adjustment for the net Oracle litigation proceeds of $1.8 billion. The cash conversion cycle was minus 25 days in the quarter. This deteriorated 4 days sequentially as lower days payable outstanding and higher days sales outstanding was only partially offset by the decrease in days of inventory.
For the quarter, we returned a total of $2 billion to shareholders, which represented 210% of free cash flow. This included $1.75 billion in share repurchases and $219 million in cash dividends. For FY '21, we returned a record $7.2 billion to shareholders or 172% of free cash flow.
Looking ahead to FY '22, we expect to continue aggressively buying back shares at elevated levels of at least $4 billion. Our share repurchase program, combined with our recently increased annual dividend of $1 per share, has us on track to exceed our $16 billion return of capital target set in our value creation plan.
Looking forward to Q1 and FY '22, we continue to navigate supply availability, logistics constraints, pricing dynamics and the pace of the economic recovery. In particular, keep the following in mind related to our Q1 and overall fiscal 2022 financial outlook.
For Personal Systems, we continue to see strong demand for our PCs, particularly in commercial as well as favorable pricing. We expect solid PS revenue growth to continue into fiscal '22 with the shift to higher growth categories, including commercial, premium and peripherals. We expect PS margins to be towards the high end of our 5% to 7% long-term range.
In Print, we expect solid demand in consumer, a continued normalization in mix as commercial gradually improves through 2022 and disciplined cost management. We expect print margins to be towards the high end of our 16% to 18% long-term range.
For Personal Systems, we expect the component shortages as well as manufacturing port and transit disruptions will continue to constrain revenue due to the ongoing pandemic in many parts of the world. In Print, we expect similar but more acute challenges, particularly with regard to factory disruptions and component shortages. We expect these challenges across peers in print to persist at least through the first half of 2022.
Furthermore, normal sequential seasonality doesn't apply for FY '22, and we expect our revenue performance to be more linear by quarter, particularly driven by PS. In addition, we expect a slight headwind year-on-year, approximately $20 million per quarter from corporate investments and others.
Taking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook. We expect first quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.99 to $1.05. And first quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.92 to $0.98. We expect full year non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $4.07 to $4.27. And FY '22 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.86 to $4.06. For FY '22, we expect free cash flow to be at least $4.5 billion.
Overall, I feel very good about our performance and our outlook. I am confident in our ability to deliver consistent, long-term sustainable growth. And we look forward to taking your questions. So let me hand it back to the operator."

And then somewhat related to that, I think, Marie, you basically said we should sort of ignore traditional seasonality and kind of think a flattish growth throughout the year. But if you're actually going to make any progress in drawing down your backlog and demand remains strong, your seasonality actually should be above normal seasonality because demand is continuing at the same rate, but you're getting a tailwind from backlog ultimately if you're able to draw that down. So maybe you could just help provide some color on both of those things, potential inconsistencies and set me straight."

And then with respect to the PS operating margins in the quarter, PS was actually, the rate was actually down slightly quarter-on-quarter, and that was just really due to, you might recall, the material change in estimate that we had back in Q3. And also, you saw just the strength of the business that we actually had. So we did take the opportunity to make some onetime investments that we don't expect that they are probably going to repeat in '22."

And we think that really is going to be contributing to the sustained growth that we expect to see in Personal Systems. We have done a lot of changes internally to manage the business better. In the past, if you remember, we were calling it attach. And when you call a business attach, you don't put the best engineers, you don't put the investment that the business requires and you don't have the organizational focus. And we have changed all that.
We have a dedicated organization to peripheral. We have put some of the strongest leaders in the company to drive that initiative. We are increasing internal investment. We are moving some of our best engineers to the group. And we have also invested in inorganic, in acquisitions as the acquisition we did with HyperX to reinforce our position in some specific areas, like in the case of HyperX in peripherals for gaming.
What you will see us doing in the future is to continue to invest in this space. We think we have a great opportunity to continue to grow going forward. And we will be providing regular updates of the progress that we are going to see in that category going forward. And just to close, this quarter, we have double digit growth in this category.

And in some cases, we are also selling the part to the consumers or to the end users.
And we shared in our Investor Day that we were working on molded fiber and sustainable packaging and on orthotics and on footwear, 3 areas of businesses in the $8 billion to $12 billion where we can really drive a strong disruption because we think 3D printing is really going to help us to grow and to transform those industries.

Also, as we look at the composition of the backlog, the majority of the backlog now is coming from commercial customers, given that this is where we continue to see the strongest demand. Usually, there is an end user or in many cases, there is an end user associated with that backlog. So it means the probabilities of double booking or cancellation is even lower. But rest assured, this is something we monitor constantly, and we don't see any cancellations.

We have done several acquisitions in that space, both in printing technologies and also in software. And we have identified this as one of the key 5 growth areas of the company. And as I said, M&A is part of our plan. We expect to continue to do that in 2022.
And as we also shared, we have room to do that while at the same time we return aggressive capital to shareholders through both share repurchases and dividends. And as I said before, over time, we will be increasing our ratio to 1.5 to 2, which will be also another source of capital.
And I think it's now time to wrap up. So let me close the call by saying that we really feel strong about the quarter that we have, is a great proof point of the ability that we have to deliver value to our shareholders and shows the strong momentum that we have entered in fiscal year '22. And this is why we provided the guide that we provided for Q1 that show the strength that we see in our business. So thank you, everybody, for the call today, and we wish all of you a great Thanksgiving with your families. Thank you."
