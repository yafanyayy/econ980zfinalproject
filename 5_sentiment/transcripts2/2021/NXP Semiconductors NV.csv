Today, I will review our Q4 and our full year 2020 performance. I will provide insights on how we view the current supply-demand environment, and I will certainly discuss our guidance for quarter 1. 
Now let me begin with quarter 4. Our results were near the high end of our guidance. With the contribution from the automotive and mobile markets both meaningfully stronger than planned. And with trends in the industrial and IoT and communication infrastructure markets in line with our expectations. Taken together, NXP delivered quarter 4 revenue of 2.5 billion, an increase of 9% year-over-year and 57 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. 
Our non-GAAP operating margin in quarter 4 was a strong 30.5%. That is 60 basis points better than the year ago period and about 80 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance. Our outperformance was thanks to good fall-through on strength revenue growth, thanks to early benefits of our improved factory utilization and solid operating expense control. 
For the full year, revenue was 8.6 billion, a decline of 3% year-over-year. And as 2020 progressed, and the initial impacts from the pandemic earlier in the year subsided, our customers began to accelerate orders at a very robust rate, which we do anticipate will continue throughout 2021. Our full year non-GAAP operating margin was 25.9%, a 310 basis points decline because of lower revenue, reduced factory loadings combined with slightly reduced operating expenses. It is important to note though that throughout the year, we shifted more of our OpEx spend from SG&A towards R&D as we do continue to invest in new and differentiated products, which are definitely the lifeblood of our long-term growth ambitions. 
Now let me turn to the specific trends in our focus end markets, starting with automotive. Full year revenue was 3.83 billion, down 9% year-on-year, materially better than overall auto production and the reflection of strong new product traction and content gains in ADAS, in digital clusters, and in electrification, which we have all spoken about in the past. For quarter 4, automotive revenue was 1.2 billion, up 9% versus the year ago period, and 20 million better than our guidance. 
Now moving to industrial and IoT, full year revenue was 1.84 billion, 15% year-on-year up with both the wireless connectivity and our crossover processes supporting the growth. For quarter 4, Industrial and IoT revenue was 511 million, 23% versus the year ago period, and with that in line with our guidance. 
Now moving to mobile, our full year revenue in mobile was 1.25 billion, up 5% year-on-year. Now if we are reconciling this for the sale of our voice and audio business during quarter 1 last year, the underlying mobile end market growth was up a robust 19% year-on-year. And during the year, we experienced continued strong adoption of our secure mobile wallet and the early ramps of our ultra-wideband solutions, offset by the anticipated discontinuation of some parts of our semi-custom mobile analog interface business. 
We do estimate the full year attach rate of mobile wallets increased to about 40%, which is in line with our expectations and which is also supportive of our 50% attach rate target exiting 2021. For quarter 4, mobile revenue was 409 million, up 23% versus the year-ago period, and with that 40 million better than our guidance. 
And last but not least, communication infrastructure and other full year revenue was 1.7 billion, down 9% year-over-year. The year-on-year decline was due to reduced sales of RF Power products into the cellular base station market relative to the positive trends which we had experienced in the first half of 2019. For quarter 4, revenue was 394 million, down 14% year-on-year and in line with our guidance. 
Now before turning to our guidance and expectations for the first quarter, I would like to offer my view on the current demand and supply environment as it pertains to NXP. When our customers began to reopen after the shutdowns in the second quarter, we did see order rates through Q3 and Q4 accelerate at a very rapid rate. This trend has continued, and it will likely be the case over several quarters to come. The increased demand has been broad-based across most of our focus end markets, most of our product portfolio and all of our geographies, as well as across our direct and our distribution fulfillment channels. 
We actually believe that the working from home trends because of the pandemic which emerged in full force beginning in the first half of the year, led to an explosion in demand for high-volume consumer compute and mobile type products in the industry. And then as the auto and industrial markets began to rebound in the second half of the year, the available foundry capacity was largely sold out. As a result, we and others are experiencing significant increases in lead times, and in certain cases, increased costs from suppliers. Taking that all together, the setup indicates a really robust demand environment, combined with a very challenging supply situation, which we anticipate may continue for several more quarters. And we are working very diligently with both our external suppliers, our internal operations team and our customers to adequately align supply with demand. 
Against this backdrop, now let me come to the quarter 1 guidance. We are guiding quarter 1 revenue at 2.55 billion, up about 26% versus the first quarter of 2020 within the range of up 22% to up 30% year-over-year. From a sequential basis, this represents growth of about 2% at the midpoint versus the prior quarter. 
At the midpoint, we anticipate the following trends in our business. First, automotive is expected to be up in the mid-20% range versus quarter 1 2020 and up in the mid-single digits versus quarter 4 2020. Industrial and IoT is expected to be up nearly 50% year-over-year and up high single digits versus quarter 4 2020. Mobile is expected to be up 40% year-over-year and down in the mid-teens versus quarter 4 '20. And finally, Communication Infrastructure & Other is expected to be flat versus the same period a year ago and up in the low single-digit range on a sequential basis. 
Now while we are really encouraged by the rapid rebound in demand, it is important to remember we are still challenged by the impact of the global pandemic. And we will carefully navigate the improving demand environment, focused on meeting our customers' requirements while simultaneously assuring at all times, the safety and health of all of our employees. And I am extremely proud of their adaptability, their dedication and their hard work in the face of continued adversity. 
So in summary, customer engagement levels, our design win momentum and our strategic focus areas continue to be all very positive. And hence, we continue to be very optimistic about the future potential of NXP. 
And with that, I would like to pass the call to you, Peter, for a review of our financial performance."

Good morning to everyone on today's call. As Kurt already covered the drivers of the revenue during the fourth quarter and provided our revenue outlook for Q1, I'll move on to the financial highlights. Overall, our fourth quarter financia",1305,"Thank you, Kurt. Good morning to everyone on today's call. As Kurt already covered the drivers of the revenue during the fourth quarter and provided our revenue outlook for Q1, I'll move on to the financial highlights. Overall, our fourth quarter financial performance was very good. Revenue was near the high end of our guidance range with an improvement of both non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP operating profit. 
I'll first provide full year highlights and then move on to the fourth quarter results. Full year revenue for 2020 was $8.61 billion, down 3% year-on-year. We generated $4.4 billion in non-GAAP gross profit and reported a non-GAAP gross profit margin of 51.1%, down 240 basis points year-on-year because of the significant deceleration of revenue and the associated lower factory utilization during the year. 
Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $2.17 billion, down $8 million year-on-year. Total non-GAAP operating profit was $2.23 billion, and non-GAAP operating margin was 25.9%, down 310 basis points year-on-year. Non-GAAP interest expense was $357 million. Cash taxes for ongoing operations were $103 million and incidental taxes were $45 million with noncontrolling interests of 28 million. Stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings, was $384 million. 
Full year cash flow highlights include $2.48 billion in cash flow from operations, and $388 million in net CapEx investments resulting in $2.09 billion of non-GAAP free cash flow or a very healthy 24% of revenue. 
During 2020, we repurchased $627 million of shares and paid cash dividends of $420 million. In total, we returned $1.05 billion to our owners which was 50% of the total non-GAAP free cash flow generated during the year. 
Now moving to the details of the fourth quarter, total revenue was $2.51 billion, up 9% year-on-year, at the high end of our guidance range. We generated $1.3 billion in non-GAAP gross profit and reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 52.9%, down 130 basis points year-on-year and modestly above the midpoint of guidance. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $563 million, flat year-on-year and up $13 million from Q3, in line with the midpoint of our guidance. 
From a total operating profit perspective, non-GAAP operating profit was $764 million, and the non-GAAP operating margin was 30.5%, up 60 basis points year-on-year and well above the high end of our guidance. 
Non-GAAP interest expense was $90 million. Cash taxes for ongoing operations were $30 million and noncontrolling interest was $11 million. Stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings, was $89 million. 
So turning to the changes in our cash and debt, our total debt at the end of Q4 was $7.61 billion, down $1.75 billion sequentially as we retired early the 2021. $1.35 billion 4/8 and the 2022 $400 million foreign 5/8 notes. We did this on September 28, which was the first day of our fourth quarter. Our ending cash position was $2.28 billion, and was down $1.29 billion sequentially, mainly due to the previously noted debt repayments offset by cash generation during the fourth quarter. The resulting net debt was $5.33 billion and we exited the quarter with a trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA of $2.79 billion. Our ratio of net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q4 was 1.9x and our 12-month adjusted EBITDA interest coverage was 8x. Our liquidity is excellent, and our balance sheet continues to be very strong. 
During the fourth quarter, we paid $105 million in cash dividends and repurchased $257 million of our shares. 
Turning to working capital metrics, days of inventory was 78 days, a decrease of 6 days sequentially, significantly below our long-term target. We continue to closely manage our distribution channel with inventory in the channel of 1.6 months also below our long-term targets. Both metrics reflect customer orders accelerating faster than we anticipated, and we find ourselves in a supply-constrained position. It will take a number of quarters to rebuild on-hand inventory and channel inventories to our long-term target levels. 
Days receivables were 28 days, down 2 sequentially, and days payable was 75%, an increase of 20 days versus the prior quarter as we rapidly increased material orders with our suppliers. Taken together, our cash conversion cycle was 31 days, an improvement of 28 days versus the prior quarter, reflecting strong customer demand, solid receivables collections and positioning for customer deliveries in future periods. 
Cash flow from operations was $1.03 billion in the quarter, and net CapEx was 103 million. resulting in a non-GAAP free cash flow of $926 million. 
Turning to our expectations for the first quarter, as Kurt mentioned, we anticipate Q1 revenue to be about $2.55 billion plus or minus about $75 million. At the midpoint, this is up 26% year-on-year and 2% sequentially. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be about 53.5%, plus or minus 30 basis points. Operating expenses are expected to be about $590 million, plus or minus about $10 million. Taken together, we see non-GAAP operating margin to be about 30.4% at the midpoint. We estimate non-GAAP financial expense to be about $85 million and anticipate cash tax related to ongoing operations to be about $56 million. 
Noncontrolling interest will be about GBP 10 million. And for the first quarter, we suggest that for modeling purposes, you use an average share count of 284 million shares. 
Finally, I have a few closing comments I'd like to make. One, clearly, demand has come back more rapidly than we could have expected. Our current focus is to look after our customers and ensure we ship as much product to them as possible. It's unfortunate that some of our suppliers are attempting to use the current type supply environment as a short-term opportunity to raise prices, which we will clearly have to pass on. 
To be clear, though, we do not see this as an opportunity to improve our margin by sacrificing long-term relationships. Additionally, given the tightness in supply and the level of orders, we anticipate shipping for production during Q1. It's unlikely we'll be able to increase our month of supply that distributors or move our DIO target upward towards our long-term targets during the first quarter. 
Between January 4 and February 1, we bought back an additional $354 million worth of stock and plan to continue to buy back in line with our capital allocation policy of returning all excess cash to shareholders. Clearly, our operating margin reflects the significant fall-through benefit of the additional revenue. Although the current environment creates a new set of challenges, we believe we can still deliver on our margin improvement plan in 2021. 
In terms of the pandemic, our team continues to perform in a truly outstanding way. And the safety of our team members, as Kurt mentioned, continues to be our primary concern. If anyone experiences any symptoms or are in any way exposed to the virus, we ask them to self-isolate for a period. Unfortunately, in Q4, we've seen a few more people than expected in our fab operations requiring to self-isolate. And as a result of the shortage of labor, a small impact in our internal fab output. Although this causes a short-term issue, it's clearly best for our overall performance in both the short and medium term. We estimate this is impacting this to the tune of 80 basis points of profit in Q1 and 40 basis will impact us 40 basis points in Q2. While this is a short-term headwind, the safety of our employees remains our key consideration, and we believe our COVID protocols are appropriate and correct. 
Finally, I'd like to thank all my colleagues at NXP for a truly amazing 2020. You've done an incredible job in a truly unbelievable environment and set us up for a very bright future. 
So with that, I'll turn it back to the operator for your questions."

I think I said last quarter that utilization -- underutilization rather, would impact us about 150 basis points in Q4. So we'd have that level of benefit in Q1. As it turns out, because of these -- the need to self-isolate, and so again, 150 basis points of improvement from Q4 into Q1, we've only got about 70 basis points. So that 52.9 to 53.5 is 60 basis points is really made up of 3 big things, CJ. So we pick up 70 basis points from improved factory performance. 20 -- sorry, from underutilization, 20 basis points from improved factory performance above and beyond what we were expecting. And it's about 30 basis points of headwind because of our annual price reductions. So that's from Q4 to Q1. Then if you say, okay, well, in Q4, you did 53.5, why aren't you running -- sorry, from 52.9 to 53.5, why aren't you running 55%? That 150 basis points is really made up from 2 things. There's about -- in theory, it's about 50 basis points of underutilization very roughly. and about 100 basis points of mix. 
And the issue in mix really is one of our Comm Infra business. So our comm infra business in the first half is relatively weak and auto and mobile are relatively strong. And we think as we move through the year and as kind of 5G progresses, we've seen an improvement in our mix over time. Did I -- oh, your real question was about pricing, right? 
So pricing is really mixed, okay? So we're seeing some suppliers trying to put up the prices to us. But we -- in the same way that we have long-term contracts with our customers, we have similar contracts with many of our suppliers. So it's a bit of a mixed bag really. Having said that, we are seeing price increases. And where we have them, we will we'll endeavor to pass those on to our customers. You made an interesting comment actually about how quickly you can do it. So I think what we'll actually see is, hopefully, we'd be able to pass them on pretty quickly. But if you could always have a month or 2 when -- or I guess even a quarter when you can't really pass them on that quickly. 
So it's a disturbance rather than a fundamental issue. We would like to say that we don't see the current environment as an opportunity to structurally improve our margins. We're not a commodity business. We don't increase our prices when times are tight and reduce them when times are good. Did I manage to cover everything there?"

And while certainly, this is a challenging moment for everybody in the chain, there is a lot we speak about the future in terms of how do we best deal with this on a go-forward basis? Because everybody recognizes the enormous relevance of semiconductors in building cars. 
So thinking about trends, thinking about aligning forecasts on a longer-term basis, is definitely a positive result out of this. So I don't think this is a negative. I think it is actually something we as an industry altogether are learning from, how to avoid these things from happening in the future. And the way to do this is just a much closer collaboration than we've had along the chain. And what I mean is really not only with our Tier 1 customers, but also with the OEMs directly. And that is obviously great for innovation at the same time."

So let me start with what IHS is telling us for this year in units for auto, and that would be around 85 million units, which if that comes, it's like 14% year-on-year growth in units.

So let me start with what IHS is telling us for this year in units for auto, and that would be around 85 million units, which if that comes, it's like 14% year-on-year growth in units. 
This is the IHS number. We've always used it internally. I would tell you from my very, very frequent discussions over the past couple of weeks and also at the ending of last year. I think the sentiment in the auto industry is possibly even above that. So maybe more 85 to 90 million units in what the car companies thinks to achieve. But a lot of that is obviously based on the assumption of say, the second half of the year being fully vaccinated, society coming back to more normal lives and that actually being another push for auto production and order sales. Again, the former number is 85 million units, which would be a 14% growth. 
But you were hinting to the other half of this discussion, which is actually content, because clearly, the fact that we've been 7 points faster than the last year is thanks to content growth. And thanks to our specific play in our high-growth areas like radar and electrification, BMS, digital clusters, which actually did not decline. So our growth businesses, and you know that's about 1/4 of our auto business, those parts of our auto business did not decline last year. They actually had growth even in a year where the SAAR was, I think, last year, down by something like 16%. And we see the content growth certainly going at the same rate going forward. One really strong element is the CO2 targets which translates then often in electrification, but this is not just about the say, the electric engines. There's a lot of other applications which are coming in tune with electrification, which is overall driving the semi content in the car [indiscernible]. 
So all in all, we, I would say, I think it is safe to assume the 85 million units for this year, which is a 14% growth for SAAR. And definitely, our algorithm of outgrowing the SAAR as we spoke about it before, does stand strong also in this year. 
Now 1 last element on this, which everybody tries to understand currently is about inventory levels. I think at the moment from anything we can see, the supply chains through the auto world are empty. And I say that because I know that every single product we are shipping is immediately built into a car. And so there is just nothing going on the sideline. It all goes through into production immediately. That's why we also clearly said the ER supply constraints for the first quarter. 
And as a reaction to this, I hear quite a few people in the industry speaking about the desire to actually ask for more inventory along the chain in automotive going forward. There is 1 large U.S. OEM, which actually made even a public statement about how much chip inventory they would like to see at their first-tier customers. 
So if you model this on top of the content gains and SAAR growth, which we just spoke about, Then I think there is a good reason to believe there is a multiple quarter growth pattern ahead of us."

I think we talked about our gallium nitride, both product as well as production capability, getting online at the end of last quarter. And I can actually probably say that in the meantime, all the products are qualified, and more importantly, they are qualified at this handful of important customers. And since this is a new for us because we haven't had this gallium nitride capability really in the first place, we absolutely see that we will gain share on that basis with the further rollout of the infrastructure in this coming year.

But certainly, our focus on further driving penetration with the mobile wallet, where I think I spoke about hitting the 40% attachment rate at the end of last year and we think we are perfectly on track to get this to a 50% rate through this year. 
And secondly, we have the emerging ultra-wideband, and you've probably followed the most recent announcement of Samsung, who actually brought now another couple of phones out, which are carrying ultra-wideband. And that is now also spreading into associated ecosystems, which I think makes it even more attractive. I think Samsung spoke about digital car keys for a couple of car companies. And they also spoke about -- actually their first moves now into the IoT world, which is a product which they  call the Smart Tech Plus which is like a small finder device, which you can attach to something and you will find it with your phone. 
Now all of that is going to help with Samsung, but of course, also with the other OEMs, drive further and speedy ultra-wideband adoption in line with what we did in the investor teaching some time ago. 
So those 2 pillars are standing firm. And I'd say, certainly, some of the big OEM customers also have good run rates, John. But I would say for us, it continues to be a content growth story. Secure mobile wallets, secure ultra-wideband. And then you know we also had the EU ICC, which is coming in. 
So there is a number of very specific content drivers which make us actually quite optimistic in mobile on a continued basis beyond the unit rate."

I guess I guess I'd say a couple of things, really, Ross. You can look to really big numbers in the fourth quarter and the first quarter, just if you do some change our math on our months of supply and -- sorry, months of inventory and distribution. I'm not sure how relevant it is, really. So in theory, we could have shipped hundreds of millions of dollars or more. But then I don't know to what extent you'd be then pulling that out of Q3 and Q4. 
We're seeing strength across our businesses. Obviously, there's a lot more reporting in the automotive sector because they're having real supply issues and having to maybe close down factories in certain cases, and you talk about people not being able to work for weeks at a time which is maybe different than you see in some of the smaller customers who don't have the same mega phone. But even in those areas, they're seeing they're seeing problems. 
So I would say it's pretty general. And I would go back to one of Kurt's comments, which was 2019, the supply chain really got  emptied. Demand was very weak. We really forget about '19 in the context of COVID. And then in the first half of '20, we had the absolutely the same issue. So we're looking at pretty empty supply chains across the board. To some extent, it's exacerbated by maybe people moving into the big Taiwanese and other foundries outside of China by the fact that the people thought maybe they would not be able to buy product out of China. 
But I think trying to pass it really individual situations is absolutely very difficult. I would say, in theory, yes, we could have shipped a lot more. Effectively we're sold out for Q1. And we're just spending huge amounts of time in the moment with customers making sure that they keep their factories going, which is why Kurt made the comment that we don't think anything we're shipping in the model is going into inventory. We think it's all going into building products. And we think it's going to be quite some time, and we wouldn't speculate exactly when. So when we get to a point that, that becomes more balanced and everyone can start to breathe normally."

I couldn't agree more. There is this element which is creating a bubble eventually. But I would really highlight and I say that from very hands-on practical experience currently, everything we ship goes into production. That -- it isn't piling any inventory at any place.

We have that same surge in demand in our other markets.

Now certainly, we will continue to watch this very carefully because, again, we've seen this before. We have our controls, we know what to look after. But now is not the time to be worried about that. So we clearly see this demand continuing for a couple of quarters without building unnecessary inventory. 
The only, I wouldn't say exception, but the 1 thing specific which I believe could become a growth trend, which is then nothing wrong but something to be conscious about, is possibly the fact that the auto industry will want to have a longer supply chain, higher inventory levels than they used to have. Just learning from the current experience and trying to mitigate any future disruptions. That would be then building inventory but it wouldn't be a bubble, but it would be a very conscious and very, say, targeted building of inventory.

It's really carried by the solution capability made up by the crossover processes. I mean it's the whole processing portfolio, but specifically, the crossovers are delivering on the promise, coupled with our Wi-Fi capabilities. And you might have seen just in Q4 we launched our first and what I think is really an industry-leading 2x2 WiFi 6 solution, which is a result of the Marvell acquisition. But getting this all together into solutions is actually doing what we wanted to see. 
Now there is 1 other element with this, which I think is a driver for the growth for NXP, particularly in that segment, and that is our exposure to China. That's also, I think, the background for last year's strong performance because China left the pandemic from an industrial performance perspective behind them already in the second quarter. So if you will, China had 3 strong quarters last year, and our Industrial business has a quite big exposure to China. So we've been benefiting from this and we see this continuing into this year."

Yes, I think in summary, it is fair to say that if we just for a minute look back to last year, last year has really been a year with 2 phases: a very grim and very difficult year in the first half, and then a definitely faster-than-anticipated recovery in the second half. And given all the discussions which we've had about supply and demand, it is fair to say that we believe it's only the start of the recovery. This will continue through the calendar year 2021. And we see that our specific end market focus of NXP with a lot of strength in automotive, with a lot of very specific strength in the mobile and in industrial and IoT gives us actually a very good opportunity to benefit from this continuing recovery into this calendar year. 
The 1 segment we've certainly been less happy with is the comms infra segment as we discussed. But also there, given the new product introductions in gallium nitride, we are optimistic on the second half of the year which is a strong driver for our mix when you think about our margin targets.

Today, I will review our Q4 and our full year 2020 performance. I will provide insights on how we view the current supply-demand environment, and I will certainly discuss our guidance for quarter 1.  
Now let me begin with quarter 4. Our results were near the high end of our guidance. With the contribution from the automotive and mobile markets both meaningfully stronger than planned, and with trends in the industrial and IoT and communication infrastructure markets in line with our expectations. Taken together, NXP delivered quarter 4 revenue of $2.5 billion, an increase of 9% year-over-year and $57 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. 
Our non-GAAP operating margin in quarter 4 was a strong 30.5%. That is 60 basis points better than the year-ago period and about 80 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance. Our outperformance was thanks to good fall-through on strength, revenue growth, thanks to early benefits of our improved factory utilization and solid operating expense control. 
For the full year, revenue was $8.6 billion, a decline of 3% year-over-year. And as 2020 progressed, and the initial impacts from the pandemic earlier in the year subsided, our customers began to accelerate orders at a very robust rate, which we do anticipate will continue throughout 2021. 
Our full year non-GAAP operating margin was 25.9%, a 310 basis points decline because of lower revenue, reduced factory loadings combined with slightly reduced operating expenses. It is important to note though that throughout the year, we shifted more of our OpEx spend from SG&A towards R&D as we do continue to invest in new and differentiated products, which are definitely the lifeblood of our long-term growth ambitions. 
Now let me turn to the specific trends in our focus end markets, starting with automotive. Full year revenue was $3.83 billion, down 9% year-on-year, materially better than overall auto production and the reflection of strong new product traction and content gains in ADAS, in digital clusters, and in electrification, which we have all spoken about in the past. For quarter 4, automotive revenue was $1.2 billion, up 9% versus the year ago period, and $20 million better than our guidance. 
Now moving to industrial and IoT. Full year revenue was $1.84 billion, 15% year-on-year up, with both the wireless connectivity and our crossover processes supporting the growth. For quarter 4, industrial and IoT revenue was $511 million, 23% versus the year ago period, and with that, in line with our guidance. 
Now moving to mobile, our full year revenue in mobile was $1.25 billion, up 5% year-on-year. Now if we are reconciling this for the sale of our voice and audio business during quarter 1 last year, the underlying mobile end market growth was up a robust 19% year-on-year. And during the year, we experienced continued strong adoption of our secure mobile wallet and the early ramps of our ultra-wideband solutions, offset by the anticipated discontinuation of some parts of our semi-custom mobile analog interface business. We do estimate the full year attach rate of mobile wallets increased to about 40%, which is in line with our expectations and which is also supportive of our 50% attach rate target exiting 2021. 
For quarter 4, mobile revenue was $409 million, up 23% versus the year-ago period, and with that, $40 million better than our guidance. And last but not least, communication infrastructure and other full year revenue was $1.7 billion, down 9% year-over-year. The year-on-year decline was due to reduced sales of RF Power products into the cellular base station market relative to the positive trends which we had experienced in the first half of 2019. For quarter 4, revenue was 394 million, down 14% year-on-year and in line with our guidance. 
Now before turning to our guidance and expectations for the first quarter, I would like to offer my view on the current demand and supply environment as it pertains to NXP. When our customers began to reopen after the shutdowns in the second quarter, we did see order rates through Q3 and Q4 accelerate at a very rapid rate. This trend has continued, and it will likely be the case over several quarters to come. The increased demand has been broad-based across most of our focus end markets, most of our product portfolio and all of our geographies, as well as across our direct and our distribution fulfillment channels. 
We actually believe that the working-from-home trends because of the pandemic, which emerged in full force beginning in the first half of the year, led to an explosion in demand for high-volume consumer compute and mobile type products in the industry. And then as the auto and industrial markets began to rebound in the second half of the year, the available foundry capacity was largely sold out. As a result, we and others are experiencing significant increases in lead times, and in certain cases, increased costs from suppliers. 
Taking that all together, the setup indicates a really robust demand environment, combined with a very challenging supply situation, which we anticipate may continue for several more quarters. And we are working very diligently with both our external suppliers, our internal operations team and our customers to adequately align supply with demand. 
Against this backdrop, now let me come to the quarter 1 guidance. We are guiding quarter 1 revenue at $2.55 billion, up about 26% versus the first quarter of 2020, within the range of up 22% to up 30% year-over-year. From a sequential basis, this represents growth of about 2% at the midpoint versus the prior quarter. 
At the midpoint, we anticipate the following trends in our business. First, automotive is expected to be up in the mid-20% range versus quarter 1 2020 and up in the mid-single digits versus quarter 4 2020. Industrial and IoT is expected to be up nearly 50% year-over-year and up high single digits versus quarter 4 2020. Mobile is expected to be up 40% year-over-year and down in the mid-teens versus quarter 4 '20. And finally, communication infrastructure and other is expected to be flat versus the same period a year ago and up in the low single-digit range on a sequential basis. 
Now while we are really encouraged by the rapid rebound in demand, it is important to remember we are still challenged by the impact of the global pandemic. And we will carefully navigate the improving demand environment, focused on meeting our customers' requirements while simultaneously assuring at all times, the safety and health of all of our employees. And I am extremely proud of their adaptability, their dedication and their hard work in the face of continued adversity. 
So in summary, customer engagement levels, our design win momentum, and our strategic focus areas continue to be all very positive. And hence, we continue to be very optimistic about the future potential of NXP. 
And with that, I would like to pass the call to you, Peter, for a review of our financial performance."

Good morning to everyone on today's call. As Kurt already covered the drivers of the revenue during the fourth quarter and provided our revenue outlook for Q1, I'll move on to the financial highlights. Overall, our fourth quarter financia",1308,"Thank you, Kurt. Good morning to everyone on today's call. As Kurt already covered the drivers of the revenue during the fourth quarter and provided our revenue outlook for Q1, I'll move on to the financial highlights. Overall, our fourth quarter financial performance was very good. Revenue was near the high end of our guidance range with an improvement of both non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP operating profit. 
I'll first provide full year highlights and then move on to the fourth quarter results. Full year revenue for 2020 was $8.61 billion, down 3% year-on-year. We generated $4.4 billion in non-GAAP gross profit and reported a non-GAAP gross profit margin of 51.1%, down 240 basis points year-on-year because of the significant deceleration of revenue and the associated lower factory utilization during the year. 
Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $2.17 billion, down $8 million year-on-year. Total non-GAAP operating profit was $2.23 billion, and non-GAAP operating margin was 25.9%, down 310 basis points year-on-year. Non-GAAP interest expense was $357 million. Cash taxes for ongoing operations were $103 million, and incidental taxes were $45 million, with noncontrolling interests of 28 million. 
Stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings, was $384 million. Full-year cash flow highlights include $2.48 billion in cash flow from operations, and $388 million in net CapEx investments, resulting in $2.09 billion of non-GAAP free cash flow or a very healthy 24% of revenue. 
During 2020, we repurchased $627 million of shares and paid cash dividends of $420 million. In total, we returned $1.05 billion to our owners which was 50% of the total non-GAAP free cash flow generated during the year.
Now moving to the details of the fourth quarter, total revenue was $2.51 billion, up 9% year-on-year, at the high end of our guidance range. We generated $1.3 billion in non-GAAP gross profit and reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 52.9%, down 130 basis points year-on-year and modestly above the midpoint of guidance. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $563 million, flat year-on-year and up $13 million from Q3, in line with the midpoint of our guidance. 
From a total operating profit perspective, non-GAAP operating profit was $764 million, and the non-GAAP operating margin was 30.5%, up 60 basis points year-on-year and well above the high end of our guidance. Non-GAAP interest expense was $90 million. Cash taxes for ongoing operations were $30 million, and noncontrolling interest was $11 million. Stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings, was $89 million. 
So turning to the changes in our cash and debt. Our total debt at the end of Q4 was $7.61 billion, down $1.75 billion sequentially as we retired early the 2021 $1.35 billion 4 1/8%, and the 2022 $400 million 4 5/8% notes. We did this on September 28, which was the first day of our fourth quarter. Our ending cash position was $2.28 billion, and was down $1.29 billion sequentially, mainly due to the previously noted debt repayments offset by cash generation during the fourth quarter. 
The resulting net debt was $5.3 billion -- $5.33 billion and we exited the quarter with a trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of $2.79 billion. Our ratio of net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q4 was 1.9x and our 12-month adjusted EBITDA interest coverage was 8x. Our liquidity is excellent, and our balance sheet continues to be very strong. During the fourth quarter, we paid $105 million in cash dividends and repurchased $257 million of our shares. 
Turning to working capital metrics, days of inventory was 78 days, a decrease of 6 days sequentially, significantly below our long-term target. We continue to closely manage our distribution channel, with inventory in the channel of 1.6 months also below our long-term targets. Both metrics reflect customer orders accelerating faster than we had anticipated, and we find ourselves in a supply-constrained position. It will take a number of quarters to rebuild on-hand inventory and channel inventories to our long-term target levels. 
Days receivables were 28 days, down 2 sequentially, and days payable was 75, an increase of 20 days versus the prior quarter as we rapidly increased material orders with our suppliers. Taken together, our cash conversion cycle was 31 days, an improvement of 28 days versus the prior quarter, reflecting strong customer demand, solid receivables collections and positioning for customer deliveries in future periods. Cash flow from operations was $1.03 billion in the quarter, and net CapEx was 103 million, resulting in a non-GAAP free cash flow of $926 million. 
Turning to our expectations for the first quarter, as Kurt mentioned, we anticipate Q1 revenue to be about $2.55 billion, plus or minus about $75 million. At the midpoint, this is up 26% year-on-year and 2% sequentially. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be about 53.5%, plus or minus 30 basis points. Operating expenses are expected to be about $590 million, plus or minus about $10 million. 
Taken together, we see non-GAAP operating margin to be about 30.4% at the midpoint. We estimate non-GAAP financial expense to be about $85 million and anticipate cash tax related to ongoing operations to be about $56 million. Noncontrolling interest will be about $10 million. And for the first quarter, we suggest that for modeling purposes, you use an average share count of 284 million shares. 
Finally, I have a few closing comments I'd like to make. One, clearly, demand has come back more rapidly than we could have expected. Our current focus is to look after our customers and ensure we ship as much product to them as possible. It's unfortunate that some of our suppliers are attempting to use the current type supply environment as a short-term opportunity to raise prices, which we will clearly have to pass on. 
To be clear, though, we do not see this as an opportunity to improve our margin by sacrificing long-term relationships. Additionally, given the tightness in supply and the level of orders, we anticipate shipping for production during Q1. It's unlikely we'll be able to increase our month of supply that distributors or move our DIO target upward towards our long-term targets during the first quarter. 
Between January 4 and February 1, we bought back an additional $354 million worth of stock and plan to continue to buy back in line with our capital allocation policy of returning all excess cash to shareholders. Clearly, our operating margin reflects the significant fall-through benefit of the additional revenue. Although the current environment creates a new set of challenges, we believe we can still deliver on our margin improvement plan in 2021. 
In terms of the pandemic, our team continues to perform in a truly outstanding way. And the safety of our team members, as Kurt mentioned, continues to be our primary concern. If anyone experiences any symptoms or are in any way exposed to the virus, we ask them to self-isolate for a period. Unfortunately, in Q4, we've seen a few more people than expected in our fab operations requiring to self-isolate, and as a result of this shortage of labor, a small impact in our internal fab output. 
Although this causes a short-term issue, it's clearly best for our overall performance in both the short to medium term. We estimate this is impacting us to the tune of 80 basis points of profit in Q1 and 40 basis -- will impact us 40 basis points in Q2. While this is a short-term headwind, the safety of our employees remains our key consideration, and we believe our COVID protocols are appropriate and correct. 
Finally, I'd like to thank all my colleagues at NXP for a truly amazing 2020. You've done an incredible job in a truly unbelievable environment and set us up for a very bright future. 
So with that, I'll turn it back to the operator for your questions."

I think I said last quarter that utilization -- underutilization rather, would impact us about 150 basis points in Q4. So we'd have that level of benefit in Q1. 
As it turns out, because of these -- the need to self-isolate, instead of getting 150 basis points of improvement from Q4 into Q1, we've only got about 70 basis points. So that 52.9% to 53.5%, the 60 basis points is really made up of 3 big things, C.J. So we picked up 70 basis points from improved factory performance, 20 -- sorry, from underutilization; 20 basis points from improved factory performance above and beyond what we were expecting; and it's about 30 basis points of headwind because of our annual price reductions. So that's from Q4 to Q1. 
Then if you say, okay, well, in Q4, you did 53.5%, why aren't you running -- sorry, from 52.9% to 53.5%, why aren't you running 55%? That 150 basis points is really made up from 2 things. There's about -- in theory, it was about 50 basis points of underutilization, very roughly and about 100 basis points of mix. 
And the issue in mix, really, is one of our comm infra business. So our comm infra business in the first half is relatively weak and auto and mobile are relatively strong. And we think as we move through the year, and as kind of 5G progresses, we'd seen an improvement in our mix over time. Did I -- oh, and -- right, your other question was about pricing, right? 
So pricing is really mixed, okay? So we're seeing some suppliers trying to put up the prices to us. But we -- in the same way that we have long-term contracts with our customers, we have similar contracts with many of our suppliers. So it's a bit of a mixed bag really. 
Having said that, we are seeing price increases. And where we have them, we'll endeavor to pass those on to our customers. You made an interesting comment actually about how quickly you can do it. So I think what we'll actually see is, hopefully, we'd be able to pass them on pretty quickly. But you could always have a month or 2 when -- or I guess even a quarter when you can't really pass them on that quickly. 
So it's a disturbance rather than a fundamental issue. We would like to say that we don't see the current environment as an opportunity to structurally improve our margins. We're not a commodity business. We don't increase our prices when times are tight and reduce them when times are good but -- did I manage to cover everything there? I know there was a lot..."

So thinking about trends, thinking about aligning forecasts on a longer-term basis, is definitely a positive result out of this. So I don't think this is a negative. I think it is actually something we, as an industry, altogether are learning from, how to avoid these things from happening in the future. And the way to do this is just a much closer collaboration than we've had along the chain. And what I mean is really not only with our Tier 1 customers, but also with the OEMs directly. And that is obviously great for innovation at the same time."

Kurt, I'm curious, what's your baseline view of automotive unit growth in 2021 as you see at the start of the year? And also last year, when I look at your auto semiconductor sales which were down 9, they were like 5, 6, 7 points ahead of older units, so that was a very impressive content delta.

So let me start with what IHS is telling us for this year in units for auto, and that would be around 85 million units, which if that comes, it's like 14% year-on-year growth in units.

So let me start with what IHS is telling us for this year in units for auto, and that would be around 85 million units, which if that comes, it's like 14% year-on-year growth in units. 
This is the IHS number. We've always used it internally. I would tell you from my very, very frequent discussions over the past couple of weeks and also at the ending of last year. I think the sentiment in the auto industry is possibly even above that. So maybe more 85 to 90 million units in what the car companies thinks to achieve. But a lot of that is obviously based on the assumption of, say, the second half of the year being fully vaccinated, society coming back to more normal lives, and that actually being another push for auto production and auto sales. Again, the former number is 85 million units, which would be a 14% growth. 
But you were hinting to the other half of this discussion, which is actually content. Because clearly, the fact that we've been 7 points faster than the SAAR last year is thanks to content growth and thanks to our specific play in our high-growth areas like radar and electrification, BMS, digital clusters, which actually did not decline. 
So our growth businesses, and you know that's about 1/4 of our auto business, those parts of our auto business did not decline last year. They actually had growth even in a year where the SAAR was, I think, last year, down by something like 16%. And we see the content growth certainly going at the same rate going forward. One really strong element is the CO2 targets which translates then often in electrification, but this is not just about the, say, the electric engines. There's a lot of other applications which are coming in tune with electrification, which is overall driving the semi content in the car massively. 
So all in all, we, I would say, I think it is safe to assume the 85 million units for this year, which is a 14% growth for SAAR. And definitely, our algorithm of outgrowing the SAAR as we spoke about it before, does stand strong also in this year. 
Now 1 last element on this, which everybody tries to understand currently, is about inventory levels. I think at the moment from anything we can see, the supply chains through the auto world are empty. And I say that because I know that every single product we are shipping is immediately built into a car. And so there is just nothing going on the sideline. It all goes through into production immediately. That's why we also clearly said we are supply constrained for the first quarter. 
And as a reaction to this, I hear quite a few people in the industry speaking about the desire to actually ask for more inventory along the chain in automotive going forward. There is 1 large U.S. OEM, which actually made even a public statement about how much chip inventory they would like to see at their first-tier customers. 
So if you model this on top of the content gains and SAAR growth, which we just spoke about, then I think there is a good reason to believe there is a multiple-quarter growth pattern ahead of us."

I think we talked about our gallium nitride, both product as well as production capability, getting online at the end of last quarter. And I can actually probably say that in the meantime, all the products are qualified. And more importantly, they are qualified at this handful of important customers.

And secondly, we have the emerging ultra-wideband, and you've probably followed the most recent announcement of Samsung, who actually brought now another couple of phones out, which are carrying ultra-widebands. And that is now also spreading into associated ecosystems, which I think makes it even more attractive. I think Samsung spoke about digital car keys for a couple of car companies. 
And they also spoke about -- actually their first moves now into the IoT world, which is a product which they call the [ Smart Tech Plus ] which is like a small finder device, which you can attach to something and you will find it with your phone. Now all of that is going to help with Samsung, but of course, also with the other OEMs, drive further and speedy ultra-wideband adoption in line with what we did in the investor teaching some time ago. 
So those 2 pillars are standing firm. And I'd say, certainly, some of the big OEM customers also have good run rates, John. But I would say for us, it continues to be a content growth story.

Obviously, there's a lot more reporting in the automotive sector because they're having real supply issues and having to maybe close down factories in certain cases. And you talk about people not being able to work for weeks at a time which is maybe different than you see in some of the smaller customers who don't have the same megaphone. But even in those areas, they're seeing they're seeing problems. 
So I would say it's pretty general. And I would go back to one of Kurt's comments, which was, 2019, the supply chain really got emptied. Demand was very weak. We really forget about '19 in the context of COVID. And then in the first half of '20, we had  absolutely the same issue. So we're looking at pretty empty supply chains across the board. To some extent, it's exacerbated by maybe people moving into the big Taiwanese and other foundries outside of China by the fact that the people thought maybe they would not be able to buy product out of China. 
But I think trying to pass it to really individual situations is absolutely very difficult. I would say, in theory, yes, we could have shipped a lot more. Effectively we're sold out for Q1. And we're just spending huge amounts of time at the moment with customers, making sure that they keep their factories going, which is why Kurt made the comment that we don't think anything we're shipping in the month is going into inventory. We think it's all going into building products. And we think it's going to be quite some time, and we wouldn't speculate exactly when, to when we get to a point that, that becomes more balanced and everyone can start to breathe normally."

We are proud that we've been able to successfully integrate all of this and actually are now in a position to come out with solutions with products, which are building on the IPs from these different former deals. And from anything I've seen relative to the deals you mentioned, we don't see this as a threat to that competitive decision which we have.

Typically, when this happens, you have this behavior of overordering by some customers that stimulates capacity additions and sort of there goes the cycle. This behavior is typically what sort of paints the peak of the cycle. I've argued that I think the lean inventory through the supply chain and really, the breadth of demand is what perhaps will make the cycle extend a little bit longer. But I wonder if there's anything else that relates to the insight that you've all shared with us already suggesting that we continue to see this imbalance favoring growth as we go through the year."

There is this element which is creating a bubble eventually. But I would really highlight and I say that from very hands-on, practical experience currently, everything we ship goes into production. That -- it isn't piling any inventory at any place. And I can also again emphasize, it is broad. I mean, you read and see a lot about automotive, as Peter said, because that is very prominent when it comes to publications, but it is much broader. We have that same surge in demand in our other markets. 
So that makes me believe that at least at this point in time, this is not about inventory building. Now certainly, we will continue to watch this very carefully because, again, we've seen this before. We have our controls, we know what to look after. But now is not the time to be worried about that. So we clearly see this demand continuing for a couple of quarters without building unnecessary inventory. 
The only, I wouldn't say exception, but the one thing specific which I believe could become a growth trend, which is then nothing wrong but something to be conscious about, is possibly the fact that the auto industry will want to have a longer supply chain, higher inventory levels than they used to have, just learning from the current experience and trying to mitigate any future disruptions. That would be then building inventory but it wouldn't be a bubble, but it would be a very conscious and very, say, targeted building of inventory. But again, from anything, we can see with our product, this is -- we are far from this at this point in time, but it could become something which happens maybe later in the year."

It's really carried by the solution capability made up by the crossover processes. I mean, it's the whole processing portfolio, but specifically, the crossovers are delivering on the promise, coupled with our WiFi capabilities. And you might have seen just in Q4, we launched our first and what I think is really an industry-leading 2x2 WiFi 6 solution, which is a result of the Marvell acquisition. But getting this all together into solutions is actually doing what we wanted to see. 
Now there is 1 other element with this, which I think is a driver for the growth for NXP, particularly in that segment, and that is our exposure to China. That's also, I think, the background for last year's strong performance, because China left the pandemic from an industrial performance perspective behind them already in the second quarter. So if you will, China had 3 strong quarters last year, and our industrial business has a quite big exposure to China. So we've been benefiting from this and we see this continuing into this year."

And given all the discussions which we've had about supply and demand, it is fair to say that we believe it's only the start of the recovery. This will continue through the calendar year 2021. And we see that our specific end market focus of NXP with a lot of strength in automotive, with a lot of very specific strength in the mobile and in industrial and IoT, gives us actually a very good opportunity to benefit from this continuing recovery into this calendar year. 
The 1 segment we've certainly been less happy with is the comms infra segment as we discussed. But also there, given the new product introductions in gallium nitride, we are optimistic on the second half of the year which is a strong driver for our mix when you think about our margin targets.

Thanks very, very much, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. We really appreciate you joining our call today. Today, I will review our quarter 1 results and discuss our guidance for Q2. Furthermore, I will provide an updated perspective on how we view",1611,"Yes. Thanks very, very much, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. We really appreciate you joining our call today. 
Today, I will review our quarter 1 results and discuss our guidance for Q2. Furthermore, I will provide an updated perspective on how we view the current supply-demand environment, including the recovery of our 2 Austin-based facilities, which were hit by the severe winter storm in February. And additionally, I will discuss our efforts for sustainability. 
Now let me get started with quarter 1. Our results were better than the midpoint of our guidance with the contribution from the industrial and the communication infrastructure end markets, both stronger than planned. At the same time, trends in the mobile and auto markets were generally in line with our expectations, with automotive being just slightly impacted by the severe winter storms in Texas. Taken together, NXP delivered quarter 1 revenue of $2.57 billion, an increase of 27% year-over-year and $17 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. Non-GAAP operating margin in Q1 was a strong 30.9%, 600 basis points better than the year-ago period, and about 50 basis points above the midpoint of guidance, driven both by improved mix and additional revenue. 
Now let me turn to the specific trends in our focus end markets. In automotive, quarter 1 revenue was $1.23 billion, up 24% versus the year-ago period and about $13 million below our guidance. In industrial IoT, our quarter 1 revenue was $571 million, up 52% versus the year-ago period, and about $13 million better than our guidance. In mobile, quarter 1 revenue was $346 million, up 40% versus the year-ago period and in line with our guidance. Reconciling for the sale of the voice and audio business, which closed during quarter 1 2020, the underlying mobile end market growth was actually up a robust 46% year-over-year. And lastly, in communication infrastructure and other, quarter 1 revenue was $421 million, up 4% year-on-year and about $17 million better than our guidance. 
Now let me move to our outlook. We are guiding quarter 2 revenue at $2.57 billion, up about 40% versus the second quarter of 2020 within a range of up 38% to up 45% year-over-year. And from a sequential perspective, this is about flat at the midpoint versus the prior quarter. 
At the midpoint, we anticipate the following trends in our business. Automotive is expected to be up in the upper 80% range versus quarter 2 2020 and up in the low single digits versus quarter 1 '21. Industrial and IoT is expected to be up in the low 30% range year-over-year and flat versus quarter 1 '21. Mobile is expected to be up in the mid-30% range and flat versus quarter 1 2021. And finally, communication infrastructure and other is expected to be down in the low teens percent range versus the same period a year ago and down in the mid-single-digit range on a sequential basis. 
Now at this point, let me turn to an update on the current supply-demand environment. As I had shared with you on our last earnings call, as many of our customers started to resume full production during Q3 of 2020, we were faced with the challenge to balance a very accelerated rate of customer orders versus a very tight, if not sold out wafer supply situation. While our foundry partners have attempted to address our needs, it really has not been enough, and we were supply constrained in quarter 1. This supply trend will continue through quarter 2. And our current expectation is we will face a tight supply environment for at least the remainder of 2021. We would also note that in the medium term, we have seen a significant increase in demand for our products, which is very consistent with our anticipated content gains and our design wins. In that very context, it is really insightful to compare to the pre-pandemic levels of 2019. 
When we look at total current revenue levels compared to the prepandemic levels in 2019, we actually plan to ship nearly 20% more in the first half of 2021 versus the first half of 2019. And more specifically, in automotive, we plan to ship at least 20% more in the first half of 2021 versus the first half of 2019. And this is while IHS suggests a drop of 10% in car production over the very same period. And now going forward, we see our overall revenue in the second half of 2021 being stronger than the first half of this year. And against these trends, we continue to have low channel and low on-hand inventory, which we do not anticipate rebuilding this year. Our customers are responding by placing long-dated, noncancelable and nonreturnable order requests. And we are making long-term strategic supply commitments to our partners in order to assure future supply. 
Against this challenging supply environment, we also had the very unfortunate and unexpected winter storms in Austin. And I am today pleased to share that our 2 wafer facilities in Austin are now fully back on line. And I would like to commend our manufacturing, our operations and our facilities teams for their superb effort and dedication to getting these 2 facilities back online in record time. Truly a job very well done. 
Notwithstanding the challenging supply environment or the natural disasters we faced, our results and guidance clearly validate the underlying long-term growth and profitability of our business. We acknowledge it has been a long process to deliver on our committed gross margin target. The next objective will be to demonstrate full year performance at the 55% gross margin target. 
And furthermore, on a positive note of recognition, NXP was added to the S&P 500 Index, which is a strong validation of a lot of hard work the entire NXP team has undertaken to drive growth, improve profitability and enhance free cash flow. 
Now before I pass the call over to Peter, I would like to take a minute and discuss our sustainability efforts, an area to which NXP has a long demonstrated history of commitment. At a more personal level, I do believe sustainability is a very important journey we all need to embrace and undertake. And it's not just the finite destination. At NXP, we are dedicated to our long-term sustainability goals, which our employees, our customers, our suppliers and investors all believe are of the utmost importance. All our stakeholders are paying attention to the products we develop to how our company complements the communities we operate within and to how we attempt to lessen the impact our company has on our environment. And hence, we just recently published our annual Corporate Sustainability Report in our annual proxy statement, both of which set forth the progress we have achieved towards previously stated goals and lay out our vision for the future. 
In support of our continuous commitment to improve our environmental and social responsibility and our corporate governance metrics, there are a few areas I would like to highlight, starting with social responsibility. We have made clear, our commitments, to workplace diversity, equality and inclusion. In order to ensure our working environment provides equal access and opportunity, we appointed a head of diversity, equality and inclusion, reporting directly to me and to our Executive Vice President of Human Resources. We are dedicated to creating an inclusive and diverse work environment where NXP appropriately mirrors to society and communities in which we operate. We have an ongoing commitment to improve and refine our corporate governance. In 2020, we have enhanced our human capital management disclosures, which expanded and detailed workforce demographics. We are committed to improving gender diversity throughout the organization, but especially within the company's leadership teams. 
Now turning to environmental impact. In 2020, we met our 10-year goal of reducing our carbon footprint by 30%. We have achieved a 47% water recycling rate, and we purchased 27% of our electricity from renewable sources, led by our factory in [ Niagen ], which is running 100% on renewable energy. 
Finally, and certainly not least, our employees. We definitely believe our employees are the lifeblood of innovation and the spirit at NXP. We are dedicated to building a highly engaged workforce who will continuously push the boundaries of innovation. We view a highly engaged workforce as the very best early indicator of potential success for our company in the future. We measure this annually through a global employee survey called the winning culture survey. That survey looks at multiple early indicators of long-term employee engagement. It includes factors as employee views on company strategy, innovation, execution and leadership as well as culture, collaboration and a supportive work environment. And I'm proud to say that in 2020, we had a 90-plus percent global participation rate. 
Now in summary, we are very, very encouraged by the rapid rebound in demand across our end markets. Based on our customer conversations and order rates, it appears NXP is in the early stages of a longer-term company-specific growth cycle. Our employees are highly engaged to drive our success, we have a robust pipeline of new and innovative products and customer response engagement, design win momentum all underpin our optimism about the future potential of NXP. I'm extremely proud of all our employees, but today, I would like to especially comment our manufacturing, our operations and customer-facing teams for their relentless focus and energy while assuring our customer success. Their dedication and hard work in the face of a very challenging supply environment truly make a big difference. 
And now, I would like to pass the call to Peter for a review of our financial performance. Peter?"

As Kurt has already covered the drivers of the revenue during the first quarter and provided our revenue outlook for the second quarter, I'll move on to the financial highlights. Overall,",1046,"Thank you, Kurt, and good morning to everyone on today's call. 
As Kurt has already covered the drivers of the revenue during the first quarter and provided our revenue outlook for the second quarter, I'll move on to the financial highlights. 
Overall, our first quarter financial performance was very good. Revenue was above the midpoint of our guidance range and we drove an improvement of both non-GAAP profit and non-GAAP operating profit. 
Moving to the details of the first quarter. Total revenue was $2.57 billion, up 27% year-on-year and above the midpoint of our guidance range. We generated $1.39 billion in non-GAAP gross profit and reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 54.2%, up 240 basis points year-on-year and above the high end of our guidance. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $600 million, up $55 million year-on-year and up $37 million from the fourth quarter. This was $10 million above the midpoint of our guidance due to increased variable compensation, driven by an improved first half performance. From a total operating profit perspective, non-GAAP operating profit was $792 million, and non-GAAP operating margin was 30.9%, up 600 basis points year-on-year and was at the high end of our guidance. Non-GAAP interest expense was $87 million; cash taxes for ongoing operations were $40 million; and noncontrolling interest was $11 million. Taken together, $13 million better than our guidance. 
Stock-based comp, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings, was $91 million. 
Now I'd like to -- now I'd like to turn to the changes in our cash and debt. Our total debt at the end of the fourth quarter was $7.61 billion, essentially flat versus the fourth quarter. Our ending cash position was $1.84 billion, down $433 million sequentially, mainly due to share repurchases, offset by cash generation during the first quarter. The resulting net debt was $5.77 billion, and we exited the quarter with a trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of $3.09 billion. Our ratio of net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was at the end -- was at the end of quarter 1 was 1.9x. And our 12-month adjusted EBITDA interest coverage was 8.6x. Our liquidity is excellent, and our balance sheet continues to be very strong. During the first quarter, we paid $105 million in cash dividends and repurchased $905 million of our shares for a total of $1 billion of capital return to our owners during the quarter. 
Turning to working capital metrics. Days of inventory was 81 days, an increase of 3 days sequentially and continues to be significantly below our long-term target of 95 days. We continue to closely manage our distribution channel with inventory in the channel at 1.6 months, flat sequentially and below our long-term target. Both metrics reflect the continuation of strong customer order rates and we continue to be in a supply-constrained position. It will take several quarters before we are able to rebuild on-hand and channel inventories to our long-term target levels. Days receivable were 30 days, up 2 days sequentially and days payable was 79 days, an increase of 4 days versus the prior quarter as we continue to increase material orders to our suppliers. Taken together, our cash conversion cycle was 32 days, up 1 day versus the prior quarter, reflecting strong customer demand, solid receivables collections and positioning for customer deliveries in future periods. 
Cash flow from operations was $732 million and net CapEx was $150 million, resulting in non-GAAP free cash flow of $582 million. 
Turning to our expectations for the second quarter. As Kurt mentioned, we anticipate Q2 revenue to be about $2.57 billion, plus or minus about $70 million. At the midpoint, this is up 41% year-on-year and flat sequentially. We expect non-GAAP gross profit to be about 55.5%, plus or minus 30 basis points. Operating expenses are expected to be about $623 million, plus or minus about $10 million. And taken together, we see non-GAAP operating margin to be about 31.3% to the midpoint. We estimate non-GAAP financial expense to be about $87 million and anticipate cash tax related to ongoing operations to be about $55 million. Noncontrolling interest will be about $9 million And for the second quarter, we suggest that for modeling purposes, you use an average share count of 283 million shares. 
Finally, I have a few closing comments I'd like to make. Firstly, demand trends continue be strong across our target and markets and customer interest in our newest products continues to be robust. We are diligently working with our customers and our suppliers to address order requests in a timely manner. 
Our second quarter guidance reflects the clear potential of our business model, both in terms of revenue growth as well as the significant fall-through, which will enable us to drive our non-GAAP gross margin target to the 55% level. 
With the new United States administration in place, the potential increase the cost -- sorry, thirdly, with the new U.S. administration in place, the potential increase for corporate income taxes is a large topic of interest. Unfortunately, at this point in time, there are too many variables in play, and it just makes it impossible for any company to forecast. Therefore, it seems pointless to speculate until we can get more clarity. On a more positive note, we do expect our cash taxes to be slightly lower than the originally envisaged for 2021. So 2021 will likely be 9% versus the previously indicated 10%. 
Fourthly, as we've said in the past, our capital return policy is to return all excess free cash flow to our owners. During the first quarter, the Board approved a $2 billion buyback authorization as well as a 50% increase in our quarterly cash dividend. During the quarter, we returned $1 billion to shareholders and we will continue to execute our stated capital return policy. 
Fifthly, as Kurt mentioned, we believe the demand environment is strong. And notwithstanding the supply constraints, we believe the second half of 2021 will be greater than the first half of the year. 
Sixth, and finally, I'd like to thank all my colleagues at NXP for the dedication and the incredible job executing in a truly unbelievable environment. 
So with that, I'd like to turn it back to the operator for any questions you might have."

So we do see us just being at the beginning of a longer-term growth cycle. And I think, in that respect, I also tried to clarify that we do see the second half of the year growing again over the first half of this year. 
What has changed over the last 3 months is that the demand environment has, not only continued to be strong, but I would say we started to understand better and better some of the sustainable drivers of the demand environment. Now with us being 50% exposed to the automotive end market, this is clearly one place where we do understand now how content increases are contributing significantly to this very, very robust demand environment where we absolutely see no reason why that should ease off or should go away. So what I tried to say here is that our understanding of the demand environment has become better and deeper. And with that, we better believe in it. Also, totally ruling out double ordering and any of these possible fears of piling inventories at any place. So in our key segments, and I can say that very explicitly for automotive, for industrial, but also for mobile, we do know and we do see that what we ship out is immediately being built into product and no inventory is being built in any place."

Obviously, reaching 55-plus percent is a great thing, but the next question is always what have you done for me lately?

We were trying to use that kind of rule of thumb to explain what might happen as we go to full utilization. The good news now is we always said that around about 2.4, we could run 55%. So we're a little bit above that 2.5 at 55.5%. We're pretty much now internally kind of at the high end of our utilization. So I feel pretty good about the gross margin numbers where we are. But you'll see in our CapEx number, and for the full year, we'll probably do about 7% CapEx this year. We need to start adding -- or not we need, we are adding capacity, particularly in the back ends to cope with the additional revenue we're seeing. And also, over the last year or 2, we've seen the amount of product we buy externally move up from the kind of low 50s to to the high 50s percent. 
So I think from a gross margin perspective, I'd say, clearly, the challenge, at the moment, is to demonstrate that we can consistently run at 55%, which we feel very, very comfortable about. And then, over the next few years, the things that will move us up to 57% and not so much revenue. They're more about the new product introductions and improving the cost performance of our products."

So we're not only able to run, obviously, not Austin, but our other fabs full out. But also, we're getting really great utilization now in our back ends. So there's always a few small things moving in different directions. But I think Q1, it was about utilization that helped us beat -- sorry, Q1 was about mix, which helped us beat the guidance. But Q1 to Q2 is really about utilization and that's -- now that we've been able to optimize, is maybe the wrong word, but certainly utilize things a lot better, that's what gives me confidence on our gross margin going forward, really."

I guess, if I narrowed it down to your automotive business, historically, we've had a typical delta of content above SAAR. And it sounds like you're confident that, that delta is actually expanding. So I guess, really, what's changed there? You have pretty long design cycles in that sort of business. And so, it's a little surprising to me that you would have something that would arise that -- in the short term that would increase your ability to outgrow SAAR as rapidly as you appear to do right now.

But obviously, it's been all snowed under by the shutdowns, especially in the first half in the factories. But if you think about content increases, and that's why I made the comparison to 2019, which was more of a normal year, if you will then actually, over that period of time, it doesn't look that crazy at all. So that's one statement. But there is 2 more -- so it's not all of a sudden, but it's really been gradually building already over the period of the last 4 to 6 quarters, but very much disrupted by the by COVID. 
Now there is 2 more things which are really important here. The one is, yes, I do believe that especially the electric vehicle production rates are increasing faster than anticipated, which I believe makes it a content richer story than probably the initial forecast would have suggested. So the penetration of electric drivetrains is going faster, especially now, this year, than it was forecasted. 
Thirdly, and I think actually most importantly, we are now bearing fruit from all of the design wins in the focus areas we've been working on so hard over the past years. So what I'm saying is Ross, that some of this is clearly company specific. If I look at our growth rates in our focused businesses like radar, ADAS, battery management, the digital clusters, then it becomes very obvious that those are really pulling ahead the growth. So there is an underlying stronger momentum on content gains but I think a good part of this is also company-specific, meaning share gains for NXP."

And there's certainly no impact of anything even remotely like that in Q1 or Q2. 
In terms of the second half, as I said before to Ross, gross margin from here is not really driven by additional revenue. Yes, could there be some small impacts here? Sure. I think I'd say 2 things. One is I have a strong confidence that the level of -- the level of gross margin we are at the moment. So I think that's a good thing. And I think as we go forward, our focus has to be on how we bring out our new products and new versions of our existing products to improve our profitability.

So I was hoping you could talk about what they can do differently that helps to extend your demand cycle and visibility? 
And then outside of autos, when I look at your deficit on the distribution side, right, that's still close to, I think, 0.8 months, right? So usually 2.4 months and it's 1.6 months right now.

Let me answer to both elements, Vivek. Let me take the latter one, the [indiscernible] one first. So yes, we indeed stayed at the record low 1.6 months in the first quarter just like we did in Q4. And yes, I mean, if you woul",536,"Yes, that's a great question. Let me answer to both elements, Vivek. Let me take the latter one, the [indiscernible] one first. So yes, we indeed stayed at the record low 1.6 months in the first quarter just like we did in Q4. And yes, I mean, if you would just do some chainsaw math, this -- just bringing that back to a more normal level of 2.4 months, which we've historically had, is probably like $400 million. But no, I don't anticipate this -- that we reached that level anytime this year. I just think the sell-through is so strong that we don't get it up from a supply perspective back to that level. And that also gives you an indication for the very strong pull here, which is really a -- which is sell-through. I mean, if we ship more into distribution now, inventory wouldn't go up, but it would be actually selling through right away. 
On the automotive side, yes, that's -- I think this is indeed a significant discussion but also exploration, which we are having across the industry. First of all, I'd say most of our products, if not all in automotive, are noncommodity product. So it is indeed a matter of fact that demand, it just doesn't go away. I mean, if anything, then it's shifted because possibly a car here or there cannot be built. And with that, it moves then into the next quarter or eventually into next year, as you say. At the same time, we are working very, very diligently, both with our customers, which is the Tier 1s, but also directly with the car companies on very prudently understanding the future demand patterns. I think one of the biggest learnings out of this current situation is to build much more transparency about the content increases, which are often application and module-specific, and how they map out over not just the next 2 quarters, which is far too short for us, knowing that we have a manufacturing cycle time of 1 to 2 quarters, but actually more over the next 8 to 16 quarters in order to understand how that's going to map out. So that work is underway, and I can certainly say we do this with all of the top 10 car OEMs in the world. 
At the same time, we also work, of course, very hard with our suppliers, with our mainly wafer suppliers, but also back-end extensions, as Peter has mentioned, in order to quickly ramp up our supply capability at the same time. And I mean, part of this is the reason why I said earlier that already, in the second half of this year, we will ship at higher revenue levels than we are doing in the first half. So some of that demand obviously, it doesn't have to move into next year, but we are satisfying it already in the second half of this year. But yes, it's a long term -- it's really a long-term story. A lot of learning out of this situation. But at the bottom of it, and I think that's most important, a more and more diligent understanding of a very robust demand environment."

If you look at the guidance in the Q1 results, you will find it's at least 20% growth over the first half of '19. But if you think about the content, be sure to include that this is 2 years of content increase. I mean, last year, clearly, the car production was very much down but that doesn't mean that the content was coming to a stop because the content was driven by models which were to be introduced anyway, maybe at lower build rates. So if you compare the '19 to '21, it is 2 years stack of up from a content increase perspective. And I'd say, a 10% content increase per year is maybe realistic before price adjustments and that gives you already a 20% -- a 20% difference over those 2 years."

So let me speak about -- let me take the revenue side first, John. So first of all, I really have to say clearly, that was an extremely unfortunate and unexpected event, both for NXP, of course, in the first place, but in consequence also for our customers because the supply interruption as a consequence of this, in that current environment is clearly not something anybody would have wished to have. 
Now to frame it, all of this did happen on February 15, so mid of February. I think we released our press release on March 11, that we had resumed initial operations. And I can tell you that about 8 to 9 weeks after the fact or after Feb. 15, we have been fully up and running in both facilities again. So by now, both factories are 100% running again at the pre-storm -- pre-winter storm levels, which is great moves and the great achievements in a very, very challenging and difficult situation. 
Yes, we had talked about $100 million impact on the revenues in Q2. I would still say, John, we -- this is the impact which we have on Q2. Now you see that we guided sequentially flat. So obviously, we found other ways and means in other areas, with other products, to make up for that loss from the factory shutdown. Furthermore, we had a tiny little bit of impact already at the very end of the first quarter in automotive. I said this earlier, that a little bit, it's really more like maybe in the $10 million range was already impacting the very end of Q1 from a shipment perspective in automotive. I would further say that we are absolutely confident that the $100 million will be made up in the second half of the year. So again, why we made it up in the second -- why we will make it up in the second quarter with other products, we will make up those $100 million which we lost in the first phase in the second half of the year because the factories are running again and we'll be shipping full out. 
Now Peter, maybe you pick up the part of the question, which was related to the cost impact."

We have insurance to essentially cover everything. So the only real impact to our cost was the deductible, which is millions of dollars rather than tens of millions of dollars. So from a cost perspective, it hasn't really have any measurable impact."

But I guess to that point, when I look at sort of your long-term growth rate target that you have out there of 5% to 7%, that '19 to '21 compare would sort of argue a 12% growth rate trend line, at least over that 2-year period.

We spoke a lot about ultra-wideband kicking in earlier. Things seem to look robust. But let's also not forget, John, that if you think about '18, '19, '20, all 3 years were really not great years from a market perspective. So it's always a bit tempting to take just 2 years, which looked in very good. So we will have to look at this from a more longer-term perspective again. 
But clearly, I do agree with you what matters for NXP should be increasingly the company-specific drivers from those focus areas where our really strong portfolio, which we've been building over years with organically and inorganically, which is now playing out very nicely."

That is just the direct impact from their dependence on these Austin factories. So that's a temporary thing, which we'll leave behind us after Q2. 
Talking about the auto OEMs, I really can't answer that question, Blayne, because we still don't have that long-term transparency I talked about earlier on the demand side. I can absolutely tell you that the supply is increasing. It does increase already in the second quarter, but it also increases further in the third and fourth quarter. But it's always a function of what does the demand do at the same time. So I would carefully say, I don't think it is completely easing off this year.

Thanks very, very much, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. We really appreciate you joining our call today.  Today, I will review our quarter 1 results and discuss our guidance for Q2.

Today, I will review our quarter 1 results and discuss our guidance for Q2. Furthermore, I will provide an updated perspective on how we view the current supply/demand environment, including the recovery of our 2 Austin-based facilities which were hit by the severe winter storm in February. And additionally, I will discuss our efforts for sustainability.  
Now let me get started with quarter 1. Our results were better than the midpoint of our guidance with the contribution from the industrial and the communication infrastructure end markets both stronger than planned. At the same time, trends in the mobile and auto markets were generally in line with our expectations, with automotive being just slightly impacted by the severe winter storms in Texas. 
Taken together, NXP delivered quarter 1 revenue of $2.57 billion, an increase of 27% year-over-year and $17 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. Non-GAAP operating margin in Q1 was a strong 30.9%, 600 basis points better than the year-ago period and about 50 basis points above the midpoint of guidance, driven both by improved mix and additional revenue.  
Now let me turn to the specific trends in our focus end markets. In automotive, quarter 1 revenue was $1.23 billion, up 24% versus the year-ago period and about $13 million below our guidance. In industrial and IoT, our quarter 1 revenue was $571 million, up 52% versus the year-ago period and about $13 million better than our guidance. In mobile, quarter 1 revenue was $346 million, up 40% versus the year-ago period and in line with our guidance. Reconciling for the sale of the voice and audio business, which closed during quarter 1 2020, the underlying mobile end market growth was actually up a robust 46% year-over-year. And lastly, in communication infrastructure and other, quarter 1 revenue was $421 million, up 4% year-on-year and about $17 million better than our guidance.  
Now let me move to our outlook. We are guiding quarter 2 revenue at $2.57 billion, up about 40% versus the second quarter of 2020 within a range of up 38% to up 45% year-over-year. And from a sequential perspective, this is about flat at the midpoint versus the prior quarter. 
At the midpoint, we anticipate the following trends in our business. Automotive is expected to be up in the upper 80% range versus quarter 2, 2020, and up in the low single digits versus quarter 1, '21. Industrial and IoT is expected to be up in the low 30% range year-over-year and flat versus quarter 1, '21. Mobile is expected to be up in the mid-30% range and flat versus quarter 1, 2021. And finally, communication infrastructure and other is expected to be down in the low teens percent range versus the same period a year ago and down in the mid-single-digit range on a sequential basis. 
Now at this point, let me turn to an update on the current supply/demand environment. As I had shared with you on our last earnings call, as many of our customers started to resume full production during Q3 of 2020, we were faced with the challenge to balance a very accelerated rate of customer orders versus a very tight, if not sold out, wafer supply situation. 
While our foundry partners have attempted to address our needs, it really has not been enough, and we were supply constrained in quarter 1. This supply trend will continue through quarter 2, and our current expectation is we will face a tight supply environment for at least the remainder of 2021. We would also note that in the medium term, we have seen a significant increase in demand for our products, which is very consistent with our anticipated content gains and our design wins. 
In that very context, it is really insightful to compare to the pre-pandemic levels of 2019. When we look at total current revenue levels compared to the prepandemic levels in 2019, we actually plan to ship nearly 20% more in the first half of 2021 versus the first half of 2019. And more specifically, in automotive, we plan to ship at least 20% more in the first half of 2021 versus the first half of 2019. And this is while IHS suggests a drop of 10% in car production over the very same period. 
And now going forward, we see our overall revenue in the second half of 2021 being stronger than the first half of this year. And against these trends, we continue to have low channel and low on-hand inventory, which we do not anticipate rebuilding this year. Our customers are responding by placing long-dated, noncancelable and nonreturnable order requests and we are making long-term strategic supply commitments to our partners in order to assure future supply. 
Against this challenging supply environment, we also had the very unfortunate and unexpected winter storms in Austin. And I am today pleased to share that our 2 wafer facilities in Austin are now fully back on line. And I would like to commend our manufacturing, our operations and our facilities teams for their superb effort and dedication to getting these 2 facilities back online in record time. Truly a job very well done. 
Notwithstanding the challenging supply environment or the natural disasters we faced, our results and guidance clearly validate the underlying long-term growth and profitability of our business. We acknowledge it has been a long process to deliver on our committed gross margin target. The next objective will be to demonstrate full year performance at the 55% gross margin target. 
And furthermore, on a positive note of recognition, NXP was added to the S&P 500 Index, which is a strong validation of a lot of hard work the entire NXP team has undertaken to drive growth, improve profitability and enhance free cash flow. 
Now before I pass the call over to Peter, I would like to take a minute and discuss our sustainability efforts, an area to which NXP has a long-demonstrated history of commitment. At a more personal level, I do believe sustainability is a very important journey we all need to embrace and undertake, and it's not just the finite destination. 
At NXP, we are dedicated to our long-term sustainability goals, which our employees, our customers, our suppliers and investors all believe are of the utmost importance. All our stakeholders are paying attention to the products we develop, to how our company complements the communities we operate within and to how we attempt to lessen the impact our company has on our environment. 
And hence, we just recently published our Annual Corporate Sustainability Report in our annual proxy statement, both of which set forth the progress we have achieved towards previously stated goals and lay out our vision for the future. In support of our continuous commitment to improve our environmental and social responsibility and our corporate governance metrics, there are a few areas I would like to highlight, starting with social responsibility. 
We have made clear our commitments to workplace diversity, equality and inclusion. In order to ensure our working environment provides equal access and opportunity, we appointed a head of diversity, equality and inclusion, reporting directly to me and to our Executive Vice President of Human Resources. We are dedicated to creating an inclusive and diverse work environment where NXP appropriately mirrors the society and communities in which we operate. 
We have an ongoing commitment to improve and refine our corporate governance. In 2020, we have enhanced our human capital management disclosures, which expanded and detailed workforce demographics. We are committed to improving gender diversity throughout the organization, but especially within the company's leadership teams. 
Now turning to environmental impact. In 2020, we met our 10-year goal of reducing our carbon footprint by 30%. We have achieved a 47% water recycling rate, and we purchased 27% of our electricity from renewable sources, led by our factory in Nijmegen, which is running 100% on renewable energy. 
Finally, and certainly not least, our employees. We definitely believe our employees are the lifeblood of innovation and the spirit at NXP. We are dedicated to building a highly engaged workforce who will continuously push the boundaries of innovation. We view a highly engaged workforce as the very best early indicator of potential success for our company in the future. We measure this annually through a global employee survey called the Winning Culture Survey. That survey looks at multiple early indicators of long-term employee engagement. It includes factors as employee views on company strategy, innovation, execution and leadership; as well as culture, collaboration and a supportive work environment. And I'm proud to say that in 2020, we had a 90-plus percent global participation rate. 
Now in summary, we are very, very encouraged by the rapid rebound in demand across our end markets. Based on our customer conversations and order rates, it appears NXP is in the early stages of a longer-term company-specific growth cycle. Our employees are highly engaged to drive our success, we have a robust pipeline of new and innovative products and customer response engagement, design win momentum, all underpin our optimism about the future potential of NXP. 
I'm extremely proud of all our employees, but today, I would like to especially commend our manufacturing, our operations and customer-facing teams for their relentless focus and energy while assuring our customer success. Their dedication and hard work in the face of a very challenging supply environment truly make a big difference. 
And now I would like to pass the call to Peter for a review of our financial performance. Peter?"

As Kurt has already covered the drivers of the revenue during the first quarter and provided our revenue outlook for the second quarter, I'll move on to the financial highlights. Overall, ou",1033,"Thank you, Kurt, and good morning to everyone on today's call. As Kurt has already covered the drivers of the revenue during the first quarter and provided our revenue outlook for the second quarter, I'll move on to the financial highlights. 
Overall, our first quarter financial performance was very good. Revenue was above the midpoint of our guidance range and we drove an improvement of both non-GAAP profit and non-GAAP operating profit. 
Moving to the details of the first quarter. Total revenue was $2.57 billion, up 27% year-on-year and above the midpoint of our guidance range. We generated $1.39 billion in non-GAAP gross profit and reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 54.2%, up 240 basis points year-on-year and above the high end of our guidance. 
Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $600 million, up $55 million year-on-year and up $37 million from the fourth quarter. This was $10 million above the midpoint of our guidance due to increased variable compensation driven by an improved first half performance. 
From a total operating profit perspective, non-GAAP operating profit was $792 million, and non-GAAP operating margin was 30.9%, up 600 basis points year-on-year and was at the high end of our guidance. 
Non-GAAP interest expense was $87 million, cash taxes for ongoing operations were $40 million and noncontrolling interest was $11 million. Taken together, $30 million better than our guidance. Stock-based comp, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings, was $91 million. 
Now I'd like to the changes in our cash and debt. Our total debt at the end of the fourth quarter was $7.61 billion, essentially flat versus the fourth quarter. Our ending cash position was $1.84 billion, down $433 million sequentially, mainly due to share repurchases, offset by cash generation during the first quarter. The resulting net debt was $5.77 billion, and we exited the quarter with a trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of $3.09 billion. Our ratio of net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was, at the end of quarter 1, was 1.9x, and our 12-month adjusted EBITDA interest coverage was 8.6x. Our liquidity is excellent, and our balance sheet continues to be very strong. 
During the first quarter, we paid $105 million in cash dividends and repurchased $905 million of our shares for a total of $1 billion of capital returned to our owners during the quarter. 
Turning to working capital metrics. Days of inventory was 81 days, an increase of 3 days sequentially, and continues to be significantly below our long-term target of 95 days. We continue to closely manage our distribution channel with inventory in the channel at 1.6 months, flat sequentially and below our long-term target. Both metrics reflect the continuation of strong customer order rates and we continue to be in a supply-constrained position. It will take several quarters before we are able to rebuild on-hand and channel inventories to our long-term target levels. 
Days receivable were 30 days, up 2 days sequentially; and days payable was 79 days, an increase of 4 days versus the prior quarter as we continue to increase material orders to our suppliers. Taken together, our cash conversion cycle was 32 days, up 1 day versus the prior quarter, reflecting strong customer demand, solid receivables collections and positioning for customer deliveries in future periods. 
Cash flow from operations was $732 million and net CapEx was $150 million, resulting in non-GAAP free cash flow of $582 million. 
Turning to our expectations for the second quarter. As Kurt mentioned, we anticipate Q2 revenue to be about $2.57 billion, plus or minus about $70 million. At the midpoint, this is up 41% year-on-year and flat sequentially. We expect non-GAAP gross profit to be about 55.5%, plus or minus 30 basis points. Operating expenses are expected to be about $623 million, plus or minus about $10 million. And taken together, we see non-GAAP operating margin to be about 31.3% to the midpoint. We estimate non-GAAP financial expense to be about $87 million and anticipate cash tax related to ongoing operations to be about $55 million. Noncontrolling interest will be about $9 million. And for the second quarter, we suggest that for modeling purposes, you use an average share count of 283 million shares. 
Finally, I have a few closing comments I'd like to make. Firstly, demand trends continue be strong across our target end markets, and customer interest in our newest products continues to be robust. We are diligently working with our customers and our suppliers to address order requests in a timely manner. Our second quarter guidance reflects the clear potential of our business model, both in terms of revenue growth as well as the significant fall-through which will enable us to drive our non-GAAP gross margin target to the 55% level. 
With the new United States administration in place, the potential increase for -- sorry. Thirdly, with the new U.S. administration in place, the potential increase for corporate income taxes is a large topic of interest. Unfortunately, at this point in time, there are too many variables in play, and it just makes it impossible for any company to forecast. Therefore, it seems pointless to speculate until we can get more clarity. On a more positive note, we do expect our cash taxes to be slightly lower than the originally envisaged for 2021. So 2021 will likely be 9% versus the previously indicated 10%. 
Fourthly, as we've said in the past, our capital return policy is to return all excess free cash flow to our owners. During the first quarter, the Board approved a $2 billion buyback authorization as well as a 50% increase in our quarterly cash dividend. During the quarter, we returned $1 billion to shareholders, and we will continue to execute our stated capital return policy.  
Fifthly, as Kurt mentioned, we believe the demand environment is strong. And notwithstanding the supply constraints, we believe the second half of 2021 will be greater than the first half of the year. 
Sixth and finally, I'd like to thank all my colleagues at NXP for their dedication and the incredible job executing in a truly unbelievable environment. 
So with that, I'd like to turn it back to the operator for any questions you might have."

So we do see us just being at the beginning of a longer-term growth cycle. And I think, in that respect, I also tried to clarify that we do see the second half of the year growing again over the first half of this year. 
What has changed over the last 3 months is that the demand environment has, not only continued to be strong, but I would say we started to understand better and better some of the sustainable drivers of the demand environment. Now with us being 50% exposed to the automotive end market, this is clearly one place where we do understand now how content increases are contributing significantly to this very, very robust demand environment where we absolutely see no reason why that should ease off or should go away. 
So what I tried to say here is that our understanding of the demand environment has become better and deeper. And with that, we better believe in it. Also, totally ruling out double-ordering and any of these possible fears of piling inventories at any place. So in our key segments, and I can say that very explicitly for automotive, for industrial, but also for mobile, we do know and we do see that what we ship out is immediately being built into product and no inventory is being built in any place."

We were trying to use that kind of rule of thumb to explain what might happen as we go to full utilization. 
The good news now is we always said that around about $2.4 billion, we could run 55%. So we're a little bit above that, $2.5 billion and 55.5%. We're pretty much, now internally, kind of at the high end of our utilization. So I feel pretty good about the gross margin numbers where we are. 
But you'll see in our CapEx number, and for the full year, we'll probably do about 7% CapEx this year. We need to start adding -- or not we need. We are adding capacity, particularly in the back end, to cope with the additional revenue we're seeing. And also, over the last year or 2, we've seen the amount of product we buy externally move up from the kind of low 50s to the high 50s percent. 
So I think from a gross margin perspective, I'd say clearly, the challenge of the moment, is to demonstrate that we can consistently run at 55%, which we feel very, very comfortable about. And then, over the next few years, the things that will move us up to 57% are not so much revenue. They're more about the new product introductions and improving the cost performance of our products."

It is actually not that much all of a sudden as you would portray it because we've seen this already building through the last year. But obviously, it's been all snowed under by the shutdowns, especially in the first half, in the factories. But if you think about content increases, and that's why I made the comparison to 2019, which was more of a normal year, if you will, then actually, over that period of time, it doesn't look that crazy at all. So that's one statement. 
But there is 2 more -- so it's not all of a sudden, but it's really been gradually building already over the period of the last 4 to 6 quarters, but very much disrupted by the -- by COVID. 
Now there is 2 more things which are really important here. The one is, yes, I do believe that, especially the electric vehicle production rates, are increasing faster than anticipated, which I believe makes it a content-richer story than probably the initial forecast would have suggested. So the penetration of electric drivetrains is going faster, especially now, this year, than it was forecasted. 
Thirdly, and I think actually most importantly, we are now bearing fruit from all of the design wins in the focus areas we've been working on so hard over the past years. So what I'm saying is, Ross, that some of this is clearly company-specific. If I look at our growth rates in our focus businesses like radar, ADAS, battery management, the digital clusters, then it becomes very obvious that those are really pulling ahead, the growth. 
So there is an underlying stronger momentum on content gains, but I think a good part of this is also company-specific, meaning share gains for NXP."

So yes, we indeed stayed at the record low 1.6 months in the first quarter just like we did in Q4. And yes, I mean, if you would just do some chainsaw math, this -- just bringing that back to a more normal level of 2.4 months, which we have actually historically had, is probably like $400 million. 
But no, I don't anticipate this -- that we reach that level any time this year. I just think the sell-through is so strong that we don't get it up from a supply perspective to -- back to that level. And that also gives you an indication for the very strong pull here, which is really a -- which is sell-through. I mean, if we ship more into distribution now, inventory wouldn't go up, but it would be actually selling through right away. 
On the automotive side, yes, that's -- I think this is indeed a significant discussion, but also exploration, which we are having across the industry. First of all, I'd say most of our products, if not all in automotive, are noncommodity product. So it is indeed a matter of fact that, that demand, it just doesn't go away. I mean, if anything, then it's shifted because possibly a car here or there cannot be built. And with that, it moves then into the next quarter or eventually into next year, as you say. 
At the same time, we are working very, very diligently, both with our customers, which is the Tier 1s, but also directly with the car companies, on very prudently understanding the future demand patterns. I think one of the biggest learnings out of this current situation is to build much more transparency about the content increases, which are often application- and module-specific, and how they map out over not just the next 2 quarters, which is far too short for us, knowing that we have a manufacturing cycle time of 1 to 2 quarters, but actually more over the next 8 to 16 quarters in order to understand how that's going to map out. So that work is underway, and I can certainly say we do this with all of the top 10 car OEMs in the world. 
At the same time, we also work, of course, very hard with our suppliers, with our -- mainly wafer suppliers, but also back-end extensions, as Peter has mentioned, in order to quickly ramp up our supply capability at the same time. And I mean, part of this is the reason why I said earlier, that already in the second half of this year, we will ship at higher revenue levels than we are doing in the first half. So some of that demand obviously, it doesn't have to move into next year, but we are satisfying it already in the second half of this year. 
But yes, it's a long term -- it's really a long-term story. A lot of learning out of this situation. But at the bottom of it, and I think that's most important, a more and more diligent understanding of a very robust demand environment."

In the industrial space, it is arguably a much larger customer base, which is behind distribution. But also there, there are some big customers who are in very direct and very frequent contact also with me personally, and I know about their demand and build situation.

I mean, last year, clearly, the car production was very much down, but that doesn't mean that the content was coming to a stop because the content was driven by models which were to be introduced anyway, maybe at lower build rates. So if you compare the '19 to '21, it is 2 years stack-up from a content increase perspective.

So let me speak about -- let me take the revenue side first, John. So first of all, I really have to say, clearly, that was an extremely unfortunate and unexpected event, both for NXP, of course, in the first place, but in consequence also for our customers. Because the supply interruption as a consequence of this, in that current environment, is clearly not something anybody would have wished to have. 
Now to frame it, all of this did happen on February 15, so mid of February. I think we released our press release on March 11, that we had resumed initial operations. And I can tell you that about 8 to 9 weeks after the fact, so after Feb 15, we have been fully up and running in both facilities again. So by now, both factories are 100% running again at the pre-storm -- pre-winter storm levels, which is great news and a great achievements in a very, very challenging and difficult situation. 
Yes, we had talked about $100 million impact on the revenues in Q2. I would still say, John, we -- this is the impact which we have on Q2. Now you see that we guided sequentially flat. So obviously, we found other ways and means in other areas, with other products, to make up for that loss from the factory shutdown. 
Furthermore, we had a tiny little bit of impact already at the very end of the first quarter in automotive. I said this earlier, that a little bit, it's really more like maybe in the $10 million range, was already impacting the very end of Q1 from a shipment perspective in automotive. 
I would further say that we are absolutely confident that the $100 million will be made up in the second half of the year. So again, why we made it up in the second -- why we will make it up in the second quarter with other products, we will make up those $100 million which we lost in the first phase in the second half of the year because the factories are running again, and we'll be shipping full out. 
Now Peter, maybe you pick up the part of the question which was related to the cost impact."

But I guess to that point, when I look at sort of your long-term growth rate target that you have out there of 5% to 7%, that '19 to '21 compare would sort of argue a 12% growth rate trend line, at least over that 2-year period. And I don't want to steal thunder from your next Analyst Day.

However, I clearly said earlier that some of the content drivers are in good shape, certainly in automotive, with the stronger rate of electric vehicles, with some of the trends which we have in mobile. We spoke a lot about ultra-wideband kicking in earlier. Things seem to look robust. 
But let's also not forget, John, that if you think about '18, '19, '20, all 3 years were really not great years from a market perspective. So it's always a bit tempting to take just 2 years which looked then very good. So we will have to look at this from a more longer-term perspective again.

Talking about the auto OEMs, I really can't answer that question, Blayne, because we still don't have that long-term transparency I talked about earlier on the demand side.

Our non-GAAP operating margin in quarter 2 was a strong 32%, 1,130 basis points better than the year ago period and 70 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance. Our stronger operating profit performance was driven by a richer product mix. 
Now let me turn to the specific trends in our focus end markets. In automotive, quarter 2 revenue was $1.26 billion, up 87% versus the year-ago period and slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. In industrial and IoT, quarter 2 revenue was $571 million, up 31% versus the year ago period and slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. In mobile, quarter 2 revenue was $347 million, up 36% versus the year ago period and slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. And lastly, in communication infrastructure and other, quarter 2 revenue was $416 million, down 8% year-on-year. However, about $21 million better than our guidance. 
With this, let me move to our outlook. We are guiding the midpoint of quarter 3 revenue to $2.85 billion, up 26% versus the third quarter of 2020, within the range of up 22% to up 29% year-on-year. From a sequential perspective, this is up 10% at the midpoint versus the prior quarter. At the midpoint of this range, we anticipate the following trends in our business. Automotive is expected to be up in the low 50% range versus quarter 3 2020, and up in the mid-teens range versus quarter 2 '21. Industrial and IoT is expected to be up in the high teens percent range year-on-year and up in the mid-single-digit range versus quarter 2 '21. Mobile is expected to be down in the low single-digit range year-on-year and down in the mid-single-digit range versus quarter 2 '21. And finally, communication infrastructure and other is expected to be up in the low single-digit range versus the same period a year ago and up about 10% on a sequential basis. 
At this point, let me give you an update on NXP's current demand position. As I shared with you on our last earnings call, we had anticipated product supply to be a challenge in quarter 2, and this is indeed what we experienced. With the continuation of robust demand, we expect supply to be a challenge for the foreseeable future. We do continue to work very closely with our customers on a day-to-day basis to accommodate their most pressing short-term requirements. During quarter 2, based on the orders and all of the various actions we took over the last 6 to 9 months, we began to see wafer supply from our foundry partners and internal fabs improve. We do anticipate continued increase of wafer supply during quarter 3 and beyond, which will support our revenue growth in subsequent quarters. However, with customer demand outstripping current supply, a situation that we see across all our end markets, we are working diligently to secure additional supply to achieve a healthy balance of demand versus supply. A significant number of our customers are also taking action by placing noncancelable and nonreturnable orders for the medium term. Furthermore, based on customer discussions and also based on our own analysis, we do not believe there is excess inventory of NXP components along the extended supply chain. 
Additionally, we continue to make significant investments as a direct result of the very detailed conversations and associated commitments concerning long-term demand across our customer base, especially within the automotive and industrial end markets. These investments include long-term contractual commitments to our front-end foundry partners in order to assure supply as well as making investments to expand our internal front-end capacity and our internal back-end test and assembly capabilities so as to avoid potential bottlenecks as wafer supply materializes. Notwithstanding this challenging supply environment, our results and guidance clearly validate the excellent underlying long-term growth, profitability and cash-generating capability of our business. We continue to see our company-specific key revenue growth drivers in our strategic end markets unfold as we have long anticipated. These drivers include our 77 gigahertz radar systems, our e-cockpit solutions, the domain and thermal processes and electrification products, including our battery management systems, all in the automotive market. 
And within the broad-based industrial and IoT market, our significant and focused investment to enable complete, secure connected edge processing solutions are being very well validated by strong customer design win awards. And these are just a few of the opportunities we have shared with you at our product teach-ins. All of them will continue to contribute to our future growth. While we will not provide specific guidance beyond the current quarter, we do anticipate quarter 4 revenue will be greater than quarter 3 on an absolute basis. And we are highly confident that 2021 marks just the beginning of a longer-term upcycle for NXP within our strategic end markets. 
In summary, we are very encouraged by the continued and consistent rapid rebound in demand across our end markets. Our employees are highly engaged to drive our success. We have a robust pipeline of new and innovative products. And the customer response, engagement and design win momentum all underpin our optimism about the future potential of NXP. 
Before concluding my prepared remarks, I would like to speak to the impact the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have on NXP. The pandemic remains active with spikes that continue to plague multiple regions where we have operations, namely India, in the second quarter in Southeast Asia most recently. We continue to remain very vigilant in forcing our safety protocols across all of our global sites. We have initiated successful vaccination drives in several countries for our team members and their families. However, the highly contagious delta variant has required that we revert to a complete work-from-home situation in several of our locations. I am extremely proud of all our employees for their dedication and for their resilience during this very challenging period. I would like to especially comment on our manufacturing operations and customer-facing teams for their relentless focus on energy on assuring our customer success. It is their dedication and their hard work in the face of the pandemic and the very challenging supply environment at the same time, which truly make a difference. 
Now I would like to pass the call over to you, Peter, for a review of our financial performance. Peter?"

As Kurt already covered the drivers of the revenue during the second quarter and provided our revenue outlook for the third quarter, I'll move to the financial highlights. Overall, our second q",1151,"Thanks, Kurt, and good morning to everyone on today's call. As Kurt already covered the drivers of the revenue during the second quarter and provided our revenue outlook for the third quarter, I'll move to the financial highlights. 
Overall, our second quarter financial performance was very good. Revenues were above the midpoint of our guidance range and we drove an improvement of non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP operating profit, both of which were above the high end of our guidance range. Additionally, we have implemented long-term supply agreements with our foundry partner, which we believe will enable NXP to deliver robust growth in the coming periods. 
Now moving to the details of the second quarter. Total revenue was $2.6 billion, up 43% year-on-year and above the midpoint of our guidance range. We generated $1.46 billion in non-GAAP gross profit and reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 56.1%, up 700 basis points year-on-year and above the high end of our guidance. 
Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $626 million, up $110 million year-on-year and up $26 million from the second quarter. This was $3 million above the midpoint of our guidance due to increased variable comp driven by an improved first half performance. 
From a total operating profit perspective, non-GAAP operating profit was $830 million and non-GAAP operating margin was 32%, up 1,130 basis points year-on-year and was above the high end of our guidance. Non-GAAP interest expense was $91 million, $4 million above guidance as we issued $2 billion of new debt early in the quarter. 
Cash taxes for ongoing operations were $50 million and noncontrolling interest was $9 million. Taken together, the below-the-line items were $1 million better than our guidance. Stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings, was $93 million. 
Now I'd like to turn to the changes in our cash and debt. Our total debt at the end of the second quarter was $9.59 billion, an increase of $1.98 billion due to the previously mentioned debt issuance. Our ending cash position was $2.91 billion, up $1.07 billion sequentially due to new debt and cash generation, offset by capital returns during the quarter. The resulting net debt was $6.68 billion and we exited the quarter with a trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of $3.55 billion. Our ratio of net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q2 was 1.9x and our 12-month adjusted EBITDA interest coverage was 10x. Our liquidity is excellent and our balance sheet continues to be very strong. 
During the second quarter, we repurchased $1.2 billion of our shares and paid $155 million in cash dividends for a total of $1.36 billion of capital return to our owners. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter between July 5 and August 2, we repurchased an additional $1 billion of our shares via a 10b5-1 program. resulting in a total of $3.37 billion returned to our owners year-to-date. 
Turning to working capital metrics. Days of inventory was 88 days, an increase of 7 days sequentially. Our DIO continues to be below our long-term target of 95 days, and the sequential increase in the quarter was due to an increase in work in process driven by wafer supplies -- wafer supply deliveries to support our Q3 revenue ramp, while finished goods continue to drain to very low levels. We continue to closely manage our distribution channel with inventory in the channel at 1.6 months, flat sequentially and below our long-term targets. Both metrics reflect the continuation of strong customer order rates and a tight supply environment. It will take several quarters before we're able to rebuild on inventory on hand and channel inventories to our long-term target levels. Days receivables were 35 days, up 5 days sequentially and days payable were 92, an increase of 13 days versus the prior quarter as we continue to increase material orders to our suppliers. Taken together, our cash conversion cycle was 31 days, an improvement of 1 day versus the prior quarter, reflecting strong customer demand, solid receivable collections and positioning for customer deliveries in future periods. 
Cash flow from operations was $636 million and net CapEx was $150 million, resulting in non-GAAP free cash flow of $486 million. 
Turning to our expectations for the third quarter. As Kurt mentioned, we anticipate Q3 revenue to be $2.85 billion, plus or minus $75 million. At the midpoint, this is up 26% year-on-year and 10% sequentially. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be about 56.3%, plus or minus 30 basis points. Operating expenses are expected to be about $665 million, plus or minus about $10 million, consistent with our long-term model. Taken together, we see non-GAAP operating margin to be about 33% at the midpoint. We estimate non-GAAP financial expense to be about $96 million and anticipate cash tax related to ongoing operations to be about $90 million. 
Please note, during the second quarter, we indicated that we anticipated full year cash taxes for 2021 to be approximately 9%, and that it would be back-end loaded into the second half of the year. Noncontrolling interest will be about $9 million. And for Q3, we suggest that for modeling purposes, you use an average share count of 271 million shares, which is down about 13% -- sorry, down about 13 million shares from the year ago period as a result of the consistent execution of our communicated capital return policy. 
Finally, I have a few closing comments I'd like to make. One, demand trends continue to be strong across our target end markets and customer interest in our newest products continues to be robust. We are diligently working with our customers and our suppliers to address order requests in a timely manner. Secondly, our third quarter guidance reflects the clear potential of our business model, both in terms of revenue growth as well as the significant profit fall-through, which will enable us to drive our non-GAAP gross margin above the midpoint of our gross margin targets. Thirdly, our business continues to generate significant free cash flow. We continue to invest in our internal manufacturing capabilities, increasing CapEx to expand our back-end capacity, but also to increase the output capacity of our existing front-end wafer factories. We are steadfastly committed to our capital return policy, and we'll return all excess cash free -- all excess free cash flow to our owners so long as our leverage ratio remains at or below 2x net debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. As Kurt mentioned, we believe the demand environment is strong and notwithstanding the supply constraints, we continue to anticipate robust growth for the remainder of 2021 as well as into 2022. 
Finally, I'd like to thank all my colleagues for their outstanding work and dedication. We shouldn't forget that we are all still working under stringent pandemic protocols. 
I'd like to now turn it back to the operator for your questions."

The way to look at this is clearly that the -- while the SAAR this year probably is going to grow around 10%, that's the latest data point we have from IHS. There is broad consensus that it's going to grow another around 10% next year. And only then it will actually serve part the absolute volume levels from the pre-pandemic year of 2019. But more importantly, C.J., as we've discussed many times in the past, our content gains -- company-specific content gains, and I mentioned a few in my prepared remarks, like radar, e-cockpit, thermal processes and the battery management and electrification really, really drive specific strengths and growth for NXP. And from a market perspective, I'd say that the content gains, in general, maybe are accelerating a little, especially thanks to the accelerated pace to xEVs. So we do see that the number of xEVs as a portion of the total car production is growing faster than anybody had anticipated. So the latest data we see, again, I'm quoting, I think, IHS here. It was like 12% of the total car production last year dedicated for xEVs. It's going to be more like a quarter next year. And then growing fast from there further onwards. Since xEVs have a significantly higher silicon content compared to traditional combustion engine vehicles, this is another strong driver for the auto market. 
So far away from a peak. And finally, very tactically because I know everybody wants to speak and wants to hear about that. I mean, trust me, I'm in daily contact with the CEOs of the -- both the Tier 1 customers of us, which are serving the car companies and the car companies themselves on a daily level, trying to make sure that we can fulfill their most pressing needs, really handholding shipments, day in, day out. So there is not a single piece of inventory anywhere in the extended supply chain. They want to build more cars. So I have any confidence that this keeps growing."

We've been paying for lots of kind of medical support. But I'm not sure it's big enough to really influence the margin. I think in terms of the additional utilization, you've seen the benefit of that as we go from Q2 to Q3. So our guidance 56.3% in Q3 really shows our gross margin when our factories running full out. So as we kind of expand our revenue and go into 2022, you won't see increased utilization because we actually have to add capacity. We're running pretty much full out in Q3. So I still think 56%, I think is a great number for us, and we've gotten there quicker than we thought we would do. And I think the unanswered question is still -- 57% is still a couple of years away and it's more around new product introduction. Mix helped us from Q2 into -- sorry, Q1 into Q2. And that's why we did a little bit better in Q2. But the big impact from Q2 to Q3 is really the additional utilization and being able to run our factories, particularly the back end full out."

But again, I want to reassure you, we -- I think we really are quite far away from this because at this point, and I mean you can read the headlines every day, the industry is still short from a supply perspective. And then you are referring to some foundry statements about 60% increase of microcontroller shipments. That isn't that much. I mean, our -- I think our auto supply or revenue in the first and second quarter taken together is also around 50% up over the last year. And that's also what the industry takes given the record lows of last year. So last year is not a good comparison. I think it's more meaningful to benchmark back to 2019 or even 2018 when the industry was more at peak levels from a car production perspective. 
So how do we check this? I mean I would really say most of our product is very application-specific. So we are in extremely close contact and that is new, not only with the Tier 1 suppliers, but also directly with the OEMs where the product is going. So we have a very, very good visibility in the meantime on the true demand, much more than ever before in history. And if you think about the portion, which goes through distribution, we, as always, continue to be super disciplined on the months of inventory with our distributors. And as we published, we again stayed as a -- on a really low number with 1.6 months, I mean that's not the same number we had in the quarter before. But you know that our target model is more around 2.4, 2.5. So we watch it very carefully. Given the supply situation, I think the transparency has significantly increased, especially in what we are serving, which is very application-specific product. 
I could imagine the whole question you're asking is certainly for more commodity-like products. More difficult. In our case, where it is so crystal clear which product goes where into what application at which car company, we have much less of a concern on this. And given that visibility, I'm very confident that we are still quite a bit away from the situation you're describing."

We've said all along, we'll keep our net debt to trailing 12 months EBITDA at 2x -- at the 2x level. So we buy back to that level all that time, and we'll continue to do that for the foreseeable future. And if that results in us buying more -- if that results in us returning more than 100% this year, that's what the result is. But to be honest, it's pretty mathematical, we just stay at 2x net debt."

The just-in-time practices that that sector has adopted seemingly have backfired on them a bit with the velocity of demand recently. Are any of the conversations you're having highlighting structural changes? Or is this all basically just short-term reactive movement, and you don't think anything is really going to change a couple of years down the road for the industry as far as just-in-time."

On the first one, we talked indeed about $100 million, I think I remember, which we lost for the second quarter revenue given the winter storm in our 2 Texas facilities. That is correct. What I can tell you is indeed that both factories",463,"Yes. Thanks, Ross. On the first one, we talked indeed about $100 million, I think I remember, which we lost for the second quarter revenue given the winter storm in our 2 Texas facilities. That is correct. What I can tell you is indeed that both factories are up and running completely. So we are up to the pre-storm and higher output levels in both factories, so firing on all cylinders again. And with that, we have the output, which we would have wished to have already in the first place. So that is good news, both from a revenue perspective going forward because it is steady. I mean this is not a onetime effect, but it's steady output. But it's also good news from a supply perspective since both factories had a significant exposure, as we discussed earlier, to automotive and the comms infrastructure market, which we're badly waiting for these products. So we are glad and thankful to our employees to -- who have restored operations in the whole work time. 
On the other half of your question, Ross, I see signs of a structural change in the behavior of the auto, especially also of the auto end customers. And I think there are 2 pieces to this. The one is going to be indeed realizing that a just-in-time system is not totally compatible with a 3 to 6 months manufacturing cycle time in semiconductors if you don't have some sort of a buffer in between which is dealing with it. So some more inventory in the extended supply chain, I think, is going to be a result of this. Now when you ask me, is this being implemented? My answer is no, but it's just because the supply is not there. I mean at this point in time, people are planning for this at some point, but they can't implement it yet. But I think this is going to be eventually a structural change. The other one is actually the -- first, the transparency, which we get directly from the car companies. As I mentioned earlier, we've never had so much clarity about what products in which application in which model year will run at what volume. So this is becoming much, much better than it has ever been because structurally, we are just moving much closer in a collaboration with the car companies. And I think with that, also the binding forecast, so not only providing that forecast, but also making it more binding on a mid- to long-term basis is going to be a structural change. And that's a significant one because that wasn't the case in the past. So a more binding forecast will also help to foresee and plan with the right capacities on our end."

So John, indeed, we did talk last year about significant design win traction around the large Chinese customer, which did fall apart. So indeed, this is still not there. I just want to be clear. The business which is now performing and which we guide for the next quarter is not related to this design win, which we had talked about last year. The outperformance in the second quarter is actually across the segment. It does include some of the 5G build-outs, but it's just across all of the product subsegments, which are in this revenue segment. So it is not only 5G, but it does include 5G. 
Now if you think about the nice guidance for the third quarter in comms infra, then I'd say, yes, indeed. As we had anticipated and actually, I think, discussed on a number of the last calls, we do see, I'd say, 2 trends around 5G, which are letting us grow. We see the anticipated ramps for these multi-technology modules in the U.S. So multi-technology means LDMOS and gallium nitride or new -- from our new gallium nitride, both technology product and facility in Arizona. But it's also that we are nicely included in the China CP3 tenders, which are those macro base stations for the rural areas, which are actually in the frequency range sub 2.1 gigahertz, so somewhere between, I think, 700 megahertz and 2.1 gigahertz, which is just perfect fit to our LDMOS capability and leadership. So it is those 2, John, from a go-forward basis when you think about Q3 and beyond, which are indeed driving likely our growth. The U.S. multi-technology modules for 5G and those CP3 tenders in China."

We do have a bit more raw material and work in progress from shipments from the foundries towards the end of the quarter that we received. So I guess stepping back, we're definitely investing more in internal capacity, and that will have a positive impact on us next year.

This is a complete ecosystem play where indeed we offer the radio, the secure element and software for solutions across automotive, mobile and IoT. We are very much on track though with, I think, what we said at the teach-in to have some $300 million to $400 million revenue across those segments in '23, so in only 2 years from now. As of today, I'd say mobile is actually happening as we speak. If you think about the Android world, I dare to say, with all the major Android phone companies, we are working very closely. Automotive is now closely following, and that was just a function of more because, obviously, the automotive use case of using your mobile as a car key needs the phones to be in place firstly. This is now happening. So the first cars will be out in the market in the second half of this year and next year. And there, I dare to say with a relatively high degree of certainty that any car company, which is working in and on an ultra-wideband implementation is working with NXP. So we are highly and very positively exposed here. 
Finally, we also see a good traction with first IoT implementations One of the early examples are -- those techs, which help you to find stuff, which you might have lost. But it also -- we also see nice design wins in door locks for home properties, for example, where you would then use your mobile phone to open your front door and unlock it. So very much on track, Will. Again, the numbers which we have given the $300 million to $400 million revenue size for NXP in 2 years from now, and we think the market for this is growing at some 40% over the next couple of years."

I think the thing to remember with us about 70 -- just 70% to 80% of our assembly and test capacity is internal. So that will continue to be kind of healthy source of capital requirements.

We have, as Peter alluded to, invested both into our internal test and assembly capability, but also looking at some expansions of our internal front-end factories. So all of these things across the different technologies and products are happening gradually. So it's not a onetime event.

Now let me start with quarter 2. Overall, our results were better than the midpoint of our guidance with the contribution from the communication infrastructure end market stronger than planned and above the high end of our guidance. At the same time, the trends in the auto, industrial and mobile markets were all slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. Taken together, NXP delivered quarter 2 revenue of $2.6 billion, an increase of 43% year-on-year, and $26 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. These are very good results given the constrained supply position we knew we would face entering the quarter. 
Our non-GAAP operating margin in quarter 2 was a strong 32%, 1,130 basis points better than the year ago period and 70 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance. Our stronger operating profit performance was driven by a richer product mix. 
Now let me turn to the specific trends in our focused end markets. In automotive, quarter 2 revenue was $1.26 billion, up 87% versus the year-ago period and slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. In industrial and IoT, quarter 2 revenue was $571 million, up 31% versus the year ago period and slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. In mobile, quarter 2 revenue was $347 million, up 36% versus the year ago period and slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. And lastly, in Communication Infrastructure & Other, quarter 2 revenue was $416 million, down 8% year-on-year. However, about $21 million better than our guidance. 
With this, let me move to our outlook. We are guiding the midpoint of quarter 3 revenue to $2.85 billion, up 26% versus the third quarter of 2020, within the range of up 22% to up 29% year-on-year. From a sequential perspective, this is up 10% at the midpoint versus the prior quarter. At the midpoint of this range, we anticipate the following trends in our business. Automotive is expected to be up in the low 50% range versus quarter 3 2020, and up in the mid-teens range versus quarter 2 '21. Industrial and IoT is expected to be up in the high teens percent range year-on-year and up in the mid-single-digit range versus quarter 2 '21. Mobile is expected to be down in the low single-digit range year-on-year and down in the mid-single-digit range versus quarter 2 '21. And finally, Communication Infrastructure & Other is expected to be up in the low single-digit range versus the same period a year ago and up about 10% on a sequential basis. 
At this point, let me give you an update on NXP's current demand position. As I shared with you on our last earnings call, we had anticipated product supply to be a challenge in quarter 2, and this is indeed what we experienced. With the continuation of robust demand, we expect supply to be a challenge for the foreseeable future. We do continue to work very closely with our customers on a day-to-day basis to accommodate their most pressing short-term requirements.
During quarter 2, based on the orders and all of the various actions we took over the last 6 to 9 months, we began to see wafer supply from our foundry partners and internal fabs improve. We do anticipate continued increase of wafer supply during quarter 3 and beyond, which will support our revenue growth in subsequent quarters. However, with customer demand outstripping current supply, a situation that we see across all our end markets, we are working diligently to secure additional supply to achieve a healthy balance of demand versus supply. A significant number of our customers are also taking action by placing noncancelable and nonreturnable orders for the medium term. Furthermore, based on customer discussions and also based on our own analysis, we do not believe there is excess inventory of NXP components along the extended supply chain. 
Additionally, we continue to make significant investments as a direct result of the very detailed conversations and associated commitments concerning long-term demand across our customer base, especially within the automotive and industrial end markets. These investments include long-term contractual commitments to our front-end foundry partners in order to assure supply as well as making investments to expand our internal front-end capacity and our internal back-end test and assembly capabilities so as to avoid potential bottlenecks as wafer supply materializes. Notwithstanding this challenging supply environment, our results and guidance clearly validate the excellent underlying long-term growth, profitability and cash-generating capability of our business. We continue to see our company-specific key revenue growth drivers in our strategic end markets unfold as we have long anticipated. These drivers include our 77 gigahertz radar systems, our eCockpit solutions, the domain and thermal processes and electrification products, including our Battery Management Systems, all in the automotive market. 
And within the broad-based industrial and IoT market, our significant and focused investment to enable complete, secure connected edge processing solutions are being very well validated by strong customer design win awards. And these are just a few of the opportunities we have shared with you at our product teach-ins. All of them will continue to contribute to our future growth. While we will not provide specific guidance beyond the current quarter, we do anticipate quarter 4 revenue will be greater than quarter 3 on an absolute basis. And we are highly confident that 2021 marks just the beginning of a longer-term upcycle for NXP within our strategic end markets. 
In summary, we are very encouraged by the continued and consistent rapid rebound in demand across our end markets. Our employees are highly engaged to drive our success. We have a robust pipeline of new and innovative products. And the customer response, engagement and design win momentum all underpin our optimism about the future potential of NXP. 
Before concluding my prepared remarks, I would like to speak to the impact the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have on NXP. The pandemic remains active with spikes that continue to plague multiple regions where we have operations, namely India, in the second quarter and Southeast Asia most recently. We continue to remain very vigilant, enforcing our safety protocols across all of our global sites. We have initiated successful vaccination drives in several countries for our team members and their families. However, the highly contagious delta variant has required that we revert to a complete work-from-home situation in several of our locations. I am extremely proud of all our employees for their dedication and for their resilience during this very challenging period. I would like to especially comment on our manufacturing operations and customer-facing teams for their relentless focus and energy on assuring our customer success. It is their dedication and their hard work in the face of the pandemic and the very challenging supply environment at the same time, which truly make a difference. 
Now I would like to pass the call over to you, Peter, for a review of our financial performance. Peter?"
934467,1673433846,2360703,"NXP Semiconductors N.V., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2021",2021-08-03,"Earnings Calls","NXP Semiconductors N.V.","Executives","Thanks, Kurt, and good morning to everyone on today's call. As Kurt already covered the drivers of the revenue during the second quarter and provided our revenue outlook for the third quarter, I'll move to the financial highlights. Overall, our second q",1151,"Thanks, Kurt, and good morning to everyone on today's call. As Kurt already covered the drivers of the revenue during the second quarter and provided our revenue outlook for the third quarter, I'll move to the financial highlights. 
Overall, our second quarter financial performance was very good. Revenues were above the midpoint of our guidance range and we drove an improvement of non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP operating profit, both of which were above the high end of our guidance range. Additionally, we have implemented long-term supply agreements with our foundry partners, which we believe will enable NXP to deliver robust growth in the coming periods. 
Now moving to the details of the second quarter. Total revenue was $2.6 billion, up 43% year-on-year and above the midpoint of our guidance range. We generated $1.46 billion in non-GAAP gross profit and reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 56.1%, up 700 basis points year-on-year and above the high end of our guidance. 
Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $626 million, up $110 million year-on-year and up $26 million from the second quarter. This was $3 million above the midpoint of our guidance due to increased variable comp driven by an improved first half performance. 
From a total operating profit perspective, non-GAAP operating profit was $830 million and non-GAAP operating margin was 32%, up 1,130 basis points year-on-year and was above the high end of our guidance. Non-GAAP interest expense was $91 million, $4 million above guidance as we issued $2 billion of new debt early in the quarter. 
Cash taxes for ongoing operations were $50 million and noncontrolling interest was $9 million. Taken together, the below-the-line items were $1 million better than our guidance. Stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings, was $93 million. 
Now I'd like to turn to the changes in our cash and debt. Our total debt at the end of the second quarter was $9.59 billion, an increase of $1.98 billion due to the previously mentioned debt issuance. Our ending cash position was $2.91 billion, up $1.07 billion sequentially due to new debt and cash generation, offset by capital returns during the quarter. The resulting net debt was $6.68 billion and we exited the quarter with a trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of $3.55 billion. Our ratio of net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q2 was 1.9x and our 12-month adjusted EBITDA interest coverage was 10x. Our liquidity is excellent and our balance sheet continues to be very strong. 
During the second quarter, we repurchased $1.2 billion of our shares and paid $155 million in cash dividends for a total of $1.36 billion of capital return to our owners. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter between July 5 and August 2, we repurchased an additional $1 billion of our shares via a 10b5-1 program, resulting in a total of $3.37 billion returned to our owners year-to-date. 
Turning to working capital metrics. Days of inventory was 88 days, an increase of 7 days sequentially. Our DIO continues to be below our long-term target of 95 days, and the sequential increase in the quarter was due to an increase in work in process driven by wafer supplies -- wafer supply deliveries to support our Q3 revenue ramp, while finished goods continue to drain to very low levels. We continue to closely manage our distribution channel with inventory in the channel at 1.6 months, flat sequentially and below our long-term targets. Both metrics reflect the continuation of strong customer order rates and a tight supply environment. It will take several quarters before we're able to rebuild on inventory on hand and channel inventories to our long-term target levels. Days receivables were 35 days, up 5 days sequentially and days payable were 92, an increase of 13 days versus the prior quarter as we continue to increase material orders to our suppliers. Taken together, our cash conversion cycle was 31 days, an improvement of 1 day versus the prior quarter, reflecting strong customer demand, solid receivable collections and positioning for customer deliveries in future periods. 
Cash flow from operations was $636 million and net CapEx was $150 million, resulting in non-GAAP free cash flow of $486 million. 
Turning to our expectations for the third quarter. As Kurt mentioned, we anticipate Q3 revenue to be $2.85 billion, plus or minus $75 million. At the midpoint, this is up 26% year-on-year and 10% sequentially. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be about 56.3%, plus or minus 30 basis points. Operating expenses are expected to be about $665 million, plus or minus about $10 million, consistent with our long-term model. Taken together, we see non-GAAP operating margin to be about 33% at the midpoint. We estimate non-GAAP financial expense to be about $96 million and anticipate cash tax related to ongoing operations to be about $90 million. 
Please note, during the second quarter, we indicated that we anticipated full year cash taxes for 2021 to be approximately 9%, and that it would be back-end loaded into the second half of the year. Noncontrolling interest will be about $9 million. And for Q3, we suggest that for modeling purposes, you use an average share count of 271 million shares, which is down about 13% -- sorry, down about 13 million shares from the year ago period as a result of the consistent execution of our communicated capital return policy. 
Finally, I have a few closing comments I'd like to make. One, demand trends continue to be strong across our target end markets and customer interest in our newest products continues to be robust. We are diligently working with our customers and our suppliers to address order requests in a timely manner. Secondly, our third quarter guidance reflects the clear potential of our business model, both in terms of revenue growth as well as the significant profit fall-through, which will enable us to drive our non-GAAP gross margin above the midpoint of our gross margin targets. Thirdly, our business continues to generate significant free cash flow. We continue to invest in our internal manufacturing capabilities, increasing CapEx to expand our back-end capacity, but also to increase the output capacity of our existing front-end wafer factories. We are steadfastly committed to our capital return policy, and we'll return all excess cash free -- all excess free cash flow to our owners so long as our leverage ratio remains at or below 2x net debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. As Kurt mentioned, we believe the demand environment is strong and notwithstanding the supply constraints, we continue to anticipate robust growth for the remainder of 2021 as well as into 2022. 
Finally, I'd like to thank all my colleagues for their outstanding work and dedication. We shouldn't forget that we are all still working under stringent pandemic protocols. 
I'd like to now turn it back to the operator for your questions."

The way to look at this is clearly that the -- while the SAAR this year probably is going to grow around 10%, that's the latest data point we have from IHS, there is broad consensus that it's going to grow another around 10% next year. And only then it will actually surpass the absolute volume levels from the pre-pandemic year of 2019. But more importantly, C.J., as we've discussed many times in the past, our content gains -- company-specific content gains, and I mentioned a few in my prepared remarks, like radar, eCockpit, thermal processes and the battery management and electrification really, really drive specific strengths and growth for NXP. And from a market perspective, I'd say that the content gains, in general, maybe are accelerating a little, especially thanks to the accelerated pace to xEVs. So we do see that the number of xEVs as a portion of the total car production is growing faster than anybody had anticipated. So the latest data we see, again, I'm quoting, I think, IHS here. It was like 12% of the total car production last year dedicated for xEVs. It's going to be more like a quarter next year. And then growing fast from there further onwards. Since xEVs have a significantly higher silicon content compared to traditional combustion engine vehicles, this is another strong driver for the auto market. 
So far away from a peak. And finally, very tactically because I know everybody wants to speak and wants to hear about that. I mean, trust me, I'm in daily contact with the CEOs of the -- both the Tier 1 customers of us, which are serving the car companies and the car companies themselves on a daily level, trying to make sure that we can fulfill their most pressing needs, really handholding shipments, day in, day out. So there is not a single piece of inventory anywhere in the extended supply chain. They want to build more cars. So I have any confidence that this keeps growing."

We've been paying for lots of kind of medical support. But I'm not sure it's big enough to really influence the margin. I think in terms of the additional utilization, you've seen the benefit of that as we go from Q2 to Q3. So our guidance of 56.3% in Q3 really shows our gross margin when our factories running full out. So as we kind of expand our revenue and go into 2022, you won't see increased utilization because we actually have to add capacity. We're running pretty much full out in Q3. So I still think 56%, I think is a great number for us, and we've gotten there quicker than we thought we would do. And I think the unanswered question is still -- 57% is still a couple of years away and it's more around new product introduction. Mix helped us from Q2 into -- sorry, Q1 into Q2.

And that's also what the industry takes, given the record lows of last year. So last year is not a good comparison. I think it's more meaningful to benchmark back to 2019 or even 2018 when the industry was more at peak levels from a car production perspective. 
So how do we check this? I mean I would really say most of our product is very application-specific. So we are in extremely close contact and that is new, not only with the Tier 1 suppliers, but also directly with the OEMs where the product is going. So we have a very, very good visibility in the meantime on the true demand, much more than ever before in history. And if you think about the portion which goes through distribution, we, as always, continue to be super disciplined on the months of inventory with our distributors. And as we published, we again stayed as a -- on a really low number with 1.6 months, I mean that's not the same number we had in the quarter before. But you know that our target model is more around 2.4, 2.5. So we watch it very carefully. Given the supply situation, I think the transparency has significantly increased, especially in what we are serving, which is very application-specific product. 
I could imagine the whole question you're asking is certainly for more commodity-like products. More difficult. In our case, where it is so crystal clear which product goes where into what application at which car company, we have much less of a concern on this. And given that visibility, I'm very confident that we are still quite a bit away from the situation you're describing."

Vivek, I'd say, in general, there isn't much of a seasonal pattern this year anyway, given the situation. But here, specifically, yes, you're right.

So we have a supply constraint for some products in the mobile market, which we know we will address later on, so this is just of a temporary nature. But for quarter 3, it just hits us that we can ship to the amount which we want to ship. The good news is it doesn't cost us any market share. So we don't lose any socket with this. We fully keep our momentum going, and it's of a temporary nature. 
If you do the annual comparison, I also might want to remind you that last year, Q3 was a bit of a special quarter in mobile because it was the last quarter before the Huawei ban, which actually benefited quarter 3 in our mobile business since people had a bit more in Q3, then it stopped totally in quarter 4.

We will actually go in a bit more detail on particular question, Stacy, in our Investor Day, which Jeff has just highlighted, November 11, to parse it a little bit more -- in a more detailed way on how this shows up.

On the first one, we talked indeed about $100 million, I think I remember, which we lost for the second quarter revenue given the winter storm in our 2 Texas facilities. That is correct. What I can tell you is indeed that both factories",462,"Yes. Thanks, Ross. On the first one, we talked indeed about $100 million, I think I remember, which we lost for the second quarter revenue given the winter storm in our 2 Texas facilities. That is correct. What I can tell you is indeed that both factories are up and running completely. So we are up to the pre-storm and higher output levels in both factories, so firing on all cylinders again. And with that, we have the output which we would have wished to have already in the first place. So that is good news, both from a revenue perspective going forward because it is steady. I mean this is not a onetime effect, but it's steady output. But it's also good news from a supply perspective since both factories have a significant exposure, as we discussed earlier, to automotive and the comms infrastructure market, which we're badly waiting for these products. So we are glad and thankful to our employees to -- who have restored operations in [ interval ] time. 
On the other half of your question, Ross, I see signs of a structural change in the behavior of the auto, especially also of the auto end customers. And I think there are 2 pieces to this. The one is going to be indeed realizing that a just-in-time system is not totally compatible with a 3 to 6 months manufacturing cycle time in semiconductors if you don't have some sort of a buffer in-between which is dealing with it. So some more inventory in the extended supply chain, I think, is going to be a result of this. Now when you ask me, is this being implemented? My answer is no, but it's just because the supply is not there. I mean at this point in time, people are planning for this at some point, but they can't implement it yet. But I think this is going to be eventually a structural change. The other one is actually the -- first, the transparency, which we get directly from the car companies. As I mentioned earlier, we've never had so much clarity about what product in which application in which model year will run at what volume. So this is becoming much, much better than it has ever been because structurally, we are just moving much closer in a collaboration with the car companies. And I think with that, also the binding forecast, so not only providing that forecast, but also making it more binding on a mid- to long-term basis is going to be a structural change. And that's a significant one because that wasn't the case in the past. So a more binding forecast will also help to foresee and plan with the right capacities on our end."

So John, indeed, we did talk last year about significant design win traction around the large Chinese customer, which did fall apart. So indeed, this is still not there. I just want to be clear. The business which is now performing and which we guide for the next quarter is not related to this design win, which we had talked about last year. The outperformance in the second quarter is actually across the segment. It does include some of the 5G build-outs, but it's just across all of the product subsegments which are in this revenue segment. So it is not only 5G, but it does include 5G. 
Now if you think about the nice guidance for the third quarter in Comms Infra, then I'd say, yes, indeed. As we had anticipated and actually, I think, discussed on a number of the last calls, we do see, I'd say, 2 trends around 5G, which are letting us grow. We see the anticipated ramps for these multi-technology modules in the U.S. So multi-technology means LDMOS and gallium nitride or new -- from our new gallium nitride, both technology product and facility in Arizona. But it's also that we are nicely included in the China CP3 tenders, which are those macro base stations for the rural areas, which are actually in the frequency range sub 2.1 gigahertz, so somewhere between, I think, 700 megahertz and 2.1 gigahertz, which is just perfect fit to our LDMOS capability and leadership.

As of today, I'd say mobile is actually happening as we speak. If you think about the Android world, I dare to say, with all the major Android phone companies, we are working very closely. Automotive is now closely following, and that was just a function of more because, obviously, the automotive use case of using your mobile as a car key needs the phones to be in place firstly. This is now happening. So the first cars will be out in the market in the second half of this year and next year. And there, I dare to say with a relatively high degree of certainty that any car company, which is working in and on an ultra-wideband implementation, is working with NXP. So we are highly and very positively exposed here. 
Finally, we also see a good traction with first IoT implementations. One of the early examples are the -- those techs, which help you to find stuff which you might have lost. But it also -- we also see nice design wins in door locks for home properties, for example, where you would then use your mobile phone to open your front door and unlock it.

So to the extent that GDP grows over the next few years, you will see semiconductors grow at probably a faster rate. I think the thing to remember with us about 70 -- just 70% to 80% of our assembly and test capacity is internal. So that will continue to be kind of healthy source of capital requirements.

I will review our quarter 3 results and then discuss our guidance for quarter 4. 
Overall, our quarter 3 results were better than the midpoint of our guidance with the mobile end market stronger than planned as a result of improved supply. At the same time, the trends in the auto, industrial and IoT and communication infrastructure markets were all in line with our guidance. Taken together, NXP delivered quarter 3 revenue of $2.86 billion, an increase of 26% year-on-year and $11 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. These are very good results given the constrained supply position we knew we would face entering the quarter. 
And we continue to view our channel and on-hand inventory metrics below our long-term targets. We exited quarter 3 with our distribution channel supply metric at 1.6 months, almost a full month lower than our long-term target, and we expect this to be the situation in quarter 4 again as well. Our non-GAAP operating margin in quarter 3 was a strong 33.5%, which is 770 basis points better than the year ago period and 50 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance. 
Operating profit dollars were $19 million better than guidance, driven by higher revenue and lower expense. Now let me turn to the specific trends in our focus end markets, starting with automotive. Quarter 3 revenue was $1.46 billion, 51% up versus the year ago period and in line with our expectations. 
In Industrial and IoT, quarter 3 revenue was $607 million, up 18% versus the year ago period and again in line with our expectations. In Mobile, quarter 3 revenue was $345 million, up about 2% versus the year ago period and above our expectations. Lastly, in Communication Infrastructure and Other, Quarter 3 revenue was $454 million, about flat versus the year ago period and in line with our expectations. 
With this, let me move straight to our outlook for quarter 4. We expect the midpoint of quarter 4 revenue to be $3 billion, up 20% versus the fourth quarter of 2020 within a range of up 17% to up 23% year-on-year. From a sequential perspective, this is up 5% at the midpoint versus the prior quarter. And we again anticipate demand outstripping available supply in our quarter 4 outlook. 
At the midpoint of this range, we anticipate the following trends in our business. Automotive is expected to be up in the high 20% range year-on-year and up in the mid-single-digit range versus quarter 3 '21. Industrial and IoT is expected to be up in the high 20% range year-on-year and up in the mid-single-digit range versus quarter 3 '21. Mobile is expected to be down in the mid-teens range year-on-year and up in the low single-digit range versus quarter 3 '21. And finally, Communication Infrastructure and Other is expected to be up in the high teens range versus the same period a year ago and up in the low single-digit range versus quarter 3 '21. 
Over the course of the last 2 quarters, investors continue to ask how to reconcile the revenue performance of NXP's Automotive business with that of the global vehicle production numbers as they are reported by IHS. Specifically, NXP's Automotive segment revenue is expected to be up over 40% in 2021. Against this, the auto OEMs continue to struggle to match supply to strong consumer demand with the auto industry likely not able to meaningfully grow unit production versus 2020. Now let me make a few observations, which may help you understand this divergence. 
First, the auto supply chain is very extended and complex with multiple points of product transformation across the globe. This extended supply chain needs to coordinate the timing and delivery of up to 30,000 parts and up to 1,500 different semiconductors from hundreds of suppliers to build just one single car. 
During normal periods from the time at which NXP ships a finished component to when the final assembly gets fitted into a finished car, it takes up to 6 months. And this is on top of the normal semiconductor manufacturing cycle times of 3 to 6 months. At each step of the transformation, thousands of parts move through a complex global network of suppliers. For the process to work efficiently, it is essential that all of the components needed to complete a car are available exactly there and when they are required. 
Now we believe the extended auto supply chain significantly depleted on-hand inventory of all types of products, including semiconductors, already by the beginning in the second half of 2018 and continuing through 2019 and most of 2020. That depletion was a result of global car production declining 6% in 2019 and another 16% in 2020. While NXP's auto business, despite content increases, declined by 7% into 2019 and by another 9% into 2020. 
Now let me illustrate the impact by using the NXP distribution channel as a proxy for overall auto supply-demand trends and how we have been directly affected. We consistently monitor and measure all component movements and inventory data at our distribution partners at the end market level. 
Throughout 2021, these metrics for automotive have been at record low levels, with on-hand inventory being about 1 month below our long-term target of 2.5 months with demand in the intermediate term being consistently greater than our ability to rebuild inventory back to normalized levels. In our and my personal daily discussions with our customers throughout the auto supply chain, we hear the consistent message that they want significantly more product. And in some cases, Tier 1s are struggling to assemble full kits. And in other cases, the OEMs choose to build partially completed cars or hold their production lines altogether. 
For NXP, lead times for about 75% of our automotive products continued to be above 52 weeks. Against this backdrop, our customers are placing NCNR orders to assure long-term supply. We, in turn, are making long-term supply commitments to our supply partners. 
In summary, we think the automotive supply-demand equation will continue to be out of balance through 2022. In addition, as a learning out of the current material shortage situation and in order to mitigate the impacts the auto OEMs are experiencing today, our Tier 1 partners explicitly demand that more supplies and inventory will be needed in the extended supply chain, which we believe cannot be broadly achieved before 2023. 
Now with this currently dysfunctional supply chain as a backdrop, there are very clear and very positive trends that have simultaneously increased the demand for auto semiconductors industry-wide as a consequence of content growth. We have seen multiple OEMs prioritize the production of premium vehicles, which require upwards of twice the semiconductor content from NXP and others. 
And another clear and emerging secular content driver for the auto semiconductor market is the fast acceleration of full electric and hybrid electric vehicles, which combined have moved from 8% of global production in '19 to about 20% of production in 2021. This is very impactful since the average semiconductor content in an xEV is about $900, which is roughly 2x that of an equivalent ICE vehicle. These trends have resulted in industry-wide content per vehicle increasing at 10% per year over the last 3 years. And on top of all of this, NXP is consistently gaining share in our focused growth areas and increasing content. 
These content gains include 77 gigahertz radar safety systems, multiple electrification system opportunities beyond just battery management, and new domain and sonar processing as well as others. 
Now for NXP, it's, of course, not just automotive driving our performance. Within the industrial and IoT market, we see our ability to provide complete turnkey connected edge processing solutions consisting of processes, connectivity, security and analog, all leading to increased customer traction. These are all just a few examples that underpin our confidence in our company-specific growth. 
As Jeff mentioned earlier, we plan to go into much greater detail at our Investor Day on November 11 next week in New York. In summary, we continue to execute very well in a strong demand environment, notwithstanding the industry-wide supply charges. From a company-specific perspective, NXP is experiencing very positive customer traction of our newest products and solutions. 
Putting it all together, we are highly confident that the company's specific drivers within our strategic end markets will continue to build also beyond Q4 into Q1, as well as over the intermediate term through 2022. 
Now before we move to the financial details of the quarter, I'd like to make a few remarks in the context of our recent announcement of Bill Betz as our new CFO. I have personally worked with Bill as a business partner and one of Peter Kelly's key finance leaders for over 8 years. Bill brings both a strong track record in career in the semiconductor industry as well as truly intimate knowledge of NXP and consistency to his new role. I personally drove the evaluation and interview process, interviewing a wide number of external candidates as well as Bill, and I concluded Bill is the right person to lead our NXP finance organization, and I'm personally truly excited to work with Bill and drive NXP's profitable growth going forward. 
At the same time, I'd like to highlight the outstanding contribution Peter Kelly has played in the strategic evolution of NXP. Peter first came into the company in an operations role over a decade ago and then quickly moved into the CFO role to drive the financial discipline our stakeholders have all come to expect. He has been a clear thinking, strategic adviser to myself and a highly valued mentor to many on the NXP management team, obviously, including both Bill and Jeff. We wish Peter the very best in the next phase of his life and hope he gets to spend more quality time with his family. 
And with that, I would now like to pass the call to you, Bill, for a review of our financial performance. Bill?"

We generated $1.62 billion in non-GAAP gross profit and reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 56.5%, up 640 basis points year-on-year and near the high end of our guidance. 
Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $657 million, up $107 million year-on-year and up $31 million from Q2. This was $8 million below the midpoint of our guidance due to lower material and mass spend during the quarter. From a total operating profit perspective, non-GAAP operating profit was $959 million and non-GAAP operating margin was 33.5%, up 770 basis points year-on-year. This was also at the high end of our guidance range as a result of better fall-through on higher revenues. 
Non-GAAP interest expense was $94 million with cash taxes on going operations of $86 million and noncontrolling interest was $7 million. Taken together, the below-the-line items were $8 million better than our guidance. Stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings, was $81 million. 
Now I would like to turn to the changes in our cash and debt. Our total debt at the end of Q3 was $9.59 billion, flat on a sequential basis. Our ending cash position was $2.3 billion, down $607 million sequentially due to higher CapEx and robust capital returns during the quarter. The resulting net debt was $7.29 billion, and we exited the quarter with a trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of $3.92 billion. 
Our ratio of debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q3 was 1.9x, and our 12-month adjusted EBITDA interest coverage ratio was 11x. Our liquidity continues to be excellent, and our balance sheet is very strong. 
During Q3, we repurchased $1.16 billion of our shares and paid $152 million in cash dividends for a total of $1.31 billion of capital return to our owners. Subsequent to the end of Q3, between October 3 and November 1, we repurchased an additional $300 million of our shares via a 10b5-1 program resulting in a total of $4 billion return to our owners year-to-date. 
Turning to working capital metrics. Days of inventory was 85 days, a decline of 3 days sequentially. Our DIO continues to be below our long-term target of 95 days. We continue to closely manage our distribution channel with inventory in the channel at 1.6 months, flat sequentially and below our long-term targets. Both metrics reflect the continuation of strong customer order rates and a tight supply environment. 
We continue to believe it will take multiple quarters before we are able to rebuild on hand and channel inventories to our long-term target level. Days receivable were 31 days, down 4 days sequentially, and days payable were [indiscernible] a decline of 9 days versus the prior quarter. Taken together, our cash conversion cycle was 33 days, an increase of 2 days per [indiscernible] winner. Cash flow from operations was $924 million, and net CapEx was $200 million, resulting in non-GAAP free cash flow of $724 million. 
Turning to our expectations for Q4. As Kurt mentioned, we anticipate Q4 revenue to be $3 billion, plus or minus $75 million. At the midpoint, this is up 20% year-on-year and up 5% sequentially. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be about 56.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points. Operating expenses are expected to be about $680 million, plus or minus about $10 million, consistent with our long-term model. Taken together, we see non-GAAP operating margin to be about 33.8% at the midpoint. 
We estimate non-GAAP financial expense to be about $94 million, and anticipate cash tax related to ongoing operations to be about $100 million. Noncontrolling interest will be about $9 million. For Q4, we suggest, for modeling purposes, you use an average share count of 270 million shares, which is down 15 million shares from a year ago period as a result of the consistent execution of our communicated capital return policy. 
Finally, I have a few closing comments I'd like to make. First, demand trends continue to be strong across our target end markets and customer interest in our newest products continues to be very robust. At the same time, we are closely working with our customers and our suppliers to address order requests in a timely manner. 
Second, our Q4 guidance reflects the clear potential of our business model, both in terms of revenue growth as well as a significant profit fall-through, which will enable us to consistently drive our non-GAAP gross margin above the midpoint of our gross margin targets. Thirdly, our business continues to generate significant free cash flow, and we are committed to our capital return policy, and we'll return all excess free cash flow to our owners so long as our leverage ratio remains at or below 2x net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. 
I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank Peter Kelly for his significant contributions to NXP since he joined the company in 2011. Not only did Peter guide NXP from a financial perspective, but he truly helped lead the company and drive the strategy that made NXP what it is today. And on a personal note, I consider Peter a great leader, a mentor and a friend, and I will always be grateful for your support. 
And then finally, I'd like to thank all my colleagues across NXP for their outstanding work and dedication. We shouldn't forget that we are all still working under strict pandemic protocols. So with that, I'd like to turn it back to the operator for questions."

So expedites, escalation calls, all sorts of real actions to try to get products faster to their manufacturing locations has not slowed down by an inch. So we see that continuing. 
From a more strategic and, say, learning perspective, I would say, clearly, the whole auto industry has realized now, and that's for me a step function and the reset at the same time, has realized now how big the significance and importance of semiconductors is for their future, today, but also years out. I mean that's about innovation, but obviously, it's also about being able to build complete cars. 
And that has led to much closer and better relationships between us and directly the OEMs in terms of understanding both their innovation needs, but also the, from a more tactical perspective, their product supply needs in the near and midterm. All of that leads then to a number of significant, I would say, quite significant changes. We are seeing longer-term orders so we get the so-called NCNR orders, which easily reach out for the entire next calendar year. These are coming from the Tier 1 customers of us, but of course, they do this since they get similar behavior from the OEMs. But we also get greater visibility into the longer term, which I find a very, very important perspective which reaches then over to innovation because the intimacy, which we can build with the OEMs now to think about future systems is a great help for us to construct the right road maps."

So as we -- when we went into quarter 3, I think we talked about a sequential decline, which we could avoid. So we could pull in some supply, and that's the whole reason why we actually ended up in mobile better than guidance. So there is no difference in sockets or anything. It was just that we had a somewhat better supply capability and we continue to forecast now a similar thing into the fourth quarter. 
But overall, if you take the full second half of this year, we are unfortunately significantly constrained in supply into the mobile market. It is gradually getting better, which is why we have this performance I just quoted. But if you hold it just in total, it is pretty significantly suffering. 
Now from a year-on-year perspective, Ross, it's a more difficult compare. Last year Q3, we had the ban on Huawei coming into play, which artificially bumped up quarter 3. And quarter 4, one of our very large mobile customers needed a lot of products, which also had to do with the phasing of the quarter of last year, which was later than normal. So that's why the year-on-year comparisons, both for Q3 and Q4, need some bridging given those 2 specific customer events. All in all, I just want to absolutely reconfirm we haven't lost a single socket there. So everything is going as we had planned. We are supply constrained, but the bigger drivers being the adoption of mobile wallet attach rates and also the early penetration of ultra wideband, secure ultra-wideband solutions are fully on track with earlier targets and earlier planning."

With the knowledge at the time, no. So no, we didn't know. 
And now what you call surprises is what actually happened. A few things. One, clearly, the mix change to premium vehicles, which is an optimization to higher profit on the OEM side. It clearly is something we have not foreseen. I think nobody has anticipated that, and that has a significant impact on semiconductor consumption given that premium vehicles can easily have twice the semi content of a mass volume car. 
And on the same note, again, the xEV penetration, which I think is a result of the big focus in the growth on CO2 targets, but also a lot of government subsidies in various countries to boost actually more electric vehicles. Those 2 elements, so the mix to premium and the much stronger penetration or faster penetration of xEVs, those have significant positive impacts on the content increase for semiconductors. 
So even if the car production is flat, the content goes up massively. Again, think about that both of these elements, each one on its own right, are potentially bringing the semi content of a car to a factor of 2x. So that's -- I mean this is just outstripping any car reduction by far. 
The third element, which I would say I use your language, surprised us, I would rather say we gained more insight, is the enormous depth and complexity of the extended automotive supply chain, which means how many stages and companies sometimes are between us after we ship a product before that product ends up in a car. 
And if that supply chain is enormously depleted, as it has been the case after 2019 and 2020, it becomes incredibly dysfunctional. And we are still in the process of refilling that supply chain just to normalized levels. So really important, this is not about building any strategic inventory. It's just getting back to more normalized levels, which allow for proper operation of that supply chain. And that we didn't see, either. 
I would say we had no idea how far it has been depleted, how deep it has been depleted nor how deep it is, which means how much elasticity is in there to be refilled in the first place to make it -- to try to make it functional. Again, it is still dysfunctional at this stage."

Kurt, I think we all appreciate all the details you gave in your opening comments about the complexity around the auto supply chain. I'm kind of curious if you could spend a couple of minutes just talking about your ability to grow supply from here, both internally and externally, but both on the wafer side and on the back end on test. I'm assuming that the nice sequential jump in autos means that some of the weather events in the first half of the year have reversed themselves. But specifically, as you look over the next several quarters, would you expect your ability to grow supply to be relatively linear? Or is it going to be chunky?

The one is indeed the negative impact from the [indiscernible], which we had, I think, early Q2 in Texas, is indeed behind us. So I mean, you just put that to file, both factories which were impacted are running very much at pre-storm levels and we are good. 
Another element I have to mention here because it has impact on the industry. You've seen that over summer, there have been quite a few factory shutdowns of back-end test and assembly sites in Malaysia. I just want to highlight that we have been in a very disciplined position to organize and manage our own factories in such a way that our shutdowns were very immaterial. So we had a few days, but by and large, we had very little negative impact from those shutdowns on our revenue. 
So when you think about what we shipped in Q3, assume there was hardly any negative impact from COVID factory shutdowns from Southeast Asia and/or specifically Malaysia. Now going forward, we will clearly see improvements on the wafer side. We talked about earlier that we are entering into long-term supply commitments with our supply partners, and that's largely on the wafer side, which is going to start benefiting us next year, but also the years after. And again, this is in balance against the NCNR autos, which we are collecting from our customers. 
The back-end test and assembly, which largely is in-house for NXP, we, of course, put all the CapEx and all the investments in place to make sure that any wafer we get our hands around will also find enough capacity in-house to be tested and assembled into finished products. So think about the test and assembly increase in capacity as pretty gradual because it is something which we are putting in tune with the wafers coming in. 
On the wafer side, it is in a way more discrete, but it's not jumpy, John, because we have obviously several wafer suppliers, and they don't improve all at the same time. So from that perspective, what comes out into the revenue think about something which is gradual, which doesn't have huge step functions at any specific point in time. 
However, the result of all of this is that clearly, our supply capability, as it has done through this year, will continue to grow also through next year. Now finally, I should say this is clearly not a comment which is in any way or form specific to automotive, this is a broad comment because the supply shortages, which we are facing, is across all markets. We discussed earlier briefly mobile. Anyway, anybody knows about automotive. But we have the same negative impact on our industrial and IoT business and partially in the Comite business. So all of these improvements will help and will support revenue growth across all of our end market segments."

Given some of the logistic inflationary costs out there, oftentimes it's hard to within a quarter to get all of that right relative to pricing. Was there anything holding back gross margins from a cost side in the quarter? And I guess more importantly, as you look out across these LTAs, can you help us understand how they're being constructed relative to kind of your gross margin goal? I would assume it's much easier to price to value in this sort of environment. Does that mean we could see some tick-ups here in gross margins over the next several quarters?"

Let me give a bigger picture on the margin and more color about it. So as mentioned on our previous calls, our gross margin had improved drastically versus last year, driven by the higher volumes and improved internal utilizations from our factories. 
For example, if I try to remember, I think Q3 utilizations last year were in the mid-60s, and today, we're in the high 90s. And from a guidance standpoint, as you saw, we were slightly better  from a quarter-over-quarter basis by 20, 30 bps related to the improved product mix. 
Now as we move forward over the next several quarters, it's going to be really difficult to have that additional fall-through on our internal factories. And basically, they're running full out, I'd say. To address your question on pricing, we are only passing on the increases of the input costs from our suppliers to our customers and we're not adding any of our margins in this process as we value our long-term relationships with our customers, I'd say. And we're really equally sharing the pain together. 
As you could see in Q4, we are guiding our gross margins to be flat quarter-over-quarter. And any additional margin expansion, I'd say that come in the short term would be driven by that continued product mix. And more longer term will be really driven by the expansion of our new NPIs. I'd say overall, we're very proud of achieving these levels, and we look forward to continue delivering toward that higher end financial stated model of 57% as we go forward."

The very, very vast majority of our portfolio is application-specific. And with that portfolio, we are in very deep longer-term relationships with our customers.

But we want to be transparent, and we want to have long-term relationships, which are built on trust with our customers. 
And in that context, we absolutely consider it the right thing to pass on the input cost, but not use it to pad on our margins. I would personally say from being in different markets in the past, in a commodity market that works different, but that's not the kind of market environment we are moving in. And I'm very, very sure that this will pay off positively in the long term relative to the customer relations, which we need to continue to build our business. 
In that context, it is also important to note that the whole environment clearly has a lot of input costs, which is going up for our customers. I mean it's not just on semis.

And with reset, what I mean is that the step function, which we have to take, is something which is here too large. And that comes with -- I think I made the comment earlier with the realization of all the industries we are serving, that's not just for automotive, of how important semiconductors are. It just represents a different value to them. And from that perspective, I think we make a step here, which is a reset, which is here to stay. 
How that goes then in individual cases or individual prices year-on-year is hard to anticipate, but I don't think it will go backwards."

Also, by the way, the impact of not shipping enough product is at least as significant as in automotive. It just catches less headlines in newspapers. 
But if you think about the impact on industrial automation, which is huge machinery, which cannot be built if there is not enough semiconductor supply or in the smart home, it's equally drastic as it is in automotive, just catching less headlines. 
Now our big differentiator more and more is our capability to offer complete solutions, complete solutions around the processor. We've had that leadership in a very wide range and portfolio of processing solutions, into industrial, but it's now very nicely complemented by connectivity, security and analog attach, which really differentiates us from our  competitors. 
I would dare to say it's a very unrivaled position and offering here, which, by the way, is also going to be very much in the spotlight of our Investor Day next week. To give you much more detail what we have and why we think it makes us grow so much in the time to come. 
Now from a supply chain or channel perspective, a lot of that business indeed is going through distribution, which is because it goes to thousands, literally thousands of small customers, and this is exactly why the solution capability of NXP makes such a big difference because many of these companies, which we are serving there through distribution, don't have the capability themselves to deal with the complexity of these connected edge applications. So when and if we can offer them a complete solution, then that has a huge advantage for both time to market, but also from an R&D perspective for them. That's actually what I think is really a very, very significant differentiator for us. 
Now another element in the equation is we do have a relatively strong exposure to China. So if you think about the industrial business, the lot is going through distribution and a lot is going into China. And just to anticipate the question, we do not see a slowdown there in China. But again, mind you, it's also that we are -- we continue to be supply kept. 
So as I said earlier, also in Industrial, we could certainly run higher revenues if only we have more supply. Good news is also there, our supply capability, as we discussed with John earlier is improving every month so that over time, also there, we hopefully get into a better place."

I did indeed say that I don't think there is, broadly speaking, enough supply next year to already start building those additional inventories because that's exactly what you're asking for. 
Yes, we clearly see a demand by the OEMs to the and other participants in the extended supply chain, explicitly not the semi companies, but in between, between us and the OEMs, the demand and the requirements to build more inventory. That typical -- if you want to size this, a typical ask is somewhere between 3 and 6 months, sometimes longer. And it has a very simple reasoning. That's the manufacturing cycle time for a semiconductor product. 
So in a very simple way, they say, okay, if this is the additional inventory, then that puts us maybe on the safe side for more flexibility. And yes, this is something which I don't see the industry has the capability to build that next year, but that's been for '23."

I will review our quarter 3 results and then discuss our guidance for quarter 4. 
Overall, our quarter 3 results were better than the midpoint of our guidance with the mobile end market stronger than planned as a result of improved supply. At the same time, the trends in the auto, industrial and IoT and communication infrastructure markets were all in line with our guidance. Taken together, NXP delivered quarter 3 revenue of $2.86 billion, an increase of 26% year-on-year and $11 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. These are very good results given the constrained supply position we knew we would face entering the quarter.  
And we continue to view our channel and on-hand inventory metrics below our long-term targets. We exited quarter 3 with our distribution channel supply metric at 1.6 months, almost a full month lower than our long-term target, and we expect this to be the situation in quarter 4 again as well. Our non-GAAP operating margin in quarter 3 was a strong 33.5%, which is 770 basis points better than the year ago period and 50 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance. Operating profit dollars were $19 million better than guidance, driven by higher revenue and lower expense. 
Now let me turn to the specific trends in our focus end markets, starting with automotive. Quarter 3 revenue was $1.46 billion, 51% up versus the year ago period and in line with our expectations. In industrial and IoT, quarter 3 revenue was $607 million, up 18% versus the year ago period and again in line with our expectations. In Mobile, quarter 3 revenue was $345 million, up about 2% versus the year ago period and above our expectations. Lastly, in Communication Infrastructure and Other, quarter 3 revenue was $454 million, about flat versus the year ago period and in line with our expectations.  
With this, let me move straight to our outlook for quarter 4. We expect the midpoint of quarter 4 revenue to be $3 billion, up 20% versus the fourth quarter of 2020, within a range of up 17% to up 23% year-on-year. From a sequential perspective, this is up 5% at the midpoint versus the prior quarter. And we again anticipate demand outstripping available supply in our quarter 4 outlook.  
At the midpoint of this range, we anticipate the following trends in our business. Automotive is expected to be up in the high 20% range year-on-year and up in the mid-single-digit range versus quarter 3 '21. Industrial and IoT is expected to be up in the high 20% range year-on-year and up in the mid-single-digit range versus quarter 3 '21. Mobile is expected to be down in the mid-teens range year-on-year and up in the low single-digit range versus quarter 3 '21. And finally, Communication Infrastructure and Other is expected to be up in the high teens range versus the same period a year ago and up in the low single-digit range versus quarter 3 '21.  
Over the course of the last 2 quarters, investors continue to ask how to reconcile the revenue performance of NXP's automotive business with that of the global vehicle production numbers as they are reported by IHS. Specifically, NXP's Automotive segment revenue is expected to be up over 40% in 2021. Against this the auto OEMs continue to struggle to match supply to strong consumer demand with the auto industry likely not able to meaningfully grow unit production versus 2020. 
Now let me make a few observations, which may help you understand this divergence. First, the auto supply chain is very extended and complex with multiple points of product transformation across the globe. This extended supply chain needs to coordinate the timing and delivery of up to 30,000 parts and up to 1,500 different semiconductors from hundreds of suppliers to build just one single car.  
During normal periods from the time at which NXP ships a finished component to when the final assembly gets fitted into a finished car, it takes up to 6 months. And this is on top of the normal semiconductor manufacturing cycle times of 3 to 6 months. At each step of the transformation, as thousands of parts move through a complex global network of suppliers. For the process to work efficiently, it is essential that all of the components needed to complete a car are available exactly there and when they are required.  
Now we believe the extended auto supply chain significantly depleted on-hand inventory of all types of products, including semiconductors, already by the beginning in the second half of 2018 and continuing through 2019 and most of 2020. That depletion was a result of global car production declining 6% in 2019 and another 16% in 2020. While NXP's auto business, despite content increases, declined by 7% into 2019 and by another 9% into 2020.  
Now let me illustrate the impact by using the NXP distribution channel as a proxy for overall auto supply-demand trends and how we have been directly affected. We consistently monitor and measure all component movements and inventory data at our distribution partners at the end market level. Throughout 2021, these metrics for automotive have been at record low levels, with on-hand inventory being about 1 month below our long-term target of 2.5 months, with demand in the intermediate term being consistently greater than our ability to rebuild inventory back to normalized levels. 
In our and my personal daily discussions with our customers throughout the auto supply chain, we hear the consistent message that they want significantly more product. And in some cases, Tier 1s are struggling to assemble full kits. And in other cases, the OEMs choose to build partially completed cars or hold their production lines altogether.  
For NXP, lead times for about 75% of our automotive products continued to be above 52 weeks. Against this backdrop, our customers are placing NCNR orders to assure long-term supply. We, in turn, are making long-term supply commitments to our supply partners. In summary, we think the automotive supply-demand equation will continue to be out of balance through 2022. 
In addition, as a learning out of the current material shortage situation and in order to mitigate the impacts the auto OEMs are experiencing today, our Tier 1 partners explicitly demand that more supplies and inventory will be needed in the extended supply chain, which we believe cannot be broadly achieved before 2023.  
Now with this currently dysfunctional supply chain as a backdrop, there are very clear and very positive trends that have simultaneously increased the demand for auto semiconductors industry-wide as a consequence of content growth. We have seen multiple OEMs prioritize the production of premium vehicles, which require upwards of twice the semiconductor content from NXP and others.  
And another clear and emerging secular content driver for the auto semiconductor market is the fast acceleration of full electric and hybrid electric vehicles, which combined have moved from 8% of global production in '19 to about 20% of production in 2021. This is very impactful since the average semiconductor content in an xEV is about $900, which is roughly 2x that of an equivalent ICE vehicle. These trends have resulted in industry-wide content per vehicle increasing at 10% per year over the last 3 years. 
And on top of all of this, NXP is consistently gaining share in our focused growth areas and increasing content. These content gains include 77 gigahertz radar safety systems, multiple electrification system opportunities beyond just battery management and new domain and sonar processing as well as others.  
Now for NXP, it's of course not just automotive driving our performance. Within the industrial and IoT market, we see our ability to provide complete turnkey connected edge processing solutions consisting of processes, connectivity, security and analog, all leading to increased customer traction. These are all just a few examples that underpin our confidence in our company-specific growth. As Jeff mentioned earlier, we plan to go into much greater detail at our Investor Day on November 11 next week in New York. 
In summary, we continue to execute very well in a strong demand environment, notwithstanding the industry-wide supply charges. From a company-specific perspective, NXP is experiencing very positive customer traction of our newest products and solutions. Putting it all together, we are highly confident that the company's specific drivers within our strategic end markets will continue to build also beyond Q4 into Q1, as well as over the intermediate term through 2022.  
Now before we move to the financial details of the quarter, I'd like to make a few remarks in the context of our recent announcement of Bill Betz as our new CFO. I have personally worked with Bill as a business partner and one of Peter Kelly's key finance leaders for over 8 years. Bill brings both a strong track record in career in the semiconductor industry as well as truly intimate knowledge of NXP and consistency to his new role. I personally drove the evaluation and interview process, interviewing a wide number of external candidates as well as Bill, and I concluded Bill is the right person to lead our NXP finance organization, and I'm personally truly excited to work with Bill and drive NXP's profitable growth going forward.  
At the same time, I'd like to highlight the outstanding contribution Peter Kelly has played in the strategic evolution of NXP. Peter first came into the company in an operations role over a decade ago and then quickly moved into the CFO role to drive the financial discipline our stakeholders have all come to expect. He has been a clear thinking, strategic adviser to myself and a highly valued mentor to many on the NXP management team, obviously, including both Bill and Jeff. We wish Peter the very best in the next phase of his life and hope he gets to spend more quality time with his family.  
And with that, I would now like to pass the call to you, Bill, for a review of our financial performance. Bill?"

As Kurt had already covered the drivers of the revenue during Q3 and provided our revenue outlook for Q4, I will move to the financial highlights.  Overall, our Q3 financial performance was",1013,"Thank you, Kurt, and good morning to everyone on today's call. As Kurt had already covered the drivers of the revenue during Q3 and provided our revenue outlook for Q4, I will move to the financial highlights.  
Overall, our Q3 financial performance was very good. Revenue was above the midpoint of our guidance range and we drove an improvement of non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP operating profit, both of which were at the high end of our guidance range.  
Now moving to the details of Q3. Total revenue was $2.86 billion, up 26% year-on-year and above the midpoint of our guidance range. We generated $1.62 billion in non-GAAP gross profit and reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 56.5%, up 640 basis points year-on-year and near the high end of our guidance. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $657 million, up $107 million year-on-year and up $31 million from Q2. This was $8 million below the midpoint of our guidance due to lower material and mass spend during the quarter. From a total operating profit perspective, non-GAAP operating profit was $959 million and non-GAAP operating margin was 33.5%, up 770 basis points year-on-year. This was also at the high end of our guidance range as a result of better fall-through on higher revenues.  
Non-GAAP interest expense was $94 million with cash taxes on going operations of $86 million and noncontrolling interest was $7 million. Taken together, the below-the-line items were $8 million better than our guidance. Stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings, was $81 million.  
Now I would like to turn to the changes in our cash and debt. Our total debt at the end of Q3 was $9.59 billion, flat on a sequential basis. Our ending cash position was $2.3 billion, down $607 million sequentially due to higher CapEx and robust capital returns during the quarter. The resulting net debt was $7.29 billion, and we exited the quarter with a trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of $3.92 billion.  
Our ratio of debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q3 was 1.9x, and our 12-month adjusted EBITDA interest coverage ratio was 11x. Our liquidity continues to be excellent, and our balance sheet is very strong.  
During Q3 we repurchased $1.16 billion of our shares and paid $152 million in cash dividends for a total of $1.31 billion of capital return to our owners. Subsequent to the end of Q3, between October 3 and November 1, we repurchased an additional $300 million of our shares via a 10b5-1 program resulting in a total of $4 billion return to our owners year-to-date.  
Turning to working capital metrics. Days of inventory was 85 days, a decline of 3 days sequentially. Our DIO continues to be below our long-term target of 95 days. We continue to closely manage our distribution channel with inventory in the channel at 1.6 months, flat sequentially and below our long-term targets. Both metrics reflect the continuation of strong customer order rates and a tight supply environment.  
We continue to believe it will take multiple quarters before we are able to rebuild on hand and channel inventories to our long-term target level. Days receivable were 31 days, down 4 days sequentially, and days payable were 83, a decline of 9 days versus the prior quarter. Taken together, our cash conversion cycle was 33 days, an increase of 2 days versus prior quarter.  
Cash flow from operations was $924 million, and net CapEx was $200 million, resulting in non-GAAP free cash flow of $724 million.  
Turning to our expectations for Q4. As Kurt mentioned, we anticipate Q4 revenue to be $3 billion, plus or minus $75 million. At the midpoint, this is up 20% year-on-year and up 5% sequentially. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be about 56.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points. Operating expenses are expected to be about $680 million, plus or minus about $10 million, consistent with our long-term model. Taken together, we see non-GAAP operating margin to be about 33.8% at the midpoint. We estimate non-GAAP financial expense to be about $94 million, and anticipate cash tax related to ongoing operations to be about $100 million. Noncontrolling interest will be about $9 million. For Q4, we suggest, for modeling purposes, you use an average share count of 270 million shares, which is down 15 million shares from a year ago period as a result of the consistent execution of our communicated capital return policy.  
Finally, I have a few closing comments I'd like to make. First, demand trends continue to be strong across our target end markets and customer interest in our newest products continues to be very robust. At the same time, we are closely working with our customers and our suppliers to address order requests in a timely manner.  
Second, our Q4 guidance reflects the clear potential of our business model, both in terms of revenue growth as well as a significant profit fall-through, which will enable us to consistently drive our non-GAAP gross margin above the midpoint of our gross margin targets. Thirdly, our business continues to generate significant free cash flow, and we are committed to our capital return policy, and we'll return all excess free cash flow to our owners so long as our leverage ratio remains at or below 2x net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA.  
I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank Peter Kelly for his significant contributions to NXP since he joined the company in 2011. Not only did Peter guide NXP from a financial perspective, but he truly help lead the company and drive the strategy that made NXP what it is today. And on a personal note, I consider Peter a great leader, a mentor and a friend, and I will always be grateful for your support.  
And then finally, I'd like to thank all my colleagues across NXP for their outstanding work and dedication. We shouldn't forget that we are all still working under strict pandemic protocols. So with that, I'd like to turn it back to the operator for questions."

So first of all, very tactically and I just have to highlight that because it sits on top of my agenda every day in and out, there continues to be no change in pressure to get more products. So expedites, escalation calls",300,"Yes. Indeed, a couple of changes. So first of all, very tactically and I just have to highlight that because it sits on top of my agenda every day in and out, there continues to be no change in pressure to get more products. So expedites, escalation calls, all sorts of real actions to try to get products faster to their manufacturing locations has not slowed down by an inch. So we see that continuing.  
From a more strategic and say, learning perspective, I would say, clearly the whole auto industry has realized now and that's for me a step function and the reset at the same time, has realized now how big the significance and importance of semiconductors is for their future, today, but also years out. I mean that's about innovation, but obviously, it's also about being able to build complete cars.  
And that has led to much closer and better relationships between us and directly the OEMs in terms of understanding both their innovation needs, but also the -- from a more tactical perspective, their product supply needs in the near and midterm. All of that leads then to a number of significant, I would say, quite significant changes. We are seeing longer-term orders so we get the so-called NCNR orders, which easily reach out for the entire next calendar year. These are coming from the Tier 1 customers of us, but of course, they do this since they get similar behavior from the OEMs. But we also get greater visibility into the longer term, which I find a very, very important perspective which reaches then over to innovation because the intimacy, which we can build with the OEMs now to think about future systems is a great help for us to construct the right road maps."

But the mobile business is a bit weaker seasonally than we would have expected in the combination of the quarters.

So as we -- when we went into quarter 3, I think we talked about a sequential decline, which we could avoid. So we could pull in some supply, and that's the whole reason why we actually ended up in mobile better than guidance. So there is no difference in sockets or anything. It was just that we had a somewhat better supply capability and we continue to forecast now a similar thing into the fourth quarter. But overall, if you take the full second half of this year, we are unfortunately significantly constrained in supply into the mobile market. It is gradually getting better, which is why we have this performance, I just quoted. But if you hold it just in total, it is pretty significantly suffering.  
Now from a year-on-year perspective, Ross, it's a more difficult compare. Last year Q3, we had the ban on Huawei coming into play, which artificially bumped up quarter 3. And quarter 4, one of our very large mobile customers needed a lot of products, which also had to do with the phasing of the quarter of last year, which was later than normal. So that's why the year-on-year comparisons, both for Q3 and Q4, need some bridging given those 2 specific customer events. All in all, I just want to absolutely reconfirm we haven't lost a single socket there. So everything is going as we had planned. We are supply constrained, but the bigger drivers being the adoption of mobile wallet attach rates and also the early penetration of ultra wideband, secure ultra-wideband solutions are fully on track with earlier targets and earlier planning."

And now what you call surprises is what actually happened. A few things.",414,"Yes. Vivek, I mean, very transparently and honestly, with the knowledge of today, of course, we could have predicted it with the knowledge at the time, no. So no, we didn't know.  
And now what you call surprises is what actually happened. A few things. One, clearly, the mix change to premium vehicles, which is an optimization to higher profit on the OEM side. It clearly is something we have not foreseen. I think nobody has anticipated that, and that has a significant impact on semiconductor consumption given that premium vehicles can easily have twice the semi content of a mass volume car.  
And on the same note, again, the xEV penetration, which I think is a result of the big focus in the growth on CO2 targets, but also a lot of government subsidies in various countries to boost actually more electric vehicles. Those 2 elements, so the mix to premium and the much stronger penetration or faster penetration of xEVs, those have significant positive impacts on the content increase for semiconductors.  
So even if the car production is flat, the content goes up massively. Again, think about that both of these elements, each one on its own right, are potentially bringing the semi content of a car to a factor of 2x. So that's -- I mean this is just outstripping any car production by far.  
The third element, which I would say, I use your language, surprised us, I would rather say we gained more insight, is the enormous depth and complexity of the extended automotive supply chain, which means how many stages and companies sometimes are between us after we ship a product before that product ends up in a car.  
And if that supply chain is enormously depleted, as it has been the case after 2019 and 2020, it becomes incredibly dysfunctional. And we are still in the process of refilling that supply chain just to normalized levels. So really important, this is not about building any strategic inventory. It's just getting back to more normalized levels, which allow for proper operation of that supply chain. And that we didn't see, either.  
I would say we had no idea how far it has been depleted, how deep it has been depleted nor how deep it is, which means how much elasticity is in there to be refilled in the first place to make it -- to try to make it functional. Again, it is still dysfunctional at this stage."

So assuming that happens, what is the crystal ball thing in terms of that rough delta for the industry next year? Do you think it will be that at that 10 point?

Kurt, I think we all appreciate all the details you gave in your opening comments about the complexity around the auto supply chain. I'm kind of curious if you could spend a couple of minutes just talking about your ability to grow supply from here, both internally and externally, both on the wafer side and on the back end on test. I'm assuming that the nice sequential jump in autos means that some of the weather events in the first half of the year have reversed themselves.

So I mean, you just put that to file both factories, which",494,"Yes. Thanks, John. Let me give you a few pieces on this. The one is indeed the negative impact from the [Technical Difficulty], which we had some, I think, early Q2 in Texas, is indeed behind us. So I mean, you just put that to file both factories, which were impacted are running very much at pre-storm levels and we are good.  
Another element I have to mention here because it has impact on the industry. You've seen that over summer there have been quite a few factory shutdowns of back-end test and assembly sites in Malaysia. I just want to highlight that we have been in a very disciplined position to organize and manage our own factories in such a way that our shutdowns were very immaterial. So we had a few days, but by and large, we had very little negative impact from those shutdowns on our revenue.  
So when you think about what we shipped in Q3, assume there was hardly any negative impact from COVID factory shutdowns from Southeast Asia and/or specifically Malaysia. Now going forward, we will clearly see improvements on the wafer side. We talked about earlier that we are entering into long-term supply commitments with our supply partners, and that's largely on the wafer side, which is going to start benefiting us next year, but also the years after. And again, this is in balance against the NCNR auto, which we are collecting from our customers.  
The back-end test and assembly, which largely is in-house for NXP, we, of course, put all the CapEx and all the investments in place to make sure that any wafer we get our hands around will also find enough capacity in-house to be tested and assembled into finished products. So think about the test and assembly increase in capacity as pretty gradual because it is something which we are putting in tune with the wafers coming in. 
On the wafer side, it is in a way more discrete, but it's not jumpy, John, because we have obviously several wafer suppliers, and they don't improve all at the same time. So from that perspective, what comes out into the revenue think about something which is gradual, which doesn't have huge step functions at any specific point in time. However, the result of all of this is that clearly, our supply capability, as it has done through this year, will continue to grow also through next year. 
Now finally, I should say this is clearly not a comment which is in anyway or form specific to automotive, this is a broad comment because the supply shortages, which we are facing, is across all markets. We discussed earlier briefly mobile. Anyway, anybody knows about automotive. But we have the same negative impact on our industrial and IoT business and partially in the Comms Infra business. So all of these improvements will help and will support revenue growth across all of our end market segments."

And from a guidance standpoint, as you saw, we were slightly better from a quarter-over-quarter basis by 20, 30 bps related to the improved product mix.  
Now as we move forward over the next several quarters, it's going to be really difficult to have that additional fall-through on our internal factories. And basically, they're running full out, I'd say. 
To address your question on pricing, we are only passing on the increases of the input costs from our suppliers to our customers and we're not adding any of our margins in this process as we value our long-term relationships with our customers, I'd say. And we're really equally sharing the pain together.  
As you could see in Q4, we are guiding our gross margins to be flat quarter-over-quarter. And any additional margin expansion, I'd say that come in the short term would be driven by that continued product mix. And more longer term will be really driven by the expansion of our new NPIs. I'd say overall, we're very proud of achieving these levels, and we look forward to continue delivering toward that higher end financial stated model of 57% as we go forward."

The very, very vast majority of our portfolio is application-specific. And with that portfolio, we are in very deep longer-term relationships with our customers. So what we do is, as Bill said, we pass on the input cost, which is already, in some cases, a pretty significant element to digest for our customers. But we want to be transparent and we want to have long-term relationships, which are built on trust with our customers. And in that context, we absolutely consider it the right thing to pass on the input cost, but not use it to pad on our margins. 
I would personally say from being in different markets in the past, in a commodity market that works different, but that's not the kind of market environment we are moving in. And I'm very, very sure that this will pay off positively in the long term relative to the customer relations, which we need to continue to build our business. 
In that context, it is also important to note that the whole environment clearly has a lot of input costs, which is going up for our customers. I mean it's not just on semis. A lot of other things are also moving. So it's a tough environment for all the participants, where I think consistency, transparency and trust into the long-term relationships is a big value, and that's something where we do differentiate."

Also, by the way, the impact of not shipping enough product is at least as significant as in automotive. It just catches less headlines in newspapers. But if you think about the impact on industrial automation, which is huge machinery, which cannot be built if there is not enough semiconductor supply or in the smart home, it's equally drastic as it is in automotive, just catching less headlines. 
Now our big differentiator more and more is our capability to offer complete solutions, complete solutions around the processor. We've had that leadership in a very wide range and portfolio of processing solutions, into industrial, but it's now very nicely complemented by connectivity, security and analog attach, which really differentiates us from our competitors. I would dare to say it's a very unrivaled position and offering here, which by the way is also going to be very much in the spotlight of our Investor Day next week. To give you much more detail what we have and why we think it makes us grow so much in the time to come. 
Now from a supply chain or channel perspective, a lot of that business indeed is going through distribution, which is because it goes to thousands, literally thousands of small customers, and this is exactly why the solution capability of NXP makes such a big difference because many of these companies, which we are serving there through distribution don't have the capability themselves to deal with the complexity of these connected edge applications. So when and if we can offer them a complete solution, then that has a huge advantage for both time to market, but also from an R&D perspective for them. That's actually what I think is really a very, very significant differentiator for us. 
Now another element in the equation is we do have a relatively strong exposure to China. So if you think about the industrial business, a lot is going through distribution and a lot is going into China. And just to anticipate the question, we do not see a slowdown there in China. But again, mind you, it's also that we are -- we continue to be supply kept. So as I said earlier, also in Industrial, we could certainly run higher revenues if only we have more supply. Good news is also there, our supply capability, as we discussed with John earlier is improving every month so that over time, also there we hopefully get into a better place."

I did indeed say that I don't think there is, broadly speaking, enough supply next year to already start building those additional inventories because that's exactly what you're asking for. Yes, we clearly see a demand by the OEMs to the Tier 1s and other participants in the extended supply chain, explicitly not the semi companies, but in between, between us and the OEMs, the demand and the requirements to build more inventory. That typical -- if you want to size this, a typical ask is somewhere between 3 and 6 months, sometimes longer. And it has a very simple reasoning. That's the manufacturing cycle time for a semiconductor product. 
So in a very simple way, they say, okay, if this is the additional inventory, then that puts us maybe on the safe side for more flexibility. And yes, this is something which I don't see the industry has the capability to build that next year, but that's been for '23."

I will review our quarter 2 results, and I will discuss our guidance for quarter 3. Furthermore, I will provide an updated perspective on how we view the current demand environment. 
Now let me start with quarter 2. Overall, our results were better than the midpoint of our guidance with the contribution from the communication infrastructure end market stronger than planned and above the high end of our guidance. At the same time, the trends in the auto, industrial and mobile markets were all slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. Taken together, NXP delivered quarter 2 revenue of $2.6 billion, an increase of 43% year-on-year, and $26 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. These are very good results given the constrained supply position we knew we would face entering the quarter. 
Our non-GAAP operating margin in quarter 2 was a strong 32%, 1,130 basis points better than the year ago period and 70 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance. Our stronger operating profit performance was driven by a richer product mix. 
Now let me turn to the specific trends in our focused end markets. In automotive, quarter 2 revenue was $1.26 billion, up 87% versus the year-ago period and slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. In industrial and IoT, quarter 2 revenue was $571 million, up 31% versus the year ago period and slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. In mobile, quarter 2 revenue was $347 million, up 36% versus the year ago period and slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. And lastly, in Communication Infrastructure & Other, quarter 2 revenue was $416 million, down 8% year-on-year. However, about $21 million better than our guidance. 
With this, let me move to our outlook. We are guiding the midpoint of quarter 3 revenue to $2.85 billion, up 26% versus the third quarter of 2020, within the range of up 22% to up 29% year-on-year. From a sequential perspective, this is up 10% at the midpoint versus the prior quarter. At the midpoint of this range, we anticipate the following trends in our business. Automotive is expected to be up in the low 50% range versus quarter 3 2020, and up in the mid-teens range versus quarter 2 '21. Industrial and IoT is expected to be up in the high teens percent range year-on-year and up in the mid-single-digit range versus quarter 2 '21. Mobile is expected to be down in the low single-digit range year-on-year and down in the mid-single-digit range versus quarter 2 '21. And finally, Communication Infrastructure & Other is expected to be up in the low single-digit range versus the same period a year ago and up about 10% on a sequential basis. 
At this point, let me give you an update on NXP's current demand position. As I shared with you on our last earnings call, we had anticipated product supply to be a challenge in quarter 2, and this is indeed what we experienced. With the continuation of robust demand, we expect supply to be a challenge for the foreseeable future. We do continue to work very closely with our customers on a day-to-day basis to accommodate their most pressing short-term requirements.
During quarter 2, based on the orders and all of the various actions we took over the last 6 to 9 months, we began to see wafer supply from our foundry partners and internal fabs improve. We do anticipate continued increase of wafer supply during quarter 3 and beyond, which will support our revenue growth in subsequent quarters. However, with customer demand outstripping current supply, a situation that we see across all our end markets, we are working diligently to secure additional supply to achieve a healthy balance of demand versus supply. A significant number of our customers are also taking action by placing noncancelable and nonreturnable orders for the medium term. Furthermore, based on customer discussions and also based on our own analysis, we do not believe there is excess inventory of NXP components along the extended supply chain. 
Additionally, we continue to make significant investments as a direct result of the very detailed conversations and associated commitments concerning long-term demand across our customer base, especially within the automotive and industrial end markets. These investments include long-term contractual commitments to our front-end foundry partners in order to assure supply as well as making investments to expand our internal front-end capacity and our internal back-end test and assembly capabilities so as to avoid potential bottlenecks as wafer supply materializes. Notwithstanding this challenging supply environment, our results and guidance clearly validate the excellent underlying long-term growth, profitability and cash-generating capability of our business. We continue to see our company-specific key revenue growth drivers in our strategic end markets unfold as we have long anticipated. These drivers include our 77 gigahertz radar systems, our eCockpit solutions, the domain and thermal processes and electrification products, including our Battery Management Systems, all in the automotive market. 
And within the broad-based industrial and IoT market, our significant and focused investment to enable complete, secure connected edge processing solutions are being very well validated by strong customer design win awards. And these are just a few of the opportunities we have shared with you at our product teach-ins. All of them will continue to contribute to our future growth. While we will not provide specific guidance beyond the current quarter, we do anticipate quarter 4 revenue will be greater than quarter 3 on an absolute basis. And we are highly confident that 2021 marks just the beginning of a longer-term up-cycle for NXP within our strategic end markets. 
In summary, we are very encouraged by the continued and consistent rapid rebound in demand across our end markets. Our employees are highly engaged to drive our success. We have a robust pipeline of new and innovative products. And the customer response, engagement and design win momentum all underpin our optimism about the future potential of NXP. 
Before concluding my prepared remarks, I would like to speak to the impact the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have on NXP. The pandemic remains active with spikes that continue to plague multiple regions where we have operations, namely India, in the second quarter and Southeast Asia most recently. We continue to remain very vigilant, enforcing our safety protocols across all of our global sites. We have initiated successful vaccination drives in several countries for our team members and their families. However, the highly contagious delta variant has required that we revert to a complete work-from-home situation in several of our locations. I am extremely proud of all our employees for their dedication and for their resilience during this very challenging period. I would like to especially comment on our manufacturing operations and customer-facing teams for their relentless focus and energy on assuring our customer success. It is their dedication and their hard work in the face of the pandemic and the very challenging supply environment at the same time, which truly make a difference. 
Now I would like to pass the call over to you, Peter, for a review of our financial performance. Peter?"
934467,1673433846,2529832,"NXP Semiconductors N.V., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2021",2021-08-03,"Earnings Calls","NXP Semiconductors N.V.","Executives","Thanks, Kurt, and good morning to everyone on today's call. As Kurt already covered the drivers of the revenue during the second quarter and provided our revenue outlook for the third quarter, I'll move to the financial highlights. Overall, our second q",1151,"Thanks, Kurt, and good morning to everyone on today's call. As Kurt already covered the drivers of the revenue during the second quarter and provided our revenue outlook for the third quarter, I'll move to the financial highlights. 
Overall, our second quarter financial performance was very good. Revenues were above the midpoint of our guidance range and we drove an improvement of non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP operating profit, both of which were above the high end of our guidance range. Additionally, we have implemented long-term supply agreements with our foundry partners, which we believe will enable NXP to deliver robust growth in the coming periods. 
Now moving to the details of the second quarter. Total revenue was $2.6 billion, up 43% year-on-year and above the midpoint of our guidance range. We generated $1.46 billion in non-GAAP gross profit and reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 56.1%, up 700 basis points year-on-year and above the high end of our guidance. 
Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $626 million, up $110 million year-on-year and up $26 million from the second quarter. This was $3 million above the midpoint of our guidance due to increased variable comp driven by an improved first half performance. 
From a total operating profit perspective, non-GAAP operating profit was $830 million and non-GAAP operating margin was 32%, up 1,130 basis points year-on-year and was above the high end of our guidance. Non-GAAP interest expense was $91 million, $4 million above guidance as we issued $2 billion of new debt early in the quarter. 
Cash taxes for ongoing operations were $50 million and noncontrolling interest was $9 million. Taken together, the below-the-line items were $1 million better than our guidance. Stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings, was $93 million. 
Now I'd like to turn to the changes in our cash and debt. Our total debt at the end of the second quarter was $9.59 billion, an increase of $1.98 billion due to the previously mentioned debt issuance. Our ending cash position was $2.91 billion, up $1.07 billion sequentially due to new debt and cash generation, offset by capital returns during the quarter. The resulting net debt was $6.68 billion and we exited the quarter with a trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of $3.55 billion. Our ratio of net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q2 was 1.9x and our 12-month adjusted EBITDA interest coverage was 10x. Our liquidity is excellent and our balance sheet continues to be very strong. 
During the second quarter, we repurchased $1.2 billion of our shares and paid $155 million in cash dividends for a total of $1.36 billion of capital return to our owners. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter between July 5 and August 2, we repurchased an additional $1 billion of our shares via a 10b5-1 program, resulting in a total of $3.37 billion returned to our owners year-to-date. 
Turning to working capital metrics. Days of inventory was 88 days, an increase of 7 days sequentially. Our DIO continues to be below our long-term target of 95 days, and the sequential increase in the quarter was due to an increase in work in process driven by wafer supplies -- wafer supply deliveries to support our Q3 revenue ramp, while finished goods continue to drain to very low levels. We continue to closely manage our distribution channel with inventory in the channel at 1.6 months, flat sequentially and below our long-term targets. Both metrics reflect the continuation of strong customer order rates and a tight supply environment. It will take several quarters before we're able to rebuild on inventory on hand and channel inventories to our long-term target levels. 
Days receivables were 35 days, up 5 days sequentially and days payable were 92, an increase of 13 days versus the prior quarter as we continue to increase material orders to our suppliers. Taken together, our cash conversion cycle was 31 days, an improvement of 1 day versus the prior quarter, reflecting strong customer demand, solid receivable collections and positioning for customer deliveries in future periods. 
Cash flow from operations was $636 million and net CapEx was $150 million, resulting in non-GAAP free cash flow of $486 million. 
Turning to our expectations for the third quarter. As Kurt mentioned, we anticipate Q3 revenue to be $2.85 billion, plus or minus $75 million. At the midpoint, this is up 26% year-on-year and 10% sequentially. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be about 56.3%, plus or minus 30 basis points. Operating expenses are expected to be about $665 million, plus or minus about $10 million, consistent with our long-term model. Taken together, we see non-GAAP operating margin to be about 33% at the midpoint. We estimate non-GAAP financial expense to be about $96 million and anticipate cash tax related to ongoing operations to be about $90 million. 
Please note, during the second quarter, we indicated that we anticipated full year cash taxes for 2021 to be approximately 9%, and that it would be back-end loaded into the second half of the year. Noncontrolling interest will be about $9 million. And for Q3, we suggest that for modeling purposes, you use an average share count of 271 million shares, which is down about 13% -- sorry, down about 13 million shares from the year ago period as a result of the consistent execution of our communicated capital return policy. 
Finally, I have a few closing comments I'd like to make. One, demand trends continue to be strong across our target end markets and customer interest in our newest products continues to be robust. We are diligently working with our customers and our suppliers to address order requests in a timely manner. 
Secondly, our third quarter guidance reflects the clear potential of our business model, both in terms of revenue growth as well as the significant profit fall-through, which will enable us to drive our non-GAAP gross margin above the midpoint of our gross margin targets. 
Thirdly, our business continues to generate significant free cash flow. We continue to invest in our internal manufacturing capabilities, increasing CapEx to expand our back-end capacity, but also to increase the output capacity of our existing front-end wafer factories. We are steadfastly committed to our capital return policy, and we'll return all excess cash free -- all excess free cash flow to our owners so long as our leverage ratio remains at or below 2x net debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. As Kurt mentioned, we believe the demand environment is strong and notwithstanding the supply constraints, we continue to anticipate robust growth for the remainder of 2021 as well as into 2022. 
Finally, I'd like to thank all my colleagues for their outstanding work and dedication. We shouldn't forget that we are all still working under stringent pandemic protocols. 
I'd like to now turn it back to the operator for your questions."

The way to look at this is clearly that the -- while the SAAR this year probably is going to grow around 10%, that's the latest data point we have from IHS, there is broad consensus that it's going to grow another around 10% next year. And only then, it will actually surpass the absolute volume levels from the pre-pandemic year of 2019. 
But more importantly, C.J., as we've discussed many times in the past, our content gains -- company-specific content gains, and I mentioned a few in my prepared remarks, like radar, eCockpit, thermal processes and the battery management and electrification really, really drive specific strengths and growth for NXP. And from a market perspective, I'd say that the content gains, in general, maybe are accelerating a little, especially thanks to the accelerated pace to xEVs. So we do see that the number of xEVs as a portion of the total car production is growing faster than anybody had anticipated. So the latest data we see, again, I'm quoting, I think, IHS here. It was like 12% of the total car production last year dedicated for xEVs. It's going to be more like a quarter next year. And then growing fast from there further onwards. Since xEVs have a significantly higher silicon content compared to traditional combustion engine vehicles, this is another strong driver for the auto market. 
So far away from a peak. And finally, very tactically because I know everybody wants to speak and wants to hear about that. I mean, trust me, I'm in daily contact with the CEOs of the -- both the Tier 1 customers of us, which are serving the car companies and the car companies themselves on a daily level, trying to make sure that we can fulfill their most pressing needs, really handholding shipments, day in, day out. So there is not a single piece of inventory anywhere in the extended supply chain. They want to build more cars. So I have any confidence that this keeps growing."

We've been paying for lots of kind of medical support. But I'm not sure it's big enough to really influence the margin. 
I think in terms of the additional utilization, you've seen the benefit of that as we go from Q2 to Q3. So our guidance of 56.3% in Q3 really shows our gross margin when our factories running full out. So as we kind of expand our revenue and go into 2022, you won't see increased utilization because we actually have to add capacity. We're running pretty much full out in Q3. So I still think 56%, I think is a great number for us, and we've gotten there quicker than we thought we would do. And I think the unanswered question is still -- 57% is still a couple of years away and it's more around new product introduction. Mix helped us from Q2 into -- sorry, Q1 into Q2. And that's why we did a little bit better in Q2. But the big impact from Q2 to Q3 is really the additional utilization and being able to run our factories, particularly the back end full out."

But again, I want to reassure you, we -- I think we really are quite far away from this because at this point, and I mean you can read the headlines every day, the industry is still short from a supply perspective. And then you are referring to some foundry statements about 60% increase of microcontroller shipments. That isn't that much. I mean, our -- I think our auto supply or revenue in the first and second quarter taken together is also around 50% up over the last year. And that's also what the industry takes, given the record lows of last year. So last year is not a good comparison. I think it's more meaningful to benchmark back to 2019 or even 2018 when the industry was more at peak levels from a car production perspective. 
So how do we check this? I mean I would really say most of our product is very application-specific. So we are in extremely close contact and that is new, not only with the Tier 1 suppliers, but also directly with the OEMs where the product is going. So we have a very, very good visibility in the meantime on the true demand, much more than ever before in history. And if you think about the portion which goes through distribution, we, as always, continue to be super disciplined on the months of inventory with our distributors. And as we published, we again stayed as a -- on a really low number with 1.6 months, I mean that's not the same number we had in the quarter before. But you know that our target model is more around 2.4, 2.5. So we watch it very carefully. Given the supply situation, I think the transparency has significantly increased, especially in what we are serving, which is very application-specific product. 
I could imagine the whole question you're asking is certainly for more commodity-like products. More difficult. In our case, where it is so crystal clear which product goes where into what application at which car company, we have much less of a concern on this. And given that visibility, I'm very confident that we are still quite a bit away from the situation you're describing."

On the first one, we talked indeed about $100 million, I think I remember, which we lost for the second quarter revenue given the winter storm in our 2 Texas facilities. That is correct. What I can tell you is indeed that both factories",462,"Yes. Thanks, Ross. On the first one, we talked indeed about $100 million, I think I remember, which we lost for the second quarter revenue given the winter storm in our 2 Texas facilities. That is correct. What I can tell you is indeed that both factories are up and running completely. So we are up to the pre-storm and higher output levels in both factories, so firing on all cylinders again. And with that, we have the output which we would have wished to have already in the first place. So that is good news, both from a revenue perspective going forward because it is steady. I mean this is not a onetime effect, but it's steady output. But it's also good news from a supply perspective since both factories have a significant exposure, as we discussed earlier, to automotive and the comms infrastructure market, which we're badly waiting for these products. So we are glad and thankful to our employees to -- who have restored operations in [ interval ] time. 
On the other half of your question, Ross, I see signs of a structural change in the behavior of the auto, especially also of the auto end customers. And I think there are 2 pieces to this. The one is going to be indeed realizing that a just-in-time system is not totally compatible with a 3 to 6 months manufacturing cycle time in semiconductors if you don't have some sort of a buffer in-between which is dealing with it. So some more inventory in the extended supply chain, I think, is going to be a result of this. 
Now when you ask me, is this being implemented? My answer is no, but it's just because the supply is not there. I mean at this point in time, people are planning for this at some point, but they can't implement it yet. But I think this is going to be eventually a structural change. The other one is actually the -- first, the transparency, which we get directly from the car companies. As I mentioned earlier, we've never had so much clarity about what product in which application in which model year will run at what volume. So this is becoming much, much better than it has ever been because structurally, we are just moving much closer in a collaboration with the car companies. And I think with that, also the binding forecast, so not only providing that forecast, but also making it more binding on a mid- to long-term basis is going to be a structural change. And that's a significant one because that wasn't the case in the past. So a more binding forecast will also help to foresee and plan with the right capacities on our end."

So John, indeed, we did talk last year about significant design win traction around the large Chinese customer, which did fall apart. So indeed, this is still not there. I just want to be clear. The business which is now performing and which we guide for the next quarter is not related to this design win, which we had talked about last year. The outperformance in the second quarter is actually across the segment. It does include some of the 5G build-outs, but it's just across all of the product subsegments which are in this revenue segment. So it is not only 5G, but it does include 5G. 
Now if you think about the nice guidance for the third quarter in Comms Infra, then I'd say, yes, indeed. As we had anticipated and actually, I think, discussed on a number of the last calls, we do see, I'd say, 2 trends around 5G, which are letting us grow. We see the anticipated ramps for these multi-technology modules in the U.S. So multi-technology means LDMOS and gallium nitride or new -- from our new gallium nitride, both technology product and facility in Arizona. But it's also that we are nicely included in the China CP3 tenders, which are those macro base stations for the rural areas, which are actually in the frequency range sub 2.1 gigahertz, so somewhere between, I think, 700 megahertz and 2.1 gigahertz, which is just perfect fit to our LDMOS capability and leadership. So it is those 2, John, from a go-forward basis when you think about Q3 and beyond, which are indeed driving nicely our growth.

We are very much on track though with, I think, what we said at the teach-in to have some $300 million to $400 million revenue across those segments in '23, so in only 2 years from now. 
As of today, I'd say mobile is actually happening as we speak. If you think about the Android world, I dare to say, with all the major Android phone companies, we are working very closely. Automotive is now closely following, and that was just a function of more because, obviously, the automotive use case of using your mobile as a car key needs the phones to be in place firstly. This is now happening. So the first cars will be out in the market in the second half of this year and next year. And there, I dare to say with a relatively high degree of certainty that any car company, which is working in and on an ultra-wideband implementation, is working with NXP. So we are highly and very positively exposed here. 
Finally, we also see a good traction with first IoT implementations. One of the early examples are the -- those techs, which help you to find stuff which you might have lost. But it also -- we also see nice design wins in door locks for home properties, for example, where you would then use your mobile phone to open your front door and unlock it.

Just trying to understand the cadence you're bringing it in. And then you mentioned mobile, you're kind of reprioritizing for a quarter. Is that just kind of a one-off? Or are you -- are there other segments that even with the strong guide in September that you're having to prioritize away from them?"

And indeed, mobile is kind of suffering in the third quarter. But everything is relatively short across the board. The additional supply coming online is really gradual from many different sources. I mean, we talked about it. We have increasing traction with the mid- and longer-term contracts with our foundry suppliers. We have Texas fully up and running by now. We have, as Peter alluded to, invested both into our internal test and assembly capability, but also looking at some expansions of our internal front-end factories. So all of these things across the different technologies and products are happening gradually. So it's not a onetime event. But I would say with the demand being as strong as we continue to foresee it, it will remain tight for a while. But the one really suffering in Q3 is indeed mobile."

One source of content gains is always new model years that typically make seasonality in autos kind of have a March heavy. It seems like maybe you're seeing '22 model years earlier. I'm just kind of curious, as you think about that content portion, you're obviously benefiting now from maybe a mix shift to EV, but just kind of auto seasonality, is it different this year? Are you seeing maybe model years earlier? Just kind of walk us through, obviously, you don't want to guide for December-March, but just any thoughts on kind of seasonality for that auto business up to September."

That's one. Secondly, I don't think there is really seasonality in auto at this point in time because dealer inventories are at record lows in the U.S. and in China and they just can't build as many cars as they would wish to build. So I think it's more a function of supply availability in terms of when they would do what. So at this point in time, it is really supply constrained for them, which I think overwrites any seasonality."
