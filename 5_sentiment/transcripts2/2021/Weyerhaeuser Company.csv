This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported full year GAAP earnings of $797 million or $1.07 per diluted share, on net sales of $7.5 billion. Excluding special items, our full year 2020 earnings totaled $962 million or $1.29 per diluted share. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $2.2 billion, a more than 70% increase over full year 2019, and the highest EBITDA performance in nearly 15 years. For the fourth quarter, we reported GAAP earnings of $292 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, on net sales of $2.1 billion. Excluding net after-tax charges of $69 million for special items, we earned $361 million or $0.48 per diluted share for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $657 million, or more than 150% higher than fourth quarter 2019. 
I'd like to open this morning by expressing my sincere gratitude to our employees for their exceptional performance, dedication, resiliency and flexibility in 2020. Our people maintained a safety focus, continued to serve our customers and delivered strong results in the face of unprecedented operating and market challenges. All of our businesses executed exceptionally well, further strengthening our unrivaled portfolio of assets, improving our industry-leading operating performance and positioning the company to drive superior long-term value for shareholders. 
I'm extremely proud of our accomplishments in 2020, which included: delivering a record-breaking $1.5 billion of adjusted EBITDA from our Wood Products segment, a more than $1 billion increase over 2019; capturing approximately $100 million of company-wide operational excellence improvements, significantly exceeding our annual target; achieving record low controllable manufacturing costs in our lumber operations; strategically upgrading our Oregon Timberland Holdings; reducing gross debt by more than $900 million; introducing a new dividend framework that is sustainable across market cycles; reducing employee and contractor serious injuries by over 50%; and launching a new sustainability strategy. 
Before I discuss fourth quarter business results, let me first make some comments on the housing market. U.S. housing activity continued its toward pace throughout the fourth quarter, with no seasonal slowdown in building activity. Total U.S. housing starts averaged 1.6 million units for the fourth quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis, an improvement of 11% over the third quarter. 
Single-family starts were the primary catalyst, improving nearly 20% quarter-over-quarter. Single-family now represents approximately 80% of new residential construction activity compared with 66% one year ago. Additionally, housing permits have surged to the highest level since before the Great Recession, reaching a seasonally adjusted 1.7 million units in December. As we progress into 2021, we expect numerous macroeconomic tailwinds will continue to drive favorable U.S. housing activity, including a post-COVID preference for larger single-family homes, supported by ongoing work-from-home flexibility, mortgage interest rates near record lows, strong homebuilder confidence, record low inventory for existing home sales, demographic trends that support growing millennial homeownership while older adults are deciding to age in place, and the possibility of a federal tax credit for first-time homebuyers under the Bite Administration. 
U.S. homebuilders are seeing strong demand in January, with months of backlog, and this supports what we are hearing anecdotally from our customers. 
Certain cautionary headwinds are worth noting, most notably, constraints relating to building materials as well as lot and labor availability challenges for homebuilders. However, the housing backdrop appears increasingly favorable, and we anticipate 1.45 million housing starts in 2021, primarily driven by continued strength in single-family activity. With an aging housing stock, rising home equity and low interest rates, we expect repair and remodel activity will also remain strong in 2021. Collectively, we expect these positive housing dynamics to be a tailwind for our businesses over the next several years. 
Turning now to our fourth quarter business results. I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands on Pages 7 through 9 of our earnings slides. Timberlands' adjusted EBITDA increased by $37 million compared to the third quarter. Earnings increased by $297 million, which included a $182 million gain on the previously announced sale of certain Southern Oregon Timberlands. Western Timberlands' adjusted EBITDA increased $30 million compared with the third quarter, primarily due to higher average sales realizations for domestic and Japan export logs. 
In the western domestic market, demand remained favorable throughout the quarter as mills sought to take advantage of strong lumber prices and replenish lean inventory positions following the severe fire season. Log markets were tight to start the quarter, particularly in Oregon, where some harvest operations were slow to come online as landowners prepared for salvage activity. As salvage operations commenced, log supply improved and pricing for smaller diameter logs soften, primarily in markets with significant salvage activity. 
Our fee harvest volume increased by 9% compared with the third quarter as we fully resumed harvest operations and initiated salvage activity on our affected timberlands in Oregon. We are not experiencing any downgrades and realizations on our salvage logs. Log and haul costs increased modestly during the fourth quarter due to higher safety and operational requirements, moderately lower yields and increased hauling distances to market, all associated with salvage logging activity in Oregon. 
Turning to our export markets. In Japan, demand for our logs strengthened through the fourth quarter as housing activity improved and robust U.S. domestic lumber markets reduced the availability of imported lumber. Our Japanese log sales volumes and realizations increased significantly compared with the third quarter. Similar to Japan, the market for U.S. logs strengthened in China in the fourth quarter as container availability reduced the supply of European salvage and Australian imports were restricted due to pest issues. Our sales volumes to China increased significantly over the third quarter and average realizations increased slightly. 
Moving to the South. Southern Timberlands' adjusted EBITDA increased $2 million compared with the third quarter. Southern sawlog markets improved modestly in the fourth quarter, as strong lumber and panel pricing drove steady demand and wet weather limited log supply in some Atlantic Coast markets. Fiber markets in most areas softened slightly as seasonal maintenance outages reduced demand, although the Atlantic markets remained more tensioned due to limited log availability. 
Our fee harvest volume was slightly lower in the third -- slightly lower than the third quarter as we completed less spending activity due to the unusually wet October weather. Average sales realizations were comparable to the third quarter as improved realizations for sawlogs were offset by slightly lower fiber log realizations. Northern Timberlands' adjusted EBITDA increased $2 million compared with the third quarter, partially due to slightly higher sales realizations for hardwood logs. 
Real estate, energy and natural resources, Pages 10 and 11. Real estate and E&R contributed $14 million to fourth quarter earnings and $23 million to adjusted EBITDA. For the full year, the segment generated $241 million of adjusted EBITDA, slightly more than our revised full year guidance. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $37 million lower than the third quarter due to timing of transactions. Similar to 2019, our real estate sales activity in 2020 was heavily weighted toward the first half of the year. Average price per acre was up significantly compared to the third quarter and the year ago quarter due to transaction mix. 
Fourth quarter 2020 included an unusually high proportion of high-value, small parcel transactions. 
Wood products, Pages 12 and 13. Wood Products contributed $481 million to fourth quarter earnings and $530 million to adjusted EBITDA. I'm incredibly proud of our strong performance in Wood Products this year, despite significant operational disruptions and challenges from the pandemic. In 2020, our lumber and OSB businesses delivered the highest full year adjusted EBITDA on record. And our distribution business generated the highest adjusted EBITDA in over 15 years. 
In the fourth quarter, demand remained strong across our product lines, with robust new residential construction activity, a limited seasonal slowdown in repair and remodel, and favorable weather conditions for construction. Benchmark lumber prices entered the quarter at record levels, but declined sharply through October, as repair and remodel activity began to ease and buyers limited replenishment in expectation of a seasonal slowdown in housing. As the quarter progressed, strong construction activity, lean inventories and concerns about COVID-related supply disruptions drove buyers to step back in and pricing improved through December. On average, the framing lumber composite decreased 9% in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter. 
OSB markets performed at a stronger pace, with pricing softening only modestly in late November and rebounding shortly thereafter. Average OSB composite pricing increased 18% compared with the third quarter. EBITDA for lumber decreased $109 million compared with the third quarter. Average sales realizations decreased by 10% and Western and Canadian log costs increased significantly. Sales volumes were comparable to the third quarter. 
OSB delivered a record $220 million of EBITDA during the fourth quarter, surpassing the prior record by $60 million, which was established just last quarter. Average sales realizations improved by 27%. Operating rates decreased compared with the third quarter, and unit manufacturing costs increased as we completed planned maintenance shutdowns at 4 of our OSB mills. 
Engineered wood products' EBITDA decreased by $21 million compared to the third quarter as a result of higher raw material costs, primarily for oriented strand board web stock. Average realizations for solid section and I-joists improved slightly as we began to capture the benefit of our third quarter price increases. 
In distribution, EBITDA decreased $13 million compared to the third quarter due to a modest seasonal reduction in sales volumes. Despite this reduction, our current distribution business established a new fourth quarter EBITDA record as demand remained above what is typical for this time of year. 
Now I'd like to turn to operational excellence. Our employees continued an unwavering commitment to OpEx despite a very challenging operating environment. In 2020, our teams delivered approximately $100 million of margin improvements, exceeding our $50 million to $70 million target, while also capturing meaningful opportunities to enhance future value, avoid future costs and improve efficiencies across our enterprise. 
In Timberlands, business -- our Timberlands business delivered $43 million of OpEx improvements in 2020, with notable contributions from initiatives to increase mechanized harvesting in the West, implement machine planting in the South and optimize our southern fertilization activity. The business also created significant future value through initiatives to reduce reforestation turnaround time, further enhanced seeding survival rates and improve data capture and analysis capabilities through expanded use of drones and LIDAR technology. Wood Products captured $50 million of OpEx enhancements through a continued focus on controllable costs, mill reliability and enhanced product mix. This enabled us to achieve multiple operating records and milestones despite fluctuating operating postures in response to the pandemic. 
For example, our lumber business achieved record low controllable manufacturing costs for the second consecutive year, and our OSB mills increased reliability and delivered record production volumes. The business has also avoided future costs through procurement and efficiency initiatives. In addition to these achievements, we captured $13 million of cross-business OpEx that improved margins in both Timberlands and Wood Products. Examples include an ongoing effort to ensure that every log we sell internally is routed to its most value-accretive mill, strategically flexing harvest volume to our internal mills to reduce out-of-log downtime. And flexing our wood products procurement to consume additional fee harvest logs during the pandemic-related market disruptions. 
As we look forward to 2021, we're targeting another $50 million to $75 million of OpEx improvements across our businesses. And I'm excited to see the creativity, innovation and collaboration that emerges as we continuously strive to deliver industry-leading operating performance across all business segments. 
I'll now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our first quarter outlook."
107633,699656368,2185962,"Weyerhaeuser Company, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2021",2021-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Weyerhaeuser Company","Executives","Thanks, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin our key financial items, which are summarized on pages 15 and 16. Cash from operations totaled $444 million for the fourth quarter, and over $1.5 billion for the full year. This is our highest fourth q",1943,"Thanks, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin our key financial items, which are summarized on pages 15 and 16. Cash from operations totaled $444 million for the fourth quarter, and over $1.5 billion for the full year. This is our highest fourth quarter operating cash flow since 2007, and our strongest full year operating cash flow since 2005. We invested a portion of this cash back into our Timberlands and Wood Products businesses through capital expenditures, which totaled $281 million for the full year. Adjusted funds available for distribution, or FAD, for 2020, totaled $1.24 billion, as highlighted on Page 16. 
We used a significant portion of this year's adjusted FAD to reduce our debt outstanding. During the fourth quarter, we redeemed our $500 million [ 4 and 5/ 8 ] notes that reduced September 2023. We incurred a $58 million pretax charge on the early extinguishment, which is included in our results as a special item. We ended the year with just under $5.5 billion of total debt outstanding, which is a reduction of approximately $900 million in 2020. 
This activity, in addition to strong 2020 EBITDA performance, has substantially improved our net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, which, at the end of 2020, was 2.3x compared to a high of 4.9x at the end of 2019. With this reduction, our leverage ratio is comfortably below our target of 3.5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA over the cycle. We also have cash earmark to repay our $150 million, 9% note when it matures in the fourth quarter of 2021. After the repayment of this note, we will have no additional debt maturities until late 2023. 
In addition to improving our leverage, we returned over $380 million to shareholders during the year, which included reinitiating the dividend with a $0.17 per share base quarterly dividend, which was paid in the fourth quarter 2020. Overall, we ended the year in a strong financial position, with a sustainable dividend framework and a debt structure that is appropriate over the cycle and supports our solid investment-grade credit profile. 
Turning now to our key outlook items for the first quarter and full year 2021, which are summarized on Pages 17 and 18. In our Timberlands business, we expect first quarter net earnings and adjusted EBITDA to be slightly higher than the fourth quarter. In our Western Timberlands operations, we expect our first quarter domestic log sales volumes will be comparable to the fourth quarter. Domestic mill inventories ended the fourth quarter at moderate levels, and log demand in the West remains favorable due to strong lumber markets. We expect first quarter domestic average sales realizations will be slightly below the fourth quarter average. We anticipate the first quarter fee harvest volumes will be comparable with the fourth quarter. We also expect Western road spending will be lower compared to the fourth quarter as our roadwork activity slows during the winter months. 
We revised our 2021 Western harvest plan to focus Oregon organ salvage activities, and we currently anticipate salvage wood will comprise nearly half of the 2021 Western harvest volume. 
We'll be front-loading this activity as we are not currently experiencing any price erosion for our salvage logs. Additionally, unit log and haul costs are expected to increase slightly compared to the fourth quarter. The salvage activity results in lower efficiency and increased hauling distance to market. 
Moving to the export markets. In Japan, our first quarter average sales realizations and average sales volumes are expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter. Log demand remained strong as Japanese housing activity improved in the fourth quarter, and lumber imports to Japan remain limited. Chinese export log sales realizations and average log sales volumes are expected to be slightly higher in the first quarter. Demand remains solid, supported by an improving economy, government infrastructure spending and continued disruptions in the supply of log imports. 
In the South, we anticipate fee harvest volumes will be higher than fourth quarter following the conclusion of our 2020 harvest reductions. Additionally, we expect average log sales realizations will be comparable to the fourth quarter. In the North, average log sales realizations are expected to be comparable to fourth quarter, while fee harvest volumes are expected to be slightly lower. 
Turning to our full year harvest plan. For the full year 2021, we expect total company harvest volume will be approximately 34.5 million tons. We expect our southern harvest volumes will be up approximately 10%, and as we resume a more normalized level of activity following our 2020 pandemic-related harvest reductions. In the West, we expect our harvest volumes will be approximately 5% lower. This reflects the lower productivity on our salvage logging operations. We expect Northern harvest volumes to be moderately lower than 2020. This reflects the divestiture of our Montana Timberlands and softer demand for northern fiber logs. 
I'll wrap up the Timberlands segment with a few comments on our fourth quarter Oregon Timberlands transactions. As Devin indicated, fourth quarter included a gain of $182 million on the sale of 149,000 Southern Oregon acres, which was reported as a special item. We reported a cash inflow of $381 million related to this sale and a cash outflow of $425 million for the purchase of 85,000 acres in mid-coastal Oregon Timberlands. The net cash outflow for these 2 transactions was $44 million. 
Turning to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. Interest in our Real estate Properties remain strong. A shifting societal preferences during this time are driving robust demand for real recreational properties. We expect full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $255 million. And we anticipate the cadence of our 2021 real estate activity will be similar to our cadence in both 2019 and 2020. Land basis as a percentage of real estate sales is expected to be approximately 45% to 55% for the year. 
For the first quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA for this segment will be modestly lower than first quarter 2020 due to the timing of transactions. We expect net earnings, however, to be slightly higher than the first quarter 2020 due to mix. 
For our Wood Products segment, new residential construction activity carried forward from the fourth quarter at very favorable levels, and our builder and dealer customers are anticipating a strong first quarter. In repair and remodel markets, demand is expected to remain solid as rising home equity, continued work-from-home trends and an aging housing stock drive continued interest in home remodeling and upgrades. Channel inventories remain generally lean, with limited purchasing in advance of the spring building season. Excluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and oriented strand board, we expect first quarter adjusted EBITDA will be significantly higher than the fourth quarter. 
Production volumes within our OSB and Engineered Wood businesses are expected to increase during the quarter, following the completion of planned maintenance in the fourth quarter. We expect improved manufacturing costs across our product lines and slightly higher sales volumes, primarily for lumber and engineered wood products, while costs should be comparable to the fourth quarter. 
Entering the first quarter, benchmark pricing for oriented strand board reached a new peak in January, and the framing lumber composite is also at near-record levels. For lumber, our quarter-to-date average sales realizations are approximately $210 higher, and current realizations are approximately $250 higher than the fourth quarter average. For OSB, our quarter-to-date average sales realizations are approximately $55 higher, and our current sales realizations are approximately $70 higher than the fourth quarter average. 
As a reminder, for lumber, every $10 change in realizations is approximately $11 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis. And for OSB, every $10 change in realizations is approximately $8 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis. 
For engineered wood products average sales realizations for our solid section and I-joist products will be modestly higher as we capture the benefits of price increases announced in August 2020 and January 2021. 
Turning now to the major components of our unallocated items as summarized on Page 14. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $3 million lower than the third quarter, with unfavorable variances from elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and LIFO and the effects of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower variable compensation expense. The charge for the elimination of intersegment profit and inventory on LIFO was primarily driven by a seasonal increase in log inventories at the end of the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, when inventories were below normal levels. 
Moving to pension. In the fourth quarter, we completed the purchase of a group annuity contract, which transfers approximately $765 million of our U.S. pension liabilities to an insurance carrier. Contract purchase was funded from our U.S. pension plan assets, with no company cash contribution required. As a result of this transaction, fourth quarter special items included a $253 million noncash pretax settlement charge. The transaction is the latest in a series of actions taken to reduce our pension plan obligations. 
We have now settled nearly $3 billion since the beginning of these efforts in 2018. 
For our pension and post-employment plans, the year ended 2020 funded status decreased by approximately $200 million compared to 2019, driven primarily by lower discount rates. Discount rates decreased by approximately 90 basis points for the U.S. plans and approximately 60 basis points for the Canadian plans. Cash paid for pension and post-retirement plans in 2020 was $30 million. In 2021, we do not anticipate any cash contributions to our U.S. qualified plan. Our required cash payments for all other plans will be approximately $25 million. 
Excluding our fourth quarter settlement charge, our noncash, nonoperating pension and postretirement expense was $37 million in 2020. We expect to report approximately $35 million of expense in 2021. 
I'll wrap up with a few additional outlook items highlighted on Page 18. Our full year 2020 interest expense, before special items, was approximately $350 million. This excludes our early extinguishment of debt charges of $92 million. We expect interest expense will be $315 million for the full year 2021. 
Turning to capital expenditures. We expect total CapEx for 2021 will be approximately $420 million, which includes $115 million for Timberlands, inclusive of reforestation costs, $300 million for Wood Products and $5 million for planned corporate IT system investments. Wood Products' CapEx is increasing as we undertake some of the high-return capital projects deferred last year, and began a multiyear project to modernize our strategic hold in Louisiana sawmill.  
Similar to the highly successful rebuilds of our dirks and millport sawmills, this project will significantly reduce the mill's cost structure, enhance its product mix to better serve market demand and optimize the equipment to more efficiently process logs from our adjacent timberlands. These improvements will also result in approximately 100 million board feet of additional production capacity. This will begin ramping up in 2023 when the project is completed. 
Turning now to taxes. Our full year 2020 effective tax rate was 20%, excluding special items. For the first quarter and full year 2021, we expect our effective tax rate will be between 18% and 22% before special items based on the forecasted mix of earnings between our REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary. For cash taxes, we paid in net $76 million for the full year 2020. As previously discussed, we expect to receive a $90 million refund associated with our 2018 pension contribution in mid-2021. Excluding this refund, we expect our 2021 cash taxes will be generally comparable to our overall tax expense. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Devin, and I look forward to your questions."

In closing, I want to, again, thank our employees for their dedication, flexibility and adherence to our company values in 2020, despite being tested personally and professionally in ways that, frankly, weren't imaginable at this time last year. Notwithstanding these challenges, we achieved remarkable operating results, and I'm very pleased with the progress we made on numerous strategic initiatives. Looking forward, I'm excited by the opportunities in front of us this year. U.S. housing market has accelerated sharply, and we believe that strong macroeconomic and demand fundamentals will continue to support a favorable backdrop for our products. The potential for a federal stimulus package from the new administration could also drive incremental demand for our products. Our manufacturing facilities are operating with unprecedented reliability and an industry-leading cost structure, and a strong balance sheet and a dividend framework that enables us to return meaningful cash to shareholders across market conditions. In mass timber and Climate Solutions, including potential opportunities relating to carbon, present exciting new sources of future demand.

I'm just wondering, there seems to be some subregions of the South that are seeing real price tension and maybe some regions where prices seem challenged long term. I guess my question is, when we look sort of underneath the hood of that flat average price, is there any color you can give us on sort of the regional differences between what you're seeing maybe in your strongest submarket and weakest submarket? 
And then you upgraded the Oregon footprint last year. With your balance sheet where it is, is there maybe a kind of a parallel opportunity or a bigger opportunity to upgrade sort of the regional footprint in the south?"

Maybe I'll take that in a few different pieces. Just, at a high level, Anthony, you're right. We are still seeing issues in the south that really -- it goes back to the great recession with the oversupply that we've seen in a number of markets. As you note, that, obviously, differs somewhat by market. And it's always important to remember that supply and demand are very wood basket specific. Now as I would say, the good news is that we've seen a fair amount of new capacity coming into the South, about 6.5 billion board feet of new capacity over the last several years, some recent announcements on some new capacity. A couple of those are in wood baskets that should be very favorable to us, the [indiscernible] mill, Idaho Forest Products mill in Mississippi. And we're expecting continued new capacity coming into the south in the coming years. 
When we think about the submarkets, a thing to remember is that our business has scale across all major markets. And this really allows us to take advantage of stronger markets, such as the Atlantic region, really from Florida up through North Carolina. We have about [ 1 million 2  acres ] in total across those regions. We're also starting to see some improvements in certain markets and other regions, Southern Arkansas, Central Mississippi, North Central Louisiana, some areas of Georgia and Alabama. We're starting to see a little bit of tension in there that, I think, could continue to grow here over time. And then the other thing I would just mention is just the export markets in the South. As you know, back in 2018, we really had started ramping up our export programs primarily to China. With the tariff situation that came into play, we backed that off, but now the tariffs have come off. We've reaccelerated our export programs into China, picking up some India opportunities as well. So that's another area, frankly, for those regions that have proximity to a port, to tension that up over time. With respect to the optimization work that we did in Oregon, that's work that is ongoing all the time. That's true in the West. It's true in the South. We've been doing that for quite a while, frankly, with Russell's new role and some of the work they're doing. I would expect that, that work will continue and perhaps even accelerate going forward. But again, we're going to continue to look for ways to drive value across our portfolio, and that will include optimization work for sure, both in the South and the West."

Of what you've seen, what could be the most meaningful for Weyerhaeuser near term? Is there anything that can really move the needle in 2021? And then maybe any thoughts kind of on the long term?"

As with the new administration, there are going to be some puts and takes, and we're watching that closely. Tax, regulatory policy, those are things that we look for really in any administration to see how that's going to impact our business. But I do think, as you noted, there are some real opportunities for us with the Biden Administration. You mentioned a couple of them. A more normalized trade environment where we can avoid tariffs into China will help us continue to accelerate our export programs into that market, which should be a positive. I think, on the immigration side, a little bit different policy, perhaps, could allow some additional labor, both into the homebuilder market, which is downstream for us, but also even in the forestry side. And I think that could be a benefit. 
The infrastructure plan, we'll see how that progresses. But to the extent that we got a significant infrastructure plan through Congress, that's something that could spur some additional demand for our products. 
And then I think the big thing is really just around the environmental policies that come out of the administration around global warming and climate change. And that's certainly something that, I think, will find its way into every aspect of policy under the new administration. And I think that's something that could have some incrementally positive benefits for us. Since that falls squarely within Russell's new responsibilities, maybe I'll ask Russell, anything you want to mention specifically on the carbon side?"

I mean, clearly, the Biden Administration is going to focus on climate change, and we're seeing some of the policy specific to carbon, starting to get framed up and discussed. The early actions that they've taken demonstrates that this is going to be a focal point for them. So I would say at a federal level, I don't -- I'd be surprised if we saw a carbon tax or cap and trade type structure. I just don't think the political will is there to pull something off like that. But I do think we'll see policies supporting climate change mitigation across all the federal agencies. And that could come in the form of purchasing preferences for wood-based building because of the environmental benefits of that, solutions aimed at forest health and then recognizing the benefits of carbon stored in wood. And so I think those are all very positive, not only for Weyerhaeuser, but for the industry as a whole. 
So again, as they continue to focus on this area, we'll see more innovation, and we'll see markets continue to mature. And I think that's beneficial, again, for the industry and for Weyerhaeuser, in particular."

I wanted to start with a top-down question for you related to housing and kind of the ultimate impact on demand. So you enumerated a number of things, demographics, the move towards larger single-family homes and these sorts of things. I would also imagine a benefit to housing would be hopefully improved employment and wages for that matter, too. That said, some of our contacts are beginning to get a little bit worried about affordability based on rates moving higher and home prices moving up even more quickly. So I acknowledge that the answer is probably going to be all of the above, but of the things that you talked about in your opening comments, what gives you the most confidence that housing can continue to move higher? What gives your customers that confidence, given what's been a little bit of a spike in the wrong way in terms of affordability?"

And I think you note the affordability piece is going to be a headwind. There's no question about that. In terms of just the confidence, though, around the building environment right now, it just -- it starts with overwhelming demand for homes. There is virtually no existing home inventory for sale at present. The new home inventory for sale is pretty low. And I think we've just hit a point where, whether it's specific to COVID or whether it's just the demographic trends have finally reached that inflection point, there's just a significant amount of demand in really all markets that we participate for more housing. And the builders are really -- they're confident that they're going to have a lot of building activity this year. 
Certainly, I think to the extent that interest rates can stay relatively low in the near term, which seems to be the federal policy at present, that will be supportive. But in any event, it goes back to some of the things we've been talking about for years, which is, we've been massively underbuilding in the United States for over a decade. We need to build millions of homes over and above just kind of keeping pace with normal demand just to get back to even. 
So I think there are a lot of tailwinds to support that, but you're exactly right. The affordability piece is the one that is going to have to be solved. But, in the near term, at least for 2021, we're feeling pretty positive about the construction setup for this year."

It's situated very well in terms of serving some key customers. It's surrounded by a significant amount of our fee timberlands. This new mill configuration. It's going to allow us to improve the product mix from the mill. We've got a great employee base there. So we're really excited about this. I think this is going to be along the lines of our Dirks and Millport mill in terms of just really a very low-cost, highly efficient mill that's going to make some great lumber over time. 
In terms of the ability to flex up for additional volume in the near term, we are very focused on improving mill reliability across our footprint. And that comes into play in a number of different instances. And a good example of that, right? Is on the OSB side, where we hit a production volume record in 2020, notwithstanding the fact that we took a fair amount of downtime in the spring. And so those reliability improvements will provide extra volume across the system. And that's equally true from a lumber and an EWP standpoint. So there's going to be some volume creep that comes through that. And we're continuing to invest back in our mills across the system as part of our CapEx program. But what I would note is that those capital programs are largely focused on reducing costs, improving reliability and driving efficiencies in the system as opposed to being directly focused at increasing our volumes. And so that's a long-winded way of saying, we are adding another 100 million of volume from our holding project, continuing to ramp up Millport, so maybe another 50 million to 60 million board feet coming off of Millport this year. And then just some additional flex from continuing to run our mills well, at least that's the answer here in the short term."

And if that plays out, like you say, we're going to generate some very strong cash flow. As we've indicated with our new dividend framework, the plan is to return 75% to 80% of our 2021 FAD back to shareholders, both through the base dividend and then, ultimately, the supplemental dividend. 
And any cash flow over and above that 75% to 80% of FAD would be available for growth, further debt paydown or, under the right circumstances, share repurchase. And so we'll continue to look at those opportunistically and allocate the cash to those opportunities that create the most long-term value for shareholders. And I would say Timberland's growth opportunities are an area that I would expect we'll continue to look closely at, both from just an optimization standpoint and growth more generally. But obviously, that's something that's dependent on finding the right deals that are accretive and strategic. And so we're going to continue to be very disciplined in that respect. 
In terms of a potential interim supplemental dividend this year, as we mentioned, the new framework really anticipates that supplemental dividend is going to pay -- be paid out annually in Q1 for the prior year. And really, the reason for that is just to make sure that we're matching our variable dividend component to the cash flow that we're generating for the year. So generally, we're anticipating that, that first supplemental dividend would be paid in the first quarter of 2022 based on the 2021 cash flow. Now look, if things go really well, could there be a situation where we would consider some sort of interim supplemental dividend later in the year? Certainly, that's conceivable. I wouldn't shut the door on that definitively. But again, we're expecting that to be paid out annually in Q1 under most circumstances."

With this level of housing activity, just as a general statement, the western market is, by far, the most tension market in the United States. And a big driver of what kept log pricing down for really all of 2019 and a portion of 2020 was depressed lumber prices. And so what we've historically seen, at least in the recent past, is much of the benefit of lumber prices increasing will go back to the woods in the form of log pricing. But obviously, people are not going to pay more for logs that caused them to be cash flow negative. And so when you have low lumber prices, that does put some restrictions on your ability to increase log prices. 
But as we continue to see lumber prices stay at healthy levels, the tension in the market will remain. Certainly, we've seen strong export markets. Coming out of Q4 into Q1, we expect that to continue. That's a japan statement. That's a China statement. So the market tension is there. It's really just a function of what lumber prices are doing. 
The only caveat to that, Mark, is just, there will be a dynamic going on in portions of Oregon this year as landowners work through their salvage volumes. And so one of the things that we're seeing here, probably in the near term, is that, as all of the landowners, ourselves included, are working through salvage activity, what that typically means is that you're harvesting some stands that are younger than you would normally harvest. And so as we're out and we're harvesting stands that are in the low 30s as opposed to 40 to 45, we are going to see more chip and saw really going into that market. So that may have a little bit of a depressive effect here for a portion of 2021. But overall, the wood basket in Washington and Oregon remains fairly tensioned."

As we think about -- this is primarily a southern statement because we have a much higher percentage of our logs that go into the pulp market in the South. As we think about our harvesting activity generally, we're looking at that on a regular basis",201,"Yes. As we think about -- this is primarily a southern statement because we have a much higher percentage of our logs that go into the pulp market in the South. As we think about our harvesting activity generally, we're looking at that on a regular basis because the point of how we manage our harvest is, obviously, we want to keep the growth in the harvest in balance over time. But on a year-to-year basis, we're looking at what's going on in the markets, and we're really trying to maximize the value of our timberlands over time. 
And so as we think about 2021, as Russell mentioned, we are a little heavier to fiber in the South, and that's really catching up on some thinning backlog, which is really important from a silvicultural perspective, and we need to do that. But obviously, that does put a little bit more pulpwood into the market, and you don't get as many tons from thinning as you do from clear cutting. But the high-level answer is, we continue to look at that really on a year-to-year basis, looking at what's going on in the markets, what the different opportunities are for that wood."

I think people get the rationale and how it fits in with the business and the cash flows. But we still have to prove that out. And so I think that's a part of it. And we'll continue to look forward to delivering on the commitments that we made as part of rolling that new framework out. 
So I think that's a piece of it. And certainly, we are in a position where we feel like the markets are pretty strong. They're going to be a tailwind for us. Our businesses are running really, really well.

And so that's probably the most likely portfolio moves that we're going to make would be on the Timberland side. 
On the Wood Products side, I think we like the assets that we have. And so I wouldn't anticipate big portfolio changes necessarily on the Wood Products' side. If we found a mill here or there, sort of a small bolt-on acquisition in the Wood Products space, we would look at that if the price is right and it's in the right locale. But in terms of large acquisitions on the Wood Products' side, I'd say that's not currently our focus.

Excluding special items, our full year 2020 earnings totaled $962 million or $1.29 per diluted share. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $2.2 billion, more than 70% increase over full year 2019 and the highest EBITDA performance in nearly 15 years. For the fourth quarter, we reported GAAP earnings of $292 million or $0.39 per diluted share, on net sales of $2.1 billion. Excluding net after-tax charges of $69 million for special items, we earned $361 million or $0.48 per diluted share for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $657 million, or more than 150% higher than fourth quarter 2019. 
I'd like to open this morning by expressing my sincere gratitude to our employees for their exceptional performance, dedication, resiliency and flexibility in 2020. Our people maintained a safety focus, continued to serve our customers and delivered strong results in the face of unprecedented operating and market challenges. All of our businesses executed exceptionally well, further strengthening our unrivaled portfolio of assets, improving our industry-leading operating performance and positioning the company to drive superior long-term value for shareholders. 
I'm extremely proud of our accomplishments in 2020, which included: delivering a record-breaking $1.5 billion of adjusted EBITDA from our Wood Products segment, a more than $1 billion increase over 2019; capturing approximately $100 million of company-wide operational excellence improvements, significantly exceeding our annual target; achieving record low controllable manufacturing costs in our lumber operations; strategically upgrading our Oregon Timberland Holdings; reducing gross debt by more than $900 million; introducing a new dividend framework that is sustainable across market cycles; reducing employee and contractor serious injuries by over 50%; and launching a new sustainability strategy. 
Before I discuss fourth quarter business results, let me first make some comments on the housing market. U.S. housing activity continued its torrid pace throughout the fourth quarter, with no seasonal slowdown in building activity. Total U.S. housing starts averaged 1.6 million units for the fourth quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis, an improvement of 11% over the third quarter. 
Single-family starts were the primary catalyst, improving nearly 20% quarter-over-quarter. Single-family now represents approximately 80% of new residential construction activity compared with 66% one year ago. Additionally, housing permits have surged to the highest level since before the Great Recession, reaching a seasonally adjusted 1.7 million units in December. 
As we progress into 2021, we expect numerous macroeconomic tailwinds will continue to drive favorable U.S. housing activity, including a post-COVID preference for larger single-family homes, supported by ongoing work-from-home flexibility, mortgage interest rates near record lows, strong homebuilder confidence, record low inventory for existing home sales, demographic trends that support growing millennial homeownership while older adults are deciding to age in place, and the possibility of a federal tax credit for first-time homebuyers under the Biden administration. 
U.S. homebuilders are seeing strong demand in January, with months of backlog, and this supports what we are hearing anecdotally from our customers. 
Certain cautionary headwinds are worth noting, most notably, constraints relating to building materials as well as lot and labor availability challenges for homebuilders. However, the housing backdrop appears increasingly favorable, and we anticipate 1.45 million housing starts in 2021, primarily driven by continued strength in single-family activity. With an aging housing stock, rising home equity and low interest rates, we expect repair and remodel activity will also remain strong in 2021. Collectively, we expect these positive housing dynamics to be a tailwind for our businesses over the next several years. 
Turning now to our fourth quarter business results. I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands on Pages 7 through 9 of our earnings slides. Timberlands' adjusted EBITDA increased by $37 million compared to the third quarter. Earnings increased by $297 million, which included a $182 million gain on the previously announced sale of certain Southern Oregon Timberlands. Western Timberlands' adjusted EBITDA increased $30 million compared with the third quarter, primarily due to higher average sales realizations for domestic and Japan export logs. 
In the western domestic market, demand remained favorable throughout the quarter as mills sought to take advantage of strong lumber prices and replenish lean inventory positions following the severe fire season. Log markets were tight to start the quarter, particularly in Oregon, where some harvest operations were slow to come online as landowners prepared for salvage activity. As salvage operations commenced, log supply improved and pricing for smaller diameter logs softened, primarily in markets with significant salvage activity. 
Our fee harvest volume increased by 9% compared with the third quarter as we fully resumed harvest operations and initiated salvage activity on our affected Timberlands in Oregon. We are not experiencing any downgrades and realizations on our salvage logs. Log and haul costs increased modestly during the fourth quarter due to higher safety and operational requirements, moderately lower yields and increased hauling distances to market, all associated with salvage logging activity in Oregon. 
Turning to our export markets. In Japan, demand for our logs strengthened through the fourth quarter as housing activity improved and robust U.S. domestic lumber markets reduced the availability of imported lumber. Our Japanese log sales volumes and realizations increased significantly compared with the third quarter. Similar to Japan, the market for U.S. logs strengthened in China in the fourth quarter as container availability reduced the supply of European salvage and Australian imports were restricted due to pest issues. Our sales volumes to China increased significantly over the third quarter and average realizations increased slightly. 
Moving to the South. Southern Timberlands' adjusted EBITDA increased $2 million compared with the third quarter. Southern sawlog markets improved modestly in the fourth quarter, as strong lumber and panel pricing drove steady demand and wet weather limited log supply in some Atlantic Coast markets. Fiber markets in most areas softened slightly as seasonal maintenance outages reduced demand, although the Atlantic markets remained more tensioned due to limited log availability. 
Our fee harvest volume was slightly lower in the third -- slightly lower than the third quarter as we completed less spending activity due to the unusually wet October weather. Average sales realizations were comparable to the third quarter as improved realizations for sawlogs were offset by slightly lower fiber log realizations. Northern Timberlands' adjusted EBITDA increased $2 million compared with the third quarter, partially due to slightly higher sales realizations for hardwood logs. 
Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources, Pages 10 and 11. Real Estate and E&R contributed $14 million to fourth quarter earnings and $23 million to adjusted EBITDA. For the full year, the segment generated $241 million of adjusted EBITDA, slightly more than our revised full year guidance. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $37 million lower than the third quarter due to timing of transactions. Similar to 2019, our Real Estate sales activity in 2020 was heavily weighted toward the first half of the year. Average price per acre was up significantly compared to the third quarter and the year ago quarter due to transaction mix. Fourth quarter 2020 included an unusually high proportion of high value, small parcel transactions. 
Wood products, Pages 12 and 13. Wood Products contributed $481 million to fourth quarter earnings and $530 million to adjusted EBITDA. I'm incredibly proud of our strong performance in Wood Products this year, despite significant operational disruptions and challenges from the pandemic. In 2020, our lumber and OSB businesses delivered the highest full year adjusted EBITDA on record. And our distribution business generated the highest adjusted EBITDA in over 15 years. 
In the fourth quarter, demand remained strong across our product lines, with robust new residential construction activity, a limited seasonal slowdown in repair and remodel and favorable weather conditions for construction. Benchmark lumber prices entered the quarter at record levels, but declined sharply through October, as repair and remodel activity began to ease and buyers limited replenishment in expectation of a seasonal slowdown in housing. As the quarter progressed, strong construction activity, lean inventories and concerns about COVID-related supply disruptions drove buyers to step back in and pricing improved through December. On average, the framing lumber composite decreased 9% in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter. 
OSB markets performed at a stronger pace, with pricing softening only modestly in late November and rebounding shortly thereafter. Average OSB composite pricing increased 18% compared with the third quarter. EBITDA for lumber decreased $109 million compared with the third quarter. Average sales realizations decreased by 10% and Western and Canadian log costs increased significantly. Sales volumes were comparable to the third quarter. 
OSB delivered a record $220 million of EBITDA during the fourth quarter, surpassing the prior record by $60 million, which was established just last quarter. Average sales realizations improved by 27%. Operating rates decreased compared with the third quarter. And unit manufacturing costs increased as we completed planned maintenance shutdowns at 4 of our OSB mills. 
Engineered wood products' EBITDA decreased by $21 million compared to the third quarter as a result of higher raw material costs, primarily for oriented strand board web stock. Average realizations for solid section and I-joists improved slightly as we began to capture the benefit of our third quarter price increases. 
In distribution, EBITDA decreased $13 million compared to the third quarter due to a modest seasonal reduction in sales volumes. Despite this reduction, our current distribution business established a new fourth quarter EBITDA record as demand remained above what is typical for this time of year. 
Now I'd like to turn to operational excellence. Our employees continued an unwavering commitment to OpEx despite a very challenging operating environment. In 2020, our teams delivered approximately $100 million of margin improvements, exceeding our $50 million to $70 million target, while also capturing meaningful opportunities to enhance future value, avoid future costs and improve efficiencies across our enterprise. 
In Timberlands, business -- our Timberlands business delivered $43 million of OpEx improvements in 2020, with notable contributions from initiatives to increase mechanized harvesting in the west, implement machine planting in the south and optimize our southern fertilization activity. The business also created significant future value through initiatives to reduce reforestation turnaround time, further enhanced seedling survival rates and improve data capture and analysis capabilities through expanded use of drones and LIDAR technology. 
Wood Products captured $50 million of OpEx enhancements through a continued focus on controllable costs, mill reliability and enhanced product mix. This enabled us to achieve multiple operating records and milestones despite fluctuating operating postures in response to the pandemic. 
For example, our lumber business achieved record low controllable manufacturing costs for the second consecutive year, and our OSB mills increased reliability and delivered record production volumes. The business has also avoided future costs through procurement and efficiency initiatives. In addition to these achievements, we captured $13 million of cross-business OpEx that improved margins in both Timberlands and Wood Products. Examples include an ongoing effort to ensure that every log we sell internally is routed to its most value-accretive mill, strategically flexing harvest volume to our internal mills to reduce out-of-log downtime. And flexing our wood products procurement to consume additional fee harvest logs during the pandemic-related market disruptions. 
As we look forward to 2021, we're targeting another $50 million to $75 million of OpEx improvements across our businesses. And I'm excited to see the creativity, innovation and collaboration that emerges as we continuously strive to deliver industry-leading operating performance across all business segments. 
I'll now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our first quarter outlook."

I'll begin our key financial items, which are summarized on pages 15 and 16. Cash from operations totaled $444 million for the fourth quarter and over $1.5 billion for the full year. This is our highest fourth qu",1938,"Thanks, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin our key financial items, which are summarized on pages 15 and 16. Cash from operations totaled $444 million for the fourth quarter and over $1.5 billion for the full year. This is our highest fourth quarter operating cash flow since 2007, and our strongest full year operating cash flow since 2005. We invested a portion of this cash back into our Timberlands and Wood Products businesses through capital expenditures, which totaled $281 million for the full year. Adjusted funds available for distribution, or FAD, for 2020, totaled $1.24 billion, as highlighted on Page 16. 
We used a significant portion of this year's adjusted FAD to reduce our debt outstanding. During the fourth quarter, we redeemed our $500 million 4 5/8% notes that were due September 2023. We incurred a $58 million pretax charge on the early extinguishment, which is included in our results as a special item. We ended the year with just under $5.5 billion of total debt outstanding, which is a reduction of approximately $900 million in 2020. 
This activity, in addition to strong 2020 EBITDA performance, has substantially improved our net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, which, at the end of 2020, was 2.3x compared to a high of 4.9x at the end of 2019. With this reduction, our leverage ratio is comfortably below our target of 3.5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA over the cycle. We also have cash earmark to repay our $150 million, 9% note when it matures in the fourth quarter of 2021. After repayment of this note, we will have no additional debt maturities until late 2023. 
In addition to improving our leverage, we returned over $380 million to shareholders during the year, which included reinitiating the dividend with a $0.17 per share base quarterly dividend, which was paid in the fourth quarter 2020. Overall, we ended the year in a strong financial position, with a sustainable dividend framework and a debt structure that is appropriate over the cycle and supports our solid investment-grade credit profile. 
Turning now to our key outlook items for the first quarter and full year 2021, which are summarized on Pages 17 and 18. In our Timberlands business, we expect first quarter net earnings and adjusted EBITDA to be slightly higher than the fourth quarter. In our Western Timberlands operations, we expect our first quarter domestic log sales volumes will be comparable to the fourth quarter. Domestic mill inventories ended the fourth quarter at moderate levels, and log demand in the West remains favorable due to strong lumber markets. We expect first quarter domestic average sales realizations will be slightly below the fourth quarter average. We anticipate the first quarter fee harvest volumes will be comparable with the fourth quarter. We also expect Western road spending will be lower compared to the fourth quarter as our roadwork activity slows during the winter months. 
We revised our 2021 Western harvest plan to focus Oregon salvage activities, and we currently anticipate salvage wood will comprise nearly half of the 2021 Western harvest volume. 
We'll be front-loading this activity as we are not currently experiencing any price erosion for our salvage logs. Additionally, unit log and haul costs are expected to increase slightly compared to the fourth quarter. The salvage activity results in lower efficiency and increased hauling distance to market. 
Moving to the export markets. In Japan, our first quarter average sales realizations and average sales volumes are expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter. Log demand remained strong as Japanese housing activity improved in the fourth quarter, and lumber imports to Japan remain limited. Chinese export log sales realizations and average log sales volumes are expected to be slightly higher in the first quarter. Demand remains solid, supported by an improving economy, government infrastructure spending and continued disruptions in the supply of log imports. 
In the South, we anticipate fee harvest volumes will be higher than fourth quarter following the conclusion of our 2020 harvest reductions. Additionally, we expect average log sales realizations will be comparable to the fourth quarter. In the North, average log sales realizations are expected to be comparable to fourth quarter, while fee harvest volumes are expected to be slightly lower. 
Turning to our full year harvest plan. For the full year 2021, we expect total company harvest volume will be approximately 34.5 million tons. We expect our southern harvest volumes will be up approximately 10%, and as we resume a more normalized level of activity following our 2020 pandemic-related harvest reductions. In the West, we expect our harvest volumes will be approximately 5% lower. This reflects the lower productivity on our salvage logging operations. We expect Northern harvest volumes to be moderately lower than 2020. This reflects the divestiture of our Montana Timberlands and softer demand for northern fiber logs. 
I'll wrap up the Timberlands segment with a few comments on our fourth quarter Oregon Timberlands transactions. As Devin indicated, fourth quarter included a gain of $182 million on the sale of 149,000 Southern Oregon acres, which was reported as a special item. We reported a cash inflow of $381 million related to this sale and a cash outflow of $425 million for the purchase of 85,000 acres in mid-coastal Oregon Timberlands. The net cash outflow for these 2 transactions was $44 million. 
Turning to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. Interest in our Real estate Properties remain strong. A shifting societal preferences during this time are driving robust demand for real recreational properties. We expect full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $255 million. And we anticipate the cadence of our 2021 real estate activity will be similar to our cadence in both 2019 and 2020. Land basis as a percentage of real estate sales is expected to be approximately 45% to 55% for the year. 
For the first quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA for this segment will be modestly lower than first quarter 2020 due to the timing of transactions. We expect net earnings, however, to be slightly higher than the first quarter 2020 due to mix. 
For our Wood Products segment, new residential construction activity carried forward from the fourth quarter at very favorable levels, and our builder and dealer customers are anticipating a strong first quarter. In repair and remodel markets, demand is expected to remain solid as rising home equity, continued work-from-home trends and an aging housing stock drive continued interest in home remodeling and upgrades. Channel inventories remain generally lean, with limited purchasing in advance of the spring building season. Excluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and oriented strand board, we expect first quarter adjusted EBITDA will be significantly higher than the fourth quarter. 
Production volumes within our OSB and engineered wood businesses are expected to increase during the quarter, following the completion of planned maintenance in the fourth quarter. We expect improved manufacturing costs across our product lines and slightly higher sales volumes, primarily for lumber and engineered wood products, while costs should be comparable to the fourth quarter. 
Entering the first quarter, benchmark pricing for oriented strand board reached a new peak in January, and the framing lumber composite is also at near-record levels. For lumber, our quarter-to-date average sales realizations are approximately $210 higher, and current realizations are approximately $250 higher than the fourth quarter average. For OSB, our quarter-to-date average sales realizations are approximately $55 higher, and our current sales realizations are approximately $70 higher than the fourth quarter average. 
As a reminder, for lumber, every $10 change in realizations is approximately $11 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis. And for OSB, every $10 change in realizations is approximately $8 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis. 
For engineered wood products average sales realizations for our solid section and I-joist products will be modestly higher as we capture the benefits of price increases announced in August 2020 and January 2021. 
Turning now to the major components of our unallocated items as summarized on Page 14. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $3 million lower than the third quarter, with unfavorable variances from elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and LIFO and the effects of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower variable compensation expense. The charge for the elimination of intersegment profit and inventory on LIFO was primarily driven by a seasonal increase in log inventories at the end of the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, when inventories were below normal levels. 
Moving to pension. In the fourth quarter, we completed the purchase of a group annuity contract, which transfers approximately $765 million of our U.S. pension liabilities to an insurance carrier. Contract purchase was funded from our U.S. pension plan assets, with no company cash contribution required. As a result of this transaction, fourth quarter special items included a $253 million noncash pretax settlement charge. The transaction is the latest in a series of actions taken to reduce our pension plan obligations. 
We have now settled nearly $3 billion since the beginning of these efforts in 2018. 
For our pension and post-employment plans, the year ended 2020 funded status decreased by approximately $200 million compared to 2019, driven primarily by lower discount rates. Discount rates decreased by approximately 90 basis points for the U.S. plans and approximately 60 basis points for the Canadian plans. Cash paid for pension and post-retirement plans in 2020 was $30 million. In 2021, we do not anticipate any cash contributions to our U.S. qualified plan. Our required cash payments for all other plans will be approximately $25 million. 
Excluding our fourth quarter settlement charge, our noncash, nonoperating pension and postretirement expense was $37 million in 2020. We expect to report approximately $35 million of expense in 2021. 
I'll wrap up with a few additional outlook items highlighted on Page 18. Our full year 2020 interest expense, before special items, was approximately $350 million. This excludes our early extinguishment of debt charges of $92 million. We expect interest expense will be $315 million for the full year 2021. 
Turning to capital expenditures. We expect total CapEx for 2021 will be approximately $420 million, which includes $115 million for Timberlands, inclusive of reforestation costs, $300 million for Wood Products and $5 million for planned corporate IT system investments. Wood Products' CapEx is increasing as we undertake some of the high-return capital projects deferred last year, and began a multiyear project to modernize our strategic hold in Louisiana sawmill. 
Similar to the highly successful rebuilds of our Dierks and Millport sawmills, this project will significantly reduce the mill's cost structure, enhance its product mix to better serve market demand and optimize the equipment to more efficiently process logs from our adjacent timberlands. These improvements will also result in approximately 100 million board feet of additional production capacity. This will begin ramping up in 2023 when the project is completed. 
Turning now to taxes. Our full year 2020 effective tax rate was 20%, excluding special items. For the first quarter and full year 2021, we expect our effective tax rate will be between 18% and 22% before special items based on the forecasted mix of earnings between our REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary. For cash taxes, we paid in net $76 million for the full year 2020. As previously discussed, we expect to receive a $90 million refund associated with our 2018 pension contribution in mid-2021. Excluding this refund, we expect our 2021 cash taxes will be generally comparable to our overall tax expense. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Devin, and I look forward to your questions."

In closing, I want to, again, thank our employees for their dedication, flexibility and adherence to our company values in 2020, despite being tested personally and professionally in ways that, frankly, weren't imaginable at this time last year. Notwithstanding these challenges, we achieved remarkable operating results, and I'm very pleased with the progress we made on numerous strategic initiatives. Looking forward, I'm excited by the opportunities in front of us this year. U.S. housing market has accelerated sharply, and we believe that strong macroeconomic and demand fundamentals will continue to support a favorable backdrop for our products. The potential for a federal stimulus package from the new administration could also drive incremental demand for our products. Our manufacturing facilities are operating with unprecedented reliability and an industry-leading cost structure. We have a strong balance sheet and a dividend framework that enables us to return meaningful cash to shareholders across market conditions. In mass timber and climate Solutions, including potential opportunities relating to carbon, present exciting new sources of future demand. 
Entering 2021, we're well positioned, and we remain steadfast in our pursuit to serve customers and create value for our shareholders through an unmatched portfolio of assets, industry-leading performance and disciplined capital allocation. And now I'd like to open up the floor for questions."

I'm just wondering, there seems to be some subregions of the South that are seeing real price tension and maybe some regions where prices seem challenged in the long term. I guess my question is, when we look sort of underneath the hood of that flat average price, is there any color you can give us on sort of the regional differences between what you're seeing maybe in your strongest submarket and weakest submarket? 
And then you upgraded the Oregon footprint last year. With your balance sheet where it is, is there maybe a kind of a parallel opportunity or a bigger opportunity to upgrade sort of the regional footprint in the south?"

Maybe I'll take that in a few different pieces. Just, at a high level, Anthony, you're right. We are still seeing issues in the south that really -- it goes back to the Great Recession with the oversupply that we've seen in a number of markets. As you note, that, obviously, differs somewhat by market. And it's always important to remember that supply and demand are very wood basket specific. 
Now as I would say, the good news is that we've seen a fair amount of new capacity coming into the South, about 6.5 billion board feet of new capacity over the last several years, some recent announcements on some new capacity. A couple of those are in wood baskets that should be very favorable to us, the [indiscernible] mill, Idaho Forest products mill in Mississippi. And we're expecting continued new capacity coming into the south in the coming years. 
When we think about the submarkets, a thing to remember is that our business has scale across all major markets. And this really allows us to take advantage of stronger markets, such as the Atlantic region, really from Florida up through North Carolina. We have about 1.2 million acres in total across those regions. We're also starting to see some improvements in certain markets and other regions, Southern Arkansas, Central Mississippi, North Central Louisiana, some areas of Georgia and Alabama. 
We're starting to see a little bit of tension in there that, I think, could continue to grow here over time. And then the other thing I would just mention is just the export markets in the South. As you know, back in 2018, we really had started ramping up our export programs primarily to China. With the tariff situation that came into play, we backed that off, but now the tariffs have come off. We've reaccelerated our export programs into China, picking up some India opportunities as well. So that's another area, frankly, for those regions that have proximity to a port, to tension that up over time. With respect to the optimization work that we did in Oregon, that's work that is ongoing all the time. That's true in the West. It's true in the South. We've been doing that for quite a while, frankly, with Russell's new role and some of the work they're doing. I would expect that, that work will continue and perhaps even accelerate going forward. But again, we're going to continue to look for ways to drive value across our portfolio, and that will include optimization work for sure, both in the South and the West."

As with the new administration, there are going to be some puts and takes, and we're watching that closely. Tax, regulatory policy, those are things that we look for really in any administration to see how that's going to impact our business. But I do think, as you noted, there are some real opportunities for us with the Biden Administration. You mentioned a couple of them. A more normalized trade environment where we can avoid tariffs into China will help us continue to accelerate our export programs into that market, which should be a positive. I think, on the immigration side, a little bit different policy, perhaps, could allow some additional labor, both into the homebuilder market, which is downstream for us, but also even in the forestry side. And I think that could be a benefit. 
The infrastructure plan, we'll see how that progresses. But to the extent that we got a significant infrastructure plan through Congress, that's something that could spur some additional demand for our products. 
And then I think the big thing is really just around the environmental policies that come out of the administration around global warming and climate change. And that's certainly something that, I think, will find its way into every aspect of policy under the new administration. And I think that's something that could have some incrementally positive benefits for us. Since that falls squarely within Russell's new responsibilities, maybe I'll ask Russell, anything you want to mention specifically on the carbon side?"

I mean, clearly, the Biden Administration is going to focus on climate change, and we're seeing some of the policy specific to carbon, starting to get framed up and discussed. The early actions that they've taken demonstrates that this is going to be a focal point for them. So I would say at a federal level, I don't -- I'd be surprised if we saw a carbon tax or cap and trade type structure. I just don't think the political will is there to pull something off like that. But I do think we'll see policies supporting climate change mitigation across all the federal agencies. And that could come in the form of purchasing preferences for wood-based building because of the environmental benefits of that, solutions aimed at forest health and then recognizing the benefits of carbon stored in wood. And so I think those are all very positive, not only for Weyerhaeuser, but for the industry as a whole. 
So again, as they continue to focus on this area, we'll see more innovation, and we'll see markets continue to mature. And I think that's beneficial, again, for the industry and for Weyerhaeuser, in particular."

I wanted to start with a top-down question for you related to housing and kind of the ultimate impact on demand. So you enumerated a number of things, demographics, the move towards larger single-family homes and these sorts of things. I would also imagine a benefit to housing would be hopefully improved employment and wages for that matter, too. That said, some of our contacts are beginning to get a little bit worried about affordability based on rates moving higher and home prices moving up even more quickly. So I acknowledge that the answer is probably going to be all of the above, but of the things that you talked about in your opening comments, what gives you the most confidence that housing can continue to move higher? What gives your customers that confidence, given what's been a little bit of a spike in the wrong way in terms of affordability?"

And I think you note the affordability piece is going to be a headwind. There's no question about that. In terms of just the confidence, though, around the building environment right now, it just -- it starts with overwhelming demand for homes. There is virtually no existing home inventory for sale at present. The new home inventory for sale is pretty low. And I think we've just hit a point where, whether it's specific to COVID or whether it's just the demographic trends have finally reached that inflection point, there's just a significant amount of demand in really all markets that we participate for more housing. And the builders are really -- they're confident that they're going to have a lot of building activity this year. 
Certainly, I think to the extent that interest rates can stay relatively low in the near term, which seems to be the federal policy at present, that will be supportive. But in any event, it goes back to some of the things we've been talking about for years, which is, we've been massively underbuilding in the United States for over a decade. We need to build millions of homes over and above just kind of keeping pace with normal demand just to get back to even. 
So I think there are a lot of tailwinds to support that, but you're exactly right. The affordability piece is the one that is going to have to be solved. But, in the near term, at least for 2021, we're feeling pretty positive about the construction setup for this year."

It's going to allow us to improve the product mix from the mill. We've got a great employee base there. So we're really excited about this. I think this is going to be along the lines of our Dierks and Millport mill in terms of just really a very low-cost, highly efficient mill that's going to make some great lumber over time. 
In terms of the ability to flex up for additional volume in the near term, we are very focused on improving mill reliability across our footprint. And that comes into play in a number of different instances. And a good example of that, right? Is on the OSB side, where we hit a production volume record in 2020, notwithstanding the fact that we took a fair amount of downtime in the spring. And so those reliability improvements will provide extra volume across the system. And that's equally true from a lumber and an EWP standpoint. So there's going to be some volume creep that comes through that. And we're continuing to invest back in our mills across the system as part of our CapEx program. But what I would note is that those capital programs are largely focused on reducing costs, improving reliability and driving efficiencies in the system as opposed to being directly focused at increasing our volumes. And so that's a long-winded way of saying, we are adding another 100 million of volume from our holding project, continuing to ramp up Millport, so maybe another 50 million to 60 million board feet coming off of Millport this year. And then just some additional flex from continuing to run our mills well, at least that's the answer here in the short term."

As we've indicated with our new dividend framework, the plan is to return 75% to 80% of our 2021 FAD back to shareholders, both through the base dividend and then, ultimately, the supplemental dividend. 
And any cash flow over and above that 75% to 80% of FAD would be available for growth, further debt paydown or, under the right circumstances, share repurchase. And so we'll continue to look at those opportunistically and allocate the cash to those opportunities that create the most long-term value for shareholders. And I would say Timberland's growth opportunities are an area that I would expect we'll continue to look closely at, both from just an optimization standpoint and growth more generally. But obviously, that's something that's dependent on finding the right deals that are accretive and strategic. And so we're going to continue to be very disciplined in that respect. 
In terms of a potential interim supplemental dividend this year, as we mentioned, the new framework really anticipates that supplemental dividend is going to pay -- be paid out annually in Q1 for the prior year. And really, the reason for that is just to make sure that we're matching our variable dividend component to the cash flow that we're generating for the year. So generally, we're anticipating that, that first supplemental dividend would be paid in the first quarter of 2022 based on the 2021 cash flow. Now look, if things go really well, could there be a situation where we would consider some sort of interim supplemental dividend later in the year? Certainly, that's conceivable. I wouldn't shut the door on that definitively. But again, we're expecting that to be paid out annually in Q1 under most circumstances."

The BFS-BMC merger, both of those businesses have been long-standing customers of Weyerhaeuser. We've had really good working relationships with both of these firms. Dave Flitman has put together a strong team from the combined firm. And I anticipate we'll continue to have a great relationship with BFS going forward. And we'll work with them as we always have, to help find ways to create value in their supply chain and for their customers. 
I think, just on consolidation, generally, I'm sure that there are still some opportunities out there in the market for companies to create value for their stakeholders through consolidation. Timing specifics, those things are always hard to predict, but I wouldn't be surprised if there's continued consolidation in the markets."

With this level of housing activity, just as a general statement, the western market is, by far, the most tension market in the United States. And a big driver of what kept log pricing down for really all of 2019",330,"Yes. So I think the short answer is, yes. With this level of housing activity, just as a general statement, the western market is, by far, the most tension market in the United States. And a big driver of what kept log pricing down for really all of 2019 and a portion of 2020 was depressed lumber prices. And so what we've historically seen, at least in the recent past, is much of the benefit of lumber prices increasing will go back to the woods in the form of log pricing. But obviously, people are not going to pay more for logs that caused them to be cash flow negative. And so when you have low lumber prices, that does put some restrictions on your ability to increase log prices. 
But as we continue to see lumber prices stay at healthy levels, the tension in the market will remain. Certainly, we've seen strong export markets. Coming out of Q4 into Q1, we expect that to continue. That's a japan statement. That's a China statement. So the market tension is there. It's really just a function of what lumber prices are doing. 
The only caveat to that, Mark, is just, there will be a dynamic going on in portions of Oregon this year as landowners work through their salvage volumes. And so one of the things that we're seeing here, probably in the near term, is that, as all of the landowners, ourselves included, are working through salvage activity, what that typically means is that you're harvesting some stands that are younger than you would normally harvest. And so as we're out and we're harvesting stands that are in the low 30s as opposed to 40 to 45, we are going to see more chip and saw really going into that market. So that may have a little bit of a depressive effect here for a portion of 2021. But overall, the wood basket in Washington and Oregon remains fairly tensioned."

But on a year-to-year basis, we're looking at what's going on in the markets, and we're really trying to maximize the value of our timberlands over time. 
And so as we think about 2021, as Russell mentioned, we are a little heavier to fiber in the South, and that's really catching up on some thinning backlog, which is really important from a silvicultural perspective, and we need to do that. But obviously, that does put a little bit more pulpwood into the market, and you don't get as many tons from thinning as you do from clear cutting.

On the Wood Products side, I think we like the assets that we have. And so I wouldn't anticipate big portfolio changes necessarily on the Wood Products' side. If we found a mill here or there, sort of a small bolt-on acquisition in the Wood Products space, we would look at that if the price is right and it's in the right locale. But in terms of large acquisitions on the Wood Products' side, I'd say that's not currently our focus.

Adjusted EBITDA was $2.2 billion, more than 70% increase over full year 2019 and the highest EBITDA performance in nearly 15 years. For the fourth quarter, we reported GAAP earnings of $292 million or $0.39 per diluted share, on net sales of $2.1 billion. Excluding net after-tax charges of $69 million for special items, we earned $361 million or $0.48 per diluted share for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $657 million, or more than 150% higher than fourth quarter 2019. 
I'd like to open this morning by expressing my sincere gratitude to our employees for their exceptional performance, dedication, resiliency and flexibility in 2020. Our people maintained a safety focus, continued to serve our customers and delivered strong results in the face of unprecedented operating and market challenges. All of our businesses executed exceptionally well, further strengthening our unrivaled portfolio of assets, improving our industry-leading operating performance and positioning the company to drive superior long-term value for shareholders. 
I'm extremely proud of our accomplishments in 2020, which included: delivering a record-breaking $1.5 billion of adjusted EBITDA from our Wood Products segment, a more than $1 billion increase over 2019; capturing approximately $100 million of company-wide operational excellence improvements, significantly exceeding our annual target; achieving record low controllable manufacturing costs in our lumber operations; strategically upgrading our Oregon Timberland Holdings; reducing gross debt by more than $900 million; introducing a new dividend framework that is sustainable across market cycles; reducing employee and contractor serious injuries by over 50%; and launching a new sustainability strategy. 
Before I discuss fourth quarter business results, let me first make some comments on the housing market. U.S. housing activity continued its torrid pace throughout the fourth quarter, with no seasonal slowdown in building activity. Total U.S. housing starts averaged 1.6 million units for the fourth quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis, an improvement of 11% over the third quarter. 
Single-family starts were the primary catalyst, improving nearly 20% quarter-over-quarter. Single-family now represents approximately 80% of new residential construction activity compared with 66% one year ago. Additionally, housing permits have surged to the highest level since before the Great Recession, reaching a seasonally adjusted 1.7 million units in December. 
As we progress into 2021, we expect numerous macroeconomic tailwinds will continue to drive favorable U.S. housing activity, including a post-COVID preference for larger single-family homes, supported by ongoing work-from-home flexibility, mortgage interest rates near record lows, strong homebuilder confidence, record low inventory for existing home sales, demographic trends that support growing millennial homeownership while older adults are deciding to age in place, and the possibility of a federal tax credit for first-time homebuyers under the Biden administration. 
U.S. homebuilders are seeing strong demand in January, with months of backlog, and this supports what we are hearing anecdotally from our customers. 
Certain cautionary headwinds are worth noting, most notably, constraints relating to building materials as well as lot and labor availability challenges for homebuilders. However, the housing backdrop appears increasingly favorable, and we anticipate 1.45 million housing starts in 2021, primarily driven by continued strength in single-family activity. With an aging housing stock, rising home equity and low interest rates, we expect repair and remodel activity will also remain strong in 2021. Collectively, we expect these positive housing dynamics to be a tailwind for our businesses over the next several years. 
Turning now to our fourth quarter business results. I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands on Pages 7 through 9 of our earnings slides. Timberlands' adjusted EBITDA increased by $37 million compared to the third quarter. Earnings increased by $297 million, which included a $182 million gain on the previously announced sale of certain Southern Oregon Timberlands. Western Timberlands' adjusted EBITDA increased $30 million compared with the third quarter, primarily due to higher average sales realizations for domestic and Japan export logs. 
In the western domestic market, demand remained favorable throughout the quarter as mills sought to take advantage of strong lumber prices and replenish lean inventory positions following the severe fire season. Log markets were tight to start the quarter, particularly in Oregon, where some harvest operations were slow to come online as landowners prepared for salvage activity. As salvage operations commenced, log supply improved and pricing for smaller diameter logs softened, primarily in markets with significant salvage activity. 
Our fee harvest volume increased by 9% compared with the third quarter as we fully resumed harvest operations and initiated salvage activity on our affected Timberlands in Oregon. We are not experiencing any downgrades and realizations on our salvage logs. Log and haul costs increased modestly during the fourth quarter due to higher safety and operational requirements, moderately lower yields and increased hauling distances to market, all associated with salvage logging activity in Oregon. 
Turning to our export markets. In Japan, demand for our logs strengthened through the fourth quarter as housing activity improved and robust U.S. domestic lumber markets reduced the availability of imported lumber. Our Japanese log sales volumes and realizations increased significantly compared with the third quarter. Similar to Japan, the market for U.S. logs strengthened in China in the fourth quarter as container availability reduced the supply of European salvage and Australian imports were restricted due to pest issues. Our sales volumes to China increased significantly over the third quarter and average realizations increased slightly. 
Moving to the South. Southern Timberlands' adjusted EBITDA increased $2 million compared with the third quarter. Southern sawlog markets improved modestly in the fourth quarter, as strong lumber and panel pricing drove steady demand and wet weather limited log supply in some Atlantic Coast markets. Fiber markets in most areas softened slightly as seasonal maintenance outages reduced demand, although the Atlantic markets remained more tensioned due to limited log availability. 
Our fee harvest volume was slightly lower in the third -- slightly lower than the third quarter as we completed less spending activity due to the unusually wet October weather. Average sales realizations were comparable to the third quarter as improved realizations for sawlogs were offset by slightly lower fiber log realizations. Northern Timberlands' adjusted EBITDA increased $2 million compared with the third quarter, partially due to slightly higher sales realizations for hardwood logs. 
Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources, Pages 10 and 11. Real Estate and E&R contributed $14 million to fourth quarter earnings and $23 million to adjusted EBITDA. For the full year, the segment generated $241 million of adjusted EBITDA, slightly more than our revised full year guidance. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $37 million lower than the third quarter due to timing of transactions. Similar to 2019, our Real Estate sales activity in 2020 was heavily weighted toward the first half of the year. Average price per acre was up significantly compared to the third quarter and the year ago quarter due to transaction mix. Fourth quarter 2020 included an unusually high proportion of high value, small parcel transactions. 
Wood products, Pages 12 and 13. Wood Products contributed $481 million to fourth quarter earnings and $530 million to adjusted EBITDA. I'm incredibly proud of our strong performance in Wood Products this year, despite significant operational disruptions and challenges from the pandemic. In 2020, our lumber and OSB businesses delivered the highest full year adjusted EBITDA on record. And our distribution business generated the highest adjusted EBITDA in over 15 years. 
In the fourth quarter, demand remained strong across our product lines, with robust new residential construction activity, a limited seasonal slowdown in repair and remodel and favorable weather conditions for construction. Benchmark lumber prices entered the quarter at record levels, but declined sharply through October, as repair and remodel activity began to ease and buyers limited replenishment in expectation of a seasonal slowdown in housing. As the quarter progressed, strong construction activity, lean inventories and concerns about COVID-related supply disruptions drove buyers to step back in and pricing improved through December. On average, the framing lumber composite decreased 9% in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter. 
OSB markets performed at a stronger pace, with pricing softening only modestly in late November and rebounding shortly thereafter. Average OSB composite pricing increased 18% compared with the third quarter. EBITDA for lumber decreased $109 million compared with the third quarter. Average sales realizations decreased by 10% and Western and Canadian log costs increased significantly. Sales volumes were comparable to the third quarter. 
OSB delivered a record $220 million of EBITDA during the fourth quarter, surpassing the prior record by $60 million, which was established just last quarter. Average sales realizations improved by 27%. Operating rates decreased compared with the third quarter. And unit manufacturing costs increased as we completed planned maintenance shutdowns at 4 of our OSB mills. 
Engineered wood products' EBITDA decreased by $21 million compared to the third quarter as a result of higher raw material costs, primarily for oriented strand board web stock. Average realizations for solid section and I-joists improved slightly as we began to capture the benefit of our third quarter price increases. 
In distribution, EBITDA decreased $13 million compared to the third quarter due to a modest seasonal reduction in sales volumes. Despite this reduction, our current distribution business established a new fourth quarter EBITDA record as demand remained above what is typical for this time of year. 
Now I'd like to turn to operational excellence. Our employees continued an unwavering commitment to OpEx despite a very challenging operating environment. In 2020, our teams delivered approximately $100 million of margin improvements, exceeding our $50 million to $70 million target, while also capturing meaningful opportunities to enhance future value, avoid future costs and improve efficiencies across our enterprise. 
In Timberlands, business -- our Timberlands business delivered $43 million of OpEx improvements in 2020, with notable contributions from initiatives to increase mechanized harvesting in the west, implement machine planting in the south and optimize our southern fertilization activity. The business also created significant future value through initiatives to reduce reforestation turnaround time, further enhanced seedling survival rates and improve data capture and analysis capabilities through expanded use of drones and LIDAR technology. 
Wood Products captured $50 million of OpEx enhancements through a continued focus on controllable costs, mill reliability and enhanced product mix. This enabled us to achieve multiple operating records and milestones despite fluctuating operating postures in response to the pandemic. 
For example, our lumber business achieved record low controllable manufacturing costs for the second consecutive year, and our OSB mills increased reliability and delivered record production volumes. The business has also avoided future costs through procurement and efficiency initiatives. In addition to these achievements, we captured $13 million of cross-business OpEx that improved margins in both Timberlands and Wood Products. Examples include an ongoing effort to ensure that every log we sell internally is routed to its most value-accretive mill, strategically flexing harvest volume to our internal mills to reduce out-of-log downtime. And flexing our wood products procurement to consume additional fee harvest logs during the pandemic-related market disruptions. 
As we look forward to 2021, we're targeting another $50 million to $75 million of OpEx improvements across our businesses. And I'm excited to see the creativity, innovation and collaboration that emerges as we continuously strive to deliver industry-leading operating performance across all business segments. 
I'll now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our first quarter outlook."
107633,699656368,2254813,"Weyerhaeuser Company, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2021",2021-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Weyerhaeuser Company","Executives","Thanks, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin our key financial items, which are summarized on pages 15 and 16. Cash from operations totaled $444 million for the fourth quarter and over $1.5 billion for the full year. This is our highest fourth qu",1938,"Thanks, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin our key financial items, which are summarized on pages 15 and 16. Cash from operations totaled $444 million for the fourth quarter and over $1.5 billion for the full year. This is our highest fourth quarter operating cash flow since 2007, and our strongest full year operating cash flow since 2005. We invested a portion of this cash back into our Timberlands and Wood Products businesses through capital expenditures, which totaled $281 million for the full year. Adjusted funds available for distribution, or FAD, for 2020, totaled $1.24 billion, as highlighted on Page 16. 
We used a significant portion of this year's adjusted FAD to reduce our debt outstanding. During the fourth quarter, we redeemed our $500 million 4 5/8% notes that were due September 2023. We incurred a $58 million pretax charge on the early extinguishment, which is included in our results as a special item. We ended the year with just under $5.5 billion of total debt outstanding, which is a reduction of approximately $900 million in 2020. 
This activity, in addition to strong 2020 EBITDA performance, has substantially improved our net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, which, at the end of 2020, was 2.3x compared to a high of 4.9x at the end of 2019. With this reduction, our leverage ratio is comfortably below our target of 3.5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA over the cycle. We also have cash earmark to repay our $150 million, 9% note when it matures in the fourth quarter of 2021. After repayment of this note, we will have no additional debt maturities until late 2023. 
In addition to improving our leverage, we returned over $380 million to shareholders during the year, which included reinitiating the dividend with a $0.17 per share base quarterly dividend, which was paid in the fourth quarter 2020. Overall, we ended the year in a strong financial position, with a sustainable dividend framework and a debt structure that is appropriate over the cycle and supports our solid investment-grade credit profile. 
Turning now to our key outlook items for the first quarter and full year 2021, which are summarized on Pages 17 and 18. In our Timberlands business, we expect first quarter net earnings and adjusted EBITDA to be slightly higher than the fourth quarter. In our Western Timberlands operations, we expect our first quarter domestic log sales volumes will be comparable to the fourth quarter. Domestic mill inventories ended the fourth quarter at moderate levels, and log demand in the West remains favorable due to strong lumber markets. We expect first quarter domestic average sales realizations will be slightly below the fourth quarter average. We anticipate the first quarter fee harvest volumes will be comparable with the fourth quarter. We also expect Western road spending will be lower compared to the fourth quarter as our roadwork activity slows during the winter months. 
We revised our 2021 Western harvest plan to focus Oregon salvage activities, and we currently anticipate salvage wood will comprise nearly half of the 2021 Western harvest volume. 
We'll be front-loading this activity as we are not currently experiencing any price erosion for our salvage logs. Additionally, unit log and haul costs are expected to increase slightly compared to the fourth quarter. The salvage activity results in lower efficiency and increased hauling distance to market. 
Moving to the export markets. In Japan, our first quarter average sales realizations and average sales volumes are expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter. Log demand remained strong as Japanese housing activity improved in the fourth quarter, and lumber imports to Japan remain limited. Chinese export log sales realizations and average log sales volumes are expected to be slightly higher in the first quarter. Demand remains solid, supported by an improving economy, government infrastructure spending and continued disruptions in the supply of log imports. 
In the South, we anticipate fee harvest volumes will be higher than fourth quarter following the conclusion of our 2020 harvest reductions. Additionally, we expect average log sales realizations will be comparable to the fourth quarter. In the North, average log sales realizations are expected to be comparable to fourth quarter, while fee harvest volumes are expected to be slightly lower. 
Turning to our full year harvest plan. For the full year 2021, we expect total company harvest volume will be approximately 34.5 million tons. We expect our southern harvest volumes will be up approximately 10%, and as we resume a more normalized level of activity following our 2020 pandemic-related harvest reductions. In the West, we expect our harvest volumes will be approximately 5% lower. This reflects the lower productivity on our salvage logging operations. We expect Northern harvest volumes to be moderately lower than 2020. This reflects the divestiture of our Montana Timberlands and softer demand for northern fiber logs. 
I'll wrap up the Timberlands segment with a few comments on our fourth quarter Oregon Timberlands transactions. As Devin indicated, fourth quarter included a gain of $182 million on the sale of 149,000 Southern Oregon acres, which was reported as a special item. We reported a cash inflow of $381 million related to this sale and a cash outflow of $425 million for the purchase of 85,000 acres in mid-coastal Oregon Timberlands. The net cash outflow for these 2 transactions was $44 million. 
Turning to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. Interest in our Real estate Properties remain strong. A shifting societal preferences during this time are driving robust demand for real recreational properties. We expect full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $255 million. And we anticipate the cadence of our 2021 real estate activity will be similar to our cadence in both 2019 and 2020. Land basis as a percentage of real estate sales is expected to be approximately 45% to 55% for the year. 
For the first quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA for this segment will be modestly lower than first quarter 2020 due to the timing of transactions. We expect net earnings, however, to be slightly higher than the first quarter 2020 due to mix. 
For our Wood Products segment, new residential construction activity carried forward from the fourth quarter at very favorable levels, and our builder and dealer customers are anticipating a strong first quarter. In repair and remodel markets, demand is expected to remain solid as rising home equity, continued work-from-home trends and an aging housing stock drive continued interest in home remodeling and upgrades. Channel inventories remain generally lean, with limited purchasing in advance of the spring building season. Excluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and oriented strand board, we expect first quarter adjusted EBITDA will be significantly higher than the fourth quarter. 
Production volumes within our OSB and engineered wood businesses are expected to increase during the quarter, following the completion of planned maintenance in the fourth quarter. We expect improved manufacturing costs across our product lines and slightly higher sales volumes, primarily for lumber and engineered wood products, while costs should be comparable to the fourth quarter. 
Entering the first quarter, benchmark pricing for oriented strand board reached a new peak in January, and the framing lumber composite is also at near-record levels. For lumber, our quarter-to-date average sales realizations are approximately $210 higher, and current realizations are approximately $250 higher than the fourth quarter average. For OSB, our quarter-to-date average sales realizations are approximately $55 higher, and our current sales realizations are approximately $70 higher than the fourth quarter average. 
As a reminder, for lumber, every $10 change in realizations is approximately $11 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis. And for OSB, every $10 change in realizations is approximately $8 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis. 
For engineered wood products average sales realizations for our solid section and I-joist products will be modestly higher as we capture the benefits of price increases announced in August 2020 and January 2021. 
Turning now to the major components of our unallocated items as summarized on Page 14. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $3 million lower than the third quarter, with unfavorable variances from elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and LIFO and the effects of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower variable compensation expense. The charge for the elimination of intersegment profit and inventory on LIFO was primarily driven by a seasonal increase in log inventories at the end of the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, when inventories were below normal levels. 
Moving to pension. In the fourth quarter, we completed the purchase of a group annuity contract, which transfers approximately $765 million of our U.S. pension liabilities to an insurance carrier. Contract purchase was funded from our U.S. pension plan assets, with no company cash contribution required. As a result of this transaction, fourth quarter special items included a $253 million noncash pretax settlement charge. The transaction is the latest in a series of actions taken to reduce our pension plan obligations. 
We have now settled nearly $3 billion since the beginning of these efforts in 2018. 
For our pension and post-employment plans, the year ended 2020 funded status decreased by approximately $200 million compared to 2019, driven primarily by lower discount rates. Discount rates decreased by approximately 90 basis points for the U.S. plans and approximately 60 basis points for the Canadian plans. Cash paid for pension and post-retirement plans in 2020 was $30 million. In 2021, we do not anticipate any cash contributions to our U.S. qualified plan. Our required cash payments for all other plans will be approximately $25 million. 
Excluding our fourth quarter settlement charge, our noncash, nonoperating pension and postretirement expense was $37 million in 2020. We expect to report approximately $35 million of expense in 2021. 
I'll wrap up with a few additional outlook items highlighted on Page 18. Our full year 2020 interest expense, before special items, was approximately $350 million. This excludes our early extinguishment of debt charges of $92 million. We expect interest expense will be $315 million for the full year 2021. 
Turning to capital expenditures. We expect total CapEx for 2021 will be approximately $420 million, which includes $115 million for Timberlands, inclusive of reforestation costs, $300 million for Wood Products and $5 million for planned corporate IT system investments. Wood Products' CapEx is increasing as we undertake some of the high-return capital projects deferred last year, and began a multiyear project to modernize our strategic hold in Louisiana sawmill. 
Similar to the highly successful rebuilds of our Dierks and Millport sawmills, this project will significantly reduce the mill's cost structure, enhance its product mix to better serve market demand and optimize the equipment to more efficiently process logs from our adjacent timberlands. These improvements will also result in approximately 100 million board feet of additional production capacity. This will begin ramping up in 2023 when the project is completed. 
Turning now to taxes. Our full year 2020 effective tax rate was 20%, excluding special items. For the first quarter and full year 2021, we expect our effective tax rate will be between 18% and 22% before special items based on the forecasted mix of earnings between our REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary. For cash taxes, we paid in net $76 million for the full year 2020. As previously discussed, we expect to receive a $90 million refund associated with our 2018 pension contribution in mid-2021. Excluding this refund, we expect our 2021 cash taxes will be generally comparable to our overall tax expense. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Devin, and I look forward to your questions."

In closing, I want to, again, thank our employees for their dedication, flexibility and adherence to our company values in 2020, despite being tested personally and professionally in ways that, frankly, weren't imaginable at this time last year. Notwithstanding these challenges, we achieved remarkable operating results, and I'm very pleased with the progress we made on numerous strategic initiatives. Looking forward, I'm excited by the opportunities in front of us this year. U.S. housing market has accelerated sharply, and we believe that strong macroeconomic and demand fundamentals will continue to support a favorable backdrop for our products.
The potential for a federal stimulus package from the new administration could also drive incremental demand for our products. Our manufacturing facilities are operating with unprecedented reliability and an industry-leading cost structure. We have a strong balance sheet and a dividend framework that enables us to return meaningful cash to shareholders across market conditions. In mass timber and climate Solutions, including potential opportunities relating to carbon, present exciting new sources of future demand. 
Entering 2021, we're well positioned, and we remain steadfast in our pursuit to serve customers and create value for our shareholders through an unmatched portfolio of assets, industry-leading performance and disciplined capital allocation. And now I'd like to open up the floor for questions."

I'm just wondering, there seems to be some subregions of the South that are seeing real price tension and maybe some regions where prices seem challenged in the long term. I guess my question is, when we look sort of underneath the hood of that flat average price, is there any color you can give us on sort of the regional differences between what you're seeing maybe in your strongest submarket and weakest submarket? 
And then you upgraded the Oregon footprint last year. With your balance sheet where it is, is there maybe a kind of a parallel opportunity or a bigger opportunity to upgrade sort of the regional footprint in the south?"
107633,699656368,2254813,"Weyerhaeuser Company, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2021",2021-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Weyerhaeuser Company","Executives","Yes.

We are still seeing issues in the south that really -- it goes back to the Great Recession with the oversupply that we've seen in a number of markets. As yo",434,"Yes. Maybe I'll take that in a few different pieces. Just, at a high level, Anthony, you're right. We are still seeing issues in the south that really -- it goes back to the Great Recession with the oversupply that we've seen in a number of markets. As you note, that, obviously, differs somewhat by market. And it's always important to remember that supply and demand are very wood basket specific. 
Now as I would say, the good news is that we've seen a fair amount of new capacity coming into the South, about 6.5 billion board feet of new capacity over the last several years, some recent announcements on some new capacity. A couple of those are in wood baskets that should be very favorable to us, the [indiscernible] mill, Idaho Forest products mill in Mississippi. And we're expecting continued new capacity coming into the south in the coming years. 
When we think about the submarkets, a thing to remember is that our business has scale across all major markets. And this really allows us to take advantage of stronger markets, such as the Atlantic region, really from Florida up through North Carolina. We have about 1.2 million acres in total across those regions. We're also starting to see some improvements in certain markets and other regions, Southern Arkansas, Central Mississippi, North Central Louisiana, some areas of Georgia and Alabama. 
We're starting to see a little bit of tension in there that, I think, could continue to grow here over time. And then the other thing I would just mention is just the export markets in the South. As you know, back in 2018, we really had started ramping up our export programs primarily to China. With the tariff situation that came into play, we backed that off, but now the tariffs have come off. We've reaccelerated our export programs into China, picking up some India opportunities as well. So that's another area, frankly, for those regions that have proximity to a port, to tension that up over time. With respect to the optimization work that we did in Oregon, that's work that is ongoing all the time. That's true in the West. It's true in the South. We've been doing that for quite a while, frankly, with Russell's new role and some of the work they're doing. I would expect that, that work will continue and perhaps even accelerate going forward. But again, we're going to continue to look for ways to drive value across our portfolio, and that will include optimization work for sure, both in the South and the West."

As with the new administration, there are going to be some puts and takes, and we're watching that closely. Tax, regulatory policy, those are things that we look for really in any administration to see how that's going to impact our business. But I do think, as you noted, there are some real opportunities for us with the Biden Administration. You mentioned a couple of them. A more normalized trade environment where we can avoid tariffs into China will help us continue to accelerate our export programs into that market, which should be a positive. I think, on the immigration side, a little bit different policy, perhaps, could allow some additional labor, both into the homebuilder market, which is downstream for us, but also even in the forestry side. And I think that could be a benefit. 
The infrastructure plan, we'll see how that progresses. But to the extent that we got a significant infrastructure plan through Congress, that's something that could spur some additional demand for our products. 
And then I think the big thing is really just around the environmental policies that come out of the administration around global warming and climate change. And that's certainly something that, I think, will find its way into every aspect of policy under the new administration. And I think that's something that could have some incrementally positive benefits for us. Since that falls squarely within Russell's new responsibilities, maybe I'll ask Russell, anything you want to mention specifically on the carbon side?"

I mean, clearly, the Biden Administration is going to focus on climate change, and we're seeing some of the policy specific to carbon, starting to get framed up and discussed. The early actions that they've taken demonstrates that this is going to be a focal point for them. So I would say at a federal level, I don't -- I'd be surprised if we saw a carbon tax or cap and trade type structure. I just don't think the political will is there to pull something off like that. But I do think we'll see policies supporting climate change mitigation across all the federal agencies. And that could come in the form of purchasing preferences for wood-based building because of the environmental benefits of that, solutions aimed at forest health and then recognizing the benefits of carbon stored in wood. And so I think those are all very positive, not only for Weyerhaeuser, but for the industry as a whole. 
So again, as they continue to focus on this area, we'll see more innovation, and we'll see markets continue to mature. And I think that's beneficial, again, for the industry and for Weyerhaeuser, in particular."

I wanted to start with a top-down question for you related to housing and kind of the ultimate impact on demand. So you enumerated a number of things, demographics, the move towards larger single-family homes and these sorts of things. I would also imagine a benefit to housing would be hopefully improved employment and wages for that matter, too. That said, some of our contacts are beginning to get a little bit worried about affordability based on rates moving higher and home prices moving up even more quickly. So I acknowledge that the answer is probably going to be all of the above, but of the things that you talked about in your opening comments, what gives you the most confidence that housing can continue to move higher? What gives your customers that confidence, given what's been a little bit of a spike in the wrong way in terms of affordability?"

And I think you note the affordability piece is going to be a headwind. There's no question about that. In terms of just the confidence, though, around the building environment right now, it just -- it starts with overwhelming demand for homes. There is virtually no existing home inventory for sale at present. The new home inventory for sale is pretty low. And I think we've just hit a point where, whether it's specific to COVID or whether it's just the demographic trends have finally reached that inflection point, there's just a significant amount of demand in really all markets that we participate for more housing. And the builders are really -- they're confident that they're going to have a lot of building activity this year. 
Certainly, I think to the extent that interest rates can stay relatively low in the near term, which seems to be the federal policy at present, that will be supportive. But in any event, it goes back to some of the things we've been talking about for years, which is, we've been massively underbuilding in the United States for over a decade. We need to build millions of homes over and above just kind of keeping pace with normal demand just to get back to even. 
So I think there are a lot of tailwinds to support that, but you're exactly right. The affordability piece is the one that is going to have to be solved. But, in the near term, at least for 2021, we're feeling pretty positive about the construction setup for this year."

In terms of the ability to flex up for additional volume in the near term, we are very focused on improving mill reliability across our footprint. And that comes into play in a number of different instances. And a good example of that, right? Is on the OSB side, where we hit a production volume record in 2020, notwithstanding the fact that we took a fair amount of downtime in the spring. And so those reliability improvements will provide extra volume across the system. And that's equally true from a lumber and an EWP standpoint. So there's going to be some volume creep that comes through that. And we're continuing to invest back in our mills across the system as part of our CapEx program.
But what I would note is that those capital programs are largely focused on reducing costs, improving reliability and driving efficiencies in the system as opposed to being directly focused at increasing our volumes. And so that's a long-winded way of saying, we are adding another 100 million of volume from our holding project, continuing to ramp up Millport, so maybe another 50 million to 60 million board feet coming off of Millport this year. And then just some additional flex from continuing to run our mills well, at least that's the answer here in the short term."

And if that plays out, like you say, we're going to generate some very strong cash flow. As we've indicated with our new dividend framework, the plan is to return 75% to 80% of our 2021 FAD back to shareholders, both through the base dividend and then, ultimately, the supplemental dividend. 
And any cash flow over and above that 75% to 80% of FAD would be available for growth, further debt paydown or, under the right circumstances, share repurchase. And so we'll continue to look at those opportunistically and allocate the cash to those opportunities that create the most long-term value for shareholders. And I would say Timberland's growth opportunities are an area that I would expect we'll continue to look closely at, both from just an optimization standpoint and growth more generally. But obviously, that's something that's dependent on finding the right deals that are accretive and strategic. And so we're going to continue to be very disciplined in that respect. 
In terms of a potential interim supplemental dividend this year, as we mentioned, the new framework really anticipates that supplemental dividend is going to pay -- be paid out annually in Q1 for the prior year. And really, the reason for that is just to make sure that we're matching our variable dividend component to the cash flow that we're generating for the year. So generally, we're anticipating that, that first supplemental dividend would be paid in the first quarter of 2022 based on the 2021 cash flow. Now look, if things go really well, could there be a situation where we would consider some sort of interim supplemental dividend later in the year? Certainly, that's conceivable. I wouldn't shut the door on that definitively. But again, we're expecting that to be paid out annually in Q1 under most circumstances."

And a big driver of what kept log pricing down for really all of 2019",330,"Yes. So I think the short answer is, yes. With this level of housing activity, just as a general statement, the western market is, by far, the most tension market in the United States. And a big driver of what kept log pricing down for really all of 2019 and a portion of 2020 was depressed lumber prices. And so what we've historically seen, at least in the recent past, is much of the benefit of lumber prices increasing will go back to the woods in the form of log pricing. But obviously, people are not going to pay more for logs that caused them to be cash flow negative. And so when you have low lumber prices, that does put some restrictions on your ability to increase log prices. 
But as we continue to see lumber prices stay at healthy levels, the tension in the market will remain. Certainly, we've seen strong export markets. Coming out of Q4 into Q1, we expect that to continue. That's a japan statement. That's a China statement. So the market tension is there. It's really just a function of what lumber prices are doing. 
The only caveat to that, Mark, is just, there will be a dynamic going on in portions of Oregon this year as landowners work through their salvage volumes. And so one of the things that we're seeing here, probably in the near term, is that, as all of the landowners, ourselves included, are working through salvage activity, what that typically means is that you're harvesting some stands that are younger than you would normally harvest. And so as we're out and we're harvesting stands that are in the low 30s as opposed to 40 to 45, we are going to see more chip and saw really going into that market. So that may have a little bit of a depressive effect here for a portion of 2021. But overall, the wood basket in Washington and Oregon remains fairly tensioned."

And so as we think about 2021, as Russell mentioned, we are a little heavier to fiber in the South, and that's really catching up on some thinning backlog, which is really important from a silvicultural perspective, and we need to do that.

So for us, I would say, we're always looking on the Timberland side to continue to optimize and grow that timber portfolio. That's something we do year in and year out, and something we will continue to do going forward. And I'm really excited about some of the work Russell is going to be doing in that space. And so that's probably the most likely portfolio moves that we're going to make would be on the Timberland side. 
On the Wood Products side, I think we like the assets that we have. And so I wouldn't anticipate big portfolio changes necessarily on the Wood Products' side. If we found a mill here or there, sort of a small bolt-on acquisition in the Wood Products space, we would look at that if the price is right and it's in the right locale. But in terms of large acquisitions on the Wood Products' side, I'd say that's not currently our focus. 
Well, I think that was the final question. So again, thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning, and thank you for your continued interest in Weyerhaeuser. Stay safe, everyone."

This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported full year GAAP earnings of $797 million or $1.07 per diluted share, on net sales of $7.5 billion. Excluding special items, our full year 2020 earnings totaled $962 million or $1.29 per diluted share. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $2.2 billion, more than 70% increase over full year 2019 and the highest EBITDA performance in nearly 15 years. For the fourth quarter, we reported GAAP earnings of $292 million or $0.39 per diluted share, on net sales of $2.1 billion. Excluding net after-tax charges of $69 million for special items, we earned $361 million or $0.48 per diluted share for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $657 million, or more than 150% higher than fourth quarter 2019. 
I'd like to open this morning by expressing my sincere gratitude to our employees for their exceptional performance, dedication, resiliency and flexibility in 2020. Our people maintained a safety focus, continued to serve our customers and delivered strong results in the face of unprecedented operating and market challenges. All of our businesses executed exceptionally well, further strengthening our unrivaled portfolio of assets, improving our industry-leading operating performance and positioning the company to drive superior long-term value for shareholders. 
I'm extremely proud of our accomplishments in 2020, which included: delivering a record-breaking $1.5 billion of adjusted EBITDA from our Wood Products segment, a more than $1 billion increase over 2019; capturing approximately $100 million of company-wide operational excellence improvements, significantly exceeding our annual target; achieving record low controllable manufacturing costs in our lumber operations; strategically upgrading our Oregon Timberland Holdings; reducing gross debt by more than $900 million; introducing a new dividend framework that is sustainable across market cycles; reducing employee and contractor serious injuries by over 50%; and launching a new sustainability strategy. 
Before I discuss fourth quarter business results, let me first make some comments on the housing market. U.S. housing activity continued its torrid pace throughout the fourth quarter, with no seasonal slowdown in building activity. Total U.S. housing starts averaged 1.6 million units for the fourth quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis, an improvement of 11% over the third quarter. 
Single-family starts were the primary catalyst, improving nearly 20% quarter-over-quarter. Single-family now represents approximately 80% of new residential construction activity compared with 66% one year ago. Additionally, housing permits have surged to the highest level since before the Great Recession, reaching a seasonally adjusted 1.7 million units in December. 
As we progress into 2021, we expect numerous macroeconomic tailwinds will continue to drive favorable U.S. housing activity, including a post-COVID preference for larger single-family homes, supported by ongoing work-from-home flexibility, mortgage interest rates near record lows, strong homebuilder confidence, record low inventory for existing home sales, demographic trends that support growing millennial homeownership while older adults are deciding to age in place, and the possibility of a federal tax credit for first-time homebuyers under the Biden administration. 
U.S. homebuilders are seeing strong demand in January, with months of backlog, and this supports what we are hearing anecdotally from our customers. 
Certain cautionary headwinds are worth noting, most notably, constraints relating to building materials as well as lot and labor availability challenges for homebuilders. However, the housing backdrop appears increasingly favorable, and we anticipate 1.45 million housing starts in 2021, primarily driven by continued strength in single-family activity. With an aging housing stock, rising home equity and low interest rates, we expect repair and remodel activity will also remain strong in 2021. Collectively, we expect these positive housing dynamics to be a tailwind for our businesses over the next several years. 
Turning now to our fourth quarter business results. I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands on Pages 7 through 9 of our earnings slides. Timberlands' adjusted EBITDA increased by $37 million compared to the third quarter. Earnings increased by $297 million, which included a $182 million gain on the previously announced sale of certain Southern Oregon Timberlands. Western Timberlands' adjusted EBITDA increased $30 million compared with the third quarter, primarily due to higher average sales realizations for domestic and Japan export logs. 
In the western domestic market, demand remained favorable throughout the quarter as mills sought to take advantage of strong lumber prices and replenish lean inventory positions following the severe fire season. Log markets were tight to start the quarter, particularly in Oregon, where some harvest operations were slow to come online as landowners prepared for salvage activity. As salvage operations commenced, log supply improved and pricing for smaller diameter logs softened, primarily in markets with significant salvage activity. 
Our fee harvest volume increased by 9% compared with the third quarter as we fully resumed harvest operations and initiated salvage activity on our affected Timberlands in Oregon. We are not experiencing any downgrades and realizations on our salvage logs. Log and haul costs increased modestly during the fourth quarter due to higher safety and operational requirements, moderately lower yields and increased hauling distances to market, all associated with salvage logging activity in Oregon. 
Turning to our export markets. In Japan, demand for our logs strengthened through the fourth quarter as housing activity improved and robust U.S. domestic lumber markets reduced the availability of imported lumber. Our Japanese log sales volumes and realizations increased significantly compared with the third quarter. Similar to Japan, the market for U.S. logs strengthened in China in the fourth quarter as container availability reduced the supply of European salvage and Australian imports were restricted due to pest issues. Our sales volumes to China increased significantly over the third quarter and average realizations increased slightly. 
Moving to the South. Southern Timberlands' adjusted EBITDA increased $2 million compared with the third quarter. Southern sawlog markets improved modestly in the fourth quarter, as strong lumber and panel pricing drove steady demand and wet weather limited log supply in some Atlantic Coast markets. Fiber markets in most areas softened slightly as seasonal maintenance outages reduced demand, although the Atlantic markets remained more tensioned due to limited log availability. 
Our fee harvest volume was slightly lower in the third -- slightly lower than the third quarter as we completed less spending activity due to the unusually wet October weather. Average sales realizations were comparable to the third quarter as improved realizations for sawlogs were offset by slightly lower fiber log realizations. Northern Timberlands' adjusted EBITDA increased $2 million compared with the third quarter, partially due to slightly higher sales realizations for hardwood logs. 
Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources, Pages 10 and 11. Real Estate and E&R contributed $14 million to fourth quarter earnings and $23 million to adjusted EBITDA. For the full year, the segment generated $241 million of adjusted EBITDA, slightly more than our revised full year guidance. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $37 million lower than the third quarter due to timing of transactions. Similar to 2019, our Real Estate sales activity in 2020 was heavily weighted toward the first half of the year. Average price per acre was up significantly compared to the third quarter and the year ago quarter due to transaction mix. Fourth quarter 2020 included an unusually high proportion of high value, small parcel transactions. 
Wood products, Pages 12 and 13. Wood Products contributed $481 million to fourth quarter earnings and $530 million to adjusted EBITDA. I'm incredibly proud of our strong performance in Wood Products this year, despite significant operational disruptions and challenges from the pandemic. In 2020, our lumber and OSB businesses delivered the highest full year adjusted EBITDA on record. And our distribution business generated the highest adjusted EBITDA in over 15 years. 
In the fourth quarter, demand remained strong across our product lines, with robust new residential construction activity, a limited seasonal slowdown in repair and remodel and favorable weather conditions for construction. Benchmark lumber prices entered the quarter at record levels, but declined sharply through October, as repair and remodel activity began to ease and buyers limited replenishment in expectation of a seasonal slowdown in housing. As the quarter progressed, strong construction activity, lean inventories and concerns about COVID-related supply disruptions drove buyers to step back in and pricing improved through December. On average, the framing lumber composite decreased 9% in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter. 
OSB markets performed at a stronger pace, with pricing softening only modestly in late November and rebounding shortly thereafter. Average OSB composite pricing increased 18% compared with the third quarter. EBITDA for lumber decreased $109 million compared with the third quarter. Average sales realizations decreased by 10% and Western and Canadian log costs increased significantly. Sales volumes were comparable to the third quarter. 
OSB delivered a record $220 million of EBITDA during the fourth quarter, surpassing the prior record by $60 million, which was established just last quarter. Average sales realizations improved by 27%. Operating rates decreased compared with the third quarter. And unit manufacturing costs increased as we completed planned maintenance shutdowns at 4 of our OSB mills. 
Engineered wood products' EBITDA decreased by $21 million compared to the third quarter as a result of higher raw material costs, primarily for oriented strand board web stock. Average realizations for solid section and I-joists improved slightly as we began to capture the benefit of our third quarter price increases. 
In distribution, EBITDA decreased $13 million compared to the third quarter due to a modest seasonal reduction in sales volumes. Despite this reduction, our current distribution business established a new fourth quarter EBITDA record as demand remained above what is typical for this time of year. 
Now I'd like to turn to operational excellence. Our employees continued an unwavering commitment to OpEx despite a very challenging operating environment. In 2020, our teams delivered approximately $100 million of margin improvements, exceeding our $50 million to $70 million target, while also capturing meaningful opportunities to enhance future value, avoid future costs and improve efficiencies across our enterprise. 
In Timberlands, business -- our Timberlands business delivered $43 million of OpEx improvements in 2020, with notable contributions from initiatives to increase mechanized harvesting in the west, implement machine planting in the south and optimize our southern fertilization activity. The business also created significant future value through initiatives to reduce reforestation turnaround time, further enhanced seedling survival rates and improve data capture and analysis capabilities through expanded use of drones and LIDAR technology. 
Wood Products captured $50 million of OpEx enhancements through a continued focus on controllable costs, mill reliability and enhanced product mix. This enabled us to achieve multiple operating records and milestones despite fluctuating operating postures in response to the pandemic. 
For example, our lumber business achieved record low controllable manufacturing costs for the second consecutive year, and our OSB mills increased reliability and delivered record production volumes. The business has also avoided future costs through procurement and efficiency initiatives. In addition to these achievements, we captured $13 million of cross-business OpEx that improved margins in both Timberlands and Wood Products. Examples include an ongoing effort to ensure that every log we sell internally is routed to its most value-accretive mill, strategically flexing harvest volume to our internal mills to reduce out-of-log downtime. And flexing our wood products procurement to consume additional fee harvest logs during the pandemic-related market disruptions. 
As we look forward to 2021, we're targeting another $50 million to $75 million of OpEx improvements across our businesses. And I'm excited to see the creativity, innovation and collaboration that emerges as we continuously strive to deliver industry-leading operating performance across all business segments. 
I'll now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our first quarter outlook."

I'll begin our key financial items, which are summarized on pages 15 and 16. Cash from operations totaled $444 million for the fourth quarter and over $1.5 billion for the full year. This is our highest fourth qu",1938,"Thanks, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin our key financial items, which are summarized on pages 15 and 16. Cash from operations totaled $444 million for the fourth quarter and over $1.5 billion for the full year. This is our highest fourth quarter operating cash flow since 2007, and our strongest full year operating cash flow since 2005. We invested a portion of this cash back into our Timberlands and Wood Products businesses through capital expenditures, which totaled $281 million for the full year. Adjusted funds available for distribution, or FAD, for 2020, totaled $1.24 billion, as highlighted on Page 16. 
We used a significant portion of this year's adjusted FAD to reduce our debt outstanding. During the fourth quarter, we redeemed our $500 million 4 5/8% notes that were due September 2023. We incurred a $58 million pretax charge on the early extinguishment, which is included in our results as a special item. We ended the year with just under $5.5 billion of total debt outstanding, which is a reduction of approximately $900 million in 2020. 
This activity, in addition to strong 2020 EBITDA performance, has substantially improved our net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, which, at the end of 2020, was 2.3x compared to a high of 4.9x at the end of 2019. With this reduction, our leverage ratio is comfortably below our target of 3.5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA over the cycle. We also have cash earmark to repay our $150 million, 9% note when it matures in the fourth quarter of 2021. After repayment of this note, we will have no additional debt maturities until late 2023. 
In addition to improving our leverage, we returned over $380 million to shareholders during the year, which included reinitiating the dividend with a $0.17 per share base quarterly dividend, which was paid in the fourth quarter 2020. Overall, we ended the year in a strong financial position, with a sustainable dividend framework and a debt structure that is appropriate over the cycle and supports our solid investment-grade credit profile. 
Turning now to our key outlook items for the first quarter and full year 2021, which are summarized on Pages 17 and 18. In our Timberlands business, we expect first quarter net earnings and adjusted EBITDA to be slightly higher than the fourth quarter. In our Western Timberlands operations, we expect our first quarter domestic log sales volumes will be comparable to the fourth quarter. Domestic mill inventories ended the fourth quarter at moderate levels, and log demand in the West remains favorable due to strong lumber markets. We expect first quarter domestic average sales realizations will be slightly below the fourth quarter average. We anticipate the first quarter fee harvest volumes will be comparable with the fourth quarter. We also expect Western road spending will be lower compared to the fourth quarter as our roadwork activity slows during the winter months. 
We revised our 2021 Western harvest plan to focus Oregon salvage activities, and we currently anticipate salvage wood will comprise nearly half of the 2021 Western harvest volume. 
We'll be front-loading this activity as we are not currently experiencing any price erosion for our salvage logs. Additionally, unit log and haul costs are expected to increase slightly compared to the fourth quarter. The salvage activity results in lower efficiency and increased hauling distance to market. 
Moving to the export markets. In Japan, our first quarter average sales realizations and average sales volumes are expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter. Log demand remained strong as Japanese housing activity improved in the fourth quarter, and lumber imports to Japan remain limited. Chinese export log sales realizations and average log sales volumes are expected to be slightly higher in the first quarter. Demand remains solid, supported by an improving economy, government infrastructure spending and continued disruptions in the supply of log imports. 
In the South, we anticipate fee harvest volumes will be higher than fourth quarter following the conclusion of our 2020 harvest reductions. Additionally, we expect average log sales realizations will be comparable to the fourth quarter. In the North, average log sales realizations are expected to be comparable to fourth quarter, while fee harvest volumes are expected to be slightly lower. 
Turning to our full year harvest plan. For the full year 2021, we expect total company harvest volume will be approximately 34.5 million tons. We expect our southern harvest volumes will be up approximately 10%, and as we resume a more normalized level of activity following our 2020 pandemic-related harvest reductions. In the West, we expect our harvest volumes will be approximately 5% lower. This reflects the lower productivity on our salvage logging operations. We expect Northern harvest volumes to be moderately lower than 2020. This reflects the divestiture of our Montana Timberlands and softer demand for northern fiber logs. 
I'll wrap up the Timberlands segment with a few comments on our fourth quarter Oregon Timberlands transactions. As Devin indicated, fourth quarter included a gain of $182 million on the sale of 149,000 Southern Oregon acres, which was reported as a special item. We reported a cash inflow of $381 million related to this sale and a cash outflow of $425 million for the purchase of 85,000 acres in mid-coastal Oregon Timberlands. The net cash outflow for these 2 transactions was $44 million. 
Turning to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. Interest in our Real estate Properties remain strong. A shifting societal preferences during this time are driving robust demand for real recreational properties. We expect full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $255 million. And we anticipate the cadence of our 2021 real estate activity will be similar to our cadence in both 2019 and 2020. Land basis as a percentage of real estate sales is expected to be approximately 45% to 55% for the year. 
For the first quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA for this segment will be modestly lower than first quarter 2020 due to the timing of transactions. We expect net earnings, however, to be slightly higher than the first quarter 2020 due to mix. 
For our Wood Products segment, new residential construction activity carried forward from the fourth quarter at very favorable levels, and our builder and dealer customers are anticipating a strong first quarter. In repair and remodel markets, demand is expected to remain solid as rising home equity, continued work-from-home trends and an aging housing stock drive continued interest in home remodeling and upgrades. Channel inventories remain generally lean, with limited purchasing in advance of the spring building season. Excluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and oriented strand board, we expect first quarter adjusted EBITDA will be significantly higher than the fourth quarter. 
Production volumes within our OSB and engineered wood businesses are expected to increase during the quarter, following the completion of planned maintenance in the fourth quarter. We expect improved manufacturing costs across our product lines and slightly higher sales volumes, primarily for lumber and engineered wood products, while costs should be comparable to the fourth quarter. 
Entering the first quarter, benchmark pricing for oriented strand board reached a new peak in January, and the framing lumber composite is also at near-record levels. For lumber, our quarter-to-date average sales realizations are approximately $210 higher, and current realizations are approximately $250 higher than the fourth quarter average. For OSB, our quarter-to-date average sales realizations are approximately $55 higher, and our current sales realizations are approximately $70 higher than the fourth quarter average. 
As a reminder, for lumber, every $10 change in realizations is approximately $11 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis. And for OSB, every $10 change in realizations is approximately $8 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis. 
For engineered wood products average sales realizations for our solid section and I-joist products will be modestly higher as we capture the benefits of price increases announced in August 2020 and January 2021. 
Turning now to the major components of our unallocated items as summarized on Page 14. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $3 million lower than the third quarter, with unfavorable variances from elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and LIFO and the effects of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower variable compensation expense. The charge for the elimination of intersegment profit and inventory on LIFO was primarily driven by a seasonal increase in log inventories at the end of the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, when inventories were below normal levels. 
Moving to pension. In the fourth quarter, we completed the purchase of a group annuity contract, which transfers approximately $765 million of our U.S. pension liabilities to an insurance carrier. Contract purchase was funded from our U.S. pension plan assets, with no company cash contribution required. As a result of this transaction, fourth quarter special items included a $253 million noncash pretax settlement charge. The transaction is the latest in a series of actions taken to reduce our pension plan obligations. 
We have now settled nearly $3 billion since the beginning of these efforts in 2018. 
For our pension and post-employment plans, the year ended 2020 funded status decreased by approximately $200 million compared to 2019, driven primarily by lower discount rates. Discount rates decreased by approximately 90 basis points for the U.S. plans and approximately 60 basis points for the Canadian plans. Cash paid for pension and post-retirement plans in 2020 was $30 million. In 2021, we do not anticipate any cash contributions to our U.S. qualified plan. Our required cash payments for all other plans will be approximately $25 million. 
Excluding our fourth quarter settlement charge, our noncash, nonoperating pension and postretirement expense was $37 million in 2020. We expect to report approximately $35 million of expense in 2021. 
I'll wrap up with a few additional outlook items highlighted on Page 18. Our full year 2020 interest expense, before special items, was approximately $350 million. This excludes our early extinguishment of debt charges of $92 million. We expect interest expense will be $315 million for the full year 2021. 
Turning to capital expenditures. We expect total CapEx for 2021 will be approximately $420 million, which includes $115 million for Timberlands, inclusive of reforestation costs, $300 million for Wood Products and $5 million for planned corporate IT system investments. Wood Products' CapEx is increasing as we undertake some of the high-return capital projects deferred last year, and began a multiyear project to modernize our strategic hold in Louisiana sawmill. 
Similar to the highly successful rebuilds of our Dierks and Millport sawmills, this project will significantly reduce the mill's cost structure, enhance its product mix to better serve market demand and optimize the equipment to more efficiently process logs from our adjacent timberlands. These improvements will also result in approximately 100 million board feet of additional production capacity. This will begin ramping up in 2023 when the project is completed. 
Turning now to taxes. Our full year 2020 effective tax rate was 20%, excluding special items. For the first quarter and full year 2021, we expect our effective tax rate will be between 18% and 22% before special items based on the forecasted mix of earnings between our REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary. For cash taxes, we paid in net $76 million for the full year 2020. As previously discussed, we expect to receive a $90 million refund associated with our 2018 pension contribution in mid-2021. Excluding this refund, we expect our 2021 cash taxes will be generally comparable to our overall tax expense. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Devin, and I look forward to your questions."

In closing, I want to, again, thank our employees for their dedication, flexibility and adherence to our company values in 2020, despite being tested personally and professionally in ways that, frankly, weren't imaginable at this time last year. Notwithstanding these challenges, we achieved remarkable operating results, and I'm very pleased with the progress we made on numerous strategic initiatives. Looking forward, I'm excited by the opportunities in front of us this year. U.S. housing market has accelerated sharply, and we believe that strong macroeconomic and demand fundamentals will continue to support a favorable backdrop for our products.
The potential for a federal stimulus package from the new administration could also drive incremental demand for our products. Our manufacturing facilities are operating with unprecedented reliability and an industry-leading cost structure. We have a strong balance sheet and a dividend framework that enables us to return meaningful cash to shareholders across market conditions.

I'm just wondering, there seems to be some subregions of the South that are seeing real price tension and maybe some regions where prices seem challenged in the long term. I guess my question is, when we look sort of underneath the hood of that flat average price, is there any color you can give us on sort of the regional differences between what you're seeing maybe in your strongest submarket and weakest submarket? 
And then you upgraded the Oregon footprint last year. With your balance sheet where it is, is there maybe a kind of a parallel opportunity or a bigger opportunity to upgrade sort of the regional footprint in the south?"

Maybe I'll take that in a few different pieces. Just, at a high level, Anthony, you're right. We are still seeing issues in the south that really -- it goes back to the Great Recession with the oversupply that we've seen in a number of markets. As yo",434,"Yes. Maybe I'll take that in a few different pieces. Just, at a high level, Anthony, you're right. We are still seeing issues in the south that really -- it goes back to the Great Recession with the oversupply that we've seen in a number of markets. As you note, that, obviously, differs somewhat by market. And it's always important to remember that supply and demand are very wood basket specific. 
Now as I would say, the good news is that we've seen a fair amount of new capacity coming into the South, about 6.5 billion board feet of new capacity over the last several years, some recent announcements on some new capacity. A couple of those are in wood baskets that should be very favorable to us, the [indiscernible] mill, Idaho Forest products mill in Mississippi. And we're expecting continued new capacity coming into the south in the coming years. 
When we think about the submarkets, a thing to remember is that our business has scale across all major markets. And this really allows us to take advantage of stronger markets, such as the Atlantic region, really from Florida up through North Carolina. We have about 1.2 million acres in total across those regions. We're also starting to see some improvements in certain markets and other regions, Southern Arkansas, Central Mississippi, North Central Louisiana, some areas of Georgia and Alabama. 
We're starting to see a little bit of tension in there that, I think, could continue to grow here over time. And then the other thing I would just mention is just the export markets in the South. As you know, back in 2018, we really had started ramping up our export programs primarily to China. With the tariff situation that came into play, we backed that off, but now the tariffs have come off. We've reaccelerated our export programs into China, picking up some India opportunities as well. So that's another area, frankly, for those regions that have proximity to a port, to tension that up over time. With respect to the optimization work that we did in Oregon, that's work that is ongoing all the time. That's true in the West. It's true in the South. We've been doing that for quite a while, frankly, with Russell's new role and some of the work they're doing. I would expect that, that work will continue and perhaps even accelerate going forward. But again, we're going to continue to look for ways to drive value across our portfolio, and that will include optimization work for sure, both in the South and the West."

As with the new administration, there are going to be some puts and takes, and we're watching that closely. Tax, regulatory policy, those are things that we look for really in any administration to see how that's going to impact our business. But I do think, as you noted, there are some real opportunities for us with the Biden Administration. You mentioned a couple of them. A more normalized trade environment where we can avoid tariffs into China will help us continue to accelerate our export programs into that market, which should be a positive. I think, on the immigration side, a little bit different policy, perhaps, could allow some additional labor, both into the homebuilder market, which is downstream for us, but also even in the forestry side. And I think that could be a benefit. 
The infrastructure plan, we'll see how that progresses. But to the extent that we got a significant infrastructure plan through Congress, that's something that could spur some additional demand for our products. 
And then I think the big thing is really just around the environmental policies that come out of the administration around global warming and climate change. And that's certainly something that, I think, will find its way into every aspect of policy under the new administration. And I think that's something that could have some incrementally positive benefits for us. Since that falls squarely within Russell's new responsibilities, maybe I'll ask Russell, anything you want to mention specifically on the carbon side?"

I mean, clearly, the Biden Administration is going to focus on climate change, and we're seeing some of the policy specific to carbon, starting to get framed up and discussed. The early actions that they've taken demonstrates that this is going to be a focal point for them. So I would say at a federal level, I don't -- I'd be surprised if we saw a carbon tax or cap and trade type structure. I just don't think the political will is there to pull something off like that. But I do think we'll see policies supporting climate change mitigation across all the federal agencies. And that could come in the form of purchasing preferences for wood-based building because of the environmental benefits of that, solutions aimed at forest health and then recognizing the benefits of carbon stored in wood. And so I think those are all very positive, not only for Weyerhaeuser, but for the industry as a whole. 
So again, as they continue to focus on this area, we'll see more innovation, and we'll see markets continue to mature. And I think that's beneficial, again, for the industry and for Weyerhaeuser, in particular."

I wanted to start with a top-down question for you related to housing and kind of the ultimate impact on demand. So you enumerated a number of things, demographics, the move towards larger single-family homes and these sorts of things. I would also imagine a benefit to housing would be hopefully improved employment and wages for that matter, too. That said, some of our contacts are beginning to get a little bit worried about affordability based on rates moving higher and home prices moving up even more quickly. So I acknowledge that the answer is probably going to be all of the above, but of the things that you talked about in your opening comments, what gives you the most confidence that housing can continue to move higher? What gives your customers that confidence, given what's been a little bit of a spike in the wrong way in terms of affordability?"

And I think you note the affordability piece is going to be a headwind. There's no question about that. In terms of just the confidence, though, around the building environment right now, it just -- it starts with overwhelming demand for homes. There is virtually no existing home inventory for sale at present. The new home inventory for sale is pretty low. And I think we've just hit a point where, whether it's specific to COVID or whether it's just the demographic trends have finally reached that inflection point, there's just a significant amount of demand in really all markets that we participate for more housing. And the builders are really -- they're confident that they're going to have a lot of building activity this year. 
Certainly, I think to the extent that interest rates can stay relatively low in the near term, which seems to be the federal policy at present, that will be supportive. But in any event, it goes back to some of the things we've been talking about for years, which is, we've been massively underbuilding in the United States for over a decade. We need to build millions of homes over and above just kind of keeping pace with normal demand just to get back to even. 
So I think there are a lot of tailwinds to support that, but you're exactly right. The affordability piece is the one that is going to have to be solved. But, in the near term, at least for 2021, we're feeling pretty positive about the construction setup for this year."

It's situated very well in terms of serving some key customers. It's surrounded by a significant amount of our fee timberlands. This new mill configuration. It's going to allow us to improve the product mix from the mill. We've got a great employee base there. So we're really excited about this. I think this is going to be along the lines of our Dierks and Millport mill in terms of just really a very low-cost, highly efficient mill that's going to make some great lumber over time. 
In terms of the ability to flex up for additional volume in the near term, we are very focused on improving mill reliability across our footprint. And that comes into play in a number of different instances. And a good example of that, right? Is on the OSB side, where we hit a production volume record in 2020, notwithstanding the fact that we took a fair amount of downtime in the spring. And so those reliability improvements will provide extra volume across the system. And that's equally true from a lumber and an EWP standpoint. So there's going to be some volume creep that comes through that. And we're continuing to invest back in our mills across the system as part of our CapEx program.
But what I would note is that those capital programs are largely focused on reducing costs, improving reliability and driving efficiencies in the system as opposed to being directly focused at increasing our volumes. And so that's a long-winded way of saying, we are adding another 100 million of volume from our holding project, continuing to ramp up Millport, so maybe another 50 million to 60 million board feet coming off of Millport this year. And then just some additional flex from continuing to run our mills well, at least that's the answer here in the short term."

And if that plays out, like you say, we're going to generate some very strong cash flow. As we've indicated with our new dividend framework, the plan is to return 75% to 80% of our 2021 FAD back to shareholders, both through the base dividend and then, ultimately, the supplemental dividend. 
And any cash flow over and above that 75% to 80% of FAD would be available for growth, further debt paydown or, under the right circumstances, share repurchase. And so we'll continue to look at those opportunistically and allocate the cash to those opportunities that create the most long-term value for shareholders. And I would say Timberland's growth opportunities are an area that I would expect we'll continue to look closely at, both from just an optimization standpoint and growth more generally. But obviously, that's something that's dependent on finding the right deals that are accretive and strategic. And so we're going to continue to be very disciplined in that respect. 
In terms of a potential interim supplemental dividend this year, as we mentioned, the new framework really anticipates that supplemental dividend is going to pay -- be paid out annually in Q1 for the prior year. And really, the reason for that is just to make sure that we're matching our variable dividend component to the cash flow that we're generating for the year. So generally, we're anticipating that, that first supplemental dividend would be paid in the first quarter of 2022 based on the 2021 cash flow. Now look, if things go really well, could there be a situation where we would consider some sort of interim supplemental dividend later in the year? Certainly, that's conceivable. I wouldn't shut the door on that definitively. But again, we're expecting that to be paid out annually in Q1 under most circumstances."

With this level of housing activity, just as a general statement, the western market is, by far, the most tension market in the United States. And a big driver of what kept log pricing down for really all of 2019 and a portion of 2020 was depressed lumber prices. And so what we've historically seen, at least in the recent past, is much of the benefit of lumber prices increasing will go back to the woods in the form of log pricing. But obviously, people are not going to pay more for logs that caused them to be cash flow negative. And so when you have low lumber prices, that does put some restrictions on your ability to increase log prices. 
But as we continue to see lumber prices stay at healthy levels, the tension in the market will remain. Certainly, we've seen strong export markets. Coming out of Q4 into Q1, we expect that to continue. That's a japan statement. That's a China statement. So the market tension is there. It's really just a function of what lumber prices are doing. 
The only caveat to that, Mark, is just, there will be a dynamic going on in portions of Oregon this year as landowners work through their salvage volumes. And so one of the things that we're seeing here, probably in the near term, is that, as all of the landowners, ourselves included, are working through salvage activity, what that typically means is that you're harvesting some stands that are younger than you would normally harvest. And so as we're out and we're harvesting stands that are in the low 30s as opposed to 40 to 45, we are going to see more chip and saw really going into that market. So that may have a little bit of a depressive effect here for a portion of 2021. But overall, the wood basket in Washington and Oregon remains fairly tensioned."

I'd say we didn't mention it specifically, but that does not mean that there aren't issues around transportation. Trucking availability in the south, in particular, is pretty tight and so a lot of companies are having some challenges finding trucking capacity in the South. The rail issues haven't been as significant this year as they have, in some years in the past, some tightness in certain geographies. But overall, not seeing the same magnitude of issue with rail. But again, I would say trucking capacity is a bit tight, particularly in the South, and folks are struggling somewhat with that."

As we think about -- this is primarily a southern statement because we have a much higher percentage of our logs that go into the pulp market in the South.

As we think about -- this is primarily a southern statement because we have a much higher percentage of our logs that go into the pulp market in the South. As we think about our harvesting activity generally, we're looking at that on a regular basis because the point of how we manage our harvest is, obviously, we want to keep the growth in the harvest in balance over time. But on a year-to-year basis, we're looking at what's going on in the markets, and we're really trying to maximize the value of our timberlands over time. 
And so as we think about 2021, as Russell mentioned, we are a little heavier to fiber in the South, and that's really catching up on some thinning backlog, which is really important from a silvicultural perspective, and we need to do that. But obviously, that does put a little bit more pulpwood into the market, and you don't get as many tons from thinning as you do from clear cutting. But the high-level answer is, we continue to look at that really on a year-to-year basis, looking at what's going on in the markets, what the different opportunities are for that wood."

But in terms of large acquisitions on the Wood Products' side, I'd say that's not currently our focus.

This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported first quarter net earnings of $681 million or $0.91 per diluted share, on net sales of $2.5 billion. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.1 billion, a 68% increase over the fourth quarter of 2020 and a 167% increase compared to the year ago quarter. This represents the highest quarterly adjusted EBITDA on record surpassing the third quarter of 2020 by 48%. 
I'm extremely proud of the operational and financial results delivered by our team, notwithstanding winter weather disruptions and supply chain challenges throughout the quarter. The hard work we've been doing over the last several years has positioned us well to capitalize on these current favorable market conditions, and we remain focused on delivering superior value for our shareholders. 
Additionally, I'm very pleased to introduce and welcome to the call, Nancy Loewe, who joined Weyerhaeuser in March as our new CFO. Nancy brings more than 20 years of leadership in financial and operating roles across a broad range of industries. She's hit the ground running, and we're excited for the energy and expertise she's bring to Weyerhaeuser and our leadership team. 
With Nancy Now on board, Russell Hagen has fully transitioned into his new role as Chief Development Officer. I'm confident this organizational change will deliver meaningful portfolio management benefits as we align our real estate, energy and natural resources, acquisitions and divestitures and business development activities under one umbrella. I'm equally excited for the work this team is doing to support the company's increasing focus on emerging carbon and other natural climate solutions opportunities. 
In a moment, I'll dive into our first quarter business results, but first, let me make some brief comments on the housing market. First quarter housing starts averaged 1.6 million units on a seasonally adjusted basis, an improvement of 2% over the fourth quarter. Activity dipped briefly in February, driven by severe winter weather, but March activity rebounded sharply. March housing starts totaled 1.7 million units on a seasonally adjusted basis, the highest level since 2006. Single-family starts in March reached the highest rate for any month since June of 2007 at nearly 104,000 units. Additionally, housing permits in the first quarter averaged nearly 1.8 million units on a seasonally adjusted basis, surpassing last quarter by 10% and surging to its highest quarterly average since before the Great Recession. Continued improvement in this key leading indicator points to increasing demand for new home construction in 2021. 
With these encouraging tailwinds, our housing market outlook is very favorable. And further supported by macroeconomic fundamentals that will continue to drive strong U.S. housing activity, including record low supply of new and existing homes for sale, strong homebuilder sentiment, favorable demographic trends, flexible work arrangements, driving increased mobility and migration to the suburbs, higher savings rates and continued post-COVID improvements in GDP and unemployment. 
Repair and remodel activity also remained robust in the first quarter, supported by rising home equity, additional federal stimulus and limited resale inventory. Feedback from our customers indicates a shifting trend from small do-it-yourself projects to larger professional remodels. We expect repair and remodel demand to remain strong throughout 2021 as project backlogs continue to expand. We are keeping an eye on certain cautionary factors, including the impacts of increasing home prices and mortgage rates on affordability and challenges for homebuilders resulting from rising material costs, supply chain disruptions and labor availability. However, we do believe the supportive fundamentals considerably outweigh these headwinds. With the additional prospect of a federal infrastructure bill and growing demand for mass timber, we anticipate very favorable demand for Wood Products for the foreseeable future. 
Turning now to our first quarter business results. I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands on Pages 6 through 8 of our earnings slides. Timberlands contributed $108 million to first quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $5 million compared to the fourth quarter. 
Turning to Western Timberlands, starting with domestic market conditions, demand remained strong throughout the quarter as mills maintained healthy log inventories to capitalize on record lumber prices. Log supply in the first quarter continued to improve as salvage harvest activity in Oregon increased substantially. Similar to the fourth quarter, salvage operations resulted in an abundance of smaller diameter logs in the market. This, in turn, is driving stronger demand and pricing for larger diameter logs. Our fee harvest volume was comparable to the fourth quarter, and our proportion of salvage volume increased significantly. Average domestic log sales realizations were slightly lower than the fourth quarter as salvage operations resulted in a greater mix of smaller diameter logs. 
We continue to make great progress on our 2021 salvage plan. And as of the end of the first quarter, we've harvested approximately 40% of our planned salvage volume. We did not experience any downgrades and realizations on our salvage logs during the quarter. 
Log and haul costs increased slightly during the first quarter due to increased salvage activity and forestry costs were seasonally lower in the quarter. 
Turning to our export markets. In Japan, demand for our logs remained strong in the first quarter, reduced lumber imports into Japan, resulting from strong U.S. domestic lumber markets and a global shortage of shipping containers, allowed our customers to increase market share and drove stronger demand for our logs. Our Japanese log sales volumes increased moderately compared to the fourth quarter, with a slight increase in realizations. 
Similar to Japan, the market for U.S. logs in China remained strong in the first quarter as supply headwinds persisted, including lower overall lumber import volumes, a lack of container availability and restrictions on Australian log imports. Log inventories at Chinese ports increased in February as manufacturing activity paused over the Lunar New Year period but were drawn down rapidly in March as strong takeaway resumed. 
Average realizations for our China export logs increased modestly compared with the fourth quarter, but this was offset by higher ocean freight rates. Our sales volumes to China decreased significantly as we intentionally flex volume to the domestic market to capitalize on the strong pricing for our large diameter logs. 
Moving to the South. Southern Timberland's adjusted EBITDA increased $5 million compared with the fourth quarter. Southern sawlog market strengthened in the first quarter as record lumber and panel pricing drove strong demand and supply was limited by severe winter weather and seasonally wet conditions. Fiber markets also improved as demand increased following the fourth quarter maintenance outages by many of our customers. 
Our fee harvest volume was slightly lower than the fourth quarter as we lost several operating days due to the snow and Ice in February. Average sales realizations were slightly higher than the fourth quarter due to improved sawlog and fiber log realizations as well as favorable mix. 
Road and forestry costs decreased seasonally. On the export side, we continue to see growing demand from both China and India. Southern export log pricing increased substantially in the first quarter, but volumes were tripled in the fourth quarter as container availability and increased freight rates were notable headwinds. Northern Timberlands adjusted EBITDA increased $1 million compared to the fourth quarter due to improved sales realizations for hardwood logs. 
Turning to real estate, energy and natural resources, Pages 9 and 10. Real estate and ENR contributed $66 million to first quarter earnings and $96 million to adjusted EBITDA. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $73 million higher than fourth quarter due to timing of transactions. Similar to 2020, our 2021 real estate sales activity is heavily weighted toward the first half of the year. Average price per acre was down significantly compared to the unusually high fourth quarter but still substantially higher than 1 year ago. As was the case in fourth quarter, first quarter included a number of high-value retail transactions in the U.S. South. 
Wood Products, Pages 11 and 12, and wood products contributed $840 million to first quarter earnings and $889 million to adjusted EBITDA. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was 68% higher than the fourth quarter and surpassed by 45% the previous quarterly record, which was established in the third quarter of 2020. Our lumber, OSB and distribution businesses delivered the highest quarterly adjusted EBITDA on record during the first quarter. 
Demand remained extremely strong across our product lines, with continued strength in the new residential construction and repair and remodel end markets. The framing lumber composite entered the first quarter near the record levels achieved in the third quarter of 2020. After a slight pullback in January, prices reentered record territory and continue to increase as the quarter progressed, notwithstanding a low end consumption in the south following the severe winter weather event in February. 
Inventory in the distribution channels remained lean throughout the quarter, as buyers delicately balance their need to replenish inventory with buying at record high price levels. Average lumber composite pricing increased 41% compared with the fourth quarter. 
EBITDA for lumber increased $259 million compared with the fourth quarter, a more than 100% improvement. Average sales realizations increased by 42%. Costs for Canadian logs increased significantly and southern costs increased slightly during the quarter. Our lumber production decreased slightly compared with the fourth quarter as a handful of mills lost production days due to severe winter storms in the U.S. South. 
Sales volumes decreased by 5% compared with the fourth quarter as customer takeaway and supply chains in the south were temporarily disrupted following the severe winter weather. 
OSB markets performed at an unprecedented pace in the first quarter. Limited resin availability added incremental constraints to an already lean supply of OSB in the market. This time it coupled with continued strong demand, resulted in a record-setting price run that persisted for the entire quarter. Average OSB composite pricing increased 30% compared with the fourth quarter. 
OSB EBITDA increased $80 million compared to the fourth quarter, a 36% increase. Average sales realizations improved by 22%. Production and volumes increased slightly compared with the fourth quarter, and unit manufacturing costs improved as a reduction in planned maintenance more than offset weather-related downtime at one of our southern mills. 
Although resin availability was a challenge across the OSB market, our supply chain and transportation teams did a fantastic job of effectively navigating disruption, resulting in no material impact to our OSB production volumes or mix in the first quarter. We continue to benefit from proactive initiatives to diversify our resin supply. 
Engineered Wood Products EBITDA increased $5 million compared to the fourth quarter. Average sales realizations for solid section and I-joists products improved as we continue to benefit from our August 2020 price increase and quickly began capturing the benefit of a second increase announced in January. This was partially offset by higher raw material costs for oriented strand board web stock, resin and veneer. Production volumes also decreased slightly across several product lines as a result of weather-related downtime. 
In Distribution, EBITDA increased $15 million compared to the fourth quarter, as strong demand drove sales volumes across all products and the business captured improved margins. 
Turning briefly to operational excellence. After exceeding our 2020 operational excellence target, we remain focused on OpEx in 2021, targeting another $50 million to $75 million across our businesses. With one quarter of 2021 behind us, we're on track to achieve our full year 2021 target and look forward to sharing some accomplishments as the year progresses. 
Finally, I'd like to comment briefly on 2 recent Timberlands transactions. As we've noted previously, we're continuously evaluating opportunities to optimize and grow the value of our timberland holdings. Today, we reported the closing of our previously announced acquisition of 69,000 acre Alabama timberlands. These are high-quality acres that are accretive to our portfolio and exhibit strong [indiscernible] to our existing footprint. 
We also announced this morning an agreement to sell 145,000 acres in the North Cascades region of Washington to Hampton resources for $266 million. Hampton is a strategic buyer with a complementary manufacturing footprint in the area. This transaction is part of a multiyear effort to strategically optimize our Western Timberlands portfolio and completes our targeted large-scale divestitures in the region. 
The North Cascades is our least productive acreage in the West. It's primarily high elevation whitewood with high operating costs and does not serve any of our internal mills or export customers. This property does not materially contribute to EBITDA and was not expected to generate a competitive return within our portfolio, even considering future alternative sources of value. We're really pleased with this transaction and plan to redeploy the proceeds in line with our priorities for opportunistic capital allocation, including continuing to enhance and grow our Timberlands portfolio in a disciplined manner. 
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Nancy to discuss some financial items and our second quarter outlook."

Over the",1693,"Thank you, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I'm looking forward to meeting many of you in the coming months. It's a privilege to be joining Weyerhaeuser at such an exciting time, and I want to thank everyone for the warm welcome I've received. Over the past 2 months, I've spent a great deal of time with the senior leadership team, as well as the finance team here at the company, immersing myself in the business and getting to know our employees and operations. I've come away from that with tremendous excitement about the future, and our ability to create significant long-term value for shareholders. I'm looking forward to the work ahead. 
So this morning, I'll cover a few aspects of our first quarter financial performance as well as our second quarter outlook. I'll begin with the first quarter results for our unallocated items as summarized on Page 13. First quarter adjusted EBITDA for this segment improved by $7 million compared to fourth quarter 2020. This improvement was mainly due to lower corporate function and variable compensation expenses, partially offset by higher charges for the elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and LIFO. This charge was primarily driven by higher lumber inventory in the south, where customer takeaway was disrupted after the severe winter weather. 
Turning now to our key financial items, which are summarized on Page 14. Cash from operations totaled nearly $700 million for the first quarter. This is our highest quarterly operating cash flow since fourth quarter 2006, and our highest first quarter cash flow on record. We generally expect cash from operations to decrease significantly in the first quarter, primarily due to seasonal working capital increases. However, operating cash flow improved by over $250 million compared with the fourth quarter as these factors were more than outweighed by higher pricing for lumber and oriented strand board. 
We reinvested a portion of this cash in our Timberlands and Wood Products businesses through capital expenditures, which totaled $53 million for the first quarter. Adjusted funds available for distribution, or FAD, for first quarter 2021 totaled $645 million as highlighted on Page 15. In the first quarter, we returned $127 million to our shareholders through payment of our first quarter base dividend of $0.17 per share. As a reminder, we plan to target a total annual return to shareholders of 75% to 80% of our annual adjusted FAD. We will deploy the remaining 20% to 25% of our annual FAD, consistent with our stated priorities for opportunistic capital allocation. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended our first quarter with over $1 billion of cash an undrawn line of credit and just under $5.5 billion of outstanding long-term debt. As a reminder, we have cash earmarked to repay our $150 million 9% note when it matures in the fourth quarter. Our strong balance sheet position, in addition to our record EBITDA performance has resulted in a net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 1.5x. Although our leverage ratio is significantly below our over-the-cycle target of 3.5x net debt-to-EBITDA, we believe that's appropriate given the extremely strong commodity markets we're experiencing today. 
Looking forward, key outlook items for the second quarter are presented on Page 16. In our Timberlands business, we expect second quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be comparable to the first quarter. In our Western Timberlands operations, we expect our second quarter domestic log sales volumes will be significantly higher than the first quarter. Domestic mill inventories ended the first quarter at moderate levels and log demand in the West remains favorable due to strong lumber markets. Domestic average sales realizations are expected to be moderately lower compared with the first quarter. Additionally, while we expect average sales realizations for large logs to improve, we believe that this will be offset by an unfavorable mix of small logs as we continue to work through salvage wood. We anticipate second quarter fee harvest volumes will be significantly higher and that forestry and road spending will increase as we enter the spring and summer months. 
Moving to the export markets. In Japan, log demand remained  Japanese Douglas lumber producers continue to experience very favorable demand as lumber imports into Japan remain limited due to the high price of U.S. lumber and low availability of shipping containers. 
Our second quarter average sales realizations on log imports to Japan are expected to increase modestly compared to the first quarter. Our average sales volumes are expected to be comparable to the first quarter. 
For China, average export log sales realizations are expected to increase significantly. Demand for imported logs is strong due to significant economic growth, limited lumber imports, and continued disruptions in the supply of imported logs. However, our average log sales volumes are expected to be lower compared with the first quarter, with strong U.S. domestic demand for large logs and high ocean freight costs, we'll flex more logs to the domestic market to capture the highest margin. 
In the South, we anticipate fee harvest volumes will be significantly higher than first quarter due to seasonally higher thinner activity -- thinning activity as well as the deferred harvest activities related to the adverse weather we experienced during the first quarter. We expect average log sales realizations will be comparable to first quarter. Forestry spending in the South is expected to increase, which is typical coming into the spring month. 
In the North, average log sales realizations are expected to increase slightly compared to first quarter, while fee harvest volumes are expected to be significantly lower as we enter the spring breakup season. 
I'll wrap up the Timberlands segment with a few comments on our recent Timberlands transactions. In the second quarter, we will report a cash outflow of approximately $149 million for the 69,000 acre Alabama Timberlands acquisition that we completed this week. And as Devin mentioned, we have also announced the sale of our North Cascades acreage, and we expect to complete that transaction in the third quarter. The gain on sale will be reported as a special item within the Timberlands segment. 
Turning to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resource segment, real estate markets remained strong into the second quarter, as social preferences during this time continue to drive robust demand for rural recreational properties. We expect second quarter net earnings and adjusted EBITDA to be moderately lower than first quarter due to timing of transactions. We continue to expect full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $255 million, although we now expect land basis as a percentage of real estate sales, to be approximately 35% to 45% for the year due to the mix of properties sold. We continue to anticipate our 2021 real estate activity will be heavily weighted to the first half of the year similar to our cadence in both 2019 and 2020. 
For our Wood Products segment, new residential construction activity has remained at very favorable levels, and our builder and dealer customers are anticipating a strong second quarter following the already strong first quarter. In repair and remodel markets, we are seeing a shift from small do-it-yourself improvement projects to larger remodel activity, further solidifying the demand for structural Wood Products within this market. Excluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and oriented strand board, we expect second quarter adjusted EBITDA will be significantly higher than the first quarter. 
For lumber, we expect production volumes to increase during the quarter as operating rates are expected to improve following weather-related mill downtime in the first quarter. We expect these higher production volumes to have a favorable impact on our manufacturing costs. We also anticipate this increased supply as well as higher seasonal inventory drawdown to drive higher sales volumes during the quarter. 
Oriented strand board is expected to have a slightly lower production level in sales volume and slightly higher manufacturing costs due to an extended outage to complete a planned capital project at our Elkin OSB mill. This equipment has been on site, but installation has been delayed multiple times due to COVID-related travel restrictions and vendor resource availability. 
Log costs are expected to be comparable to the first quarter. Entering the second quarter benchmark pricing for oriented strand board and the framing lumber composite have continued to rise beyond the record levels experienced in the first quarter. For lumber, our quarter-to-date average sales realization are approximately $105 higher and current realizations are approximately $130 higher than the first quarter average. For OSB, our quarter-to-date average sales realizations are approximately $135 higher and our current sales realizations are approximately $185 higher than the first quarter average. 
As a reminder, for lumber, every $10 change in realizations is approximately $11 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis. For OSB, every $10 change in realizations is approximately $8 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis. 
For Engineered Wood products, we expect higher average sales realizations for our solid section and I-joist products as we continue to capture the benefit of price increases announced in August 2020 and January 2021. Additionally, in March 2021, we announced a third increase, which ranges from 10% to 25% and will be captured over the next several quarters. This will be partially offset by higher raw material costs. 
I'll wrap up with a few additional comments on our total company financial items. We continue to expect full year 2021 interest expense will be approximately $315 million. Additionally, we continue to anticipate 2021 capital expenditures to total $420 million, with most large projects executing in the second half of the year. 
Turning to taxes. We continue to expect our full year 2021 effective tax rate will be between 18% and 22% before special items, based on our forecasted mix of earnings between our REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary. As previously discussed, the $90 million tax refund associated with our 2018 pension contribution remains in process. We anticipate receiving this refund in second quarter 2021. Excluding this refund, we continue to expect our 2021 cash taxes will be generally comparable to our overall tax expense. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions."

In closing, our first quarter financial performance was the strongest on record, and I'm incredibly proud of the work our teams are doing to achieve these results. Whether it's navigating winter conditions and supply chain disruptions, keeping our people safe through a pandemic or the relentless focus to capture OpEx opportunities across our portfolio, our employees have done an outstanding job positioning the company to capitalize on the strong markets we're experiencing today. 
Looking forward, the demand for our products is extremely favorable, supported by encouraging macroeconomic conditions and continued resiliency in the U.S. housing and repair and remodel markets. We remain committed to serving our customers and delivering industry-leading performance across our operations. When combined with a strong balance sheet and a dividend framework that returns meaningful cash to shareholders, we're well positioned to drive superior long-term value into the future.

If you think back to our capital program over the last several years, we have been investing significant amounts of capital across our Wood Products business. In fact, we're doing $300 million of incremental capital this year, part of which, as you note, it goes to the holden mill, which will increase by about 100 million board feet capacity at that location. We continue to get incremental capacity through the capital program that we've had in place for a number of years. Just for reference, if you think back over the last couple of years, our Millport and our dirks mill brownfield expansions have added about 300 million board feet of incremental capacity, and we continue to put capital to work across our Wood Products and Manufacturing businesses. And it's always a balance, Anthony. We're always looking to continue to drive down costs and improve efficiencies at our mills. One of the core to our operating strategy on the manufacturing side is to have the best cost structure in the industry so that we can continue to drive good margins regardless of where we are on pricing. 
We're going to continue to look for opportunities across our Wood Products manufacturing footprint. Whether we're going to go out and do a greenfield mill? I think as we've said in the past, our inclination is to really fit in the near-term on our existing mill set. And the reason behind that is just we think we can get better risk-adjusted returns by putting that capital to work in our existing mill footprint. Now over time, as we continue to work through our capital programs down the road, is there an opportunity for a greenfield? Sure. We're always going to be open to that. But I think in the near term, it's going to be more focused on our existing footprint."

Certainly, we're experiencing incredibly strong pricing right now. And if that continues to play out over the course of the year, we're going to generate very strong cash flow. And as you noted, with our new dividend framework, around 75% to 80% of that is going back to shareholders through the base dividend and supplemental dividends. So any cash flow over and above that really goes to our opportunistic options, which are growth, further debt paydown and share repurchase. 
As we think about share repurchase specific question, Anthony, I think that can be a really good opportunity to return cash to shareholders under the right circumstances, and we continue to view that opportunistically. And so to the extent we feel like our shares are trading at a material discount. That's a great way to return cash to shareholders. But absent that, I think preference really is to distribute that via the supplemental dividend."

And ultimately, you can't continue to see housing prices continue to go up at this level year after year. There's obviously some limit where that starts to take some increments of the buying community out of the market. But with low mortgage rates sitting around low 3%, that gives a little bit more flexibility. But again, the reality right now is there is a real shortage of housing in the market, and the demand is just overwhelming. 
When we talk to our homebuilder customers, they just -- they have more buyers than they can satisfy at present. And so in that environment, it does give the builders more pricing power, and we're certainly seeing -- you see that in the numbers with the permits and the starts and builder sentiment just a lot of demand for housing. And if you think about it just at a broader level, and we've been saying this for years, the country has been under building for a decade, and you probably saw the Freddie Mac number out where they were estimating 4 million units under built the amount of time it takes to build through that overhang. It's just -- it's a lot of demand. And that's ultimately, I think, what keeps the buyer is still there, even though pricing continues to go up."

I was hoping you could give us a bit more granularity to some degree, be backing off of Anthony's questions in Wood. One, if you -- we didn't -- if we hold Holden outside of the equation for a minute, what kind of productivity capacity increases might you get around the rest of your network in lumber and OSB this year? And recognizing you said significantly, and there are lots of ways to define that, I guess, or throw that into a model. If we take pricing aside and just assumed average pricing in the first quarter to second quarter, what kind of increase would we be looking at for Wood Products 2Q versus 1Q? If you can give us any kind of guardrails around that?"

Well, I'll answer the second question first, and then we'll swing back to the capacity question. So good way to think about it quarter-over-quarter, if you take out lumber and OSB pricing is about $75 million to $100 million of incremental EBITDA. And that's really primarily a result of increased lumber volume and the EWP pricing increase rolling through. And so where you sit between that $75 million and $100 million really depends on how much OSB prices continue to go up because web stock, obviously, is -- it's an input cost that we have to bear in EWP. 
Although I will note we supply almost all, if not all of our web stock comes from our OSB mills. And so we do get that in a different pocket. So that's the range, about $75 million to $100 million. 
In terms of incremental capacity, every year through our capital program, you get several percent increase just on the debottlenecking work that we do, you get incremental volume. So that kind of comes year after year just through our normal cost programs in CapEx. We've also added, as I mentioned, about 300 million board feet over the last couple of years. And so that's now rolling through the system. We've got another 100 million coming in Holden. And so we don't necessarily talk about it this way all the time, but we are seeing organic growth in our Wood Products manufacturing operations just through those capital programs, even though they are primarily focused on cost reduction."

The place I would highlight for you that is the most acute is trucking in the south.

And so that's definitely a challenge really in a lot of different places. The South, as I mentioned, is the most acute issue. But that's really bleeding over into the rail side as well. So securing trucking capacity and rail capacity, it's been a challenge for the industry, something that believe me, we're focused on this 24/7 to make sure that we're getting product to customers and keeping them satisfied. So that's a challenge. 
And I think part of it, when you think about having lean inventories, you add the transportation challenge, for customers really across the channel, trying to get product to serve their existing projects and their customers, it just adds one more challenge. And so I think when people can get product on a short-term basis, they're willing to pay really high prices just to secure the product."

So really, Mark, when we think about doing acquisitions or divestitures for that matter, for us, it's very specific to that individual land base. And so certainly, we look at comps to get a sense of what the market looks like. But when we're doing our future cash flow projections, it really goes down to things that are specific to that land. The stocking level, the species mix, what we think the road infrastructure looks like, what we think the cost of logging and hauling in that region are going to be. So we do a very, very detailed analysis. We have some tools that we have that, I think, are proprietary to help with that to really dial in on what we think that the cash flow will look like over a period of time. And we layer on top of that, what does the local market conditions look like, and we have a pretty good sense because we're in all of these markets on what we expect market dynamics to look like. 
And then we layer on top of that, what are the synergies that we can bring to that specific land, things like leveraging our scale to drive lower log and haul costs, finding opportunities for export or alternative values like solar, wind, HBU. So our model takes all of those things in. And when we look at that particular land down in Alabama, a few things really jump out. It's in a very good market. I would say that Pine Hill, Alabama market is one of the stronger markets in the area. It's growing, both on the sawtimber side, but importantly, it's a strong fiber market, which can really help the economics of owning Timberland. We've got an expanding mill capacity. We've got a diverse set of customers there that we think we can really leverage to drive additional value on that. And it really fits well with our existing Timberlands portfolio. We have people on the ground there, so we don't have to add a lot of personnel to manage this incremental land. So when we look at all of these things, good species mix, good site index, good synergies, logistics benefits. It's a really good property for us. It's really one of the better properties that we've looked at in quite a while in the South. And so we were really excited to add that to the portfolio."

So I would say in the Pacific Northwest specifically, we've really gotten through all of the big transactions that we had as part of the review. The southern timber -- the Southern Oregon Timberlands deal that we did last year and then this North Washington deal, those were really the 2 big pieces of property in the West that we wanted to clean out of the portfolio. And again, it's really, as you think about our Western portfolio as a whole, you take out the North Cascades in the South Oregon, I mean, the rest of the property is really cream of the crop Timberland. And so I think at this point, from a western perspective, we're pretty much there in terms of getting the portfolio where we want it to be. And obviously, we'll continue to look for opportunities to add good Timberlands to that. But in terms of the big divestitures in the west, I think we're pretty much there."

So whether you think about carbon opportunities, whether you think about mitigation banks, just a whole host of opportunities that we have owning so much land, there's just inherent optionality when you have a large land base like we do. And one of the things that we're really excited about with Russell stepping into this role is to further take advantage of some of that optionality. So we're really excited. He's only been in the role for a couple of months. But I think you're going to see some real traction on this front over time."

You think about a couple of things that we've seen in the infrastructure bill. Obviously, there's a housing component that is embedded in the infrastructure bill. And so incremental housing demand, obviously, is supportive for the industry and driving incremental demand. But even when you look more broadly, roads, highways, bridges, other infrastructure, certainly, a lot of that is going to be concrete and steel. But you do have incremental demand anytime you have infrastructure spending with concrete forms and just other incremental lumber or plywood or OSB that you see when those projects are put out. And so just kind of a rough order of magnitude guess from our standpoint is, if this does get passed and not even considering necessarily the housing piece, you could see another 1 billion, 1.5 billion board feet of incremental demand on the lumber side coming out of an infrastructure program. And so we'll dial that estimate in as we get closer to get more clarity on what an infrastructure bill looks like. But I do think that if you see a bill of this magnitude come to fruition, it's going to have incremental demand implications for our industry."

I think at a high level, the reality is many of the markets across south are still oversupplied from a log standpoint. And so when we think about what's going to change that? It's a couple of things: One, it is continued capacity coming into the South, and we've seen a lot of that. We continue to see announcements coming in. New mills being built in the South. Lumber, we see pellet mills coming into the South. So the trajectory is right. I think also to the extent that you have land that's proximate to ports. I feel really optimistic about the export opportunity. We're seeing great demand. Into China, India is a growing market. We're sending chips into Turkey. So I think there are opportunities to continue to expand the pull into offshore markets, and so that can have a tensioning effect. But really, the third piece, Mark, is just time. We need some time for these new mills to come on board and to chew through some of the inventory. And so that's something that will continue to happen. It's going to be differential by market. 
Again, when you think about places like Pine Hill, Alabama or their spots in Louisiana and Arkansas, and South Carolina, North Carolina, where you've seen some capacity come in, you see things starting to tighten up a bit in the local area. But really, it's something that's going to take some time to work through, and it will be differential. 
One note I would make on that front. While southern average southern sawlog prices across the south is moderately interesting to us. What's really interesting is what's happening in the Wood baskets where we have fee Timberland. And so I can tell you, and this goes back to something that Russell and his team are working, we want to make sure that when new mill capacity comes into the South, that it's being cited in a geography that fits well with our fee Timberland. So we're having lots of conversations with people about how we can help them. If they decide to put a mill in a geography, that's a place where we have fee Timberland. So we're working all of those things. 
As you think about how does that translate into M&A, it's differential. Most of the players in the market are pretty astute in terms of understanding local supply-demand dynamics. So people will bake in what they think is going to happen in that Wood Basket over time as they put valuations into their model."

So we're doing a good job getting through that salvage operation. I mean that is a monumental effort when you think about 125,000 acres that were impacted by the fire, that's a bigger impact than we saw Mount St Helens, just to put it into context. And so the team has done a great job of organizing contractor and trucking availability in the region so we can get after that quickly. Our expectation is that we're going to get through the vast majority of the salvage work in 2021. So I would expect to have that mostly complete this year. 
We're obviously trying to get at it as fast as we can so that we can make sure we're capturing the maximum value of those salvage logs before you start to see any sort of degradation in the Wood. So we're going to be trying to do as much as we can in Q2 and Q3. And that really has a few impacts. One of which, to your question is it does have an impact on mix because we're harvesting a lot of acres that are younger than ordinarily would be the case. And so that adds smaller diameter logs into the market. And what we're seeing, primarily in Oregon is the mix of log volume into the market is a lot more smaller long. That's true -- that's the case for us, but it's also, I think, broadly speaking, the case in the market. So that brings realizations down a little bit, and that will be a little bit of a headwind in Q2 and Q3. 
The flip side of that is that puts a bit of a premium on larger logs into the system. And so you're seeing a little bit of an uplift there. So I think it's going to be a little bit of a headwind, Q2, Q3, which is why we said domestic pricing in the West is going to be down a little bit in Q2. That's really just a function of those smaller salvage logs going into the market. 
The one other point I would just make there is, as you think about 2021 for us in the West, salvage logging is obviously a little bit more expensive. And so there's a little bit of a cost headwind in the West for the next couple of quarters as well."

This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported first quarter net earnings of $681 million or $0.91 per diluted share, on net sales of $2.5 billion. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.1 billion, a 68% increase over the fourth quarter of 2020 and a 167% increase compared to the year ago quarter. This represents the highest quarterly adjusted EBITDA on record surpassing the third quarter of 2020 by 48%.
I'm extremely proud of the operational and financial results delivered by our team, notwithstanding winter weather disruptions and supply chain challenges throughout the quarter. The hard work we've been doing over the last several years has positioned us well to capitalize on these current favorable market conditions, and we remain focused on delivering superior value for our shareholders.
Additionally, I'm very pleased to introduce and welcome to the call, Nancy Loewe, who joined Weyerhaeuser in March as our new CFO. Nancy brings more than 20 years of leadership in financial and operating roles across a broad range of industries. She's hit the ground running, and we're excited for the energy and expertise she's bring to Weyerhaeuser and our leadership team.
With Nancy now on board, Russell Hagen has fully transitioned into his new role as Chief Development Officer. I'm confident this organizational change will deliver meaningful portfolio management benefits as we align our real estate, energy and natural resources, acquisitions and divestitures, and business development activities under one umbrella. 
I'm equally excited for the work this team is doing to support the company's increasing focus on emerging carbon and other natural climate solutions opportunities.
In a moment, I'll dive into our first quarter business results, but first, let me make some brief comments on the housing market. First quarter housing starts averaged 1.6 million units on a seasonally adjusted basis, an improvement of 2% over the fourth quarter. Activity dipped briefly in February, driven by severe winter weather, but March activity rebounded sharply. March housing starts totaled 1.7 million units on a seasonally adjusted basis, the highest level since 2006. 
Single-family starts in March reached the highest rate for any month since June of 2007 at nearly 104,000 units. Additionally, housing permits in the first quarter averaged nearly 1.8 million units on a seasonally adjusted basis, surpassing last quarter by 10% and surging to its highest quarterly average since before the Great Recession. Continued improvement in this key leading indicator points to increasing demand for new home construction in 2021.
With these encouraging tailwinds, our housing market outlook is very favorable. And further supported by macroeconomic fundamentals that will continue to drive strong U.S. housing activity, including record low supply of new and existing homes for sale, strong homebuilder sentiment, favorable demographic trends, flexible work arrangements, driving increased mobility and migration to the suburbs, higher savings rates, and continued post-COVID improvements in GDP and unemployment.
Repair and remodel activity also remained robust in the first quarter, supported by rising home equity, additional federal stimulus and limited resale inventory. Feedback from our customers indicates a shifting trend from small do-it-yourself projects to larger professional remodels. We expect repair and remodel demand to remain strong throughout 2021 as project backlogs continue to expand. We are keeping an eye on certain cautionary factors, including the impacts of increasing home prices and mortgage rates on affordability and challenges for homebuilders resulting from rising material costs, supply chain disruptions and labor availability. 
However, we do believe the supportive fundamentals considerably outweigh these headwinds. With the additional prospect of a federal infrastructure bill and growing demand for mass timber, we anticipate very favorable demand for Wood Products for the foreseeable future.
Turning now to our first quarter business results. I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands on Pages 6 through 8 of our earnings slides. Timberlands contributed $108 million to first quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $5 million compared to the fourth quarter.
Turning to Western Timberlands, starting with domestic market conditions, demand remained strong throughout the quarter as mills maintained healthy log inventories to capitalize on record lumber prices. Log supply in the first quarter continued to improve as salvage harvest activity in Oregon increased substantially. Similar to the fourth quarter, salvage operations resulted in an abundance of smaller diameter logs in the market. 
This, in turn, is driving stronger demand and pricing for larger diameter logs. Our fee harvest volume was comparable to the fourth quarter, and our proportion of salvage volume increased significantly. Average domestic log sales realizations were slightly lower than the fourth quarter as salvage operations resulted in a greater mix of smaller diameter logs.
We continue to make great progress on our 2021 salvage plan. And as of the end of the first quarter, we've harvested approximately 40% of our planned salvage volume. We did not experience any downgrades and realizations on our salvage logs during the quarter.
Log and haul costs increased slightly during the first quarter due to increased salvage activity and forestry costs were seasonally lower in the quarter.
Turning to our export markets. In Japan, demand for our logs remained strong in the first quarter, reduced lumber imports into Japan, resulting from strong U.S. domestic lumber markets and a global shortage of shipping containers, allowed our customers to increase market share and drove stronger demand for our logs. Our Japanese log sales volumes increased moderately compared to the fourth quarter, with a slight increase in realizations.
Similar to Japan, the market for U.S. logs in China remained strong in the first quarter as supply headwinds persisted, including lower overall lumber import volumes, a lack of container availability and restrictions on Australian log imports. Log inventories at Chinese ports increased in February as manufacturing activity paused over the Lunar New Year period but were drawn down rapidly in March as strong takeaway resumed.
Average realizations for our China export logs increased modestly compared with the fourth quarter, but this was offset by higher ocean freight rates. Our sales volumes to China decreased significantly as we intentionally flex volume to the domestic market to capitalize on the strong pricing for our large diameter logs.
Moving to the South. Southern Timberlands adjusted EBITDA increased $5 million compared with the fourth quarter. Southern sawlog market strengthened in the first quarter as record lumber and panel pricing drove strong demand and supply was limited by severe winter weather and seasonally wet conditions. Fiber markets also improved as demand increased following the fourth quarter maintenance outages by many of our pulp log customers.
Our fee harvest volume was slightly lower than the fourth quarter as we lost several operating days due to the snow and Ice in February. Average sales realizations were slightly higher than the fourth quarter due to improved sawlog and fiber log realizations as well as favorable mix.
Road and forestry costs decreased seasonally. On the export side, we continue to see growing demand from both China and India. Southern export log pricing increased substantially in the first quarter, but volumes were comparable to the fourth quarter as container availability and increased freight rates were notable headwinds. Northern Timberlands adjusted EBITDA increased $1 million compared to the fourth quarter due to improved sales realizations for hardwood logs.
Turning to real estate, energy and natural resources, Pages 9 and 10. Real estate and ENR contributed $66 million to first quarter earnings and $96 million to adjusted EBITDA. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $73 million higher than fourth quarter due to timing of transactions. Similar to 2020, our 2021 real estate sales activity is heavily weighted toward the first half of the year. Average price per acre was down significantly compared to the unusually high fourth quarter but still substantially higher than 1 year ago. As was the case in fourth quarter, first quarter included a number of high-value retail transactions in the U.S. South.
Wood Products, Pages 11 and 12. Wood Products contributed $840 million to first quarter earnings and $889 million to adjusted EBITDA. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was 68% higher than the fourth quarter and surpassed by 45% the previous quarterly record, which was established in the third quarter of 2020. Our lumber, OSB and distribution businesses delivered the highest quarterly adjusted EBITDA on record during the first quarter.
Demand remained extremely strong across our product lines, with continued strength in the new residential construction and repair and remodel end markets. The framing lumber composite entered the first quarter near the record levels achieved in the third quarter of 2020. After a slight pullback in January, prices reentered record territory and continue to increase as the quarter progressed, notwithstanding a low-end consumption in the south following the severe winter weather event in February.
Inventory in the distribution channels remained lean throughout the quarter, as buyers delicately balance their need to replenish inventory with buying at record high price levels. Average lumber composite pricing increased 41% compared with the fourth quarter.
EBITDA for lumber increased $259 million compared with the fourth quarter, a more than 100% improvement. Average sales realizations increased by 42%. Costs for Canadian logs increased significantly, and southern log costs increased slightly during the quarter. 
Our lumber production decreased slightly compared with the fourth quarter as a handful of mills lost production days due to severe winter storms in the U.S. South.
Sales volumes decreased by 5% compared with the fourth quarter as customer takeaway and supply chains in the south were temporarily disrupted following the severe winter weather.
OSB markets performed at an unprecedented pace in the first quarter. Limited resin availability added incremental constraints to an already lean supply of OSB in the market. This dynamic coupled with continued strong demand, resulted in a record-setting price run that persisted for the entire quarter. Average OSB composite pricing increased 30% compared with the fourth quarter.
OSB EBITDA increased $80 million compared to the fourth quarter, a 36% increase. Average sales realizations improved by 22%. Production and volumes increased slightly compared with the fourth quarter, and unit manufacturing costs improved as a reduction in planned maintenance more than offset weather-related downtime at one of our southern mills.
Although resin availability was a challenge across the OSB market, our supply chain and transportation teams did a fantastic job of effectively navigating disruption, resulting in no material impact to our OSB production volumes or mix in the first quarter. We continue to benefit from proactive initiatives to diversify our resin supply.
Engineered wood products EBITDA increased $5 million compared to the fourth quarter. Average sales realizations for solid section and I-joists products improved as we continue to benefit from our August 2020 price increase and quickly began capturing the benefit of a second increase announced in January. This was partially offset by higher raw material costs for oriented strand board web stock, resin, and veneer. Production volumes also decreased slightly across several product lines as a result of weather-related downtime.
In Distribution, EBITDA increased $15 million compared to the fourth quarter, as strong demand drove sales volumes across all products and the business captured improved margins.
Turning briefly to operational excellence. After exceeding our 2020 operational excellence target, we remain focused on OpEx in 2021, targeting another $50 million to $75 million across our businesses. With one quarter of 2021 behind us, we're on track to achieve our full year 2021 target and look forward to sharing some accomplishments as the year progresses.
Finally, I'd like to comment briefly on 2 recent Timberlands transactions. As we've noted previously, we're continuously evaluating opportunities to optimize and grow the value of our timberland holdings. Today, we reported the closing of our previously announced acquisition of 69,000 acres of Alabama timberlands. These are high-quality acres that are accretive to our portfolio and exhibit strong [Technical Difficulty] to our existing footprint.
We also announced this morning an agreement to sell 145,000 acres in the North Cascades region of Washington to Hampton resources for $266 million. Hampton is a strategic buyer with a complementary manufacturing footprint in the area. This transaction is part of a multiyear effort to strategically optimize our Western Timberlands portfolio and completes our targeted large-scale divestitures in the region.
The North Cascades is our least productive acreage in the West. It's primarily high elevation whitewood with high operating costs and does not serve any of our internal mills or export customers. This property does not materially contribute to EBITDA and was not expected to generate a competitive return within our portfolio, even considering future alternative sources of value. We're really pleased with this transaction and plan to redeploy the proceeds in line with our priorities for opportunistic capital allocation, including continuing to enhance and grow our Timberlands portfolio in a disciplined manner.
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Nancy to discuss some financial items and our second quarter outlook."

Over the",1693,"Thank you, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I'm looking forward to meeting many of you in the coming months. It's a privilege to be joining Weyerhaeuser at such an exciting time, and I want to thank everyone for the warm welcome I've received. Over the past 2 months, I've spent a great deal of time with the senior leadership team, as well as the finance team here at the company, immersing myself in the business and getting to know our employees and operations. I've come away from that with tremendous excitement about the future, and our ability to create significant long-term value for shareholders. I'm looking forward to the work ahead.
So this morning, I'll cover a few aspects of our first quarter financial performance as well as our second quarter outlook. I'll begin with the first quarter results for our unallocated items as summarized on Page 13. First quarter adjusted EBITDA for this segment improved by $7 million compared to fourth quarter 2020. This improvement was mainly due to lower corporate function and variable compensation expenses, partially offset by higher charges for the elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and LIFO. This charge was primarily driven by higher lumber inventory in the south, where customer takeaway was disrupted after the severe winter weather.
Turning now to our key financial items, which are summarized on Page 14. Cash from operations totaled nearly $700 million for the first quarter. This is our highest quarterly operating cash flow since fourth quarter 2006, and our highest first quarter cash flow on record. We generally expect cash from operations to decrease significantly in the first quarter, primarily due to seasonal working capital increases. However, operating cash flow improved by over $250 million compared with the fourth quarter as these factors were more than outweighed by higher pricing for lumber and oriented strand board.
We reinvested a portion of this cash in our Timberlands and Wood Products businesses through capital expenditures, which totaled $53 million for the first quarter. Adjusted funds available for distribution, or FAD, for first quarter 2021 totaled $645 million as highlighted on Page 15. 
In the first quarter, we returned $127 million to our shareholders through payment of our first quarter base dividend of $0.17 per share. As a reminder, we plan to target a total annual return to shareholders of 75% to 80% of our annual adjusted FAD. We will deploy the remaining 20% to 25% of our annual FAD, consistent with our stated priorities for opportunistic capital allocation.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended our first quarter with over $1 billion of cash, an undrawn line of credit, and just under $5.5 billion of outstanding long-term debt. As a reminder, we have cash earmarked to repay our $150 million 9% note when it matures in the fourth quarter. Our strong balance sheet position, in addition to our record EBITDA performance has resulted in a net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 1.5x. Although our leverage ratio is significantly below our over-the-cycle target of 3.5x net debt-to-EBITDA, we believe that's appropriate given the extremely strong commodity markets we're experiencing today.
Looking forward, key outlook items for the second quarter are presented on Page 16. In our Timberlands business, we expect second quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be comparable to the first quarter. In our Western Timberlands operations, we expect our second quarter domestic log sales volumes will be significantly higher than the first quarter. Domestic mill inventories ended the first quarter at moderate levels and log demand in the West remains favorable due to strong lumber markets. 
Domestic average sales realizations are expected to be moderately lower compared with the first quarter. Additionally, while we expect average sales realizations for large logs to improve, we believe this will be offset by an unfavorable mix of small logs as we continue to work through salvage wood. 
We anticipate second quarter fee harvest volumes will be significantly higher and that forestry and road spending will increase as we enter the spring and summer months.
Moving to the export markets. In Japan, log demand remained  strong. Japanese Douglas fir lumber producers continue to experience very favorable demand as lumber imports into Japan remain limited due to the high price of U.S. lumber and low availability of shipping containers.
Our second quarter average sales realizations on log imports to Japan are expected to increase modestly compared to the first quarter. Our average sales volumes are expected to be comparable to the first quarter.
For China, average export log sales realizations are expected to increase significantly. Demand for imported logs is strong due to significant economic growth, limited lumber imports, and continued disruptions in the supply of imported logs. 
However, our average log sales volumes are expected to be lower compared with the first quarter, with strong U.S. domestic demand for large logs and high ocean freight costs, we'll flex more logs to the domestic market to capture the highest margin.
In the South, we anticipate fee harvest volumes will be significantly higher than first quarter due to seasonally higher thinner activity -- thinning activity as well as the deferred harvest activities related to the adverse weather, we experienced during the first quarter. We expect average log sales realizations will be comparable to first quarter. Forestry spending in the South is expected to increase, which is typical coming into the spring month.
In the North, average log sales realizations are expected to increase slightly compared to first quarter, while fee harvest volumes are expected to be significantly lower as we enter the spring breakup season.
I'll wrap up the Timberlands segment with a few comments on our recent Timberlands transactions. In the second quarter, we will report a cash outflow of approximately $149 million for the 69,000-acre Alabama Timberlands acquisition that we completed this week. And as Devin mentioned, we have also announced the sale of our North Cascades acreage, and we expect to complete that transaction in the third quarter. The gain on sale will be reported as a special item within the Timberlands segment.
Turning to our Real Estate, Energy, and Natural Resource segment, real estate markets remained strong into the second quarter, as societal preferences during this time continue to drive robust demand for rural recreational properties. We expect second quarter net earnings and adjusted EBITDA to be moderately lower than first quarter due to timing of transactions. 
We continue to expect full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $255 million, although we now expect land basis as a percentage of real estate sales, to be approximately 35% to 45% for the year due to the mix of properties sold. We continue to anticipate our 2021 real estate activity will be heavily weighted to the first half of the year similar to our cadence in both 2019 and 2020.
For our Wood Products segment, new residential construction activity has remained at very favorable levels, and our builder and dealer customers are anticipating a strong second quarter following the already strong first quarter. In repair and remodel markets, we are seeing a shift from small do-it-yourself improvement projects to larger remodel activity, further solidifying the demand for structural Wood Products within this market. Excluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and oriented strand board, we expect second quarter adjusted EBITDA will be significantly higher than the first quarter.
For lumber, we expect production volumes to increase during the quarter as operating rates are expected to improve following weather-related mill downtime in the first quarter. We expect these higher production volumes to have a favorable impact on our manufacturing costs. We also anticipate this increased supply as well as higher seasonal inventory drawdown to drive higher sales volumes during the quarter.
Oriented strand board is expected to have a slightly lower production level in sales volume and slightly higher manufacturing costs due to an extended outage to complete a planned capital project at our Elkin OSB mill. This equipment has been on site, but installation has been delayed multiple times due to COVID-related travel restrictions and vendor resource availability.
Log costs are expected to be comparable to the first quarter. Entering the second quarter benchmark pricing for oriented strand board and the framing lumber composite have continued to rise beyond the record levels experienced in the first quarter. For lumber, our quarter-to-date average sales realization are approximately $105 higher and current realizations are approximately $130 higher than the first quarter average. For OSB, our quarter-to-date average sales realizations are approximately $135 higher, and our current sales realizations are approximately $185 higher than the first quarter average.
As a reminder, for lumber, every $10 change in realizations is approximately $11 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis. For OSB, every $10 change in realizations is approximately $8 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis.
For Engineered wood products, we expect higher average sales realizations for our solid section and I-joists products as we continue to capture the benefit of price increases announced in August 2020 and January 2021. 
Additionally, in March 2021, we announced a third increase, which ranges from 10% to 25% and will be captured over the next several quarters. This will be partially offset by higher raw material costs.
I'll wrap up with a few additional comments on our total company financial items. We continue to expect full year 2021 interest expense will be approximately $315 million. Additionally, we continue to anticipate 2021 capital expenditures to total $420 million, with most large projects executing in the second half of the year.
Turning to taxes. We continue to expect our full year 2021 effective tax rate will be between 18% and 22% before special items, based on our forecasted mix of earnings between our REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary. As previously discussed, the $90 million tax refund associated with our 2018 pension contribution remains in process. We anticipate receiving this refund in second quarter 2021. Excluding this refund, we continue to expect our 2021 cash taxes will be generally comparable to our overall tax expense.
Now I'll turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions."

Looking forward, the demand for our products is extremely favorable, supported by encouraging macroeconomic conditions and continued resiliency in the U.S. housing and repair and remodel markets. We remain committed to serving our customers and delivering industry-leading performance across our operations.

If you think back to our capital program over the last several years, we have been investing significant amounts of capital across our Wood Products business. In fact, we're doing $300 million of incremental capital this year, part of which, as you note, it goes to the Holden mill, which will increase by about 100 million board feet capacity at that location. 
We continue to get incremental capacity through the capital program that we've had in place for a number of years. Just for reference, if you think back over the last couple of years, our Millport and our Dierks mill brownfield expansions have added about 300 million board feet of incremental capacity, and we continue to put capital to work across our Wood Products and Manufacturing businesses. And it's always a balance, Anthony. We're always looking to continue to drive down costs and improve efficiencies at our mills. One of the cores to our operating strategy on the manufacturing side is to have the best cost structure in the industry so that we can continue to drive good margins regardless of where we are on pricing.
We're going to continue to look for opportunities across our Wood Products manufacturing footprint. Whether we're going to go out and do a greenfield mill? I think as we've said in the past, our inclination is to really focus in the near-term on our existing mill set. And the reason behind that is just we think we can get better risk-adjusted returns by putting that capital to work in our existing mill footprint. 
Now over time, as we continue to work through our capital programs down the road, is there an opportunity for a greenfield? Sure. We're always going to be open to that. But I think in the near term, it's going to be more focused on our existing footprint."

And certainly, we're experiencing incredibly strong pricing right now. And if that continues to play out over the course of the year, we're going to generate very strong cash flow. And as you noted, with our new dividend framework, around 75% to 80% of that is going to go back to shareholders through the base dividend and supplemental dividends. So any cash flow over and above that really goes to our opportunistic options, which are growth, further debt paydown and share repurchase.
As we think about share repurchase specific to your question, Anthony, I think that can be a really good opportunity to return cash to shareholders under the right circumstances, and we continue to view that opportunistically. 
And so to the extent we feel like our shares are trading at a material discount. That's a great way to return cash to shareholders. But absent that, I think preference really is to distribute that via the supplemental dividend."

And ultimately, you can't continue to see housing prices continue to go up at this level year after year. There's obviously some limit where that starts to take some increments of the buying community out of the market. But with low mortgage rates sitting around low 3%, that gives a little bit more flexibility. But again, the reality right now is there is a real shortage of housing in the market, and the demand is just overwhelming.
When we talk to our homebuilder customers, they just -- they have more buyers than they can satisfy at present. And so in that environment, it does give the builders more pricing power, and we're certainly seeing -- you see that in the numbers with the permits and the starts and builder sentiment just a lot of demand for housing. And if you think about it just at a broader level, and we've been saying this for years, the country has been under building for a decade, and you probably saw the Freddie Mac number out where they were estimating 4 million units under built the amount of time it takes to build through that overhang. It's just -- it's a lot of demand. That's ultimately, I think, what keeps the buyer is still there, even though pricing continues to go up."

I was hoping you could give us a bit more granularity to some degree, piggy backing off of Anthony's questions in Wood. One, if you -- we didn't -- if we hold Holden outside of the equation for a minute, what kind of productivity capacity increases might you get around the rest of your network in lumber and OSB this year? 
And recognizing you said significantly, and there are lots of ways to define that, I guess, or throw that into a model. If we take pricing aside and just assumed average pricing in the first quarter to second quarter, what kind of increase would we be looking at for Wood Products 2Q versus 1Q? If you can give us any kind of guardrails around that?"

Well, I'll answer the second question first, and then we'll swing back to the capacity question. So good way to think about it quarter-over-quarter, if you take out lumber and OSB pricing is about $75 million to $100 million of incremental EBIT",260,"Yes, sure. Well, I'll answer the second question first, and then we'll swing back to the capacity question. So good way to think about it quarter-over-quarter, if you take out lumber and OSB pricing is about $75 million to $100 million of incremental EBITDA. And that's really primarily a result of increased lumber volume and the EWP pricing increase rolling through. 
And so where you sit between that $75 million and $100 million really depends on how much OSB prices continue to go up because web stock, obviously, is -- it's an input cost that we have to bear in EWP.
Although I will note we supply almost all, if not all of our web stock comes from our OSB mills. And so we do get that in a different pocket. So that's the range, about $75 million to $100 million.
In terms of incremental capacity, every year through our capital program, you get several percentage -- several percent increase just on the debottlenecking work that we do, you get incremental volume. So that kind of comes year after year just through our normal cost programs in CapEx. We've also added, as I mentioned, about 300 million board feet over the last couple of years. And so that's now rolling through the system. We've got another 100 million coming in Holden. And so we don't necessarily talk about it this way all the time, but we are seeing organic growth in our Wood Products manufacturing operations just through those capital programs, even though they are primarily focused on cost reduction."

The place I would highlight for you that is the most acute is trucking in the south. 
And really across all industries, just with what we're seeing in the economy, the spending across all kinds of different industries, trucking availability is really short. And so that's definitely a challenge really in a lot of different places. The South, as I mentioned, is the most acute issue. But that's really bleeding over into the rail side as well. So securing trucking capacity and rail capacity, it's been a challenge for the industry, something that believe me, we're focused on this 24/7 to make sure that we're getting product to customers and keeping them satisfied. So that's a challenge.
And I think part of it, when you think about having lean inventories, you add the transportation challenge, for customers really across the channel, trying to get product to serve their existing projects and their customers, it just adds one more challenge. And so I think when people can get product on a short-term basis, they're willing to pay really high prices just to secure the product."

So really, Mark, when we think about doing acquisitions or divestitures for that matter, for us, it's very specific to that individual land base. And so certainly, we look at comps to get a sense of what the market looks like. But when we're doing our future cash flow projections, it really goes down to things that are specific to that land. 
The stocking level, the species mix, what we think the road infrastructure looks like, what we think the cost of logging and hauling in that region are going to be. So we do a very, very detailed analysis. We have some tools that we have that, I think, are proprietary to help with that to really dial in on what we think that the cash flow will look like over a period of time. And we layer on top of that, what does the local market conditions look like, and we have a pretty good sense because we're in all of these markets on what we expect market dynamics to look like.
And then we layer on top of that, what are the synergies that we can bring to that specific land, things like leveraging our scale to drive lower log and haul costs, finding opportunities for export or alternative values like solar, wind, HBU. 
So our model bakes all of those things in. And when we look at that particular land down in Alabama, a few things really jump out. It's in a very good market. I would say that Pine Hill, Alabama market is one of the stronger markets in the area. It's growing, both on the sawtimber side, but importantly, it's a strong fiber market, which can really help the economics of owning Timberland. We've got an expanding mill capacity. We've got a diverse set of customers there that we think we can really leverage to drive additional value on that. And it really fits well with our existing Timberlands portfolio. 
We have people on the ground there, so we don't have to add a lot of personnel to manage this incremental land. So when we look at all of these things, good species mix, good site index, good synergies, logistics benefits. It's a really good property for us. It's really one of the better properties that we've looked at in quite a while in the South. And so we're really excited to add that to the portfolio."

So whether you think about carbon opportunities, whether you think about mitigation banks, just a whole host of opportunities that we have owning so much land, there's just inherent optionality when you have a large land base like we do. 
And one of the things that we're really excited about with Russell stepping into this role is to further take advantage of some of that optionality. So we're really excited.

You think about a couple of things that we've seen in the infrastructure bill. Obviously, there's a housing component that is embedded in the infrastructure bill. And so incremental housing demand, obviously, is supportive for the industry and driving incremental demand. But even when you look more broadly, roads, highways, bridges, other infrastructure, certainly, a lot of that is going to be concrete and steel. But you do have incremental demand anytime you have infrastructure spending with concrete forms and just other incremental lumber or plywood or OSB that you see when those projects are put out. 
And so just kind of a rough order of magnitude guess from our standpoint is, if this does get passed and not even considering necessarily the housing piece, you could see another 1 billion, 1.5 billion board feet of incremental demand on the lumber side coming out of an infrastructure program. 
And so we'll dial that estimate in as we get closer to get more clarity on what an infrastructure bill looks like. But I do think that if you see a bill of this magnitude come to fruition, it's going to have incremental demand implications for our industry."

I think at a high level, the reality is many of the markets across south are still oversupplied from a log standpoint. And so when we think about what's going to change that? It's a couple of things: One, it is continued capacity coming into the South, and we've seen a lot of that. We continue to see announcements coming in for new mills being built in the South. Lumber, we see pellet mills coming into the South. So the trajectory is right. 
I think also to the extent that you have land that's proximate to ports. I feel really optimistic about the export opportunity. We're seeing great demand into China, India is a growing market. We're sending chips into Turkey. So I think there are opportunities to continue to expand the pull into offshore markets, and so that can have a tensioning effect. 
But really, the third piece, Mark, is just time. We need some time for these new mills to come on board and to chew through some of the inventory. And so that's something that will continue to happen. It's going to be differential by market.
Again, when you think about places like Pine Hill, Alabama or their spots in Louisiana and Arkansas, and South Carolina, North Carolina, where you've seen some capacity come in, you see things starting to tighten up a bit in the local area. But really, it's something that's going to take some time to work through, and it will be differential.
One note I would make on that front. While southern -- average southern sawlog prices across the south is moderately interesting to us. What's really interesting is what's happening in the Wood baskets where we have fee Timberland. And so I can tell you, and this goes back to something that Russell and his team are working, we want to make sure that when new mill capacity comes into the South, that it's being cited in a geography that fits well with our fee Timberland. So we're having lots of conversations with people about how we can help them. If they decide to put a mill in a geography, that's a place where we have fee Timberland. So we're working all of those things.
As you think about how does that translate into M&A, it's differential. Most of the players in the market are pretty astute in terms of understanding local supply-demand dynamics. So people will bake in what they think is going to happen in that Wood basket over time as they put valuations into their model."

So we're doing a good job getting through that salvage operation. I mean that is a monumental effort when you think about 125,000 acres that were impacted by the fire, that's a bigger impact than we saw Mount St. Helens, just to put it into context. And so the team has done a great job of organizing contractor and trucking availability in the region so we can get after that quickly. Our expectation is that we're going to get through the vast majority of the salvage work in 2021. So I would expect to have that mostly complete this year.
We're obviously trying to get at it as fast as we can so that we can make sure we're capturing the maximum value of those salvage logs before you start to see any sort of degradation in the Wood. So we're going to be trying to do as much as we can in Q2 and Q3. And that really has a few impacts. One of which, to your question is it does have an impact on mix because we're harvesting a lot of acres that are younger than ordinarily would be the case. 
And so that adds smaller diameter logs into the market. And what we're seeing, primarily in Oregon is the mix of log volume into the market is a lot more smaller log. That's true -- that's the case for us, but it's also, I think, broadly speaking, the case in the market. So that brings realizations down a little bit, and that will be a little bit of a headwind in Q2 and Q3.
The flip side of that is that puts a bit of a premium on larger logs into the system. And so you're seeing a little bit of an uplift there. So I think it's going to be a little bit of a headwind, Q2, Q3, which is why we said domestic pricing in the West is going to be down a little bit in Q2. That's really just a function of those smaller salvage logs going into the market.
The one other point I would just make there is, as you think about 2021 for us in the West, salvage logging is obviously a little bit more expensive. And so there's a little bit of a cost headwind in the West for the next couple of quarters as well."

I'm extremely proud of our team's accomplis",1293,"Thank you, Beth. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported second quarter net earnings of $1 billion or $1.37 per diluted share on net sales of $3.1 billion. I'm extremely proud of our team's accomplishments in the second quarter. Their collective efforts delivered the company's strongest quarterly adjusted EBITDA on record at $1.6 billion, surpassing last quarter's record by 43%. Our year-to-date adjusted EBITDA is almost $2 billion higher than the first half of 2020. Wood Products delivered another record quarter at $1.4 billion of adjusted EBITDA, surpassing last quarter's record by 56%. 
Turning now to our second quarter business results. I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands on Pages 5 through 8 of our earnings slides. Timberlands earnings and adjusted EBITDA improved by approximately 5% compared with the first quarter. In the West, adjusted EBITDA increased slightly in the second quarter. Western domestic markets remained favorable despite the decline in lumber prices late in the quarter and a healthy supply of logs to the market. Demand remains strong as mills took precautionary measures to bolster log inventories in response to an early fire season resulting from persistent dry conditions in a period of extremely high temperatures. This steady demand pull drove our sales volumes modestly higher during the second quarter. 
Salvage operations from last year's fires in Oregon are continuing to supply an abundance of smaller diameter logs to the market. Consequently, prices for smaller diameter logs in Oregon have experienced some downward pressure. As a result of this dynamic, our domestic sales realizations were slightly lower in the quarter. To date, we've harvested nearly 2/3 of our planned salvage volume in Oregon. Salvage productivity has slowed somewhat as warm summer weather arrived early and we began to transition salvage harvest operations into higher elevation tracks, which generally have lower productivity and higher operating costs. 
Forestry and road costs were seasonally higher during the quarter as we do a significant amount of this work during the warmer summer months. Turning to our export markets. In Japan and China, demand for our logs remained strong, and our sales realizations increased significantly. Global logistics constraints, particularly with respect to shipping container availability and strong North American lumber prices continued to impact the availability of imported lumber into Japan and China. This has resulted in strong demand for locally produced lumber and increased demand for imported logs. Additionally, a ban on Australian logs continues to reduce the supply of imported logs to China. Our China sales volumes increased in the quarter as we intentionally flexed volume from the domestic market to capitalize on strong demand signals and pricing from our Chinese customers. 
Moving to the South. Southern Timberlands' adjusted EBITDA increased by approximately 10% compared with the first quarter. Southern sawlog markets improved due to record lumber and panel pricing for most of the quarter and supply limitations resulting from persistent wet weather. Fiber markets also strengthened as mill inventories remain lean and wet conditions constrained supply. As a result, our sales realizations were slightly higher than the first quarter. Fee and sales volumes were significantly higher in the quarter despite impacts from multiple heavy rain events across the Gulf South. The wet weather in the quarter did, however, limit our ability to catch up on delayed harvest from the first quarter snow and ice events. Log and haul costs increased slightly, and forestry and road costs were seasonally higher. Although Southern export represents a small component of our operations, we continue to see strengthening demand signals from China and India, resulting in increases in both sales volumes and realizations in the second quarter. However, container availability and increased freight rates continue to be a notable headwind. 
In the North, adjusted EBITDA decreased slightly compared to the first quarter due to significantly lower sales volumes associated with seasonal spring breakup conditions, partially offset by significantly higher sales realizations. Turning to real estate, energy and natural resources on Pages 9 and 10. Earnings and adjusted EBITDA decreased by approximately 5% compared with the first quarter due to timing of real estate sales and mix of properties sold, but were significantly higher than the year ago quarter. Earnings increased by more than 230% compared with the second quarter of 2020. Demand for HBU properties has been very strong year-to-date and average price per acre remains elevated compared to historical levels. We continue to capitalize on this market and have been increasing our prices in many regions. This is resulting in a steady stream of high-value transactions with significant premiums to timber. In Energy and Natural Resources, production of construction materials increased as demand remained strong during the quarter. 
Wood Products, Pages 11 through 13. Wood Products earnings and adjusted EBITDA improved by almost $0.5 billion compared with the prior quarter. Our lumber, OSB and distribution businesses all established new quarterly adjusted EBITDA records in the second quarter. These exceptional results were delivered, notwithstanding ongoing challenges with transportation and resin availability in the quarter. I want to specifically call out and thank our supply chain and logistics teams for their tremendous work in helping us successfully navigate these headwinds. In the lumber market, average framing lumber composite pricing increased 29% compared with the first quarter. Lumber demand was strong during the first half of the quarter, but began to soften as do-it-yourself repair and remodel activity weakened toward the latter part of May. The drop-off in the do-it-yourself segment, largely a result of changing consumer spending habits coming out of COVID restrictions and to some extent, record high lumber prices resulted in lower sales activity and higher inventories at the home centers and treaters. As a result, lumber prices peaked in late May and retreated at a rapid pace for the remainder of the quarter. 
Although inventories at home centers and treaters increased, inventory levels at dealers and distributors serving the homebuilding and professional repair and remodel segments remained below normal at quarter end. Buyer positioning remains cautious with the reluctance to build meaningful inventory positions and a dynamic pricing environment. Adjusted EBITDA for lumber increased $291 million or 57% compared with the first quarter. Our sales realizations increased by 25% and sales volumes increased moderately. Log costs increased slightly in the second quarter, primarily for Canadian logs. OSB markets experienced historic strength in the second quarter as demand continued to outpace supply. Inventories remain lean throughout the channel and supply constraints persisted due to resin availability and transportation challenges. As a result, pricing continued to accelerate to record levels before peaking at the end of the quarter. 
Average OSB composite pricing increased 52% compared with the first quarter. OSB adjusted EBITDA increased by $172 million or 57% compared to the first quarter. Our sales realizations improved by 48%. Production and sales volumes decreased modestly and unit manufacturing costs increased, primarily due to a planned extended maintenance outage to complete a capital project at our Elk in OSB mill. Fiber costs were slightly higher in the quarter, primarily for Canadian logs. Engineered Wood Products adjusted EBITDA increased $11 million compared to the first quarter, a 26% improvement. Sales realizations improved across all products, and we continue to benefit from the price increases announced over the last year for solid section and I-joists products. This was partially offset by higher raw material costs for oriented strand board web stock, resin and veneer. Sales and production volumes increased for solid section and I-joists products. 
In Distribution, adjusted EBITDA increased $36 million compared to the first quarter, a 92% improvement as strong demand drove higher sales volumes for most products and the business captured improved margins. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Nancy to discuss some financial items and our third quarter outlook."

I'll begin with our key financial items, which are summarized on Page 15. We generated over $1.3 billion of cash from operations in the second quarter and over $2 billion year-to-date. These are our highest fi",1250,"Thank you, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with our key financial items, which are summarized on Page 15. We generated over $1.3 billion of cash from operations in the second quarter and over $2 billion year-to-date. These are our highest first half operating cash flows on record. Adjusted funds available for distribution or adjusted FAD for year-to-date second quarter 2021 totaled nearly $1.9 billion, with approximately $1.2 billion related to second quarter operations, as highlighted on Page 16. Year-to-date, we have returned $255 million to our shareholders through payment of our quarterly base dividend. As a reminder, we target a total return to shareholders of 75% to 80% of our annual adjusted FAD; in the case of 2021, the majority will be returned to the variable supplemental component of our new dividend framework. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.8 billion of cash and just under $5.3 billion of debt. During the second quarter, we repaid our $225 million variable rate term loan due in 2026 and incurred no early extinguishment charges. We plan to repay our $150 million 9% note when it matures in the fourth quarter. Looking forward, key outlook items for the third quarter and full year 2021 are presented on Pages 17 and 18. In our Timberlands business, we expect third quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be approximately $25 million lower than second quarter. Turning to our Western Timberland operations. Domestic mills ended the second quarter with ample inventory. We anticipate slightly lower domestic log sales realizations in the third quarter, absent significant fire-related disruption. This is primarily due to modestly lower pricing for smaller diameter sawlogs. We expect large log pricing will remain favorable due to limited supply and strong export demand. 
We anticipate seasonally higher forestry and road spending as those activities accelerate with favorable weather conditions. Typical of the drier, warmer summer months, harvest activity will focus on higher elevation tracks where operations are less productive, resulting in slightly lower fee harvest volumes and higher per unit log and haul costs. Moving to the export markets. In Japan, log demand remains strong. We expect our third quarter sales realizations and log sales volumes to be generally comparable to the second quarter. In China, we anticipate significantly higher sales volumes and slightly higher sales realization. Although Chinese log demand generally moderates during the summer rainy season, we expect demand for U.S. logs will remain strong as imports from other countries remain constrained. 
In the South, we anticipate significantly higher fee harvest volumes as well as higher per unit log and haul costs during the third quarter due to a seasonal increase in activity. Although our sawlog and fiber log pricing should be comparable to the second quarter, we expect average sales realizations will be slightly lower due to a higher percentage mix of fiber logs. We also expect seasonally higher forestry and road costs as most of this activity is completed during these dryer summer months. 
In the North, sales realizations are expected to be lower due to mix, while fee harvest volumes are expected to be significantly higher as we come out of the spring breakup season. I'll wrap up the Timberlands outlook with a comment on the sale of our North Cascades Timberland, which was completed on July 7. In the third quarter, we will record a cash inflow of $261 million and a gain of approximately $30 million related to this transaction. The gain will be reported as a special item within the Timberlands segment. Turning to our real estate, energy and natural resources segment. We expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA will be comparable to the third quarter 2020, but earnings will be approximately $20 million higher than 1 year ago due to a lower average land basis on the mix of properties sold. 
As Devin mentioned, we continue to capitalize on exceptionally strong demand and pricing for HBU properties. In addition, we've seen strong year-to-date production of construction materials. As a result, we are increasing our guidance for full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA to $290 million. We now expect land basis as a percentage of real estate sales to be approximately 30% to 35% for the year. For our Wood Products segment, third quarter benchmark pricing for lumber has significantly reduced from record levels and benchmark pricing for oriented strand board has also recently declined. As a result, we are expecting adjusted EBITDA will be significantly lower in the third quarter. For lumber, our quarter-to-date realizations are approximately $425 lower, and current realizations are approximately $535 lower than the second quarter average. 
For OSB, our current realizations are still significantly higher than the second quarter average due to the length of our order files. Our quarter-to-date OSB realizations are approximately $155 higher and current realizations are approximately $125 higher than the second quarter average. As a reminder, for lumber, every $10 change in realizations is approximately $11 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis. And for OSB, every $10 change in realizations is approximately $8 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis. For lumber, as prices have retreated, we expect higher sales volumes as inventories at home centers and treaters normalize and demand signals improve for do-it-yourself activity. We are also anticipating improved unit manufacturing costs during the quarter. We anticipate this will be partially offset by slightly higher costs for Canadian and Western logs. For oriented strand board, we expect demand will remain favorable due to continued strength in new residential construction activity. We expect improved operating rates following the second quarter outage to complete the capital project at our Elkin OSB mill previously mentioned. 
With increased operating rates, we anticipate higher third quarter sales volumes and improved manufacturing costs. These improvements are expected to be partially offset by higher fiber costs. For Engineered Wood Products, we expect higher sales realizations for our solid section and I-joists products as we continue to benefit from previously announced price increases. In May 2021, we announced another increase, which ranges from 15% to 25% and will be captured over the next several quarters. We anticipate significantly higher raw material costs, primarily for oriented strand board web stock, as the cost of web stock lags benchmark OSB pricing by approximately 1/4. For our Distribution business, we're expecting the recent declines in commodity pricing will result in reduced margins and significantly lower adjusted EBITDA. Business results are expected to remain strong compared to a historical perspective. 
I'll wrap up with a couple of additional comments on our total company financial items. Each year in the second quarter, we finalize prior year-end estimates for pension assets and liabilities. As a result, we recorded a $138 million improvement in our net funded status as well as a reduction in our noncash, nonoperating pension and post-employment expense. Slide 18 includes our current full year outlook for pension and post-employment items. It also shows the $40 million capital expenditure increase we announced back in June for some additional high-return projects across our businesses. 
Turning to taxes. We are now -- we now expect our effective tax rate to be between 20% to 24% based on the forecasted mix of earnings between our REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary. The $90 million tax refund associated with our 2018 pension contribution has now been approved, and we expect to receive the refund in the third quarter of 2021. So now I'll turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions."

Before wrapping up this morning, I'll make a few comments on the housing and repair and remodel markets. U.S. housing activity continues at an impressive pace, with total housing starts in the second quarter averaging 1.6 million units on a seasonally adjusted basis and total permits averaging 1.7 million units. Single-family starts in June reached their highest monthly level since May of 2007. Notwithstanding a slight pullback in the second quarter as homebuilders navigated supply chain disruptions, year-to-date momentum is strong, and our customers continue to expect robust housing activity over the back half of the year. Our near-term and longer-term housing outlook remains very favorable and is bolstered by encouraging long-term housing demand fundamentals. 
Turning to repair and remodel. Although demand for small do-it-yourself projects has softened from the elevated levels established in the pandemic, demand for larger professional remodels remains healthy. Our long-term outlook for repair and remodel continues to be favorable, supported by an aging housing stock, rising home equity and low interest rates. In closing, we delivered our best financial performance on record in the second quarter, and we're well positioned to capitalize on favorable demand fundamentals for U.S. housing. Looking forward, we remain focused on industry-leading performance across our operations and are on track to deliver our 2021 OpEx target of $50 million to $75 million. Our balance sheet is extremely strong and with year-to-date adjusted FAD of nearly $1.9 billion, we expect to return significant amounts of cash to shareholders through the variable supplemental component of our new dividend framework. 
And finally, I'm pleased to announce that we will hold a virtual Investor Day on September 22. Nancy, Russell and I will give an update on our key longer-term strategic, capital allocation and sustainability initiatives. Event details and registration instructions will be included in a press release later this morning. We're excited to share that update and we'll look forward to speaking with you all again in September. And now I'd like to open up the floor for questions."

Obviously, lumber and OSB pricing for that matter, reached historically high levels this spring. And that was really a function of housing and repair and remodel just being very strong through most of the spring into May. We've seen the pricing come off significantly here recently. Although I will mention pricing is still reasonably strong by historical measures. And I'd say what's been going on of late is really primarily a function of the smaller do-it-yourself market. We've seen that over the past couple of months come down 15% to 20% in terms of our sales into that market in June and July relative to the spring. So that's caused a little bit of inventory to build up in the home improvement warehouse and treater segments, which -- that's really been sort of the pricing pressure as the producers look to move that product that would have gone into those markets to other customers. In terms of how we're looking at the current situation and as we head into fall, I think the do-it-yourself market should be picking back up here. In fact, even just this week, we've seen a little bit of a pickup there in terms of sales activity into the home improvement warehouse and the treaters. So I think that's going to start picking up, and we would expect that to accelerate. As we get into the fall, you'll see cooler weather, you'll see kids going back to school, vacation season will be winding down. And frankly, I think just the moderation in lumber prices, I suspect some of the downtick in the do-it-yourself was a little bit of sticker shock with the high lumber prices and all the that, that was getting. So in terms of the pricing environment, we think, first of all, I wouldn't be surprised at all to have seen the lumber prices over correct a little bit. We've seen that in the past when prices have come down. We're expecting that to settle into a range that's certainly higher than historical levels, albeit probably not at the record levels that we saw earlier in the spring. A couple of comments just on inventory. I think it's differential depending on what part of the channel you're talking about. I think in the home improvement warehouse and treater segment, it's probably still a little bit elevated relative to normal. But when you look at the builder and the dealer portions, I think that's probably a little lower than normal as they really haven't wanted to build inventory in a dynamic pricing environment. I will say with respect to your question about cash costs, certainly, I think, in British Columbia, with the increase in log prices and some of the other dynamics there, it's entirely possible that a segment of the BC manufacturers have gone below cash cost where pricing went. So we'll see how that develops. I do think overall, probably the cost floor in North America has gone up a little bit because of that dynamic relative to history. So again, we're expecting residential construction should remain strong. The Pro segment of repair and remodel should stay strong, and that do-it-yourself segment should start picking up here as we head into fall. So overall, we're expecting pricing to settle into a new range that's still very strong pricing by any historical context."

It was a little slow, I'd say, for the first half of the year, but certainly, we see that picking up. In terms of valuations, we've definitely seen a pickup in interest in quality timberland, and that's a statement both in the West and in the South. You can see that in some of the valuations of recently announced deals. I think there is a lot of interest in this space. The ESG piece, the carbon piece, I think that may be playing into it a little bit. But I do think, certainly, we're seeing those valuations tick up a bit. Certainly, that's what we're seeing in the market. With respect to our activity, as we've always said, we are always looking to optimize and improve the quality of our timberlands to grow the value of our timber base. That's something we're doing day in, day out. And sometimes that's on the sell side, but that's also on the buy side. You've seen us with Oregon and Alabama, a couple of transactions of late. So we're always looking. We look at every deal that comes through. I think we'll continue to be active in that space. Russell and his team are looking at deals. They're having lots of conversations. But you've got to be disciplined. And so we'll remain disciplined and execute on deals that make good financial sense and that are value accretive for us. So we expect to be active. We'll continue to look in terms of just growing and optimizing and improving our timber base."

No one wants to order and then see just as that -- those sticks of lumber showing up for price to head lower, yet your, as a dealer distributor, taking on the risk that prices and demand start to pick up on you and you're left with low inventories. What do you think will will break that logjam? Are you seeing any signs at all that the distributors and deals are beginning to rebuild inventory or maybe not just because of where prices are, we're going to be in this period of very, very low hand-to-mouth kind of ordering, which might not be the best thing for you. How do you see that shaking out?"

That's the dynamic that plays out in our markets day in, day out and has for a very long time. When you have pricing that's in a falling environment, people are going to be very cautious about building inventories. And I t",367,"Yes. Well, you're exactly right. That's the dynamic that plays out in our markets day in, day out and has for a very long time. When you have pricing that's in a falling environment, people are going to be very cautious about building inventories. And I think what really starts to bring people back into the market is 1 of 2 things. First, get a sense that you've really started to bottom out in terms of what's going on in the pricing environment. You look at what's going on today. In fact, the print last night, it showed that we saw the smallest downtick in pricing that we've seen in 10 or 11 weeks. I think because of the fires in British Columbia, there are some other dynamics that are going on that perhaps are starting to give people to feel that we've reached the floor and things will start normalizing upwards. That usually gives people some confidence to start building inventory. The second thing is it's always a matter of if you're in that space, you have to make sure that you're supplying your customers. And so to the extent that you feel like there's any risk whatsoever that you're going to have enough inventory to meet your customer demands, then people will have to come in. I'd say with the fire situation, with some of the transportation challenges what we're hearing from the builder customers in terms of their outlook for the back half of the year, it's a careful dance for them to make sure that they don't get too low and get caught short. And we've seen what happens when that dynamic has played out, and that usually results in pricing ticking up relatively quickly. So I wouldn't say in terms of the dealer distributor network, we've seen them really start to build material inventories at this point. Although as I said earlier, we have seen the home improvement warehouse and treaters start coming back. Even this week, there's been a little bit of an uptick that we've noticed to the extent that, that gains momentum and starts pulling inventory out of the system, you could see that dynamic change here relatively quickly."

I want to switch gears for my second question, kind of a 2-part on timber. We've heard of some disruptions in China as they've been, in particular with remediating, redoing the way they handle timber. And from what we gathered, inventories are relatively high. So I was a little pleasantly surprised that you're still seeing strong demand on timber into China. If you could explain why you think that's happening and to some degree why the U.S. is gaining share versus other regions? And then, in the South, I want to say prices have begun to pick up on stumpage, a couple $3 a ton year-on-year. You're starting to see some commentary now that prices are lifting for more than seasonal reasons. Do you buy that? Or are you fairly skeptical of that, and you think we're still in a flat, perhaps deflationary period on a real basis in terms of timber"

I'll cover the China question first. And the China market has been very strong for us this year. Pricing has been well above what we've seen really in a number of years. Part of that has been the supply chain challenges from European exporte",610,"Well, thanks. I'll cover the China question first. And the China market has been very strong for us this year. Pricing has been well above what we've seen really in a number of years. Part of that has been the supply chain challenges from European exporters, the ban on Australian logs. But all of those things have come together and really opened that market back up from North American logs. And so that's been a really nice market for us. As you mentioned, the inventory levels at the ports at the end of June did go up 5.5 million cubic meters, which is up from May. Take away at the ports down a little bit overall, and I'll get to Weyerhaeuser specific comments momentarily. But there are a few things that are driving that, George. I mean, first of all, there's always a little bit of a tick down in demand when you get into the hot rainy season. We see that every year into China. So that's a piece of it. But there are also some regulatory issues. They've had some increased environmental inspections. And the big one you mentioned, which is just a changing dynamic at the port, which is one of the largest log import facilities. And what they're doing is essentially they're trying to push the sawmills deeper And so there's a little bit of a dynamic going on there, where they're trying to move some of those mills away from that port. That happens from time to time in China. It will get resolved. We're still very optimistic that you're still going to need a lot of logs imported into that China market. So I think that's really more of a temporary issue. For us, in particular, our Chinese customer log demand is still very strong, pricing is strong, and so we're actually contemplating or expecting rather to have our export volume into China up quarter-over-quarter, Q3 versus Q2. So a little bit of dynamic going on there just from the items I mentioned, but we're still very positive about that market over the back half of the year. Moving to the Southern market. Obviously, we have seen a bit of an uptick in pricing. I think there are 2 things going on there. One of them is certainly the weather dynamic. When you see multiple wet weather events in the South that keeps the logging out of the woods for a period of time, which limits the supply to the sawmills and the pulp mills. And that's been going on over the course of the summer and the spring. And that's really particularly on the pulp log that's kept inventories pretty low for this time of year, and so that's been a piece of it. But I do think there's also an increment of that, which is in certain geographies, the new sawmill capacity that's come in. And we've been talking about this for several years. If you put 7 billion board feet of new capacity into the South, in those wood baskets where that new capacity is coming, you see a tensioning effect. And so I don't think it's going to be a hockey stick by any stretch of the imagination. It's just going to be slow, steady improvement across different geographies. And so we think that's going to slowly tension a number of wood baskets. And again, it's going to be specific to each geography, but that will continue to happen. We've seen a number of mills announced even just recently, and we expect that to continue here for the foreseeable future because the South is a great place to manufacture lumber."

I would say that, that is something, I think, over time will continue to be a competitive advantage for us. I think we do silviculture and forestry very well. We have a lot of great folks, a lot of PhDs, a lot of foresters that are working every day to make sure that we're driving the best yield across our land base. And so I think it is an important part. I will say, even when you think about climate change, for example, the ability of our teams to really make sure that we're using the right seed for example, as the climate gets warmer and really targeting the that we're planting across our landscape to ensure that we're maximizing the growth and the survival in a changing landscape. So it is definitely something that's still very important in the core to what we do even if we're not talking about it on a day-to-day basis as much."

So there's a desire to make improvements there. But I think you're right, the improvements that we've seen to date have really been around the margins. I think it's tough to really fundamentally change how we build houses, and that's going to be a slow process. And I'm not sure if we're having this conversation 3, 4, 5 years from now, you're going to see a real material change in the way that we build homes. You'll probably see continued improvements around the margin, but it's an established supply chain in terms of how we build this -- build these homes.

Nothing in the near term that we're expecting from our production, specifically around natural disasters or fires. That being said, every year, we have to stay nimble and adjust as we see these things play out. And so that's something on a day-to-day basis that can change, but nothing to announce here at this point. I will say over time, certainly, the environment that we're seeing with forest fires in the West and some of the natural hurricanes, other events in the South, it's something that you have to bake into your long-term planning. And so as we see British Columbia, for example, having another serious fire season, well, obviously, over time, those trees are not available for wood products manufacturing.

And so unlike lumber and OSB that have a little heavier component of repair and remodel, the EWP market is primarily residential construction, which really hasn't seen any sort of noticeable slowdown and nor are we expecting that for the back half of the year. So the dynamic there is a little different than lumber and OSB. And part of the issue there, too, is with the run-up in OSB web stock prices, the resin challenges, the near pricing, some of the input costs for making EWP have gone up quite a bit as well. So there's that balance in terms of the pricing for EWP to overcome some of those raw material costs. Absent something happening on the residential construction market, I think we feel pretty good about capturing that pricing increase that we announced in May."

We're probably dialing back in the sense that we're not trying to run those extra shifts in overtime hours that we were earlier in the spring when you had the pricing at all-time peak. So it's really dialed back to a more normal operating posture. But that's something that we look at closely all the time. The fire situation is something I do think we're keeping a close eye on, as I mentioned, no real impact to our timberlands at this point, and we've still got reasonable log decks across the Northwest in Washington and Oregon. But that's something that obviously we'll watch closely. British Columbia, we only have the 1 mill in British Columbia. I would say the fire situation up there is probably even a little worse than it is in Washington and Oregon. A lot of the logging activity has ceased at this point in BC in a number of operating areas just because of the fire situation.

But that being said, the log costs and other costs associated with operating BC have gone up, and I think that's raised the cost floor.

And that's something I think the market is probably just starting to digest the magnitude of what that variable dividend is going to be. So I think as our investor base and the market gets more familiar with the new dividend structure, starts to see the benefit as we pay out that variable dividend, we should start seeing the share price better reflect the underlying value. The other thing I'd say is we're optimistic that the other actions that we're taking to position the company for the future including our increased focus on natural climate solutions and some of the other business development opportunities are really going to be a catalyst to drive investor interest and advance -- enhance our market valuation over time."

As we've said, we certainly do intend to grow the base dividend over time. That's a core part of our overall dividend philosophy and framework. We want that base dividend to be sustainable and supportable from the cash that we generate across our businesses, over business cycles. So the growth in the base dividend is largely going to be driven from the growth in our more stable Timberlands and ENR businesses. And that can come from a variety of different angles, the organic growth in the business, taking costs out, disciplined acquisitions. The key is incremental cash flow that's sustainable across the bottom of market cycles. But certainly, we intend to grow that over time. And I'd note, just as you think about the overall dividend framework, obviously, when the pricing environment is strong or even reasonable, we're going to generate significant cash flow that will get distributed out to the shareholders over and above that base dividend. So I think the short answer to your question is the market is still digesting how this is going to work. I think as they start to see the variable dividend come into play, as they start to see the base dividend grow over time, there will be an increased appreciation for how this is going to work over time."

So I would say -- and I'm going to answer this by West and by South because there are slightly different dynamics going on in each market. In the West, we're seeing good pricing this year. It's a very tensioned wood basket. And so as long as lumber demand and lumber pricing is reasonable, that's going to be a good, strong business. We saw a little bit, obviously, of a dip in harvest levels as a result of the Oregon fires last year. We'll work through that salvage this year, and you'll start to see the harvest levels kind of ticking up slowly here over time. So we feel really good about that business. I think it will continue to be strong here for the foreseeable future. The South, obviously, we've had some disconnects between demand and supply, just in terms of the amount of inventory out in the woods coming out of the Great Recession. We've talked about that quite a bit. And I do think that there are markets within the South -- geographies within the South that are starting to tension up a little bit, and that's largely a function of new capacity coming in. That's continuing to happen. We've got, for example, several mills that have been announced, the mill, the Idaho Forest Products Mill, Mississippi, the Tolko mill that was just announced in Louisiana, and those are in good wood baskets for us. And as we continue to see that play out over time, I think that will just put pressure on pricing to slowly recover. I don't think that's going to happen overnight. It's a process that's going to play out over a number of years. But directionally, I'm feeling good about where we're going there. From an overall margin standpoint, putting aside pricing, we are very focused on operational excellence. Our operating performance, I think, is very good in that business, but we're trying to improve every day. That's part of our OpEx program. We put new targets out every year to increase the efficiency and lower cost. And so I feel good about the margin improvement opportunity there as well. So we've got good businesses. We've got good people, the overall story around housing and repair and remodel demand to drive  demand through the system, I think, is positive. So we feel good about both of those businesses."

And in the West, we typically move up the hill, the higher cost elevation units or higher elevation units. So that's a typical seasonal pattern. Q2, we did ramp up harvest, certainly relative to Q1. There has been a lot of rainy weather in the south. And so we weren't able to catch up as much of the Q1 issues that we saw with the ice storms as we had anticipated. I expect we'll most of that up over the back half of the year, absent weather events that are hard to control. So you'll see the harvest activity pick up cost activity is -- cost typically in Q4 are a little better because it's the reverse the dynamics I just mentioned.

This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported second quarter net earnings of $1 billion or $1.37 per diluted share on net sales of $3.1 billion. I'm extremely proud of our team's accomplishments in the second quarter. Their collective efforts delivered the company's strongest quarterly adjusted EBITDA on record at $1.6 billion, surpassing last quarter's record by 43%. 
Our year-to-date adjusted EBITDA is almost $2 billion higher than the first half of 2020. Wood Products delivered another record quarter at $1.4 billion of adjusted EBITDA, surpassing last quarter's record by 56%.
Turning now to our second quarter business results. I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands on Pages 5 through 8 of our earnings slides. Timberlands' earnings and adjusted EBITDA improved by approximately 5% compared with the first quarter. In the West, adjusted EBITDA increased slightly in the second quarter. Western domestic markets remained favorable despite the decline in lumber prices late in the quarter and a healthy supply of logs to the market. 
Demand remained strong as mills took precautionary measures to bolster log inventories in response to an early fire season resulting from persistent dry conditions in a period of extremely high temperatures. This steady demand pull drove our sales volumes modestly higher during the second quarter.
Salvage operations from last year's fires in Oregon are continuing to supply an abundance of smaller diameter logs to the market. Consequently, prices for smaller diameter logs in Oregon have experienced some downward pressure. As a result of this dynamic, our domestic sales realizations were slightly lower in the quarter. To date, we've harvested nearly 2/3 of our planned salvage volume in Oregon. 
Salvage productivity has slowed somewhat as warm summer weather arrived early, and we began to transition salvage harvest operations into higher elevation tracks, which generally have lower productivity and higher operating costs.  Forestry and road costs were seasonally higher during the quarter, as we do a significant amount of this work during the warmer summer months.
Turning to our export markets. In Japan and China, demand for our logs remained strong, and our sales realizations increased significantly. Global logistics constraints, particularly with respect to shipping container availability and strong North American lumber prices, continued to impact the availability of imported lumber into Japan and China. This has resulted in strong demand for locally produced lumber and increased demand for imported logs. 
Additionally, a ban on Australian logs continues to reduce the supply of imported logs to China. Our China sales volumes increased in the quarter, as we intentionally flexed volume from the domestic market to capitalize on strong demand signals and pricing from our Chinese customers.
Moving to the South. Southern Timberlands' adjusted EBITDA increased by approximately 10% compared with the first quarter. Southern sawlog markets improved due to record lumber and panel pricing for most of the quarter and supply limitations resulting from persistent wet weather. Fiber markets also strengthened as mill inventories remain lean and wet conditions constrained supply. As a result, our sales realizations were slightly higher than the first quarter. 
Fee and sales volumes were significantly higher in the quarter despite impacts from multiple heavy rain events across the Gulf South. The wet weather in the quarter did, however, limit our ability to catch up on delayed harvest from the first quarter snow and ice events. Log and haul costs increased slightly, and forestry and road costs were seasonally higher. Although Southern export represents a small component of our operations, we continue to see strengthening demand signals from China and India, resulting in increases in both sales volumes and realizations in the second quarter. However, container availability and increased freight rates continue to be a notable headwind.
In the North, adjusted EBITDA decreased slightly compared to the first quarter due to significantly lower sales volumes associated with seasonal spring breakup conditions, partially offset by significantly higher sales realizations. 
Turning to real estate, energy and natural resources, on Pages 9 and 10. Earnings and adjusted EBITDA decreased by approximately 5% compared with the first quarter due to timing of real estate sales and mix of properties sold, but were significantly higher than the year ago quarter. Earnings increased by more than 230% compared with the second quarter of 2020.
Demand for HBU properties has been very strong year-to-date and average price per acre remains elevated compared to historical levels. We continue to capitalize on this market and have been increasing our prices in many regions. This is resulting in a steady stream of high-value transactions with significant premiums to timber. In Energy and Natural Resources, production of construction materials increased as demand remained strong during the quarter.
Wood Products, Pages 11 through 13. Wood Products earnings and adjusted EBITDA improved by almost $0.5 billion compared with the prior quarter. Our lumber, OSB and distribution businesses all established new quarterly adjusted EBITDA records in the second quarter. These exceptional results were delivered, notwithstanding ongoing challenges with transportation and resin availability in the quarter. I want to specifically call out and thank our supply chain and logistics teams for their tremendous work in helping us successfully navigate these headwinds. 
In the lumber market, average framing lumber composite pricing increased 29% compared with the first quarter. Lumber demand was strong during the first half of the quarter, but began to soften as do-it-yourself repair and remodel activity weakened toward the latter part of May. The drop-off in the do-it-yourself segment, largely a result of changing consumer spending habits coming out of COVID restrictions and to some extent record high lumber prices resulted in lower sales activity and higher inventories at the home centers and treaters. As a result, lumber prices peaked in late May and retreated at a rapid pace for the remainder of the quarter. 
Although inventories at home centers and treaters increased, inventory levels at dealers and distributors serving the homebuilding and professional repair and remodel segments remained below normal at quarter end. Buyer positioning remains cautious with the reluctance to build meaningful inventory positions and a dynamic pricing environment. Adjusted EBITDA for lumber increased $291 million or 57% compared with the first quarter. Our sales realizations increased by 25% and sales volumes increased moderately. Log costs increased slightly in the second quarter, primarily for Canadian logs. 
OSB markets experienced historic strength in the second quarter as demand continued to outpace supply. Inventories remain lean throughout the channel, and supply constraints persisted due to resin availability and transportation challenges. As a result, pricing continued to accelerate to record levels before peaking at the end of the quarter. Average OSB composite pricing increased 52% compared with the first quarter. OSB adjusted EBITDA increased by $172 million or 57% compared to the first quarter.
Our sales realizations improved by 48%. Production and sales volumes decreased modestly, and unit manufacturing costs increased, primarily due to a planned extended maintenance outage to complete a capital project at our Elkin OSB mill. Fiber costs were slightly higher in the quarter, primarily for Canadian logs. 
Engineered Wood Products adjusted EBITDA increased $11 million compared to the first quarter, a 26% improvement. Sales realizations improved across all products, and we continue to benefit from the price increases announced over the last year for solid section and I-joist products. This was partially offset by higher raw material costs for oriented strand board webstock, resin and veneer. Sales and production volumes increased for solid section and I-joist products. 
In Distribution, adjusted EBITDA increased $36 million compared to the first quarter, a 92% improvement as strong demand drove higher sales volumes for most products, and the business captured improved margins.  
With that, I'll turn the call over to Nancy to discuss some financial items and our third quarter outlook."

Adjusted funds available for distribution or adjusted FAD for year-to-date second quarter 2021 totaled nearly $1.9 billion, with approximately $1.2 billion related to second quarter operations, as highlighted on Page 16. 
Year-to-date, we have returned $255 million to our shareholders through payment of our quarterly base dividend. As a reminder, we target a total return to shareholders of 75% to 80% of our annual adjusted FAD. In the case of 2021, the majority will be returned to the variable supplemental component of our new dividend framework.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.8 billion of cash and just under $5.3 billion of debt. During the second quarter, we repaid our $225 million variable rate term loan due in 2026 and incurred no early extinguishment charges. We plan to repay our $150 million 9% note when it matures in the fourth quarter. 
Looking forward, key outlook items for the third quarter and full year 2021 are presented on Pages 17 and 18. In our Timberlands business, we expect third quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be approximately $25 million lower than second quarter. 
Turning to our Western Timberland operations. Domestic mills ended the second quarter with ample inventory. We anticipate slightly lower domestic log sales realizations in the third quarter, absent significant fire-related disruption. This is primarily due to modestly lower pricing for smaller diameter sawlogs. We expect large log pricing will remain favorable due to limited supply and strong export demand.
We anticipate seasonally higher forestry and road spending, as those activities accelerate with favorable weather condition. Typical of the drier, warmer summer months, harvest activity will focus on higher elevation track, where operations are less productive, resulting in slightly lower fee harvest volumes and higher per unit log and haul costs. 
Moving to the export markets. In Japan, log demand remained strong. We expect our third quarter sales realizations and log sales volumes to be generally comparable to the second quarter. In China, we anticipate significantly higher sales volumes and slightly higher sales realization. Although Chinese log demand generally moderates during the summer rainy season, we expect demand for U.S. logs will remain strong as imports from other countries remain constrained.
In the South, we anticipate significantly higher fee harvest volumes as well as higher per unit log and haul costs during the third quarter due to a seasonal increase in thinning activity. Although our sawlog and fiber log pricing should be comparable to the second quarter, we expect average sales realizations will be slightly lower due to a higher percentage mix of fiber logs. We also expect seasonally higher forestry and road costs as most of this activity is completed during these dryer summer months.
In the North, sales realizations are expected to be lower due to mix, while fee harvest volumes are expected to be significantly higher, as we come out of the spring breakup season. I'll wrap up the Timberlands' outlook with a comment on the sale of our North Cascades Timberland, which was completed on July 7. In the third quarter, we will record a cash inflow of $261 million and a gain of approximately $30 million related to this transaction. The gain will be reported as a special item within the Timberlands segment. 
Turning to our real estate, energy and natural resources segment. We expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA will be comparable to the third quarter 2020, but earnings will be approximately $20 million higher than 1 year ago due to a lower average land basis on the mix of properties sold. 
As Devin mentioned, we continue to capitalize on exceptionally strong demand and pricing for HBU properties. In addition, we've seen strong year-to-date production of construction materials. As a result, we are increasing our guidance for full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA to $290 million. We now expect land basis as a percentage of real estate sales to be approximately 30% to 35% for the year. 
For our Wood Products segment, third quarter benchmark pricing for lumber has significantly reduced from record levels and benchmark pricing for oriented strand board has also recently declined. As a result, we are expecting adjusted EBITDA will be significantly lower in the third quarter. For lumber, our quarter-to-date realizations are approximately $425 lower, and current realizations are approximately $535 lower than the second quarter average. 
For OSB, our current realizations are still significantly higher than the second quarter average due to the length of our order files. Our quarter-to-date OSB realizations are approximately $155 higher and current realizations are approximately $125 higher than the second quarter average. As a reminder, for lumber, every $10 change in realizations is approximately $11 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis. And for OSB, every $10 change in realizations is approximately $8 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis. 
For lumber, as prices have retreated, we expect higher sales volumes as inventories at home centers and treaters normalize and demand signals improve for do-it-yourself activity. We are also anticipating improved unit manufacturing costs during the quarter. We anticipate this will be partially offset by slightly higher costs for Canadian and Western logs. 
For oriented strand board, we expect demand will remain favorable due to continued strength in new residential construction activity. We expect improved operating rates following the second quarter outage to complete the capital project at our Elkin OSB mill, previously mentioned.
With increased operating rates, we anticipate higher third quarter sales volumes and improved manufacturing costs. These improvements are expected to be partially offset by higher fiber costs. For Engineered Wood Products, we expect higher sales realizations for our solid section and I-joist products, as we continue to benefit from previously announced price increases. 
In May 2021, we announced another increase, which ranges from 15% to 25% and will be captured over the next several quarters. We anticipate significantly higher raw material costs, primarily for oriented strand board webstock, as the cost of webstock lags benchmark OSB pricing by approximately 1/4. For our Distribution business, we're expecting the recent declines in commodity pricing will result in reduced margins and significantly lower adjusted EBITDA. Business results are expected to remain strong compared to a historical perspective.
I'll wrap up with a couple additional comments on our total company financial items. Each year in the second quarter, we finalize prior year-ended estimates for pension assets and liabilities. As a result, we recorded a $138 million improvement in our net funded status as well as a reduction in our noncash, nonoperating pension and post-employment expense.  Slide 18 includes our current full year outlook for pension and post-employment items. It also shows the $40 million capital expenditure increase we announced back in June for some additional high-return projects across our businesses.
Turning to taxes. We are now -- we now expect our effective tax rate to be between 20% to 24% based on the forecasted mix of earnings between our REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary. The $90 million tax refund associated with our 2018 pension contribution has now been approved, and we expect to receive the refund in the third quarter of 2021. 
So now I'll turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions."

Before wrapping up this morning, I'll make a few comments on the housing and repair and remodel markets. U.S. housing activity continues at an impressive pace, with total housing starts in the second quarter averaging 1.6 million units on a seasonally adjusted basis and total permits averaging 1.7 million units. Single-family starts in June reached their highest monthly level since May of 2007. 
Notwithstanding a slight pullback in the second quarter as homebuilders navigated supply chain disruptions, year-to-date momentum is strong, and our customers continue to expect robust housing activity over the back half of the year. Our near-term and longer-term housing outlook remains very favorable and is bolstered by encouraging long-term housing demand fundamentals.
Turning to repair and remodel. Although demand for small do-it-yourself projects has softened from the elevated levels established in the pandemic, demand for larger professional remodels remains healthy. Our long-term outlook for repair and remodel continues to be favorable, supported by an aging housing stock, rising home equity and low interest rates. 
In closing, we delivered our best financial performance on record in the second quarter, and we're well positioned to capitalize on favorable demand fundamentals for U.S. housing. Looking forward, we remain focused on industry-leading performance across our operations and are on track to deliver our 2021 OpEx target of $50 million to $75 million. Our balance sheet is extremely strong. And with year-to-date adjusted FAD of nearly $1.9 billion, we expect to return significant amounts of cash to shareholders through the variable supplemental component of our new dividend framework.
And finally, I'm pleased to announce that we will hold a virtual Investor Day on September 22. Nancy, Russell and I will give an update on our key longer-term strategic, capital allocation and sustainability initiatives. Event details and registration instructions will be included in a press release later this morning. We're excited to share that update, and we'll look forward to speaking with you all again in September. 
And now I'd like to open up the floor for questions."

I mean price declines seem to have moderated over the last week or so. You talked about inventories below historic levels. And I would think that prices are below cash costs for a decent chunk of your competitors. I'm not sure if you'd agree with that. And specifically, you talked about anticipating a pickup in demand in 3Q. I'm just wondering, are you seeing that right now at the end of July? Or is that something that you anticipate to see in August or September? Just wondering if you can give any more color there?"

Obviously, lumber and OSB pricing, for that matter, reached historically high levels this spring. And that was really a function of housing and repair and remodel just being very strong through most of the spring into May. We've seen the pricing come off significantly here recently. Although I will mention pricing is still reasonably strong by historical measures. And I'd say what's been going on of late is really primarily a function of the smaller do-it-yourself market. 
We've seen that over the past couple of months come down 15% to 20% in terms of our sales into that market in June and July relative to the spring. So that's caused a little bit of inventory to build up in the home improvement warehouse and treater segments, which -- that's really been sort of the pricing pressure as the producers look to move that product that would have gone into those markets to other customers. 
In terms of how we're looking at the current situation and as we head into fall, I think the do-it-yourself market should be picking back up here. In fact, even just this week, we've seen a little bit of a pickup there in terms of sales activity into the home improvement warehouse and the treaters. So I think that's going to start picking up, and we would expect that to accelerate. As we get into the fall, you'll see cooler weather, you'll see kids going back to school, vacation season will be winding down. And frankly, I think just the moderation in lumber prices. I suspect some of the downtick in the do-it-yourself was a little bit of sticker shock with the high lumber prices and all the press that, that was getting. 
So in terms of the pricing environment, we think -- first of all, wouldn't be surprised at all to have seen the lumber prices overcorrect a little bit. We've seen that in the past when prices have come down. We're expecting that to settle into a range that's certainly higher than historical levels, albeit probably not at the record levels that we saw earlier in the spring. 
A couple of comments just on inventory. I think it's differential depending on what part of the channel you're talking about. I think in the home improvement warehouse and treater segment, it's probably still a little bit elevated relative to normal. But when you look at the builder and the dealer portions, I think that's probably a little lower than normal, as they really haven't wanted to build inventory in a dynamic pricing environment. I will say with respect to your question about cash costs, certainly, I think, in British Columbia, with the increase in log prices and some of the other dynamics there, it's entirely possible that a segment of the BC manufacturers have gone below cash cost where pricing went. So we'll see how that develops. 
I do think overall, probably the cost floor in North America has gone up a little bit because of that dynamic relative to history. So again, we're expecting residential construction should remain strong. The Pro segment of repair and remodel should stay strong, and that do-it-yourself segment should start picking up here as we head into fall. So overall, we're expecting pricing to settle into a new range that's still very strong pricing by any historical context."

In terms of valuations, we've definitely seen a pickup in interest in quality timberland, and that's a statement both in the West and in the South. You can see that in some of the valuations of recently announced deals. I think there is a lot of interest in this space. The ESG piece, the carbon piece, I think that may be playing into it a little bit. But I do think, certainly, we're seeing those valuations tick up a bit. Certainly, that's what we're seeing in the market.
With respect to our activity, as we've always said, we are always looking to optimize and improve the quality of our timberlands to grow the value of our timber base. That's something we're doing day in, day out. And sometimes that's on the sell side, but that's also on the buy side. You've seen us with Oregon and Alabama, a couple of transactions of late. So we're always looking. We look at every deal that comes through. I think we'll continue to be active in that space. Russell and his team are looking at deals. They're having lots of conversations. But you've got to be disciplined. And so we'll remain disciplined and execute on deals that make good financial sense and that are value accretive for us. So we expect to be active. We'll continue to look in terms of just growing and optimizing to improve on our timber base."

So we've heard about dealers and distributors keeping their inventories low and something of a standoff, right? No one wants to order and then see just as that -- those sticks of lumber showing up for price to head lower, yet you're, as a dealer or distributor, taking on the risk that prices and demand start to pick up on you and you're left with low inventories. What do you think will break that logjam? Are you seeing any signs at all that the distributors and deals are beginning to rebuild inventory or maybe not? Just because of where prices are, we're going to be in this period of very, very low hand-to-mouth kind of ordering, which might not be the best thing for you. How do you see that shaking out?"

That's the dynamic that plays out in our markets day in, day out, and has for a very long time. When you have pricing that's in a falling environment, people are going to be very cautious about building inventories. And I",370,"Yes. Well, you're exactly right. That's the dynamic that plays out in our markets day in, day out, and has for a very long time. When you have pricing that's in a falling environment, people are going to be very cautious about building inventories. And I think what really starts to bring people back into the market is 1 of 2 things. First, they get a sense that you've really started to bottom out in terms of what's going on in the pricing environment. You look at what's going on today. In fact, the print last night, it showed that we saw the smallest downtick in pricing that we've seen in 10 or 11 weeks.
I think because of the fires in British Columbia, there are some other dynamics that are going on that perhaps are starting to give people to feel that we've reached the floor and things will start normalizing upwards. That usually gives people some confidence to start building inventory. The second thing is it's always a matter of -- if you're in that space you have to make sure that you're supplying your customers. And so to the extent that you feel like there's any risk whatsoever that you're going to have enough inventory to meet your customer demands, then people will have to come in. 
I'd say with the fire situation, with some of the transportation challenges, what we're hearing from the builder customers in terms of their outlook for the back half of the year, it's a careful dance for them to make sure that they don't get too low and get caught short. And we've seen what happens when that dynamic is played out, and that usually results in pricing ticking up relatively quickly. 
So I wouldn't say in terms of the dealer or distributor network, we've seen them really start to build material inventories at this point. Although as I said earlier, we have seen the home improvement warehouse and treaters start coming back. Even this week, there's been a little bit of an uptick that we've noticed to the extent that, that gains momentum and starts pulling inventory out of the system. You could see that dynamic change here relatively quickly."

I want to switch gears for my second question, kind of a 2-part on timber. We've heard of some disruptions in China, as they've been, in particular with Ticon remediating, redoing the way they handle timber. And from what we gathered, inventories are relatively high. So I was a little pleasantly surprised that you're still seeing strong demand on timber into China. If you could explain why you think that's happening and to some degree why the U.S. is gaining share versus other regions? 
And then, in the South, I want to say prices have begun to pick up on stumpage, a couple $3 a ton year-on-year. You're starting to see some commentary now that prices are lifting for more than seasonal reasons. Do you buy that? Or are you fairly skeptical of that, and you think we're still in a flat, perhaps deflationary period on a real basis in terms of timber?"

Pricing has been well above what we've seen really in a number of years. Part of that has been the supply chain challenges from European exporters, the ban on Australian logs. But all of those things have come together and really opened that market back up for North American logs. And so that's been a really nice market for us. 
As you mentioned, the inventory levels at the ports at the end of June did go up 5.5 million cubic meters, which is up from May. Takeaway at the ports is down a little bit overall, and I'll get to Weyerhaeuser specific comments momentarily. But there are a few things that are driving that, George. I mean, first of all, there's always a little bit of a tick down in demand when you get into the hot rainy season. We see that every year into China. So that's a piece of it. But there are also some regulatory issues. They've had some increased environmental inspections. And the big one, you mentioned, which is just a changing dynamic at the port, which is one of the largest log import facilities. 
And what they're doing is essentially they're trying to push the sawmills deeper inland, and so there's a little bit of a dynamic going on there, where they're trying to move some of those mills away from that port. That happens from time to time in China. It will get resolved. We're still very optimistic that you're still going to need a lot of logs imported into that China market. So I think that's really more of a temporary issue. 
For us, in particular, our Chinese customer log demand is still very strong, pricing is strong, and so we're actually contemplating or expecting rather to have our export volume into China up quarter-over-quarter, Q3 versus Q2. So a little bit of dynamic going on there just from the items I mentioned, but we're still very positive about that market over the back half of the year. 
Moving to the Southern market. Obviously, we have seen a bit of an uptick in pricing. And I think there are 2 things going on there. One of them is certainly the weather dynamic. When you see multiple wet weather events in the South that keeps the logging out of the woods for a period of time, which limits the supply to the sawmills and the pulp mills. And that's been going on over the course of the summer and the spring. And that's really particularly on the pulp log that's kept inventories pretty low for this time of year, and so that's been a piece of it.
But I do think there's also an increment to that, which is in certain geographies, the new sawmill capacity that's come in. And we've been talking about this for several years. If you put 7 billion board feet of new capacity into the South, in those wood baskets, where that new capacity is coming, you see a tensioning effect. And so I don't think it's going to be a hockey stick by any stretch of the imagination. 
It's just going to be slow, steady improvement across different geographies. And so we think that's going to slowly tension a number of wood baskets. And again, it's going to be specific to each geography, but that will continue to happen.  We've seen a number of mills announced even just recently, and we expect that to continue here for the foreseeable future because the South is a great place to manufacture lumber."

I would say that, that is something, I think, over time will continue to be a competitive advantage for us. I think we do silviculture and forestry very well. 
We have a lot of great folks, a lot of PhDs, a lot of foresters that are working every day to make sure that we're driving the best yield across our land base. And so I think it is an important part. I will say, even when you think about climate change, for example, the ability of our teams to really make sure that we're using the right seedlings. For example, as the climate gets warmer and really targeting the seedlings that we're planting across our landscape to ensure that we're maximizing the growth and the survival in a changing landscape. So it is definitely something that's still very important in the core to what we do even if we're not talking about it on a day-to-day basis as much."

And I'm not sure if we're having this conversation 3, 4, 5 years from now, you're going to see a real material change in the way that we build homes. You'll probably see continued improvements around the margin, but it's an established supply chain in terms of how we build this -- build these homes. And so we just haven't seen big improvements to date. And I'm not sure I'm overly optimistic that that's going to change in the near term. 
We talk to our customers. We're very close with them, and we're -- I think we're a very nimble supplier. So to the extent that we need to adjust how we do business to meet our customer needs, we'll be well positioned to do that."

In the near term, we -- obviously, we're seeing a fire situation in the West, and we can speak to that here in a moment. No issues on our land. But certainly, it's been a rough start to the fire season overall. British Columbia, even worse, I would say, at this point. Nothing in the near term that we're expecting from our production, specifically around natural disasters or fires. That being said, every year, we have to stay nimble and adjust as we see these things play out.  And so that's something on a day-to-day basis that can change, but nothing to announce here at this point. 
I will say over time, certainly, the environment that we're seeing with forest fires in the West and some of the natural hurricanes, other events in the South, it's something that you have to bake into your long-term planning. And so as we see British Columbia, for example, having another serious fire season, well, obviously, over time, those trees are not available for wood products manufacturing. So as we think about our long-term planning, we do take that into consideration, as we decide where are we going to put capital to work."

We primarily send that product into new residential construction. And so unlike lumber and OSB that have a little heavier component of repair and remodel, the EWP market is primarily residential construction, which really hasn't seen any sort of noticeable slowdown and nor are we expecting that for the back half of the year. So the dynamic there is a little different than lumber and OSB. And part of the issue there, too, is with the run-up in OSB webstock prices, the resin challenges, the veneer pricing, some of the input costs for making EWP have gone up quite a bit as well. So there's that balance in terms of the pricing for EWP to overcome some of those raw material costs. 
Absent something happening on the residential construction market, I think we feel pretty good about capturing that pricing increase that we announced in May."

We're probably dialing back in the sense that we're not trying to run those extra shifts and overtime hours that we were earlier in the spring when you had the pricing at all-time peak. So it's really dialed back to a more normal operating posture. But that's something that we look at closely all the time. 
The fire situation is something I do think we're keeping a close eye on, as I mentioned. No real impact to our Timberlands at this point, and we've still got reasonable log decks across the Northwest in Washington and Oregon. But that's something that obviously we'll watch closely. British Columbia, we only have the 1 mill in British Columbia. I would say the fire situation up there is probably even a little worse than it is in Washington and Oregon. A lot of the logging activity has ceased at this point in BC in a number of operating areas just because of the fire situation. If that doesn't change at some point here in the near term, I think log availability at our BC mill is going to be challenged, at which point we would obviously have to take some downtime, but at this point, we haven't."

But we've said previously -- we haven't definitively ruled out the possibility of some sort of interim supplemental dividend later in the year. 
And really, you think about where we are, we're in a little bit of a unique situation in that through the end of the second quarter, we've already generated nearly $1.9 billion of adjusted FAD. We have a very significant cash balance. And so that's something the Board is continuing to assess in terms of both those factors and how we see the rest of the year playing out. So I'd still say at this point, we haven't ruled that out for at some point later in the year. But I would say even if we were to do that, which, again, the Board is going to consider over the back half of the year, we'd still expect the vast majority of that supplemental dividend for the 2021 cash flow would be paid out in Q1 of 2022."

So we had a number of projects in the queue really across the Wood Products business, that, we think, will generate strong returns, continue to position the business for -- to be low-cost, highly efficient, very reliable. 
So we have a variety of projects in the queue. They run the gamut from CDKs to upgrading sorter stacker -- the Elkin project, which we completed, was the forming line. So just a variety of projects across the mill largely focused on debottlenecking, reducing costs and improving reliability.

I don't think you're going to see much in the way of new capacity coming into the Pacific Northwest, primarily just it's such a tensioned wood basket. And so I think the log costs associated with that probably will prevent folks from putting too much capacity there. 
And I do think over time, we're going to lose capacity in British Columbia because of the fiber availability issue that you're well aware of. So I think on a net-net basis, we will see more capacity overall in North America. But look, we need it, right? I mean, if you think about the amount of housing that we're anticipating over the next 5 to 10 years, we won't be able to cover that without some continued capacity additions across North America.

We're actively managing our portfolio to constantly improve the value of our underlying assets. You've seen a number of timber transactions to that effect, our CapEx programs in Wood Products. We have an unrelenting focus on operational excellence and driving industry-leading performance. You've seen that in terms of our OpEx results over the years as well as our competitive positioning from an EBITDA margin. 
And I think importantly, over the last year, we've made a series of capital allocation decisions that have really positioned us very well for the future. We've paid down over $1 billion of debt. Our balance sheet is strong. We have a new base plus variable supplemental dividend structure that is really going to enable us to return significant amounts of cash to shareholders over time. As you've seen with the FAD that we've generated through the first half of the year, we're positioned to deliver a very meaningful supplemental dividend payment in the first quarter of 2022. 
And that's something I think the market is probably just starting to digest the magnitude of what that variable dividend is going to be. So I think as our investor base and the market gets more familiar with the new dividend structure, starts to see the benefit as we pay out that variable dividend, we should start seeing the share price better reflect the underlying value. 
The other thing I'd say is we're optimistic that the other actions that we're taking to position the company for the future, including our increased focus on natural climate solutions and some of the other business development opportunities, are really going to be a catalyst to drive investor interest and advance -- enhance our market valuation over time."

As we've said, we certainly do intend to grow the base dividend over time. That's a core part of our overall dividend philosophy and framework. We want that base dividend to be sustainable and supportable from the cash that we generate across our businesses, over business cycles. 
So the growth in the base dividend is largely going to be driven from the growth in our more stable Timberlands and ENR businesses. And that can come from a variety of different angles, the organic growth in the business, taking costs out, disciplined acquisitions. The key is incremental cash flow that's sustainable across the bottom of market cycles. But certainly, we intend to grow that over time.
And I'd note, just as you think about the overall dividend framework, obviously, when the pricing environment is strong or even reasonable, we're going to generate significant cash flow that will get distributed out to the shareholders over and above that base dividend. So I think the short answer to your question is the market is still digesting how this is going to work.

And I think on some level, they've slowed the sales activity a little bit to try to catch up with some of that. 
But again, as we talk to those customers, they're optimistic for the back half of the year. The demand is there, notwithstanding some of the affordability challenges, I think, from the buyer community, but the demand for housing still is incredibly strong. And we think based on those conversations and other discussions we've had with customers in the supply chain that we're still going to build a lot of houses in the U.S. this year."

So I would say -- and I'm going to answer this by West and by South because there are slightly different dynamics going on in each market. In the West, we're seeing good pricing this year. It's a very tensioned wood basket. And so as long as lumber demand and lumber pricing is reasonable, that's going to be a good, strong business. We saw a little bit, obviously, of a dip in harvest levels as a result of the Oregon fires last year. We'll work through that salvage this year, and you'll start to see the harvest levels kind of ticking up slowly here over time. So we feel really good about that business. I think it will continue to be strong here for the foreseeable future. 
The South, obviously, we've had some disconnects between demand and supply, just in terms of the amount of inventory out in the woods coming out of The Great Recession. We've talked about that quite a bit. And I do think that there are markets within the South -- geographies within the South that are starting to tension up a little bit, and that's largely a function of new capacity coming in. That's continuing to happen. We've got, for example, several mills that have been announced, the Biewer Mill, the Idaho Forest Products Mill in Mississippi, the Tolko mill that was just announced in Louisiana, and those are in good wood baskets for us. 
And as we continue to see that play out over time, I think that will just put pressure on pricing to slowly recover. I don't think that's going to happen overnight. It's a process that's going to play out over a number of years. But directionally, I'm feeling good about where we're going there. From an overall margin standpoint, putting aside pricing, we are very focused on operational excellence. Our operating performance, I think, is very good in that business, but we're trying to improve every day. That's part of our OpEx program. 
We put new targets out every year to increase the efficiency and lower cost. And so I feel good about the margin improvement opportunity there as well. So we've got good businesses. We've got good people. The overall story around housing and repair and remodel demand to drive wood demand through the system, I think, is positive. So we feel good about both of those businesses."

Q3, that's always a lower earnings quarter for us because we do more forestry and road work in that quarter. And in the West, we typically move up the hill, the higher cost elevation units or higher elevation units. So that's a typical seasonal pattern. Q2, we did ramp up harvest, certainly relative to Q1. There has been a lot of rainy weather in the south. And so we weren't able to catch up as much of the Q1 issues that we saw with the ice storms as we had anticipated. I expect we'll catch most of that up over the back half of the year absent weather events that are hard to control. So you'll see the harvest activity pick up. Cost activity is -- cost typically in Q4 are a little better because it's the reverse the dynamics, I just mentioned. So I can dimension it that way, but probably not just in terms of giving you a specific number.

This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported second quarter net earnings of $1 billion or $1.37 per diluted share on net sales of $3.1 billion. I'm extremely proud of our team's accomplishments in the second quarter. 
Their collective efforts delivered the company's strongest quarterly adjusted EBITDA on record at $1.6 billion, surpassing last quarter's record by 43%. Our year-to-date adjusted EBITDA is almost $2 billion higher than the first half of 2020. Wood Products delivered another record quarter at $1.4 billion of adjusted EBITDA, surpassing last quarter's record by 56%.
Turning now to our second quarter business results. I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands on Pages 5 through 8 of our earnings slides. Timberlands' earnings and adjusted EBITDA improved by approximately 5% compared with the first quarter. In the West, adjusted EBITDA increased slightly in the second quarter. 
Western domestic markets remained favorable despite the decline in lumber prices late in the quarter and a healthy supply of logs to the market. Demand remained strong as mills took precautionary measures to bolster log inventories in response to an early fire season resulting from persistent dry conditions and a period of extremely high temperatures. This steady demand pull drove our sales volumes modestly higher during the second quarter.
Salvage operations from last year's fires in Oregon are continuing to supply an abundance of smaller diameter logs to the market. Consequently, prices for smaller diameter logs in Oregon have experienced some downward pressure. As a result of this dynamic, our domestic sales realizations were slightly lower in the quarter. To date, we've harvested nearly 2/3 of our planned salvage volume in Oregon. Salvage productivity has slowed somewhat as warm summer weather arrived early, and we began to transition salvage harvest operations into higher elevation tracks, which generally have lower productivity and higher operating costs. Forestry and road costs were seasonally higher during the quarter, as we do a significant amount of this work during the warmer summer months.
Turning to our export markets. In Japan and China, demand for our logs remained strong, and our sales realizations increased significantly. Global logistics constraints, particularly with respect to shipping container availability and strong North American lumber prices, continued to impact the availability of imported lumber into Japan and China. This has resulted in strong demand for locally produced lumber and increased demand for imported logs. Additionally, a ban on Australian logs continues to reduce the supply of imported logs to China. Our China sales volumes increased in the quarter, as we intentionally flexed volume from the domestic market to capitalize on strong demand signals and pricing from our Chinese customers.
Moving to the South. Southern Timberlands' adjusted EBITDA increased by approximately 10% compared with the first quarter. Southern sawlog markets improved due to record lumber and panel pricing for most of the quarter and supply limitations resulting from persistent wet weather. Fiber markets also strengthened as mill inventories remain lean and wet conditions constrained supply. As a result, our sales realizations were slightly higher than the first quarter. 
Fee and sales volumes were significantly higher in the quarter despite impacts from multiple heavy rain events across the Gulf South. The wet weather in the quarter did, however, limit our ability to catch up on delayed harvest from the first quarter snow and ice events. Log and haul costs increased slightly, and forestry and road costs were seasonally higher. 
Although Southern export represents a small component of our operations, we continue to see strengthening demand signals from China and India, resulting in increases in both sales volumes and realizations in the second quarter. However, container availability and increased freight rates continue to be a notable headwind. In the North, adjusted EBITDA decreased slightly compared to the first quarter due to significantly lower sales volumes associated with seasonal spring breakup conditions, partially offset by significantly higher sales realizations. 
Turning to real estate, energy and natural resources, on Pages 9 and 10. Earnings and adjusted EBITDA decreased by approximately 5% compared with the first quarter due to timing of real estate sales and mix of properties sold, but were significantly higher than the year ago quarter. Earnings increased by more than 230% compared with the second quarter of 2020.
Demand for HBU properties has been very strong year-to-date and average price per acre remains elevated compared to historical levels. We continue to capitalize on this market and have been increasing our prices in many regions. This is resulting in a steady stream of high-value transactions with significant premiums to timber. In Energy and Natural Resources, production of construction materials increased as demand remained strong during the quarter.
Wood Products, Pages 11 through 13. Wood Products earnings and adjusted EBITDA improved by almost $0.5 billion compared with the prior quarter. Our lumber, OSB and distribution businesses all established new quarterly adjusted EBITDA records in the second quarter. These exceptional results were delivered, notwithstanding ongoing challenges with transportation and resin availability in the quarter. I want to specifically call out and thank our supply chain and logistics teams for their tremendous work in helping us successfully navigate these headwinds. 
In the lumber market, average framing lumber composite pricing increased 29% compared with the first quarter. Lumber demand was strong during the first half of the quarter, but began to soften as do-it-yourself repair and remodel activity weakened toward the latter part of May. The drop-off in the do-it-yourself segment, largely a result of changing consumer spending habits coming out of COVID restrictions and to some extent record-high lumber prices, resulted in lower sales activity and higher inventories at the home centers and treaters. As a result, lumber prices peaked in late May and retreated at a rapid pace for the remainder of the quarter. Although inventories at home centers and treaters increased, inventory levels at dealers and distributors serving the homebuilding and professional repair and remodel segments remained below normal at quarter end. Buyer positioning remains cautious with the reluctance to build meaningful inventory positions and a dynamic pricing environment.
Adjusted EBITDA for lumber increased $291 million or 57% compared with the first quarter. Our sales realizations increased by 25% and sales volumes increased moderately. Log costs increased slightly in the second quarter, primarily for Canadian logs. 
OSB markets experienced historic strength in the second quarter as demand continued to outpace supply. Inventories remain lean throughout the channel, and supply constraints persisted due to resin availability and transportation challenges. As a result, pricing continued to accelerate to record levels before peaking at the end of the quarter. Average OSB composite pricing increased 52% compared with the first quarter. 
OSB adjusted EBITDA increased by $172 million or 57% compared to the first quarter. Our sales realizations improved by 48%. Production and sales volumes decreased modestly, and unit manufacturing costs increased primarily due to a planned extended maintenance outage to complete a capital project at our Elkin OSB mill. Fiber costs were slightly higher in the quarter, primarily for Canadian logs. 
Engineered Wood Products adjusted EBITDA increased $11 million compared to the first quarter, a 26% improvement. Sales realizations improved across all products, and we continue to benefit from the price increases announced over the last year for solid section and I-joist products. This was partially offset by higher raw material costs for oriented strand board webstock, resins and veneer. Sales and production volumes increased for solid section and I-joist products. In Distribution, adjusted EBITDA increased $36 million compared to the first quarter, a 92% improvement as strong demand drove higher sales volumes for most products, and the business captured improved margins. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Nancy to discuss some financial items and our third quarter outlook."

I'll begin with our key financial items, which are summarized on Page 15. We generated over $1.3 billion of cash from operations in the second quarter and over $2 billion year-to-date. These are our highest fi",1248,"Thank you, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with our key financial items, which are summarized on Page 15. We generated over $1.3 billion of cash from operations in the second quarter and over $2 billion year-to-date. These are our highest first half operating cash flows on record. Adjusted funds available for distribution or adjusted FAD for year-to-date second quarter 2021 totaled nearly $1.9 billion, with approximately $1.2 billion related to second quarter operations, as highlighted on Page 16. 
Year-to-date, we have returned $255 million to our shareholders through payment of our quarterly base dividend. As a reminder, we target a total return to shareholders of 75% to 80% of our annual adjusted FAD. In the case of 2021, the majority will be returned through the variable supplemental component of our new dividend framework.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.8 billion of cash and just under $5.3 billion of debt. During the second quarter, we repaid our $225 million variable rate term loan due in 2026 and incurred no early extinguishment charges. We plan to repay our $150 million 9% note when it matures in the fourth quarter. 
Looking forward, key outlook items for the third quarter and full year 2021 are presented on Pages 17 and 18. In our Timberlands business, we expect third quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be approximately $25 million lower than second quarter. 
Turning to our Western Timberland operations. Domestic mills ended the second quarter with ample inventory. We anticipate slightly lower domestic log sales realizations in the third quarter, absent significant fire-related disruption. This is primarily due to modestly lower pricing for smaller diameter sawlogs. We expect large log pricing will remain favorable due to limited supply and strong export demand. We anticipate seasonally higher forestry and road spending, as those activities accelerate with favorable weather conditions. Typical of the drier, warmer summer months, harvest activity will focus on higher elevation track, where operations are less productive, resulting in slightly lower fee harvest volumes and higher per unit log and haul costs. 
Moving to the export markets. In Japan, log demand remained strong. We expect our third quarter sales realizations and log sales volumes to be generally comparable to the second quarter. In China, we anticipate significantly higher sales volumes and slightly higher sales realization. Although Chinese log demand generally moderates during the summer rainy season, we expect demand for U.S. logs will remain strong as imports from other countries remain constrained.
In the South, we anticipate significantly higher fee harvest volumes as well as higher per unit log and haul costs during the third quarter due to a seasonal increase in thinning activity. Although our sawlog and fiber log pricing should be comparable to the second quarter, we expect average sales realizations will be slightly lower due to a higher percentage mix of fiber logs. We also expect seasonally higher forestry and road costs as most of this activity is completed during these dryer summer months. In the North, sales realizations are expected to be lower due to mix, while fee harvest volumes are expected to be significantly higher, as we come out of the spring breakup season. 
I'll wrap up the Timberlands' outlook with a comment on the sale of our North Cascades Timberland, which was completed on July 7. In the third quarter, we will record a cash inflow of $261 million and a gain of approximately $30 million related to this transaction. The gain will be reported as a special item within the Timberlands segment. 
Turning to our real estate, energy and natural resources segment. We expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA will be comparable to the third quarter 2020, but earnings will be approximately $20 million higher than 1 year ago due to a lower average land basis on the mix of properties sold. As Devin mentioned, we continue to capitalize on exceptionally strong demand and pricing for HBU properties. In addition, we've seen strong year-to-date production of construction materials. As a result, we are increasing our guidance for full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA to $290 million. We now expect land basis as a percentage of real estate sales to be approximately 30% to 35% for the year. 
For our Wood Products segment, third quarter benchmark pricing for lumber has significantly reduced from record levels and benchmark pricing for oriented strand board has also recently declined. As a result, we are expecting adjusted EBITDA will be significantly lower in the third quarter. For lumber, our quarter-to-date realizations are approximately $425 lower, and current realizations are approximately $535 lower than the second quarter average. 
For OSB, our current realizations are still significantly higher than the second quarter average due to the length of our order file. Our quarter-to-date OSB realizations are approximately $155 higher and current realizations are approximately $125 higher than the second quarter average. As a reminder, for lumber, every $10 change in realizations is approximately $11 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis. And for OSB, every $10 change in realizations is approximately $8 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis. 
For lumber, as prices have retreated, we expect higher sales volumes as inventories at home centers and treaters normalize and demand signals improve for do-it-yourself activity. We are also anticipating improved unit manufacturing costs during the quarter. We anticipate this will be partially offset by slightly higher costs for Canadian and Western logs. 
For oriented strand board, we expect demand will remain favorable due to continued strength in new residential construction activity. We expect improved operating rates following the second quarter outage to complete the capital project at our Elkin OSB mill, previously mentioned. With increased operating rates, we anticipate higher third quarter sales volumes and improved manufacturing costs. These improvements are expected to be partially offset by higher fiber costs. 
For Engineered Wood Products, we expect higher sales realizations for our solid section and I-joist products, as we continue to benefit from previously announced price increases. In May 2021, we announced another increase, which ranges from 15% to 25% and will be captured over the next several quarters. We anticipate significantly higher raw material costs, primarily for oriented strand board webstock, as the cost of webstock lags benchmark OSB pricing by approximately 1/4. 
For our Distribution business, we're expecting the recent declines in commodity pricing will result in reduced margins and significantly lower adjusted EBITDA. Business results are expected to remain strong compared to a historical perspective. I'll wrap up with a couple additional comments on our total company financial items. 
Each year in the second quarter, we finalize prior year-ended estimates for pension assets and liabilities. As a result, we recorded a $138 million improvement in our net funded status as well as a reduction in our noncash, nonoperating pension and post-employment expense. Slide 18 includes our current full year outlook for pension and post-employment items. It also shows the $40 million capital expenditure increase we announced back in June for some additional high-return projects across our businesses.
Turning to taxes. We are now -- we now expect our effective tax rate to be between 20% to 24% based on the forecasted mix of earnings between our REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary. The $90 million tax refund associated with our 2018 pension contribution has now been approved, and we expect to receive the refund in the third quarter of 2021. So now I'll turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions."

Before wrapping up this morning, I'll make a few comments on the housing and repair and remodel markets. U.S. housing activity continues at an impressive pace, with total housing starts in the second quarter averaging 1.6 million units on a seasonally adjusted basis and total permits averaging 1.7 million units. Single-family starts in June reached their highest monthly level since May of 2007. Notwithstanding a slight pullback in the second quarter as homebuilders navigated supply chain disruptions, year-to-date momentum is strong, and our customers continue to expect robust housing activity over the back half of the year. Our near-term and longer-term housing outlook remains very favorable and is bolstered by encouraging long-term housing demand fundamentals.
Turning to repair and remodel. Although demand for small do-it-yourself projects has softened from the elevated levels established in the pandemic, demand for larger professional remodels remains healthy. Our long-term outlook for repair and remodel continues to be favorable, supported by an aging housing stock, rising home equity and low interest rates. 
In closing, we delivered our best financial performance on record in the second quarter, and we're well positioned to capitalize on favorable demand fundamentals for U.S. housing. Looking forward, we remain focused on industry-leading performance across our operations and are on track to deliver our 2021 OpEx target of $50 million to $75 million. Our balance sheet is extremely strong. And with year-to-date adjusted FAD of nearly $1.9 billion, we expect to return significant amounts of cash to shareholders through the variable supplemental component of our new dividend framework.
And finally, I'm pleased to announce that we will hold a virtual Investor Day on September 22. Nancy, Russell and I will give an update on our key longer-term strategic capital allocation and sustainability initiatives. Event details and registration instructions will be included in a press release later this morning.

Obviously, lumber and OSB pricing, for that matter, reached historically high levels this spring. And that was really a function of housing and repair and remodel just being very strong through most of the spring into May. We've seen the pricing come off significantly here recently although I will mention pricing is still reasonably strong by historical measures. 
And I'd say what's been going on of late is really primarily a function of the smaller do-it-yourself market. We've seen that over the past couple of months come down 15% to 20% in terms of our sales into that market in June and July relative to the spring. So that's caused a little bit of inventory to build up in the home improvement warehouse and treater segments, which -- that's really been sort of the pricing pressure as the producers look to move that product that would have gone into those markets to other customers. 
In terms of how we're looking at the current situation and as we head into fall, I think the do-it-yourself market should be picking back up here. In fact, even just this week, we've seen a little bit of a pickup there in terms of sales activity into the home improvement warehouse and the treaters. So I think that's going to start picking up, and we would expect that to accelerate. 
As we get into the fall, you'll see cooler weather, you'll see kids going back to school, vacation season will be winding down. And frankly, I think just the moderation in lumber prices. I suspect some of the downtick in the do-it-yourself was a little bit of sticker shock with the high lumber prices and all the press that, that was getting. 
So in terms of the pricing environment, we think -- first of all, wouldn't be surprised at all to have seen the lumber prices overcorrect a little bit. We've seen that in the past when prices have come down. We're expecting that to settle into a range that's certainly higher than historical levels, albeit probably not at the record levels that we saw earlier in the spring. 
A couple of comments just on inventory. I think it's differential depending on what part of the channel you're talking about. I think in the home improvement warehouse and treater segment, it's probably still a little bit elevated relative to normal. But when you look at the builder and the dealer portions, I think that's probably a little lower than normal, as they really haven't wanted to build inventory in a dynamic pricing environment. 
I will say with respect to your question about cash costs, certainly, I think, in British Columbia, with the increase in log prices and some of the other dynamics there, it's entirely possible that a segment of the BC manufacturers have gone below cash cost where pricing went. So we'll see how that develops. I do think overall, probably the cost floor in North America has gone up a little bit because of that dynamic relative to history. 
So again, we're expecting residential construction should remain strong. The pro segment of repair and remodel should stay strong, and that do-it-yourself segment should start picking up here as we head into fall. So overall, we're expecting pricing to settle into a new range that's still very strong pricing by any historical context."

It was a little slow, I'd say, for the first half of the year, but certainly, we see that picking up. In terms of valuations, we've definitely seen a pickup in interest in quality timberland, and that's a statement both in the West and in the South. You can see that in some of the valuations of recently announced deals. 
I think there is a lot of interest in this space. The ESG piece, the carbon piece, I think that may be playing into it a little bit. But I do think, certainly, we're seeing those valuations tick up a bit. Certainly, that's what we're seeing in the market.
With respect to our activity, as we've always said, we are always looking to optimize and improve the quality of our timberlands to grow the value of our timber base. That's something we're doing day in, day out. And sometimes that's on the sell side, but that's also on the buy side. You've seen us with Oregon and Alabama, a couple of transactions of late. 
So we're always looking. We look at every deal that comes through. I think we'll continue to be active in that space. Russell and his team are looking at deals. They're having lots of conversations. But you've got to be disciplined. And so we'll remain disciplined and execute on deals that make good financial sense and that are value accretive for us. So we expect to be active.

So we've heard about dealers and distributors keeping their inventories low and something of a standoff, right? No one wants to order and then see just as that -- those sticks of lumber showing up for price to head lower, yet you're, as a dealer or distributor, taking on the risk that prices and demand start to pick up on you and you're left with low inventories. 
What do you think will break that logjam? Are you seeing any signs at all that the distributors and dealers are beginning to rebuild inventory? Or maybe not. Just because of where prices are, we're going to be in this period of very, very low hand-to-mouth kind of ordering, which might not be the best thing for you. How do you see that shaking out?"
107633,1671863518,2371144,"Weyerhaeuser Company, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2021",2021-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Weyerhaeuser Company","Executives","Yes. Well, you're exactly right. That's the dynamic that plays out in our markets day in, day out, and has for a very long time. When you have pricing that's in a falling environment, people are going to be very cautious about building inventories. And I",369,"Yes. Well, you're exactly right. That's the dynamic that plays out in our markets day in, day out, and has for a very long time. When you have pricing that's in a falling environment, people are going to be very cautious about building inventories. And I think what really starts to bring people back into the market is 1 of 2 things. 
First, they get a sense that you've really started to bottom out in terms of what's going on in the pricing environment. You look at what's going on today. In fact, the print last night, it showed that we saw the smallest downtick in pricing that we've seen in 10 or 11 weeks. I think because of the fires in British Columbia, there are some other dynamics that are going on that perhaps are starting to give people to feel that we've reached the floor and things will start normalizing upwards. That usually gives people some confidence to start building inventory.
The second thing is it's always a matter of if you're in that space you have to make sure that you're supplying your customers. And so to the extent that you feel like there's any risk whatsoever that you're going to have enough inventory to meet your customer demands, then people will have to come in. I'd say with the fire situation, with some of the transportation challenges, what we're hearing from the builder customers in terms of their outlook for the back half of the year, it's a careful dance for them to make sure that they don't get too low and get caught short. And we've seen what happens when that dynamic is played out, and that usually results in pricing ticking up relatively quickly. 
So I wouldn't say in terms of the dealer or distributor network, we've seen them really start to build material inventories at this point. Although as I said earlier, we have seen the home improvement warehouse and treaters start coming back. Even this week, there's been a little bit of an uptick that we've noticed. To the extent that, that gains momentum and starts pulling inventory out of the system, you could see that dynamic change here relatively quickly."

We've heard of some disruptions in China, as they've been, in particular with Taicang remediating, redoing the way they handle timber. And from what we gathered, inventories are relatively high. So I was a little surprised -- pleasantly surprised that you're still seeing strong demand on timber into China. If you could explain why you think that's happening and to some degree why the U.S. is gaining share versus other regions. 
And then, in the South, I want to say prices have begun to pick up on stumpage, $2, $3 a ton year-on-year. You're starting to see some commentary now that prices are lifting for more than seasonal reasons. Do you buy that? Or are you fairly skeptical of that, and you think we're still in a flat, perhaps deflationary period on a real basis in terms of timber?"

Pricing has been well above what we've seen really in a number of years. Part of that has been the supply chain challenges from European exporters, the ban on Australian logs. But all of those things have come together and really opened that market back up for North American logs. And so that's been a really nice market for us. 
As you mentioned, the inventory levels at the ports at the end of June did go up 5.5 million cubic meters, which is up from May. Takeaway at the ports is down a little bit overall, and I'll get to Weyerhaeuser-specific comments momentarily, but there are a few things that are driving that, George. I mean first of all, there's always a little bit of a tick down in demand when you get into the hot rainy season. We see that every year into China. So that's a piece of it. 
But there are also some regulatory issues. They've had some increased environmental inspections. And the big one, you mentioned, which is just a changing dynamic at the port, which is one of the largest log import facilities. And what they're doing is essentially they're trying to push the sawmills deeper inland. And so there's a little bit of a dynamic going on there, where they're trying to move some of those mills away from that port. 
That happens from time to time in China. It will get resolved. We're still very optimistic that you're still going to need a lot of logs imported into that China market. So I think that's really more of a temporary issue. 
For us, in particular, our Chinese customer log demand is still very strong. Pricing is strong. And so we're actually contemplating or expecting rather to have our export volume into China up quarter-over-quarter, Q3 versus Q2. So a little bit of dynamic going on there just from the items I mentioned, but we're still very positive about that market over the back half of the year. 
Moving to the Southern market. Obviously, we have seen a bit of an uptick in pricing. And I think there are 2 things going on there. One of them is certainly the weather dynamic. When you see multiple wet weather events in the South that keeps the logging out of the woods for a period of time, which limits the supply to the sawmills and the pulp mills. And that's been going on over the course of the summer and the spring. And that's really, particularly on the pulp log, that's kept inventories pretty low for this time of year, and so that's been a piece of it.
But I do think there's also an increment to that, which is in certain geographies, the new sawmill capacity that's come in. And we've been talking about this for several years. If you put 7 billion board feet of new capacity into the South in those wood baskets where that new capacity is coming, you see a tensioning effect. And so I don't think it's going to be a hockey stick by any stretch of the imagination. It's just going to be slow, steady improvement across different geographies. 
And so we think that's going to slowly tension a number of wood baskets. And again, it's going to be specific to each geography, but that will continue to happen. We've seen a number of mills announced even just recently, and we expect that to continue here for the foreseeable future because the South is a great place to manufacture lumber."

I would say that, that is something, I think, over time will continue to be a competitive advantage for us. I think we do silviculture and forestry very well. We have a lot of great folks, a lot of PhDs, a lot of foresters that are working every day to make sure that we're driving the best yield across our land base. And so I think it is an important part. 
I will say, even when you think about climate change, for example, the ability of our teams to really make sure that we're using the right seedlings, for example, as the climate gets warmer and really targeting the seedlings that we're planting across our landscape to ensure that we're maximizing the growth and the survival in a changing landscape. So it is definitely something that's still very important in the core to what we do even if we're not talking about it on a day-to-day basis as much."

So there's a desire to make improvements there. But I think you're right, the improvements that we've seen to date have really been around the margins. 
I think it's tough to really fundamentally change how we build houses, and that's going to be a slow process. And I'm not sure if we're having this conversation 3, 4, 5 years from now, you're going to see a real material change in the way that we build homes.

And part of the issue there, too, is with the run-up in OSB webstock prices, the resin challenges, the veneer pricing, some of the input costs for making EWP have gone up quite a bit as well.

We're probably dialing back in the sense that we're not trying to run those extra shifts and overtime hours that we were earlier in the spring when you had the pricing at all-time peak. So it's really dialed back to a more normal operating posture. 
But that's something that we look at closely all the time. The fire situation is something I do think we're keeping a close eye on, as I mentioned. No real impact to our Timberlands at this point, and we've still got reasonable log decks across the Northwest in Washington and Oregon. But that's something that obviously we'll watch closely. 
British Columbia, we only have the 1 mill in British Columbia. I would say the fire situation up there is probably even a little worse than it is in Washington and Oregon. A lot of the logging activity has ceased at this point in BC in a number of operating areas just because of the fire situation.

For us, Weyerhaeuser specific, we've been focused on having a low-cost mill. I think we're probably top quartile, if not top decile from a cost structure standpoint at our Princeton mill. But that being said, the log costs and other costs associated with operating BC have gone up, and I think that's raised the cost floor. So we -- at this price, I think we can still operate that profitably, but certainly, it's getting closer even for our top-cost mill or low-cost mill rather."

And as you know, Mark, the primary reason there is just to ensure that we're matching that variable component to the cash flow that we're generating for the year. But we've said previously -- we haven't definitively ruled out the possibility of some sort of interim supplemental dividend later in the year. 
And really, you think about where we are, we're in a little bit of a unique situation in that through the end of the second quarter, we've already generated nearly $1.9 billion of adjusted FAD. We have a very significant cash balance. And so that's something the Board is continuing to assess in terms of both those factors and how we see the rest of the year playing out. So I'd still say at this point, we haven't ruled that out for at some point later in the year. But I would say even if we were to do that, which, again, the Board is going to consider over the back half of the year, we'd still expect the vast majority of that supplemental dividend for the 2021 cash flow would be paid out in Q1 of 2022."

So we had a number of projects in the queue really across the Wood Products business, that, we think, will generate strong returns, continue to position the business for -- to be low cost, highly efficient, very reliable. 
So we have a variety of projects in the queue. They run the gamut from CDKs to upgrading sorter stacker. The Elkin project, which we completed, was the forming line. So just a variety of projects across the mill largely focused on debottlenecking, reducing costs and improving reliability.

I don't think you're going to see much in the way of new capacity coming into the Pacific Northwest, primarily just it's such a tensioned wood basket. And so I think the log costs associated with that probably will prevent folks from putting too much capacity there. 
And I do think over time, we're going to lose capacity in British Columbia because of the fiber availability issue that you're well aware of. So I think on a net-net basis, we will see more capacity overall in North America. But look, we need it, right? I mean if you think about the amount of housing that we're anticipating over the next 5 to 10 years, we won't be able to cover that without some continued capacity additions across North America.

We're actively managing our portfolio to constantly improve the value of our underlying assets. You've seen a number of timber transactions to that effect, our CapEx programs in Wood Products. We have an unrelenting focus on operational excellence and driving industry-leading performance. You've seen that in terms of our OpEx results over the years as well as our competitive positioning from an EBITDA margin. 
And I think importantly, over the last year, we've made a series of capital allocation decisions that have really positioned us very well for the future. We've paid down over $1 billion of debt. Our balance sheet is strong. We have a new base plus variable supplemental dividend structure that is really going to enable us to return significant amounts of cash to shareholders over time. 
As you've seen with the FAD that we've generated through the first half of the year, we're positioned to deliver a very meaningful supplemental dividend payment in the first quarter of 2022. And that's something I think the market is probably just starting to digest the magnitude of what that variable dividend is going to be. So I think as our investor base and the market gets more familiar with the new dividend structure, starts to see the benefit as we pay out that variable dividend, we should start seeing the share price better reflect the underlying value. 
The other thing I'd say is we're optimistic that the other actions that we're taking to position the company for the future, including our increased focus on natural climate solutions and some of the other business development opportunities, are really going to be a catalyst to drive investor interest and advance -- enhance our market valuation over time."

As we've said, we certainly do intend to grow the base dividend over time. That's a core part of our overall dividend philosophy and framework. We want that base dividend to be sustainable and supportable from the cash that we generate across our businesses, over business cycles. 
So the growth in the base dividend is largely going to be driven from the growth in our more stable Timberlands and ENR businesses. And that can come from a variety of different angles, the organic growth in the business, taking costs out, disciplined acquisitions. The key is incremental cash flow that's sustainable across the bottom of market cycles. But certainly, we intend to grow that over time.
And I'd note, just as you think about the overall dividend framework, obviously, when the pricing environment is strong or even reasonable, we're going to generate significant cash flow that will get distributed out to the shareholders over and above that base dividend. So I think the short answer to your question is the market is still digesting how this is going to work.

So I would say -- and I'm going to answer this by West and by South because there are slightly different dynamics going on in each market. In the West, we're seeing good pricing this year. It's a very tensioned wood basket. And so as long as lumber demand and lumber pricing is reasonable, that's going to be a good, strong business. We saw a little bit, obviously, of a dip in harvest levels as a result of the Oregon fires last year. We'll work through that salvage this year, and you'll start to see the harvest levels kind of ticking up slowly here over time. So we feel really good about that business. I think it will continue to be strong here for the foreseeable future. 
The South, obviously, we've had some disconnects between demand and supply just in terms of the amount of inventory out in the woods coming out of The Great Recession. We've talked about that quite a bit. And I do think that there are markets within the South, geographies within the South that are starting to tension up a little bit, and that's largely a function of new capacity coming in. That's continuing to happen. 
We've got, for example, several mills that have been announced, the Biewer Mill, the Idaho Forest Products Mill in Mississippi, the Tolko mill that was just announced in Louisiana, and those are in good wood baskets for us. And as we continue to see that play out over time, I think that will just put pressure on pricing to slowly recover. I don't think that's going to happen overnight. It's a process that's going to play out over a number of years. But directionally, I'm feeling good about where we're going there. 
From an overall margin standpoint, putting aside pricing, we are very focused on operational excellence. Our operating performance, I think, is very good in that business, but we're trying to improve every day. That's part of our OpEx program. We put new targets out every year to increase the efficiency and lower cost. And so I feel good about the margin improvement opportunity there as well. So we've got good businesses.

And maybe just looking at the second half for Timberlands, it looks like the harvest should be up pretty meaningfully from the first half, maybe 15% or so. Q3 profitability down versus Q2. It sounds like there's some seasonal costs in there. Is there any way as we look, I guess, ahead to the fourth quarter that we could see that incremental volume have kind of a greater overall impact on profitability?"

Q3, that's always a lower earnings quarter for us because we do more forestry and road work in that quarter. And in the West, we typically move up the hill, the higher cost elevation units or higher elevation units. So that's a typical seasonal pattern. 
In Q2, we did ramp up harvest, certainly relative to Q1. There has been a lot of rainy weather in the south. And so we weren't able to catch up as much of the Q1 issues that we saw with the ice storms as we had anticipated. I expect we'll catch most of that up over the back half of the year absent weather events that are hard to control. So you'll see the harvest activity pick up. Cost activity is -- cost typically in Q4 are a little better because it's the reverse the dynamics, I just mentioned. So I can dimension it that way, but probably not just in terms of giving you a specific number.
All right. Well, I think that was our final question. I think that was our final question. So thanks to everyone for joining us this morning, and thank you for your continued interest in Weyerhaeuser. Have a great day."

This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported second quarter net earnings of $1 billion or $1.37 per diluted share on net sales of $3.1 billion. I'm extremely proud of our team's accomplishments in the second quarter. 
Their collective efforts delivered the company's strongest quarterly adjusted EBITDA on record at $1.6 billion, surpassing last quarter's record by 43%. Our year-to-date adjusted EBITDA is almost $2 billion higher than the first half of 2020. Wood Products delivered another record quarter at $1.4 billion of adjusted EBITDA, surpassing last quarter's record by 56%.
Turning now to our second quarter business results. I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands on Pages 5 through 8 of our earnings slides. Timberlands' earnings and adjusted EBITDA improved by approximately 5% compared with the first quarter. In the West, adjusted EBITDA increased slightly in the second quarter. 
Western domestic markets remained favorable despite the decline in lumber prices late in the quarter and a healthy supply of logs to the market. Demand remained strong as mills took precautionary measures to bolster log inventories in response to an early fire season resulting from persistent dry conditions and a period of extremely high temperatures. This steady demand pull drove our sales volumes modestly higher during the second quarter.
Salvage operations from last year's fires in Oregon are continuing to supply an abundance of smaller diameter logs to the market. Consequently, prices for smaller diameter logs in Oregon have experienced some downward pressure. As a result of this dynamic, our domestic sales realizations were slightly lower in the quarter. To date, we've harvested nearly 2/3 of our planned salvage volume in Oregon. Salvage productivity has slowed somewhat as warm summer weather arrived early, and we began to transition salvage harvest operations into higher elevation tracks, which generally have lower productivity and higher operating costs. Forestry and road costs were seasonally higher during the quarter, as we do a significant amount of this work during the warmer summer months.
Turning to our export markets. In Japan and China, demand for our logs remained strong, and our sales realizations increased significantly. Global logistics constraints, particularly with respect to shipping container availability and strong North American lumber prices, continued to impact the availability of imported lumber into Japan and China. This has resulted in strong demand for locally produced lumber and increased demand for imported logs. Additionally, a ban on Australian logs continues to reduce the supply of imported logs to China. Our China sales volumes increased in the quarter, as we intentionally flexed volume from the domestic market to capitalize on strong demand signals and pricing from our Chinese customers.
Moving to the South. Southern Timberlands' adjusted EBITDA increased by approximately 10% compared with the first quarter. Southern sawlog markets improved due to record lumber and panel pricing for most of the quarter and supply limitations resulting from persistent wet weather. Fiber markets also strengthened as mill inventories remain lean and wet conditions constrained supply. As a result, our sales realizations were slightly higher than the first quarter. 
Fee and sales volumes were significantly higher in the quarter despite impacts from multiple heavy rain events across the Gulf South. The wet weather in the quarter did, however, limit our ability to catch up on delayed harvest from the first quarter snow and ice events. Log and haul costs increased slightly, and forestry and road costs were seasonally higher. 
Although Southern export represents a small component of our operations, we continue to see strengthening demand signals from China and India, resulting in increases in both sales volumes and realizations in the second quarter. However, container availability and increased freight rates continue to be a notable headwind. In the North, adjusted EBITDA decreased slightly compared to the first quarter due to significantly lower sales volumes associated with seasonal spring breakup conditions, partially offset by significantly higher sales realizations. 
Turning to real estate, energy and natural resources, on Pages 9 and 10. Earnings and adjusted EBITDA decreased by approximately 5% compared with the first quarter due to timing of real estate sales and mix of properties sold, but were significantly higher than the year ago quarter. Earnings increased by more than 230% compared with the second quarter of 2020.
Demand for HBU properties has been very strong year-to-date and average price per acre remains elevated compared to historical levels. We continue to capitalize on this market and have been increasing our prices in many regions. This is resulting in a steady stream of high-value transactions with significant premiums to timber. In Energy and Natural Resources, production of construction materials increased as demand remained strong during the quarter.
Wood Products, Pages 11 through 13. Wood Products earnings and adjusted EBITDA improved by almost $0.5 billion compared with the prior quarter. Our lumber, OSB and distribution businesses all established new quarterly adjusted EBITDA records in the second quarter. These exceptional results were delivered, notwithstanding ongoing challenges with transportation and resin availability in the quarter. I want to specifically call out and thank our supply chain and logistics teams for their tremendous work in helping us successfully navigate these headwinds. 
In the lumber market, average framing lumber composite pricing increased 29% compared with the first quarter. Lumber demand was strong during the first half of the quarter, but began to soften as do-it-yourself repair and remodel activity weakened toward the latter part of May. The drop-off in the do-it-yourself segment, largely a result of changing consumer spending habits coming out of COVID restrictions and to some extent record-high lumber prices, resulted in lower sales activity and higher inventories at the home centers and treaters. As a result, lumber prices peaked in late May and retreated at a rapid pace for the remainder of the quarter. Although inventories at home centers and treaters increased, inventory levels at dealers and distributors serving the homebuilding and professional repair and remodel segments remained below normal at quarter end. Buyer positioning remains cautious with the reluctance to build meaningful inventory positions and a dynamic pricing environment.
Adjusted EBITDA for lumber increased $291 million or 57% compared with the first quarter. Our sales realizations increased by 25% and sales volumes increased moderately. Log costs increased slightly in the second quarter, primarily for Canadian logs. 
OSB markets experienced historic strength in the second quarter as demand continued to outpace supply. Inventories remain lean throughout the channel, and supply constraints persisted due to resin availability and transportation challenges. As a result, pricing continued to accelerate to record levels before peaking at the end of the quarter. Average OSB composite pricing increased 52% compared with the first quarter. 
OSB adjusted EBITDA increased by $172 million or 57% compared to the first quarter. Our sales realizations improved by 48%. Production and sales volumes decreased modestly, and unit manufacturing costs increased primarily due to a planned extended maintenance outage to complete a capital project at our Elkin OSB mill. Fiber costs were slightly higher in the quarter, primarily for Canadian logs. 
Engineered Wood Products adjusted EBITDA increased $11 million compared to the first quarter, a 26% improvement. Sales realizations improved across all products, and we continue to benefit from the price increases announced over the last year for solid section and I-joist products. This was partially offset by higher raw material costs for oriented strand board webstock, resins and veneer. Sales and production volumes increased for solid section and I-joist products. In Distribution, adjusted EBITDA increased $36 million compared to the first quarter, a 92% improvement as strong demand drove higher sales volumes for most products, and the business captured improved margins. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Nancy to discuss some financial items and our third quarter outlook."
107633,1671863518,2371155,"Weyerhaeuser Company, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2021",2021-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Weyerhaeuser Company","Executives","Thank you, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with our key financial items, which are summarized on Page 15. We generated over $1.3 billion of cash from operations in the second quarter and over $2 billion year-to-date. These are our highest fi",1248,"Thank you, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with our key financial items, which are summarized on Page 15. We generated over $1.3 billion of cash from operations in the second quarter and over $2 billion year-to-date. These are our highest first half operating cash flows on record. Adjusted funds available for distribution or adjusted FAD for year-to-date second quarter 2021 totaled nearly $1.9 billion, with approximately $1.2 billion related to second quarter operations, as highlighted on Page 16. 
Year-to-date, we have returned $255 million to our shareholders through payment of our quarterly base dividend. As a reminder, we target a total return to shareholders of 75% to 80% of our annual adjusted FAD. In the case of 2021, the majority will be returned through the variable supplemental component of our new dividend framework.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.8 billion of cash and just under $5.3 billion of debt. During the second quarter, we repaid our $225 million variable rate term loan due in 2026 and incurred no early extinguishment charges. We plan to repay our $150 million 9% note when it matures in the fourth quarter. 
Looking forward, key outlook items for the third quarter and full year 2021 are presented on Pages 17 and 18. In our Timberlands business, we expect third quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be approximately $25 million lower than second quarter. 
Turning to our Western Timberland operations. Domestic mills ended the second quarter with ample inventory. We anticipate slightly lower domestic log sales realizations in the third quarter, absent significant fire-related disruption. This is primarily due to modestly lower pricing for smaller diameter sawlogs. We expect large log pricing will remain favorable due to limited supply and strong export demand. We anticipate seasonally higher forestry and road spending, as those activities accelerate with favorable weather conditions. Typical of the drier, warmer summer months, harvest activity will focus on higher elevation track, where operations are less productive, resulting in slightly lower fee harvest volumes and higher per unit log and haul costs. 
Moving to the export markets. In Japan, log demand remained strong. We expect our third quarter sales realizations and log sales volumes to be generally comparable to the second quarter. In China, we anticipate significantly higher sales volumes and slightly higher sales realization. Although Chinese log demand generally moderates during the summer rainy season, we expect demand for U.S. logs will remain strong as imports from other countries remain constrained.
In the South, we anticipate significantly higher fee harvest volumes as well as higher per unit log and haul costs during the third quarter due to a seasonal increase in thinning activity. Although our sawlog and fiber log pricing should be comparable to the second quarter, we expect average sales realizations will be slightly lower due to a higher percentage mix of fiber logs. We also expect seasonally higher forestry and road costs as most of this activity is completed during these dryer summer months. In the North, sales realizations are expected to be lower due to mix, while fee harvest volumes are expected to be significantly higher, as we come out of the spring breakup season. 
I'll wrap up the Timberlands' outlook with a comment on the sale of our North Cascades Timberland, which was completed on July 7. In the third quarter, we will record a cash inflow of $261 million and a gain of approximately $30 million related to this transaction. The gain will be reported as a special item within the Timberlands segment. 
Turning to our real estate, energy and natural resources segment. We expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA will be comparable to the third quarter 2020, but earnings will be approximately $20 million higher than 1 year ago due to a lower average land basis on the mix of properties sold. As Devin mentioned, we continue to capitalize on exceptionally strong demand and pricing for HBU properties. In addition, we've seen strong year-to-date production of construction materials. As a result, we are increasing our guidance for full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA to $290 million. We now expect land basis as a percentage of real estate sales to be approximately 30% to 35% for the year. 
For our Wood Products segment, third quarter benchmark pricing for lumber has significantly reduced from record levels and benchmark pricing for oriented strand board has also recently declined. As a result, we are expecting adjusted EBITDA will be significantly lower in the third quarter. For lumber, our quarter-to-date realizations are approximately $425 lower, and current realizations are approximately $535 lower than the second quarter average. 
For OSB, our current realizations are still significantly higher than the second quarter average due to the length of our order file. Our quarter-to-date OSB realizations are approximately $155 higher and current realizations are approximately $125 higher than the second quarter average. As a reminder, for lumber, every $10 change in realizations is approximately $11 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis. And for OSB, every $10 change in realizations is approximately $8 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis. 
For lumber, as prices have retreated, we expect higher sales volumes as inventories at home centers and treaters normalize and demand signals improve for do-it-yourself activity. We are also anticipating improved unit manufacturing costs during the quarter. We anticipate this will be partially offset by slightly higher costs for Canadian and Western logs. 
For oriented strand board, we expect demand will remain favorable due to continued strength in new residential construction activity. We expect improved operating rates following the second quarter outage to complete the capital project at our Elkin OSB mill, previously mentioned. With increased operating rates, we anticipate higher third quarter sales volumes and improved manufacturing costs. These improvements are expected to be partially offset by higher fiber costs. 
For Engineered Wood Products, we expect higher sales realizations for our solid section and I-joist products, as we continue to benefit from previously announced price increases. In May 2021, we announced another increase, which ranges from 15% to 25% and will be captured over the next several quarters. We anticipate significantly higher raw material costs, primarily for oriented strand board webstock, as the cost of webstock lags benchmark OSB pricing by approximately 1/4. 
For our Distribution business, we're expecting the recent declines in commodity pricing will result in reduced margins and significantly lower adjusted EBITDA. Business results are expected to remain strong compared to a historical perspective. I'll wrap up with a couple additional comments on our total company financial items. 
Each year in the second quarter, we finalize prior year-ended estimates for pension assets and liabilities. As a result, we recorded a $138 million improvement in our net funded status as well as a reduction in our noncash, nonoperating pension and post-employment expense. Slide 18 includes our current full year outlook for pension and post-employment items. It also shows the $40 million capital expenditure increase we announced back in June for some additional high-return projects across our businesses.
Turning to taxes. We are now -- we now expect our effective tax rate to be between 20% to 24% based on the forecasted mix of earnings between our REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary. The $90 million tax refund associated with our 2018 pension contribution has now been approved, and we expect to receive the refund in the third quarter of 2021. So now I'll turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions."

Before wrapping up this morning, I'll make a few comments on the housing and repair and remodel markets. U.S. housing activity continues at an impressive pace, with total housing starts in the second quarter averaging 1.6 million units on a seasonally adjusted basis and total permits averaging 1.7 million units. Single-family starts in June reached their highest monthly level since May of 2007. Notwithstanding a slight pullback in the second quarter as homebuilders navigated supply chain disruptions, year-to-date momentum is strong, and our customers continue to expect robust housing activity over the back half of the year. Our near-term and longer-term housing outlook remains very favorable and is bolstered by encouraging long-term housing demand fundamentals.
Turning to repair and remodel. Although demand for small do-it-yourself projects has softened from the elevated levels established in the pandemic, demand for larger professional remodels remains healthy. Our long-term outlook for repair and remodel continues to be favorable, supported by an aging housing stock, rising home equity and low interest rates. 
In closing, we delivered our best financial performance on record in the second quarter, and we're well positioned to capitalize on favorable demand fundamentals for U.S. housing. Looking forward, we remain focused on industry-leading performance across our operations and are on track to deliver our 2021 OpEx target of $50 million to $75 million. Our balance sheet is extremely strong. And with year-to-date adjusted FAD of nearly $1.9 billion, we expect to return significant amounts of cash to shareholders through the variable supplemental component of our new dividend framework.
And finally, I'm pleased to announce that we will hold a virtual Investor Day on September 22. Nancy, Russell and I will give an update on our key longer-term strategic capital allocation and sustainability initiatives. Event details and registration instructions will be included in a press release later this morning. We're excited to share that update, and we'll look forward to speaking with you all again in September.

Obviously, lumber and OSB pricing, for that matter, reached historically high levels this spring. And that was really a function of housing and repair and remodel just being very strong through most of the spring into May. We've seen the pricing come off significantly here recently although I will mention pricing is still reasonably strong by historical measures. 
And I'd say what's been going on of late is really primarily a function of the smaller do-it-yourself market. We've seen that over the past couple of months come down 15% to 20% in terms of our sales into that market in June and July relative to the spring. So that's caused a little bit of inventory to build up in the home improvement warehouse and treater segments, which -- that's really been sort of the pricing pressure as the producers look to move that product that would have gone into those markets to other customers. 
In terms of how we're looking at the current situation and as we head into fall, I think the do-it-yourself market should be picking back up here. In fact, even just this week, we've seen a little bit of a pickup there in terms of sales activity into the home improvement warehouse and the treaters. So I think that's going to start picking up, and we would expect that to accelerate. 
As we get into the fall, you'll see cooler weather, you'll see kids going back to school, vacation season will be winding down. And frankly, I think just the moderation in lumber prices. I suspect some of the downtick in the do-it-yourself was a little bit of sticker shock with the high lumber prices and all the press that, that was getting. 
So in terms of the pricing environment, we think -- first of all, wouldn't be surprised at all to have seen the lumber prices overcorrect a little bit. We've seen that in the past when prices have come down. We're expecting that to settle into a range that's certainly higher than historical levels, albeit probably not at the record levels that we saw earlier in the spring. 
A couple of comments just on inventory. I think it's differential depending on what part of the channel you're talking about. I think in the home improvement warehouse and treater segment, it's probably still a little bit elevated relative to normal. But when you look at the builder and the dealer portions, I think that's probably a little lower than normal, as they really haven't wanted to build inventory in a dynamic pricing environment. 
I will say with respect to your question about cash costs, certainly, I think, in British Columbia, with the increase in log prices and some of the other dynamics there, it's entirely possible that a segment of the BC manufacturers have gone below cash cost where pricing went. So we'll see how that develops. I do think overall, probably the cost floor in North America has gone up a little bit because of that dynamic relative to history. 
So again, we're expecting residential construction should remain strong. The pro segment of repair and remodel should stay strong, and that do-it-yourself segment should start picking up here as we head into fall. So overall, we're expecting pricing to settle into a new range that's still very strong pricing by any historical context."

It was a little slow, I'd say, for the first half of the year, but certainly, we see that picking up. In terms of valuations, we've definitely seen a pickup in interest in quality timberland, and that's a statement both in the West and in the South. You can see that in some of the valuations of recently announced deals. 
I think there is a lot of interest in this space. The ESG piece, the carbon piece, I think that may be playing into it a little bit. But I do think, certainly, we're seeing those valuations tick up a bit. Certainly, that's what we're seeing in the market.
With respect to our activity, as we've always said, we are always looking to optimize and improve the quality of our timberlands to grow the value of our timber base. That's something we're doing day in, day out. And sometimes that's on the sell side, but that's also on the buy side. You've seen us with Oregon and Alabama, a couple of transactions of late. 
So we're always looking. We look at every deal that comes through. I think we'll continue to be active in that space. Russell and his team are looking at deals. They're having lots of conversations. But you've got to be disciplined. And so we'll remain disciplined and execute on deals that make good financial sense and that are value accretive for us. So we expect to be active.

107633,1671863518,2371155,"Weyerhaeuser Company, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2021",2021-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Weyerhaeuser Company","Executives","Yes. Well, you're exactly right. That's the dynamic that plays out in our markets day in, day out, and has for a very long time. When you have pricing that's in a falling environment, people are going to be very cautious about building inventories. And I",369,"Yes. Well, you're exactly right. That's the dynamic that plays out in our markets day in, day out, and has for a very long time. When you have pricing that's in a falling environment, people are going to be very cautious about building inventories. And I think what really starts to bring people back into the market is 1 of 2 things. 
First, they get a sense that you've really started to bottom out in terms of what's going on in the pricing environment. You look at what's going on today. In fact, the print last night, it showed that we saw the smallest downtick in pricing that we've seen in 10 or 11 weeks. I think because of the fires in British Columbia, there are some other dynamics that are going on that perhaps are starting to give people to feel that we've reached the floor and things will start normalizing upwards. That usually gives people some confidence to start building inventory.
The second thing is it's always a matter of if you're in that space you have to make sure that you're supplying your customers. And so to the extent that you feel like there's any risk whatsoever that you're going to have enough inventory to meet your customer demands, then people will have to come in. I'd say with the fire situation, with some of the transportation challenges, what we're hearing from the builder customers in terms of their outlook for the back half of the year, it's a careful dance for them to make sure that they don't get too low and get caught short. And we've seen what happens when that dynamic is played out, and that usually results in pricing ticking up relatively quickly. 
So I wouldn't say in terms of the dealer or distributor network, we've seen them really start to build material inventories at this point. Although as I said earlier, we have seen the home improvement warehouse and treaters start coming back. Even this week, there's been a little bit of an uptick that we've noticed. To the extent that, that gains momentum and starts pulling inventory out of the system, you could see that dynamic change here relatively quickly."

We've heard of some disruptions in China, as they've been, in particular with Taicang remediating, redoing the way they handle timber. And from what we gathered, inventories are relatively high. So I was a little surprised -- pleasantly surprised that you're still seeing strong demand on timber into China. If you could explain why you think that's happening and to some degree why the U.S. is gaining share versus other regions. 
And then, in the South, I want to say prices have begun to pick up on stumpage, $2, $3 a ton year-on-year. You're starting to see some commentary now that prices are lifting for more than seasonal reasons. Do you buy that? Or are you fairly skeptical of that, and you think we're still in a flat, perhaps deflationary period on a real basis in terms of timber?"

I'll cover the China question first. And the China market has been very strong for us this year. Pricing has been well above what we've seen really in a number of years.

Pricing has been well above what we've seen really in a number of years. Part of that has been the supply chain challenges from European exporters, the ban on Australian logs. But all of those things have come together and really opened that market back up for North American logs. And so that's been a really nice market for us. 
As you mentioned, the inventory levels at the ports at the end of June did go up 5.5 million cubic meters, which is up from May. Takeaway at the ports is down a little bit overall, and I'll get to Weyerhaeuser-specific comments momentarily, but there are a few things that are driving that, George. I mean first of all, there's always a little bit of a tick down in demand when you get into the hot rainy season. We see that every year into China. So that's a piece of it. 
But there are also some regulatory issues. They've had some increased environmental inspections. And the big one, you mentioned, which is just a changing dynamic at the port, which is one of the largest log import facilities. And what they're doing is essentially they're trying to push the sawmills deeper inland. And so there's a little bit of a dynamic going on there, where they're trying to move some of those mills away from that port. 
That happens from time to time in China. It will get resolved. We're still very optimistic that you're still going to need a lot of logs imported into that China market. So I think that's really more of a temporary issue. 
For us, in particular, our Chinese customer log demand is still very strong. Pricing is strong. And so we're actually contemplating or expecting rather to have our export volume into China up quarter-over-quarter, Q3 versus Q2. So a little bit of dynamic going on there just from the items I mentioned, but we're still very positive about that market over the back half of the year. 
Moving to the Southern market. Obviously, we have seen a bit of an uptick in pricing. And I think there are 2 things going on there. One of them is certainly the weather dynamic. When you see multiple wet weather events in the South that keeps the logging out of the woods for a period of time, which limits the supply to the sawmills and the pulp mills. And that's been going on over the course of the summer and the spring. And that's really, particularly on the pulp log, that's kept inventories pretty low for this time of year, and so that's been a piece of it.
But I do think there's also an increment to that, which is in certain geographies, the new sawmill capacity that's come in. And we've been talking about this for several years. If you put 7 billion board feet of new capacity into the South in those wood baskets where that new capacity is coming, you see a tensioning effect. And so I don't think it's going to be a hockey stick by any stretch of the imagination. It's just going to be slow, steady improvement across different geographies. 
And so we think that's going to slowly tension a number of wood baskets. And again, it's going to be specific to each geography, but that will continue to happen. We've seen a number of mills announced even just recently, and we expect that to continue here for the foreseeable future because the South is a great place to manufacture lumber."

And we have an R&D team that works on seedling improvements and different silviculture regimes to maximize the yield across our portfolio. So you're probably right, we don't talk about it as much maybe as we used to just because it's become part of our normal course. 
I would say that, that is something, I think, over time will continue to be a competitive advantage for us. I think we do silviculture and forestry very well. We have a lot of great folks, a lot of PhDs, a lot of foresters that are working every day to make sure that we're driving the best yield across our land base. And so I think it is an important part. 
I will say, even when you think about climate change, for example, the ability of our teams to really make sure that we're using the right seedlings, for example, as the climate gets warmer and really targeting the seedlings that we're planting across our landscape to ensure that we're maximizing the growth and the survival in a changing landscape. So it is definitely something that's still very important in the core to what we do even if we're not talking about it on a day-to-day basis as much."

So there's a desire to make improvements there. But I think you're right, the improvements that we've seen to date have really been around the margins. 
I think it's tough to really fundamentally change how we build houses, and that's going to be a slow process. And I'm not sure if we're having this conversation 3, 4, 5 years from now, you're going to see a real material change in the way that we build homes. You'll probably see continued improvements around the margin, but it's an established supply chain in terms of how we build this -- build these homes.

I will say over time, certainly, the environment that we're seeing with forest fires in the West and some of the natural hurricanes, other events in the South, it's something that you have to bake into your long-term planning.

And part of the issue there, too, is with the run-up in OSB webstock prices, the resin challenges, the veneer pricing, some of the input costs for making EWP have gone up quite a bit as well. So there's that balance in terms of the pricing for EWP to overcome some of those raw material costs.

So it's really dialed back to a more normal operating posture. 
But that's something that we look at closely all the time. The fire situation is something I do think we're keeping a close eye on, as I mentioned. No real impact to our Timberlands at this point, and we've still got reasonable log decks across the Northwest in Washington and Oregon. But that's something that obviously we'll watch closely. 
British Columbia, we only have the 1 mill in British Columbia. I would say the fire situation up there is probably even a little worse than it is in Washington and Oregon. A lot of the logging activity has ceased at this point in BC in a number of operating areas just because of the fire situation. If that doesn't change at some point here in the near term, I think log availability at our BC mill is going to be challenged.

And I do think over time, we're going to lose capacity in British Columbia because of the fiber availability issue that you're well aware of. So I think on a net-net basis, we will see more capacity overall in North America. But look, we need it, right? I mean if you think about the amount of housing that we're anticipating over the next 5 to 10 years, we won't be able to cover that without some continued capacity additions across North America. And so I think we will continue to see that. I think the demand signal will keep that more or less in tension. So it's not something that overly worries me at this point."

We're actively managing our portfolio to constantly improve the value of our underlying assets. You've seen a number of timber transactions to that effect, our CapEx programs in Wood Products. We have an unrelenting focus on operational excellence and driving industry-leading performance. You've seen that in terms of our OpEx results over the years as well as our competitive positioning from an EBITDA margin. 
And I think importantly, over the last year, we've made a series of capital allocation decisions that have really positioned us very well for the future. We've paid down over $1 billion of debt. Our balance sheet is strong. We have a new base plus variable supplemental dividend structure that is really going to enable us to return significant amounts of cash to shareholders over time. 
As you've seen with the FAD that we've generated through the first half of the year, we're positioned to deliver a very meaningful supplemental dividend payment in the first quarter of 2022. And that's something I think the market is probably just starting to digest the magnitude of what that variable dividend is going to be. So I think as our investor base and the market gets more familiar with the new dividend structure, starts to see the benefit as we pay out that variable dividend, we should start seeing the share price better reflect the underlying value. 
The other thing I'd say is we're optimistic that the other actions that we're taking to position the company for the future, including our increased focus on natural climate solutions and some of the other business development opportunities, are really going to be a catalyst to drive investor interest and advance -- enhance our market valuation over time."

As we've said, we certainly do intend to grow the base dividend over time. That's a core part of our overall dividend philosophy and framework. We want that base dividend to be sustainable and supportable from the cash that we generate across our businesses, over business cycles. 
So the growth in the base dividend is largely going to be driven from the growth in our more stable Timberlands and ENR businesses. And that can come from a variety of different angles, the organic growth in the business, taking costs out, disciplined acquisitions. The key is incremental cash flow that's sustainable across the bottom of market cycles. But certainly, we intend to grow that over time.
And I'd note, just as you think about the overall dividend framework, obviously, when the pricing environment is strong or even reasonable, we're going to generate significant cash flow that will get distributed out to the shareholders over and above that base dividend. So I think the short answer to your question is the market is still digesting how this is going to work. I think as they start to see the variable dividend come into play, as they start to see the base dividend grow over time, there will be an increase in appreciation for how this is going to work over time."

So I would say -- and I'm going to answer this by West and by South because there are slightly different dynamics going on in each market. In the West, we're seeing good pricing this year. It's a very tensioned wood basket. And so as long as lumber demand and lumber pricing is reasonable, that's going to be a good, strong business. We saw a little bit, obviously, of a dip in harvest levels as a result of the Oregon fires last year. We'll work through that salvage this year, and you'll start to see the harvest levels kind of ticking up slowly here over time. So we feel really good about that business. I think it will continue to be strong here for the foreseeable future. 
The South, obviously, we've had some disconnects between demand and supply just in terms of the amount of inventory out in the woods coming out of The Great Recession. We've talked about that quite a bit. And I do think that there are markets within the South, geographies within the South that are starting to tension up a little bit, and that's largely a function of new capacity coming in. That's continuing to happen. 
We've got, for example, several mills that have been announced, the Biewer Mill, the Idaho Forest Products Mill in Mississippi, the Tolko mill that was just announced in Louisiana, and those are in good wood baskets for us. And as we continue to see that play out over time, I think that will just put pressure on pricing to slowly recover. I don't think that's going to happen overnight. It's a process that's going to play out over a number of years. But directionally, I'm feeling good about where we're going there. 
From an overall margin standpoint, putting aside pricing, we are very focused on operational excellence. Our operating performance, I think, is very good in that business, but we're trying to improve every day. That's part of our OpEx program. We put new targets out every year to increase the efficiency and lower cost. And so I feel good about the margin improvement opportunity there as well. So we've got good businesses. We've got good people. The overall story around housing and repair and remodel demand to drive wood demand through the system, I think, is positive. So we feel good about both of those businesses."

And in the West, we typically move up the hill, the higher cost elevation units or higher elevation units. So that's a typical seasonal pattern. 
In Q2, we did ramp up harvest, certainly relative to Q1. There has been a lot of rainy weather in the south. And so we weren't able to catch up as much of the Q1 issues that we saw with the ice storms as we had anticipated. I expect we'll catch most of that up over the back half of the year absent weather events that are hard to control. So you'll see the harvest activity pick up. Cost activity is -- cost typically in Q4 are a little better because it's the reverse the dynamics, I just mentioned.

This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported third quarter GAAP earnings of $482 million, or $0.64 per diluted share on net sales of $2.3 billion. Excluding a special item with a net after-tax benefit of $32 million, we earned $450 million or $0.60 per diluted share. 
In the third quarter, we delivered strong results across each of our businesses despite weather-related disruptions, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and continued supply chain challenges. Our teams did an exceptional job navigating these headwinds, and I'm incredibly proud of their collective efforts and focus on safely operating our businesses and continuing to serve our customers. Truly, great execution across the entire supply chain in a difficult environment, which has resulted in record earnings and cash flow in 2021. Year-to-date, we've generated more than $3.4 billion of adjusted EBITDA and $2.4 billion of adjusted funds available for distribution. 
Turning now to our third quarter business results. I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands, on Pages 6 through 9 of our earnings slides. Timberlands earnings increased by $20 million in the quarter, which included a $32 million gain on the previously announced sale of our North Cascades Timberlands. Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $15 million compared to the second quarter. In the West, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $13 million compared to the second quarter. Western domestic log markets started the quarter in a favorable position despite weakening lumber prices and ample log supply. Demand remains elevated as mills continue to bolster log inventories during the peak of wildfire season, but weakened somewhat in September as a number of producers experienced COVID-related disruptions and finished lumber inventories increased above normal levels. 
Despite these headwinds, our third quarter domestic sales realizations were comparable to the second quarter, driven by strong domestic log prices in July and August. Salvage operations resulting from the 2020 Oregon wildfires continued in the third quarter. The teams have done an outstanding job in managing these salvage efforts over the last year. To date, we've completed approximately 80% of our planned salvage harvest and expect to conclude most of this work by year-end. As expected, during the warmer and drier months in the summer, we transitioned to higher elevation and higher cost operations. Additionally, although we experienced very minimal wildfire damage to our timberlands, active fires and dry conditions across the region resulted in restrictions on our harvest activity in the quarter, particularly in Oregon. As a result, our fee harvest and domestic sales volumes were modestly lower in the third quarter, and per unit log and haul costs were higher. 
Turning to our export markets. In Japan, demand for our logs remained strong in the third quarter. Lumber imports from Europe into Japan continue to be restricted by the ongoing shortage of global shipping containers. This dynamic is driving increased market share for our customers and robust demand for our logs. As a result, our Japanese log sales realizations increased moderately compared to the second quarter, and sales volumes were comparable. 
In China, demand for our logs remained favorable in the quarter despite seasonally lower consumption, COVID impacts to construction activity and other supply chain disruptions. Imports of lumber and logs into China continue to be constrained by global shipping container availability as well as the ban on Australian logs. As a result, sales realizations for our China export logs increased moderately compared to the second quarter, but were more than offset by higher ocean freight rates. Sales volumes to China were comparable to the second quarter. 
Moving to the South. Southern timberlands adjusted EBITDA was comparable to the second quarter. Southern sawlog and fiber markets continued to strengthen as log supply was constrained and mill inventories remain lean, resulting from ongoing wet conditions and significant weather events. As a result, our sales realizations were slightly higher than the second quarter. Fee harvest and sales volumes increased slightly in the third quarter, but fell below our planned activity level as a result of persistent wet weather and operational disruptions from Hurricane Ida. Per unit log and haul costs increased slightly in the quarter as did forestry and road costs. 
On the export side, we continue to see growing demand for our Southern logs. Our export log pricing increased substantially in the third quarter, but volumes were lower than second quarter as we continue to face challenges associated with container availability and increased freight rates. In the North, adjusted EBITDA decreased slightly compared to the second quarter. Sales volumes were significantly higher coming out of spring breakup conditions, though sales realizations were lower due to mix. 
Turning to Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources on Pages 10 and 11. Real estate and ENR contributed $45 million to third quarter earnings and $60 million to adjusted EBITDA. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $31 million lower than the second quarter due to timing of transactions, but comparable to the year ago quarter. Similar to last year, our 2021 real estate sales activity has been heavily weighted toward the first half of the year. Third quarter earnings more than doubled compared to the third quarter of 2020 due to the mix of properties sold. We continue to capitalize on strong demand for HBU properties, resulting in high-value transactions with significant premiums to timber value. 
Moving to Wood Products, Pages 12 through 14. Wood Products earnings and adjusted EBITDA decreased by approximately 60% compared to the prior quarter as lumber and OSB pricing declined substantially from record levels earlier in the year before stabilizing later in the quarter. Additionally, weather events in the U.S. South, including Hurricane Ida, resulted in temporary downtime and lost production in our lumber business. And together with COVID-related staffing disruptions, further exacerbated transportation challenges in the region. Despite these headwinds, our teams performed well and delivered strong results. 
Our EWP business established a new quarterly EBITDA record in the third quarter and the overall Wood Products segment has achieved year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of more than $2.8 billion Lumber markets began the third quarter with elevated home center and treater inventory levels due to softening do-it-yourself for [indiscernible] activity. As a result, pricing continued its downward trajectory in July and for much of August. The market began to strengthen later in the quarter as home centers and treaters work through excess inventories and consumer spending shifted back to do-it-yourself repair and remodel activity after Labor Day. When combined with solid demand from new home construction and professional repair and remodel activity, each of which remain healthy throughout the third quarter. These dynamics caused pricing to stabilize in late August and increased gradually through September. 
Adjusted EBITDA for our lumber business decreased $686 million compared to the second quarter. Our sales realizations decreased by 52% in the third quarter while the [indiscernible] lumber composite pricing decreased by 61%. Our sales volumes increased moderately in the third quarter and log costs increased slightly, primarily for Canadian logs. The OSB market weakened significantly at the outset of the third quarter with the softening of do-it-yourself repair and remodel activity. This dynamic drove lower sales activity and higher inventories at the home centers. As a result, we experienced a rapid decline in pricing from the peak record prices that we reached in July. 
Pricing then stabilized above the historical average in August, as demand from strong new home construction activity continued and the market faced supply constraints resulting from ongoing resin availability and transportation challenges. This dynamic, along with late quarter improvement in do-it-yourself repair and remodel demand, drove prices gradually higher through September. Adjusted EBITDA for our OSB business decreased by $128 million compared to the second quarter. Our sales realizations decreased by 24% in the third quarter while the OSB composite pricing decreased by 43%. This relative outperformance was largely a result of our higher percentage of premium OSB products. Our sales and production volumes improved modestly in the third quarter due to less downtime for planned maintenance. Unit manufacturing costs increased slightly, primarily for resin costs. 
Engineered Wood Products adjusted EBITDA increased $23 million compared to the second quarter, a 43% improvement. Sales realizations improved significantly across most products, and we continue to benefit from previously announced price increases for solid section and [indiscernible] products. This was partially offset by higher raw material costs for OSB web stock, resin and veneer. Sales and production volumes were moderately lower for most products as a result of planned annual maintenance during the quarter. 
In Distribution, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $53 million compared to the second quarter. Despite lower sales volumes for most products and significantly lower margins resulting from the commodity price correction, our teams did a great job navigating these challenges and delivered $22 million of adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter. With that, I will turn the call over to Nancy to discuss some financial items and our fourth quarter outlook."

I'll begin with our key financial items, which are summarized on Page 16. We generated $659 million of cash from operations in the third quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to nearly $2.7 billion, our hig",1230,"Thank you, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with our key financial items, which are summarized on Page 16. We generated $659 million of cash from operations in the third quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to nearly $2.7 billion, our highest year-to-date operating cash flows on record. Adjusted funds available for distribution or adjusted FAD, for year-to-date, third quarter 2021 totaled over $2.4 billion, as highlighted on Page 17. Year-to-date, we have returned $382 million to our shareholders through the payment of our quarterly base dividend, and we will supplement the base dividend each year with an additional return of cash to achieve the targeted 75% to 80% of adjusted FAD. For this year, we intend to achieve this entirely through a variable supplemental cash dividend. Though in future years, we may also utilize opportunistic share repurchase for a portion of this cash return. 
The supplemental dividend will normally be paid in the first quarter of each year based on prior year cash flow. However, as a result of the record year-to-date performance, we accelerated a portion of the supplemental dividend by returning $375 million to our shareholders through our previously announced $0.50 per share interim supplemental dividend earlier this month. We look forward to returning the remaining portion of the supplemental dividend with a significant payment in first quarter 2022. 
During the third quarter, we also returned $26 million to shareholders through share repurchases. Further, as previously announced, we authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program. And as always, we'll look to repurchase shares opportunistically under circumstances when we believe it will create shareholder value. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.3 billion of cash and just under $5.3 billion of debt. Subsequent to quarter end, we repaid our $150 million or 9% note at maturity, which brings our debt balance to $5.1 billion. After this repayment, we have no additional maturities until 2023. 
Looking forward, key outlook items for the fourth quarter are presented on Page 18. In our Timberlands business, we expect fourth quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be comparable to the third quarter. Turning to our Western Timberland operations, although domestic log inventories ended the third quarter higher than normal, takeaway of finished lumber and log demand have improved following a brief pullback in September. We anticipate this dynamic continuing for most of the fourth quarter. As a result, we expect our domestic sales realizations to improve from the lower levels experienced in September. 
For the fourth quarter, we anticipate our average domestic sales realizations to be moderately lower than the elevated third quarter levels. As Devin discussed, we have made great progress within our salvage operations in Oregon and expect our salvage volumes to decrease in the fourth quarter. As a result, we expect fourth quarter fee harvest volumes to be moderately higher with lower per unit log and haul costs. Moving to the export markets. In Japan, log demand remains favorable. We anticipate our fourth quarter sales realizations to be comparable to the elevated third quarter levels, partially offset by moderately lower sales volumes due to the timing of vessels. In China, despite elevated log inventories at the ports, demand for our logs is expected to remain favorable as construction activity increases seasonally and imports of lumber and logs continue to be constrained from other countries. We expect our fourth quarter sales volumes to be higher than the third quarter, partially offset by slightly lower sales realizations. Elevated freight costs and labor to load ships continue to be headwinds. In the South, weather conditions improved at the outset of the fourth quarter. As a result, we anticipate slightly higher fee harvest volumes compared to the third quarter. 
Log demand continues to be favorable as mills work to bolster lean inventories, resulting from persistent wet conditions and reduced log supply. As a result, we anticipate slightly higher sales realizations during the fourth quarter. We expect this will be offset by slightly higher per unit log and haul costs as well as a moderately higher forestry and road costs as a portion of our planned activities in the third quarter were deferred due to weather disruptions. As a result of persistent wet conditions in 2021 and significant weather events in the third quarter, we now expect full year Southern fee harvest volumes to be comparable to 2020. 
In the North, sales realizations are expected to be slightly lower due to mix and fee harvest volumes are also expected to be slightly lower compared to the third quarter. Turning to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. Fourth quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be significantly lower than third quarter due to timing of transactions. We continue to predict full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA will be approximately $290 million, and we now expect basis as a percentage of real estate sales to be approximately 25% to 30% for the full year. 
For our Wood Products segment, new residential construction activity remains strong and demand from the repair and remodel segment continues to strengthen following the improvement in do-it-yourself activity in September. This dynamic should continue for most of the quarter before weakening seasonally into winter. Excluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and oriented strand board, we expect fourth quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be higher than the third quarter. For lumber, production volumes are expected to be comparable to the third quarter. However, our sales volumes are expected to be modestly lower, resulting from the inventory drawdown we experienced in the third quarter. We anticipate this will be offset by slightly lower log costs and improved unit manufacturing costs. 
As shown on Page 19, our current and quarter-to-date realizations for lumber are slightly higher than the third quarter average. For oriented strand board, we anticipate moderately higher sales volumes and improved unit manufacturing costs, primarily due to less downtime for planned maintenance during the fourth quarter. We expect this will be partially offset by moderately higher fiber costs. As shown on Page 19, our current and quarter-to-date realizations for oriented strand board are significantly lower than the third quarter average, but still elevated compared to historical standards. For engineered wood products, we expect sales realizations for solid section and I-joist products will be comparable, while realizations for plywood will be lower. We anticipate this will be more than offset by significantly lower raw material costs, primarily for OSB Webstock. For our distribution business, we're expecting higher adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter, primarily due to improved commodity margins, partially offset by seasonally lower sales volumes. 
I'll wrap up with a couple of additional items or comments on our total company financial items. We now anticipate our full year outlook for capital expenditures to be slightly below our previous guidance of $460 million as a result of supply chain and contract labor constraints with $15 million to $25 million potentially at risk. Turning to taxes. The $90 million tax refund associated with our 2018 pension contribution was approved during the second quarter. However, we are still awaiting the refund. We expect to receive it by the end of fourth quarter 2021. Excluding this refund, we now anticipate our full year cash taxes will be slightly lower than tax expense. Now I'll turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions."

Before wrapping up this morning, I'll make a few comments on the housing and repair and remodel markets. Notwithstanding a slight decrease from the prior quarter, U.S. housing activity remained strong in the third quarter, with total housing starts and permits averaging around 1.6 million units on a seasonally adjusted basis. Although housing starts in 2021 continue at a strong pace, the cycle time between starts and completions has extended as homebuilders continue to experience supply chain and labor availability challenges. Despite these headwinds, our customers tell us they continue to expect strong demand for new home construction for the balance of 2021. 
The latest new home sales number released earlier this week further reinforces our positive view on the current state of the housing market. With favorable long-term demand fundamentals, including a decade of underbuilding, favorable demographics, we continue to have a bullish outlook on U.S. housing activity well into the future. Turning to repair and remodel. We've continued to see strength in large professional projects over the course of 2021 and expect that to continue for the balance of the year and into 2022. And while we did see some softening in the smaller do-it-yourself segment during the summer, demand has improved significantly coming out of Labor Day, and we've continued to see strong demand from the repair and remodel segment through October. Overall, we continue to have a favorable long-term outlook for repair and remodel activity, supported by numerous demand drivers, including an aging housing stock, rising home equity and low interest rates. 
Finally, we hope you have the opportunity to participate in our virtual Investor Day on September 22, where we outlined a series of multiyear strategic growth targets, including growing our Timberlands portfolio, growing our new Natural Climate Solutions business and organically growing our lumber business. We also announced several capital allocation actions and enhanced our ESG leadership by releasing our carbon record and announcing new greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. Our strategy, as we outlined at Investor Day, is simple. We intend to grow the value of our portfolio, improve our cash flows, build on our competitive advantage in the marketplace and solidify Weyerhaeuser as a premier ESG investment opportunity. These actions will ensure that we drive superior returns for our investors, including returning meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders through a growing base dividend, a variable supplemental dividend and opportunistic share repurchases, all while continuing to invest in our businesses and maintain an appropriate capital structure. 
We're excited about the future of Weyerhaeuser, and we're well positioned to capitalize on strong macro trends driving continued growth and demand for our products and new opportunities for our businesses. Before turning to questions, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize and thank Beth Baum for her leadership of our Investor Relations team over the last several years. We're greatly appreciative of Beth's contributions to our IR function and look forward to our next opportunity at the company. With best transition, Andy Taylor has assumed the lead role of our Investor Relations program. Andy joined Weyerhaeuser in October of last year after an 18-year career in the energy industry, where he served in numerous leadership roles, including Investor Relations. He's been a great addition to the Weyerhaeuser team, and we're really excited to have him taking on this new role. So now I'd like to open up the floor for questions."

I think in some of the dealers, perhaps a little lean in spots. On EWP, really, that's pretty tight across the system. So I don't think there's a whole lot of inventory there.

And that really cuts across really all aspects of the supply chain. The big one that I think has been a challenge for everyone has been on the transportation side. And that's trucking, particularly in the U.S. South, it's been a real challenge. That bleeds over into rail in many instances, all the way to the export side and finding shipping containers. So really, anything having to do with transportation is a real challenge right now. As you think about other aspects of the supply chain, labor is a challenge, I think, in many spots. You read a lot about that. I think it's impacting pretty much every industry. Ours is no different. So labor challenges. And really, to us, that's made us a little bit maybe more challenged in terms of running extra hours than we might otherwise have done so. So I think labor issues across the industry continue to be an issue. 
In terms of some of the inputs, resin, it hasn't really impacted our operations to date. But certainly, there is a tightness in terms of resin availability, and I think that's impacted the industry as a whole. The other one I would call out really is veneer, and that's been a challenge as well. So really, there are impacts across the entirety of the supply chain, and I think that's really why we're so pleased with the work our team has done in navigating some of those challenges and delivering the results that we were able to deliver in Q3."

There's also a ban on Australian logs. And so that's really opened up some opportunities for North American wood and we've really seen that demand spike up. And so that's true for China, but we've also seen the demand going into India coming up. We've started shipping into Pakistan. Turkey as well.

Well, you're absolutely right in terms of the time line for how those pricing increases typically take place. It is over a multi-quarter period. I think the way to think about that though is that just given the dynamics of what's been going on in the market, both with respect to OSB pricing and some of the other input costs like resin, veneer, et cetera, we've had a number of price increases over the last year. And so they just sort of have layered on top of each other. And generally speaking, that's the answer is we're just in this quarter, we saw several of those price increases really start to take hold. We still have more coming in terms of the previously announced price increases. So Q4 and Q1, we'll see a little bit more. The only thing I would say on that front is it's always dependent on particular regions and customers. And so we did see perhaps a little bit more in Q3 than you might otherwise think.

That was a bit of a headwind there with the size of the tariffs on Southern yellow pine. But as those have come off, we've really been building that program back up. We do see the demand in China for Southern Yellow Pine growing. I think we'll see some interesting dynamics here over the next few years, one, with the export ban of logs from Russia. I think that will be an interesting dynamic to follow. And then two, we have seen elevated levels of European logs going into that market after the beetle infestation that we've seen there. Our view is that volume is peaking, maybe over the next year or so and then should start to diminish over time. And again, I think that just opens up another opportunity for Southern Yellow Pine."

I will make a few comments by region and starting in the West. So as you think about the Western harvest levels relative to history, a few things to keep in mind. Number one, when you think about the harvest levels in kind of 2015 through 2018 time frame, to some extent, that was impacted by the [indiscernible] Timber acquisition that we did back in 2013. And as we said, that had some very mature timber that came along with that acquisition. So our harvest levels were a bit elevated for several years after that acquisition as we work that [indiscernible] class down to a more normalized level. So we always expected that to come down a bit over time. We had expected that to start going back up. But obviously, in 2020, we had a pretty significant fire season in Oregon. And so that impacted the harvest levels both in 2020, but also in 2021 as we work through some of that salvage volume. But we would expect that to start going back up next year. 
In the South, we've had a few things going on in the last couple of years. Obviously, last year, we did defer some harvest volume in the South due to some market conditions and COVID, et cetera. We had planned to have that going back up by 10% this year, year-over-year. This has just been a really wet year in the south, a lot of weather events that has really reduced our ability to get out and move wood in some of those weather events. And so we're able to catch some of that up. But I do think, to the point you just made, one of the challenges that we have in fully catching that up is just some of the availability of contracting loggers and trucking availability. So I would say on the margins, that's probably hindered a little bit our ability to ramp up to make up for some of that lost production in kind of the winter months here. But again, we do expect that to start going back up next year and we'll give more fulsome and clear guidance on harvest levels when we report for Q4."

What's going to happen with residential construction? What's going to happen from a repair and remodel standpoint? We're pretty bullish on both of those fronts. I think some other things that come into play, obviously, to the extent that we continue to see supply chain disruptions that can impact the availability of wood into the market, which obviously can have an impact on pricing. Labor availability, I would put in that mix to the extent that the industry can't find enough labor to run the mill school that can have an impact on overall supply, and that can impact the market. I do think there are a few things that are also coming into play to some extent, one of which is depending on what happens with the infrastructure bill that I think could drive some incremental demand for wood, both from a lumber standpoint, plywood, OSB, et cetera. to the extent that, that ultimately gets passed. And then just -- we do continue to see more and more momentum around wood-based building, tall buildings, mass timber, CLT, et cetera. So that could be another tailwind as well. So overall, I think we have a pretty optimistic view of what things are going to look like in the Wood Products market over the next couple of years."

This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported third quarter GAAP earnings of $482 million, or $0.64 per diluted share on net sales of $2.3 billion. Excluding a special item with a net after-tax benefit of $32 million, we earned $450 million or $0.60 per diluted share. 
In the third quarter, we delivered strong results across each of our businesses despite weather-related disruptions, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and continued supply chain challenges. Our teams did an exceptional job navigating these headwinds, and I'm incredibly proud of their collective efforts and focus on safely operating our businesses and continuing to serve our customers. Truly, great execution across the entire supply chain in a difficult environment, which has resulted in record earnings and cash flow in 2021. Year-to-date, we've generated more than $3.4 billion of adjusted EBITDA and $2.4 billion of adjusted funds available for distribution. 
Turning now to our third quarter business results. I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands, on Pages 6 through 9 of our earnings slides. Timberlands earnings increased by $20 million in the quarter, which included a $32 million gain on the previously announced sale of our North Cascades Timberlands. Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $15 million compared to the second quarter. In the West, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $13 million compared to the second quarter. Western domestic log markets started the quarter in a favorable position despite weakening lumber prices and ample log supply. Demand remains elevated as mills continue to bolster log inventories during the peak of wildfire season, but weakened somewhat in September as a number of producers experienced COVID-related disruptions and finished lumber inventories increased above normal levels. 
Despite these headwinds, our third quarter domestic sales realizations were comparable to the second quarter, driven by strong domestic log prices in July and August. Salvage operations resulting from the 2020 Oregon wildfires continued in the third quarter. The teams have done an outstanding job in managing these salvage efforts over the last year. To date, we've completed approximately 80% of our planned salvage harvest and expect to conclude most of this work by year-end. As expected, during the warmer and drier months in the summer, we transitioned to higher elevation and higher cost operations. Additionally, although we experienced very minimal wildfire damage to our timberlands, active fires and dry conditions across the region resulted in restrictions on our harvest activity in the quarter, particularly in Oregon. As a result, our fee harvest and domestic sales volumes were modestly lower in the third quarter, and per unit log and haul costs were higher. 
Turning to our export markets. In Japan, demand for our logs remained strong in the third quarter. Lumber imports from Europe into Japan continue to be restricted by the ongoing shortage of global shipping containers. This dynamic is driving increased market share for our customers and robust demand for our logs. As a result, our Japanese log sales realizations increased moderately compared to the second quarter, and sales volumes were comparable. 
In China, demand for our logs remained favorable in the quarter despite seasonally lower consumption, COVID impacts to construction activity and other supply chain disruptions. Imports of lumber and logs into China continue to be constrained by global shipping container availability as well as the ban on Australian logs. As a result, sales realizations for our China export logs increased moderately compared to the second quarter, but were more than offset by higher ocean freight rates. Sales volumes to China were comparable to the second quarter. 
Moving to the South. Southern timberlands adjusted EBITDA was comparable to the second quarter. Southern sawlog and fiber markets continued to strengthen as log supply was constrained and mill inventories remain lean, resulting from ongoing wet conditions and significant weather events. As a result, our sales realizations were slightly higher than the second quarter. Fee harvest and sales volumes increased slightly in the third quarter, but fell below our planned activity level as a result of persistent wet weather and operational disruptions from Hurricane Ida. Per unit log and haul costs increased slightly in the quarter as did forestry and road costs. 
On the export side, we continue to see growing demand for our Southern logs. Our export log pricing increased substantially in the third quarter, but volumes were lower than second quarter as we continue to face challenges associated with container availability and increased freight rates. In the North, adjusted EBITDA decreased slightly compared to the second quarter. Sales volumes were significantly higher coming out of spring breakup conditions, though sales realizations were lower due to mix. 
Turning to Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources on Pages 10 and 11. Real estate and ENR contributed $45 million to third quarter earnings and $60 million to adjusted EBITDA. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $31 million lower than the second quarter due to timing of transactions, but comparable to the year ago quarter. Similar to last year, our 2021 real estate sales activity has been heavily weighted toward the first half of the year. Third quarter earnings more than doubled compared to the third quarter of 2020 due to the mix of properties sold. We continue to capitalize on strong demand for HBU properties, resulting in high-value transactions with significant premiums to timber value. 
Moving to Wood Products, Pages 12 through 14. Wood Products earnings and adjusted EBITDA decreased by approximately 60% compared to the prior quarter as lumber and OSB pricing declined substantially from record levels earlier in the year before stabilizing later in the quarter. Additionally, weather events in the U.S. South, including Hurricane Ida, resulted in temporary downtime and lost production in our lumber business. And together with COVID-related staffing disruptions, further exacerbated transportation challenges in the region. Despite these headwinds, our teams performed well and delivered strong results. 
Our EWP business established a new quarterly EBITDA record in the third quarter and the overall Wood Products segment has achieved year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of more than $2.8 billion. Lumber markets began the third quarter with elevated home center and treater inventory levels due to softening do-it-yourself repair and remodel activity. As a result, pricing continued its downward trajectory in July and for much of August. The market began to strengthen later in the quarter as home centers and treaters work through excess inventories and consumer spending shifted back to do-it-yourself repair and remodel activity after Labor Day. When combined with solid demand from new home construction and professional repair and remodel activity, each of which remain healthy throughout the third quarter. These dynamics caused pricing to stabilize in late August and increased gradually through September. 
Adjusted EBITDA for our lumber business decreased $686 million compared to the second quarter. Our sales realizations decreased by 52% in the third quarter while the framing lumber composite pricing decreased by 61%. Our sales volumes increased moderately in the third quarter and log costs increased slightly, primarily for Canadian logs. The OSB market weakened significantly at the outset of the third quarter with the softening of do-it-yourself repair and remodel activity. This dynamic drove lower sales activity and higher inventories at the home centers. As a result, we experienced a rapid decline in pricing from the peak record prices that we reached in July. 
Pricing then stabilized above the historical average in August, as demand from strong new home construction activity continued and the market faced supply constraints resulting from ongoing resin availability and transportation challenges. This dynamic, along with late quarter improvement in do-it-yourself repair and remodel demand, drove prices gradually higher through September. Adjusted EBITDA for our OSB business decreased by $128 million compared to the second quarter. Our sales realizations decreased by 24% in the third quarter while the OSB composite pricing decreased by 43%. This relative outperformance was largely a result of our higher percentage of premium OSB products. Our sales and production volumes improved modestly in the third quarter due to less downtime for planned maintenance. Unit manufacturing costs increased slightly, primarily for resin costs. 
Engineered Wood Products adjusted EBITDA increased $23 million compared to the second quarter, a 43% improvement. Sales realizations improved significantly across most products, and we continue to benefit from previously announced price increases for solid section and I-joist products. This was partially offset by higher raw material costs for OSB webstock, resin and veneer. Sales and production volumes were moderately lower for most products as a result of planned annual maintenance during the quarter. 
In Distribution, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $53 million compared to the second quarter. Despite lower sales volumes for most products and significantly lower margins resulting from the commodity price correction, our teams did a great job navigating these challenges and delivered $22 million of adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter. With that, I will turn the call over to Nancy to discuss some financial items and our fourth quarter outlook."

I'll begin with our key financial items, which are summarized on Page 16. We generated $659 million of cash from operations in the third quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to nearly $2.7 billion, our hig",1230,"Thank you, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with our key financial items, which are summarized on Page 16. We generated $659 million of cash from operations in the third quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to nearly $2.7 billion, our highest year-to-date operating cash flows on record. Adjusted funds available for distribution or adjusted FAD, for year-to-date, third quarter 2021 totaled over $2.4 billion, as highlighted on Page 17. Year-to-date, we have returned $382 million to our shareholders through the payment of our quarterly base dividend, and we will supplement the base dividend each year with an additional return of cash to achieve the targeted 75% to 80% of adjusted FAD. For this year, we intend to achieve this entirely through a variable supplemental cash dividend. Though in future years, we may also utilize opportunistic share repurchase for a portion of this cash return. 
The supplemental dividend will normally be paid in the first quarter of each year based on prior year cash flow. However, as a result of the record year-to-date performance, we accelerated a portion of the supplemental dividend by returning $375 million to our shareholders through our previously announced $0.50 per share interim supplemental dividend earlier this month. We look forward to returning the remaining portion of the supplemental dividend with a significant payment in first quarter 2022. 
During the third quarter, we also returned $26 million to shareholders through share repurchases. Further, as previously announced, we authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program. And as always, we'll look to repurchase shares opportunistically under circumstances when we believe it will create shareholder value. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.3 billion of cash and just under $5.3 billion of debt. Subsequent to quarter end, we repaid our $150 million or 9% note at maturity, which brings our debt balance to $5.1 billion. After this repayment, we have no additional maturities until 2023. 
Looking forward, key outlook items for the fourth quarter are presented on Page 18. In our Timberlands business, we expect fourth quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be comparable to the third quarter. Turning to our Western Timberland operations, although domestic log inventories ended the third quarter higher than normal, takeaway of finished lumber and log demand have improved following a brief pullback in September. We anticipate this dynamic continuing for most of the fourth quarter. As a result, we expect our domestic sales realizations to improve from the lower levels experienced in September. 
For the fourth quarter, we anticipate our average domestic sales realizations to be moderately lower than the elevated third quarter levels. As Devin discussed, we have made great progress within our salvage operations in Oregon and expect our salvage volumes to decrease in the fourth quarter. As a result, we expect fourth quarter fee harvest volumes to be moderately higher with lower per unit log and haul costs. Moving to the export markets. In Japan, log demand remains favorable. We anticipate our fourth quarter sales realizations to be comparable to the elevated third quarter levels, partially offset by moderately lower sales volumes due to the timing of vessels. In China, despite elevated log inventories at the ports, demand for our logs is expected to remain favorable as construction activity increases seasonally and imports of lumber and logs continue to be constrained from other countries. We expect our fourth quarter sales volumes to be higher than the third quarter, partially offset by slightly lower sales realizations. Elevated freight costs and labor to load ships continue to be headwinds. In the South, weather conditions improved at the outset of the fourth quarter. As a result, we anticipate slightly higher fee harvest volumes compared to the third quarter. 
Log demand continues to be favorable as mills work to bolster lean inventories, resulting from persistent wet conditions and reduced log supply. As a result, we anticipate slightly higher sales realizations during the fourth quarter. We expect this will be offset by slightly higher per unit log and haul costs as well as a moderately higher forestry and road costs as a portion of our planned activities in the third quarter were deferred due to weather disruptions. As a result of persistent wet conditions in 2021 and significant weather events in the third quarter, we now expect full year Southern fee harvest volumes to be comparable to 2020. 
In the North, sales realizations are expected to be slightly lower due to mix and fee harvest volumes are also expected to be slightly lower compared to the third quarter. Turning to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. Fourth quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be significantly lower than third quarter due to timing of transactions. We continue to predict full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA will be approximately $290 million, and we now expect basis as a percentage of real estate sales to be approximately 25% to 30% for the full year. 
For our Wood Products segment, new residential construction activity remains strong and demand from the repair and remodel segment continues to strengthen following the improvement in do-it-yourself activity in September. This dynamic should continue for most of the quarter before weakening seasonally into winter. Excluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and oriented strand board, we expect fourth quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be higher than the third quarter. For lumber, production volumes are expected to be comparable to the third quarter. However, our sales volumes are expected to be modestly lower, resulting from the inventory drawdown we experienced in the third quarter. We anticipate this will be offset by slightly lower log costs and improved unit manufacturing costs. 
As shown on Page 19, our current and quarter-to-date realizations for lumber are slightly higher than the third quarter average. For oriented strand board, we anticipate moderately higher sales volumes and improved unit manufacturing costs, primarily due to less downtime for planned maintenance during the fourth quarter. We expect this will be partially offset by moderately higher fiber costs. As shown on Page 19, our current and quarter-to-date realizations for oriented strand board are significantly lower than the third quarter average, but still elevated compared to historical standards. For engineered wood products, we expect sales realizations for solid section and I-joist products will be comparable, while realizations for plywood will be lower. We anticipate this will be more than offset by significantly lower raw material costs, primarily for OSB webstock. For our distribution business, we're expecting higher adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter, primarily due to improved commodity margins, partially offset by seasonally lower sales volumes. 
I'll wrap up with a couple of additional items or comments on our total company financial items. We now anticipate our full year outlook for capital expenditures to be slightly below our previous guidance of $460 million as a result of supply chain and contract labor constraints with $15 million to $25 million potentially at risk. Turning to taxes. The $90 million tax refund associated with our 2018 pension contribution was approved during the second quarter. However, we are still awaiting the refund. We expect to receive it by the end of fourth quarter 2021. Excluding this refund, we now anticipate our full year cash taxes will be slightly lower than tax expense. Now I'll turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions."

Before wrapping up this morning, I'll make a few comments on the housing and repair and remodel markets. Notwithstanding a slight decrease from the prior quarter, U.S. housing activity remained strong in the third quarter, with total housing starts and permits averaging around 1.6 million units on a seasonally adjusted basis. Although housing starts in 2021 continue at a strong pace, the cycle time between starts and completions has extended as homebuilders continue to experience supply chain and labor availability challenges. Despite these headwinds, our customers tell us they continue to expect strong demand for new home construction for the balance of 2021. 
The latest new home sales number released earlier this week further reinforces our positive view on the current state of the housing market. With favorable long-term demand fundamentals, including a decade of underbuilding, favorable demographics, we continue to have a bullish outlook on U.S. housing activity well into the future. Turning to repair and remodel. We've continued to see strength in large professional projects over the course of 2021 and expect that to continue for the balance of the year and into 2022. And while we did see some softening in the smaller do-it-yourself segment during the summer, demand has improved significantly coming out of Labor Day, and we've continued to see strong demand from the repair and remodel segment through October. Overall, we continue to have a favorable long-term outlook for repair and remodel activity, supported by numerous demand drivers, including an aging housing stock, rising home equity and low interest rates. 
Finally, we hope you have the opportunity to participate in our virtual Investor Day on September 22, where we outlined a series of multiyear strategic growth targets, including growing our Timberlands portfolio, growing our new Natural Climate Solutions business and organically growing our lumber business. We also announced several capital allocation actions and enhanced our ESG leadership by releasing our carbon record and announcing new greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. Our strategy, as we outlined at Investor Day, is simple. We intend to grow the value of our portfolio, improve our cash flows, build on our competitive advantage in the marketplace and solidify Weyerhaeuser as a premier ESG investment opportunity. These actions will ensure that we drive superior returns for our investors, including returning meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders through a growing base dividend, a variable supplemental dividend and opportunistic share repurchases, all while continuing to invest in our businesses and maintain an appropriate capital structure. 
We're excited about the future of Weyerhaeuser, and we're well positioned to capitalize on strong macro trends driving continued growth and demand for our products and new opportunities for our businesses. Before turning to questions, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize and thank Beth Baum for her leadership of our Investor Relations team over the last several years. We're greatly appreciative of Beth's contributions to our IR function and look forward to our next opportunity at the company. With Beth's transition, Andy Taylor has assumed the lead role of our Investor Relations program. Andy joined Weyerhaeuser in October of last year after an 18-year career in the energy industry, where he served in numerous leadership roles, including Investor Relations. He's been a great addition to the Weyerhaeuser team, and we're really excited to have him taking on this new role. So now I'd like to open up the floor for questions."

And that really cuts across really all aspects of the supply chain. The big one that I think has been a challenge for everyone has been on the transportation side. And that's trucking, particularly in the U.S. South, it's been a real challenge. That bleeds over into rail in many instances, all the way to the export side and finding shipping containers. So really, anything having to do with transportation is a real challenge right now. As you think about other aspects of the supply chain, labor is a challenge, I think, in many spots. You read a lot about that. I think it's impacting pretty much every industry. Ours is no different. So labor challenges. And really, to us, that's made us a little bit maybe more challenged in terms of running extra hours than we might otherwise have done so. So I think labor issues across the industry continue to be an issue. 
In terms of some of the inputs, resin, it hasn't really impacted our operations to date. But certainly, there is a tightness in terms of resin availability, and I think that's impacted the industry as a whole. The other one I would call out really is veneer, and that's been a challenge as well. So really, there are impacts across the entirety of the supply chain, and I think that's really why we're so pleased with the work our team has done in navigating some of those challenges and delivering the results that we were able to deliver in Q3."

Andy, looking forward to working with you in the future. So I guess the first question I had, when I look at wood, obviously, and lumber EBITDA in particular, obviously, you took it on the chin from a pricing standpoint, although you did a little bit better than the composites. But when I apply that to your volumes, actually, EBITDA held up a little bit better than I would have expected. So what were you doing from a process and operations a cost standpoint? Obviously, you've been working on this for the last number of years that helped the performance in the quarter? And then I had a couple of follow-ons."

And we're going to continue to do that. We didn't mention that on the script. But certainly, we do plan to meet our $50 million to $75 million OpEx target for the year, which I'll just say that's a really high hurdle given the inflationary environment that we're seeing.

There's also a ban on Australian logs. And so that's really opened up some opportunities for North American wood and we've really seen that demand spike up. And so that's true for China, but we've also seen the demand going into India coming up. We've started shipping into Pakistan. Turkey as well.

And so they just sort of have layered on top of each other. And generally speaking, that's the answer is we're just in this quarter, we saw several of those price increases really start to take hold. We still have more coming in terms of the previously announced price increases. So Q4 and Q1, we'll see a little bit more. The only thing I would say on that front is it's always dependent on particular regions and customers. And so we did see perhaps a little bit more in Q3 than you might otherwise think.

That was a bit of a headwind there with the size of the tariffs on Southern Yellow Pine. But as those have come off, we've really been building that program back up. We do see the demand in China for Southern Yellow Pine growing. I think we'll see some interesting dynamics here over the next few years, one, with the export ban of logs from Russia. I think that will be an interesting dynamic to follow. And then two, we have seen elevated levels of European logs going into that market after the beetle infestation that we've seen there. Our view is that volume is peaking, maybe over the next year or so and then should start to diminish over time. And again, I think that just opens up another opportunity for Southern Yellow Pine."

If we start getting an early winter in the northern regions or you have a lot of rain or other weather events, obviously, that could impact it.

And so we have the projects identified, the vast majority of projects that are going to make up that incremental production have already been completed at one mill or another. So it's -- we view it as relatively low risk to continue to execute across these projects that we've, by and large, are already done somewhere else. So that's the long answer. The short answer is we're highly confident in that number."

So I guess what I would say to that, Paul, is first and foremost, we're always focused on driving value for our shareholders. And we do that in a number of ways, managing our portfolio. We've done some transactions on the timberland side that we think have increased value. We have a focus on OpEx, and I think that showed up in how we've driven industry-leading performance across our businesses. We've taken a number of actions of late to continue to work on the portfolio and improve our performance. We've strengthened the balance sheet by paying down over $1 billion of debt. I think our new base plus variable supplemental dividend structure is going to return significant amounts of cash over time, and we've seen how that's played out this year with the interim supplemental we paid out in October, the sizable supplemental dividend we're going to pay out in Q1 2022. And so from my standpoint, as we continue to execute on the long-term growth opportunities that we laid out in Investor Day and achieved those targets, there's no doubt in my mind that's going to make us a better and more valuable company. And I think as we continue to grow the company, improve our margins, return cash to shareholders, that value will ultimately be reflected in the stock price over time."

I will make a few comments by region and starting in the West. So as you think about the Western harvest levels relative to history, a few things to keep in mind. Number one, when you think about the harvest levels in kind of 2015 through 2018 time frame, to some extent, that was impacted by the Longview Timber acquisition that we did back in 2013. And as we said, that had some very mature timber that came along with that acquisition. So our harvest levels were a bit elevated for several years after that acquisition as we work that age class down to a more normalized level. So we always expected that to come down a bit over time. We had expected that to start going back up. But obviously, in 2020, we had a pretty significant fire season in Oregon. And so that impacted the harvest levels both in 2020, but also in 2021 as we work through some of that salvage volume. But we would expect that to start going back up next year. 
In the South, we've had a few things going on in the last couple of years. Obviously, last year, we did defer some harvest volume in the South due to some market conditions and COVID, et cetera. We had planned to have that going back up by 10% this year, year-over-year. This has just been a really wet year in the south, a lot of weather events that has really reduced our ability to get out and move wood in some of those weather events. And so we're able to catch some of that up. But I do think, to the point you just made, one of the challenges that we have in fully catching that up is just some of the availability of contracting loggers and trucking availability. So I would say on the margins, that's probably hindered a little bit our ability to ramp up to make up for some of that lost production in kind of the winter months here. But again, we do expect that to start going back up next year and we'll give more fulsome and clear guidance on harvest levels when we report for Q4."

What's going to happen with residential construction? What's going to happen from a repair and remodel standpoint? We're pretty bullish on both of those fronts. I think some other things that come into play, obviously, to the extent that we continue to see supply chain disruptions that can impact the availability of wood into the market, which obviously can have an impact on pricing. Labor availability, I would put in that mix to the extent that the industry can't find enough labor to run the mill school that can have an impact on overall supply, and that can impact the market. I do think there are a few things that are also coming into play to some extent, one of which is depending on what happens with the infrastructure bill that I think could drive some incremental demand for wood, both from a lumber standpoint, plywood, OSB, et cetera, to the extent that, that ultimately gets passed. And then just -- we do continue to see more and more momentum around wood-based building, tall buildings, mass timber, CLT, et cetera. So that could be another tailwind as well. So overall, I think we have a pretty optimistic view of what things are going to look like in the Wood Products market over the next couple of years."
