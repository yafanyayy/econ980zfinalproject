Thanks, Darcy. And Darcy says happy birthday this one's for you. But welcome, everyone, to the American Electric Power's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. 2020 was a year of tremendous challenges, the likes of which we have never seen. It appears that 2021 has thus far had its own set of challenges. 
Our hearts go out to everyone that has been and are impacted by the ongoing challenges of COVID, and all the customers impacted by the severe cold and ice conditions that precipitated significant outages from Texas to West Virginia and beyond. 
There will be plenty of opportunities to do a postmortem of the conditions that led to these outages and to address changes to help ensure these kinds of events do not occur again. But as of now, getting customers back and some return to normalcy is paramount in everyone's mind. 
I'll discuss these issues a little later, but I want to tell you in the midst of significant challenges, comes tremendous accomplishments that make us even stronger for the future, and AEP is once again delivered. 
The fourth quarter further illustrate the resiliency of AEP and its employees to deliver and exceed expectations and ensuring the consistent quality of earnings and dividend growth that you would expect from our premium regulated utility. 
AEP's operating earnings for the quarter came in at $0.87 a share, ending the year at $4.44 per share, which is the top of the operating earnings range that we projected for 2020, an excellent outcome, buoyed by our employees aggressive moves to control costs during the COVID downturn of the economy, the arbitrage of residential to industrial and commercial loads that we have discussed in previous earnings calls, and certain tax and investment related outcomes that went our way, along with positive regulatory outcomes in several of our cases that concluded in 2020. 
Given the progress that we have made on cost control with our Achieving Excellence Program and in updating our load forecast for 2021, AEP is now revising our operating earnings guidance range for 2021 upward from a midpoint of $4.61 per share to $4.65 per share, bringing our new guidance range to $4.55 to $4.75 per share. 
We're also rebasing our 5% to 7% operating earnings growth rate on the new 2021 guidance range and continue in our view that we would be disappointed not to be in the upper half of the guidance range. AEP is reaffirming our $37 billion 5-year capital plan and are committed to our credit ratings quality as we move forward. 
Additionally, after further analysis, as we do each and every year through our corporate accountability reporting process, AEP is now prepared to accelerate our carbon dioxide emission reduction goals to reach 80% by 2030 and to achieve net 0 by 2050. 
We will be releasing a new climate scenario analysis report during the first quarter that has been over a year in the making, and you will find this to be a state-of-the-art report covering everything from extensive scenario analysis of carbon reduction efforts, to technology innovations, to just transition-related aspects of the complex path before us as we require substantial stakeholder engagement as we go along. 
Like all these commercials, but wait, there's more. As I mentioned to you in the last earnings call, we were refining our integrated resource plan recommendations for all of our operating jurisdictions, which we'll roll out at our next first quarter '21 earnings call or before. 
Just a brief teaser on the future plans. We are proposing up to 3,300 megawatts of new renewable energy to serve SWEPCO customers to be delivered in the 2025 to 2028 time frame. 
We will give further updates on this, as I said, by next quarter's earnings call. AEP has a lot of work to do to manage regulatory and project-related activities as well as financial activities that are respectable to our balance sheet and credit metrics. 
I'm reminded of one of my favorite movies Gladiator in which Maximus says the time for half measures and talk are over. It is time for serious execution by AEP to transform ourselves to embrace our clean energy future on behalf and for our customers and communities. 
Additionally, we will actively manage our portfolio of assets and companies to enable this movement, while ensuring our balance sheet and credit metrics strength as we define this path forward. This execution has been recently evidenced by our sale of the Racine Hydro plant. This form of asset optimization will continue as we focus on our core growth opportunities. Moving on to our economy and load. 
The AEP load forecast is up considering the recent improvement in our commercial and industrial loads, still trailing pre-COVID levels, but improving. We are optimistic about the recovery in both our service territory and with load during 2021. 
Modest overall growth should occur, led by industrials and a focus on infrastructure by the administration and in developing the hardening and resiliency related investments, such as pipelines, natural gas distribution and other infrastructure, particularly after the winter weather events. 
Julia will be covering load related topics in more detail in a couple of minutes. Our rate case activity across our jurisdictions continues to be robust. In Virginia, Appalachian Power received an order in its Virginia Triennial rate case on November 24, 2020. We were extremely disappointed in the commission's finding that APCo finished the with the earnings -- within the earnings band, and therefore, was not entitled to a rate increase. This result hinged on the commission's determination that APCo should have amortized the disposition of certain coal plant balances over 10 years starting in June 2015  versus impairing the assets in 2019, which we believe was consistent with state law. 
The company believe the commission erred in this determination. And as a result, immediately sought both rehearing and appealed the decision to the Virginia Supreme Court. So more to come on that. 
AEP Ohio filed its base rate case in June of 2020. The parties have been engaged in ongoing settlement discussions, and we'll update the Commission on or before March 4 as to whether a settlement was reached. If not, the Commission will proceed with a full hearing, but I will say that the settlement discussions continue to be positive and constructive. 
In Kentucky, the Commission issued a constructive order on January 13, awarding the company a net revenue increase of $52 million out of its $65 million request, with a 9.3% ROE and modified the transmission tracker from 80% to 100%. 
In our SWEPCO jurisdictions, we have rate cases pending in Louisiana and Texas. SWEPCO filed its Texas case in October, seeking a net revenue increase of $73 million and ROE of 10.35%. The following included investments made from February 2018, accelerated depreciation for 3 coal plants and an increase in storm reserves and vegetation management. 
Hearings are scheduled for the end of May with a final order expected at the end of October. In Louisiana, the company filed its base rate case on December 18, seeking a 10.35% ROE and a net revenue increase of $93 million. 
A little over a month into the year, and we've experienced ice storms in the East and record cold temperatures in the West. Our APCo and Kentucky territory sustained significant ice and tree damage through our transmission and distribution system with back-to-back storms. Our teams, along with significant support from our operating companies and mutual assistance teams, have made headway on restoring service to our impacted communities. 
We intend to file for the appropriate regulatory recovery as we have with other major storms. The tragedy that unfolded in Texas is an important one for me to address. First and foremost, again, our thoughts and prayers go out to the people of Texas, and particularly to those families and communities who lost family members or experienced loss and damage as a result of the than in the state. 
As you know, our AEP Texas affiliate provides energy delivery services to a little over 1 million customers in the state. The unprecedented weather conditions required ERCOT to direct AEP and others to immediately curtail load and to operate in an emergency condition to maintain the stability and integrity of the Texas grid. 
During this event, our focus centered on responding to the directives from ERCOT to ensure that the flow of available power continued throughout this crisis. We also worked with our communities to identify critical loads such as hospitals and other first-responder resources in an effort to mitigate the impacts of key resources within our communities. 
Throughout this emergency, I could not have been more proud of our team's response in dealing with the situation that confronted them. This event serves as a sober reminder as to the critical nature of our nation's energy supply and maintaining and supporting not only our economy, but also our fundamental way of life. 
As a T&D utility with cost base rates in the ERCOT portion of Texas, our AEP Texas subsidiary is not a generator nor is it a retail electric provider, so we expect minimal, if any, financial impact from the ERCOT, Texas weather events. 
Our AEP wind assets in ERCOT began to experience outages on February 10 and started returning to service on February 19. We expect all 3 wind farms to be returned to full availability soon. We have no financial exposure from our hedges, which are all based upon unit contingent performance. 
Also, financial performance-related to wholesale loads served by AEP Energy Partners and ERCOT is not material. In the SPP, we also experienced minimal load shedding events, but fuel costs were substantially higher during this event. And as you know, we recover fuel through our fuel clauses as a pass-through. That being said, in the SWEPCO and PSO jurisdictions, we will work with the various state commissions on any alternative fuel recovery mechanisms to lessen the impacts to our customers, much like we do with major storm costs, but we have to be respectful of the cash flow metrics and the capital structure of the company going forward. 
So certainly, a weighted average cost of capital is extremely important from that perspective. These events, along with others around the country, have indicated the need for specific policy changes that focus on further refinements and reliability and resiliency of the grid. 
Specifically, we would encourage more robust reliability assessments across electric, gas and other critical infrastructure classes determine where interdependencies exist, and market designs that promote adequate capacity levels and increased generation reserve margins to provide us sufficient safety net during emergency situations. In addition to counteractive frequency, intensity and impact of storms, we need to ensure a higher level of system resilience by implementing transmission planning and interconnection reforms to enable regions to lean on each other during times of crisis as well as winterization requirements for power plants, natural gas delivery systems and critical infrastructure. Actually, in 2014, testified before the Senate and Energy Committee regarding some of these recommendations after the that hit the PJM territories. 
All stakeholders must do better to address the issues that led us to these failures that have impacted so many customers at the worst possible time. Whether it's winter and summer weather event reliability or the speed at which the clean energy future can occur, AEP stands ready to be an active participant in resolving these issues, both from a state and national perspective. 
We will also remain active on other significant issues impacting our society from racial injustice to COVID-related safety as we strive to advance in a positive way in the communities that we are so fortunate to serve. 
So now I'll move to the equalizer chart, and that's the, I think, the second page of the handout, and I'll go through that. So our overall ROE is 9.1% across the board. We generally target the ROE for our regulated segments combined to be in the 9.5% to 10% range. 
But as you see, the ROEs below are not weather normalized, and keep in mind that we're also thickening the equity layers as we go along as well. And you also note in the table, at least the indication of the size of the bubbles that you see, AEP Transmission Holdco is now our largest company based on average equity, followed by APCo with AEP Texas, I&M, AP Ohio and SWEPCO being comparable to each other. 
So first with AEP Ohio. The ROE for AEP Ohio at the end of the fourth quarter was 10.7%. AEP Ohio's ROE was above authorized primarily due to favorable regulatory items, partially offset by the roll-off of the legacy fuel and capacity carrying charge recoveries that we've discussed in the past. 
We expect the ROE to trend around authorized levels of 10% as we maintain concurrent capital recovery of distribution and transmission investment. In June 2020, as I said earlier, AEP Ohio filed the base case, and certainly, we'll see an outcome of that pretty soon. 
APCo -- the ROE for APCo at the end of the fourth quarter was 8.6%. Its ROE was below authorized due to lower normalized usage and higher amortization and depreciation from increased Virginia depreciation rates and increased capital investments, partially offset by lower O&M expenses. 
And of course, we already talked about the Virginia Triennial review. APCo did subsequently file a petition for reconsideration with the Commission, which was granted in December 2020 and result in suspension of that final order at this point. 
As far as Kentucky is concerned, we ended the fourth quarter at 5.5% ROE. The ROE was below authorized due to loss of load from weak economic conditions and loss of major customers, along with higher expenses. 
Transmission revenues were also lower due to the delay of some capital projects. And of course, you knew we filed a base rate case there. So we fully expect that ROE to improve after the rate case outcome. 
I&M, its ROE is 11.4%. I&M's ROE was above authorized due to continued management O&M expenses, reduced interest expense and rates true-ups, partially offset by lower commercial and industrial sales. I&M is projecting to trend below 10%, consistent with the authorized ROEs of 9.86% in Michigan and 9.7% in Indiana. 
PSO. The ROE there is 9%. Its ROE was below its authorized level, primarily due to lower normalized usage and unfavorable weather in 2020, partially offset by continued management of O&M expenses. And PSO's 2019 base case approved a transmission tracker, a partial distribution tracker and an ROE of 9.4%. 
PSO's 2019 base case settlement also required filing a case no later than October of 2021. So more to come on that. 
SWEPCO. The ROE for SWEPCO at the end of the fourth quarter was 7.5%. ROE was below authorized due to loss of load and the continued impact of the Arkansas share of Turk, which we've discussed several times, that equates to about 110 basis points discount associated with Turk. 
And then in October 2020, as you know, I already talked about this, filed a Texas case, and then we recently filed Louisiana case as well. So more to come on that one. 
AEP Texas. The ROE is 7.9% at the end of the fourth quarter. It's below authorized due to lag associated with the timing of annual cost recovery filings and onetime adjustments from our finalized base rate case earlier in 2020. Favorable regulatory treatment allows AEP Texas to file annual DCRF and biannual TCOS filings to recover cost and capital investment and had to wait until after the rate case to file those. 
While the exception is for the ROE to trend towards an authorized ROE of 9.4% in the longer term, continued significant levels of investment in Texas will continue to impact the ROE. 
AEP Transmission Holdco came in at fourth quarter at 9.9%. It was below authorized, primarily driven by the annual revenue true-up in the second quarter of 2020 to return the overcollection of 2019 revenues and then transmission is forecasting their ROE to be in the mid-10% range in 2021. 
So all in all, an outstanding year, both financially and operationally given the significant challenges in 2020, and we are off to a great start in 2021. AEP has shown time and time again, our agility and resilience and meeting our objective of consistent quality of earnings and dividends that embody a truly premium electric utility. 
And as we emerge from the COVID challenge and get the economy back on track in 2021 while working on a clean energy future to paraphrase the lyrics of Jonny Nash, you passed away in 2020, I can see clearly now the rain has gone, and we can remove all obstacles in our way to a bright sunshiny day. 
As many of you already know, Brian Tierney has moved on to take over our focus on the corporate strategy after serving over 11 years as CFO. I want to thank him for his dedication to the company and to our investors while in this important role. 
Now I'll turn it over to our new CFO, who many of you already know, Julie Sloat. She approaches everything with the infectious energy and focus that will take AEP to the next level, even Brian would agree with that. Julie, go ahead."

Thank you, Darcy, and happy birthday, Betty Jo. It's good to be with everyone this morning. I'm going to walk us through the fourth quarter results, spend a little more time on the full year financial results, share some thoughts on our service territory load and economy, review our balance sheet and liquidity and then we'll finish up with our revised outlook for 2021. 
So let's go to Slide #6, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter and for the year-to-date periods. GAAP earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.88 per share compared to $0.31 per share in 2019. GAAP earnings for the year were $4.44 per share compared to $3.89 per share in 2019. 
There's a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on Pages 15 and 16 of the presentation today. 
So let's walk through our fourth quarter operating earnings performance by segment, which is laid out on Slide #7. Operating earnings for the fourth quarter totaled $0.87 per share compared to $0.60 per share in 2019. The detail by segment is provided in the boxes on the chart. 
But to summarize, the change in our collective regulated businesses was driven by lower O&M and the return on incremental investment to serve our customers, which more than offset higher depreciation and unfavorable weather. 
On the generation and marketing side, earnings were up $0.05 from 2019. This was driven by land sales and favorable effects associated with the retirement of plant and the generation business as well as higher wholesale margins. Lower retail margins were offset by the expected timing of income taxes. 
Corporate and other was up $0.10 from last year, primarily due to lower taxes relating to state tax adjustments and consolidating items and investment gain on a privately held investment, all of which was partially offset by higher O&M. 
So let's take a look at our full year results on Page #8. Annual operating earnings for 2020 were $4.44 per share or $2.2 billion compared to $4.24 per share or $2.1 billion in 2019. 
Looking at the drivers by segment. Operating earnings for vertically integrated utilities were $2.21 per share, up $0.04 year-over-year. Favorable items in this segment included lower O&M, the impact of rate changes across multiple jurisdictions and higher transmission revenue, primarily due to true-ups. 
Weather was unfavorable due to warmer-than-normal temperatures in 2020 and a warmer summer in 2019. Other decreases included higher depreciation and tax expenses and lower revenue items in AFUDC. 
Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $1.03 per share, up $0.03 from 2019. Favorable drivers in this segment included higher rate changes, the recovery of increased transmission investment in ERCOT and the impact of the Ohio transmission true-up both on O&M and transmission revenue. 
Other O&M was favorable due to the concerted effort to decrease O&M expenditures through onetime and sustainable reductions. These items were partially offset by the 2019 reversal of a regulatory provision in Ohio and higher depreciation associated with the increased investment. Other smaller drivers include things like higher interest and tax expenses the roll-off of legacy riders in Ohio, prior year Texas carrying charges, unfavorable weather and AFUDC. 
The transmission -- the AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $1.03 per share, down $0.02 from 2019 due to the impact of the annual true-up and prior year FERC settlements. 
Our fundamental return on investment growth continued as net plant increased by $1.3 billion or 13% since December of 2019. 
Generation and Marketing produced $0.36 per share, up $0.06 year-over-year. The Renewables business grew with asset acquisitions. Land sales and other onetime items more than offset the impact of weaker wholesale prices on the Generation business and lower retail margins. 
Finally, Corporate and Other was up $0.09 per share, driven by taxes from lower state taxes and adjustments as well as an investment gain, partially offsetting these items with higher interest expense. 
Overall, we're pleased with our 2020 financial results as we landed in the upper half of our operating earnings guidance range. So let's take a look at our normalized load for the quarter on Page 9. 
Starting in the lower right corner, our fourth quarter normalized load came in two-tenths of a percent above the fourth quarter of 2019. This was significant not only because it was the first time we saw positive load growth since the pandemic began, but it was also the strongest quarter for load growth in over 2 years. 
For the year, AEP's 2020 normalized load finished down 2.2% compared to 2019. Normalized load has continued to improve since bottoming out in the second quarter of 2020 when COVID restrictions were at their highest levels. 
A strong finish for the year and our retail load is one of the drivers that enabled us to reach the upper end of our guidance range in 2020. I'll talk a little bit more about why this occurred when we get to Slide 11, where we can view some economic data specific to our service territory. 
But for 2021, we're projecting two-tenths of a percent growth in normalized load. While this will be an improvement from the 2.2% decline in 2020, it also shows that our service territory is gradually getting back to its normal growth trajectory. 
In the upper left quadrant, our normalized residential sales increased by 5.2% in the fourth quarter and ended the year up 3.2%. For both the quarter and year-to-date comparisons, growth in residential sales was spread across every operating company. 
Residential loads spiked in the second quarter of 2020 when the COVID restrictions were at their highest and people are spending the majority of their time at home. 
Looking to this year, while we expect residential sales to decline by 1.1% in 2021 as vaccinations are rolled out as we migrate to our post pandemic lives, we are assuming a moderate sustained load benefit from this segment, given the stickiness from work from home relationships or arrangements for many office workers across our service territory for the foreseeable future. 
So let's slide over to commercial sales in the upper right quadrant. Normalized commercial sales decreased by 2.1% in the fourth quarter and finished the year down 4.2%. Even though commercial sales were down across all operating companies in the quarter, we're seeing steady improvement since the pandemic began. 
In fact, the same sectors that were hardest hit by the shutdowns in the second quarter of 2020 were the most improved sectors in the fourth quarter. Specifically these sectors included schools, churches, restaurants and hotels. As we look forward to 2021, we expect commercial sales to experience a modest 0.5% decline as the service territory continues to recover, which is still a significant improvement from the record-setting 4.2% decline we saw in 2020. 
The improvement in commercial sales will likely track with vaccinations and as a service territory population acquires additional immunity, this class of customers should be positioned for a strong recovery. 
In the lower left chart, industrial sales increased -- or decreased by 2% in the quarter, ending the year down 5.7%. Even though industrial sales were down for the quarter in aggregate, we did have a few operating companies, namely I&M, AEP Ohio and AEP Texas post growth in industrial sales compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. 
Our projection for 2021 assumes industrial sales will continue to recover and end the year up 1.9%. On Slide 10, we have a little more color on the industrial recovery we saw in the fourth quarter. The blue bar show the growth in sales to our oil and gas customers, led by growth in the pipeline transportation sector. 
Our total oil and gas sector sales in the fourth quarter came in 1.3% above last year. In fact, the pipeline transportation sector has been the fastest-growing sector since 2018. The orange bars show the growth in industrial sales, excluding oil and gas. While it was still down 3.3% for the quarter, you can see how dramatic the sequential improvement has been the second quarter. The industrial sectors that are experiencing the strongest growth for the quarter were pipeline transportation and plastics and rubber manufacturing. 
This is mostly offset by softer demand from oil and gas extraction, mining and primary metals. Overall, we're seeing evidence of faster recovery in the industrial sector, which supports our projected growth in industrial sales for 2021. We anticipate improvements across most sectors with the exception of the coal mining sector as the industry faces headwinds with the shift toward reduced carbon dioxide emissions. 
So if you join me on Slide 11, I can provide the update I mentioned a few moments ago on the latest economic conditions within the AEP footprint. Starting with the chart on the left, you'll notice that AEP service territory experienced a 2% decline in gross regional product compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. This was 40 basis points better than the U.S. The AEP service territory was less impacted by the virus and had fewer restrictions on businesses than other parts of the country, which allowed our territory economy to fare better than the U.S. throughout the pandemic. 
Looking forward, the AEP service territory is expected to grow by 4.8% in 2021, relatively consistent with the economic recovery in the U.S. moving to employment on the right, you can see that the job market for the AEP service territory also performed better than the U.S. throughout the pandemic. 
For the quarter, employment was down 4.6%, which was 1.4% better than the U.S. This is largely the result of the mix of jobs within our local economy, which has a heavier relative concentration of manufacturing and government jobs and a smaller share of leisure and hospitality jobs. 
Going forward, we expect the job growth of 1.1% in our service territory in 2021. So let's turn over to Page 12 to check on the company's capitalization and liquidity position. Our debt-to-cap ratio increased 0.7% in the fourth quarter to 61.8%. FFO to debt increased by 0.2% during the quarter to 13% on a Moody's basis, primarily due to changes in regulatory assets and working capital. 
Our liquidity position remains strong at $2.5 billion, supported by our revolving credit facility. I'd like to touch base on a couple of things relating to our financing plan as we receive questions from time to time on this. 
So our current financing plan does not include an assumption of any asset rotation. I'd like to share that we do believe it is incumbent upon us to engage an analysis of any opportunity within our portfolio that can generate more value for another party than it can generate for us. 
So to the extent that we engage in such activity that would result in the sale of an asset or a business unit, the associated proceeds would likely supplant some of the planned equity and/or debt financing you see on Page 39 in the appendix of the presentation today. 
Nick talked about the severe winter weather in Texas, which impacted both SPP and ERCOT. I want to take a moment to provide some quantification exposure details since that's top of mind for us and also for you. 
As you know, the winter storm increased the demand for natural gas and limited natural gas supply availability resulting in unanticipated market prices for natural gas power plants to meet reliability needs for the SPP electric system. 
PSO's preliminary estimate of natural gas cost and purchases of electricity are approximately $825 million. 
SWEPCO's preliminary estimate of natural gas cost is $375 million. To provide some perspective, PSO's annual fuel and purchase power costs are roughly $550 million to $600 million. So you get the sense of how big that is. 
Importantly, PSO and SWEPCO have active fuel clauses that permit recovery of prudently incurred fuel and purchase power expenses. However, we would expect this recovery to likely occur over an extended period of time in an effort to mitigate the impact on customer bills, which is consistent with the filing we submitted yesterday, seeking a regulatory asset and mechanism to recover the costs, inclusive of PSO's weighted average cost of capital. 
So we're taking this into consideration as it relates to our financing plans since the payments to suppliers are due in March. On that note, we're contemplating the use of long-term debt and the possibility of making funding contributions to PSO and SWEPCO from the parent company. 
As far as ERCOT exposure goes, as Nick mentioned, this would be related to AEP Texas' receipt of funds from the reps, AEP renewables wind generation assets and the wholesale load served by AEP energy partners, this exposure should not be significant. 
Switching gears. Our qualified pension funding increased 5% during the quarter to 101.8%, and our OPEB funding increased 20.4% to 160.9%. Strong equity returns in both plans were the primary driver for the funded status increases during the fourth quarter. The OPEB planned funded status also benefited from lower-than-expected per capita and Medicare advantage rates, which reduce the liability. 
So let's go to Slide 13 to do a quick recap of where we've been and where we're going. So we begin 2020 with a proven track record. Our earnings in 2020 -- sorry, we began 2021 with a proven track record. Our earnings were strong in 2020 as we continue to invest capital in our businesses and earn a return on this investment. In response to the expected decline in sales from the pandemic and early mild weather, we implemented O&M savings from both onetime and sustainable reductions and we also got some help from favorable sales mix shift. 
We received approval of our North Central wind project in Oklahoma, and that will be a benefit to our PSO and SWEPCO customers. In addition, over time, we've been able to grow our dividend in line with earnings and expect to be able to do so going forward. Our dividend payout ratio is solidly within our stated target range of 60% to 70%. 
So as we look forward to 2020, we feel confident in raising our operating earnings guidance range to $4.55 per share to $4.75 per share. This is up from our previously stated 2021 operating earnings guidance range of $4.51 per share to $4.71 per share. 
There's an operating earnings waterfall on Page 31 of the appendix reflecting the midpoint of this updated guidance. The primary differences from what we shared at EEI relate to normalized load and weather reflecting 2020 actual results as well as continued focus on sustainable O&M savings from lessons learned during the pandemic. 
Not surprisingly, examples on the O&M includes things like reduced nonessential travel and training since we know now a great deal of this can be done very effectively in a virtual format, sustaining some of the reduction in material and supply expenses, minimizing over time and efficiency modifications in our field crew practices, et cetera, just to name a few. 
Specifically, we're originally forecasting our 2021 untracked O&M to be $2.7 billion, but now we are forecasting this to be $2.62 billion compared to the $2.68 billion actual for 2020. So as we proceed through 2021, we'll finalize our pending rate cases and move forward with additional opportunities in the renewable space supporting our ESG focus as we transition toward a clean energy future. 
We will continue our disciplined approach to allocating capital, and we're confident there is significant runway in our capital programs to reaffirm our 5% to 7% growth rate of the increase 2021 operating earnings guidance range. 
So thanks so much for joining us for the call today. With that, I'm going to turn it over to the operator for your questions."

We would certainly like to own as much of that as possible because I think it's really important for -- from a capital structure perspective and these companies to be well funded and have a firm foundation within the states we serve. We feel like that these generation resources, particularly the renewable resources need to be vested within the operating company. 
So we'll continue that approach. And that -- those are the filings that we'll make. And obviously, some portion of it may wind up being PPAs, but I think we have to get the message across that it's important to the vitality of the operating companies and the operating utilities in these states that we continue to flourish from a capital standpoint. 
And so I think, obviously, too, the weather events in SPP demonstrate that -- and I'm going to be probably testifying again on this pretty soon. But I really think it's important for the utility to have a view of what generation looks like in these particular events, and the interaction and interoperability of these resources with the transmission and distribution system is incredibly important. 
I started my career in -- as an electrical engineer and system operations, and I went through an ice storm, and actually, I'll tell my age, 1984. But mills were tripping with coal, pipeline was freezing, valves were freezing, all these activities were occurring, and it was our ability to redispatch and utilize the and those kinds of things that were important for us to be able to manage through that crisis. 
And that's why I think it's important for there to be control features in place and from an ownership perspective, be able to focus on ensuring those benefits for our customers. You look at even some of the coal-fired generation that was in place that mitigated some of the impact from a fuel cost perspective going forward with natural gas prices going up so much. So there's a reason for each part the portfolio, and I think it's important for the utility to be the party that runs those particular facilities. 
So that's my view. And certainly, we'll go into these cases with a firm view toward that."

So the things that we're looking to be things that are not only onetime in nature, but then obviously sustainable and try to take the learnings that we were able to glean from the pandemic really and how we had to operate in different ways. So things that we're talking about include things like data analytics, automation, digital tools, drone usage, outsourcing, workforce planning and then other other related items, essentially, those types of things that I mentioned in my kind of preamble at the beginning of the call here. 
So reducing nonessential travel and training. I mean we've been able to be very successful in a virtual format. So that actually brings a fair amount of cost savings into the pocket as well, reduce materials and supplies to the extent that we can continue to rein in on advertising, minimizing overtime, et cetera. So we're looking at this from more of a sustainability or sustainable perspective, and we'll see what else we can kind of pull out of the hat in terms of additional earnings as we go forward.

How do you think about what reforms and weatherization looks like here? And how that could impact your capital budget? 
I hear your comments about reserve margins, et cetera, I was just curious if you can elaborate a little bit further? What are your lessons learned from 2014 and 1984 here as you see them being applied perhaps in Texas holistically? And especially as you see your specific dialogues kicking off whether in Texas, or frankly, the other adjacent states as well?"
135470,704779555,2223291,"American Electric Power Company, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2021",2021-02-25,"Earnings Calls","American Electric Power Company, Inc.","Executives","Yes. So in 2014, I really testified over 3 issues. One was capacity markets and understanding the value of capacity and certainly 24/7 baseload generation. But also the second part of it was the -- at that point in 2014, it was the  gas and renewables if",434,"Yes. So in 2014, I really testified over 3 issues. One was capacity markets and understanding the value of capacity and certainly 24/7 baseload generation. But also the second part of it was the -- at that point in 2014, it was the  gas and renewables if we're going to depend upon natural gas for substantial part supply in this country, then we really have to reinforce the ability for natural gas to perform during these types of events. 
And that means someone's going to have to be able to pay for it and markets will have to compensate generators for those kinds of investments. And then for the utility system itself, it really is around infrastructure to support resiliency and hardening of the system. And also, one of the other areas I talked about in 2014 was how quickly we retire units and what the replacements of those are and how we're changing the nature of the generation mix and those have different factors associated with the planning and operation of the grid. 
So those are critical areas where I think for really, if I were to opine on Texas, it'd be more around market reform to support weatherization, market reform around communications that exist during crisis times because it's important for operators to know and even T&D operators to know where the generation is coming from to make adjustments from a transmission and distribution standpoint. And so when you think about some of these opportunities that exist for us, it seems projects on the seams of the RTOs is particularly important to have interchange capability. 
Now for Texas, it may be more DC ties, it could be -- well, obviously, it could be more transmission in general, but Texas will have to decide that. But I think there's opportunities for more levels of interchange, more ability to put infrastructure in place to support weatherization and then market changes to support the ability for capacity to be valued the way it should be based upon its contribution to the total grid. 
So those are key points that continue, and really, we sort of see -- let me -- with California, you sort of see the same thing. I mean they're depending on heavy level of imports from out of state. If out of state has issues, then they have issues internal within the state. So when you think about all those things, I think the planning and the optimization of what occurs is going to really carry the day in terms of our ability to better take care of these types of situations."

I think you have to see those decisions start this year because when you think about -- I think what's crystallized for us is really the path that we're taking. We're moving to a clean energy future. We need to be able to move from a regulatory standpoint to ensure that we're achieving the balance sheet capacity to do the things that need to be done for the transition and the optimization of the grid, and I think it's really important for us to be able to manage internally, not only from an OEM perspective, but also our assets, what generally what the assets are that contribute to not only an improved return for our investors, but also in terms of optimization of the business itself. 
So that will be part of the path because you have 2 -- you really have 2 -- maybe 3 forcing functions, but, one of those is the movement to a clean energy economy, the other is the capital structure and balance sheet of the company and then the third is really focused on those 2 objectives, but ensuring that we're moving forward with infrastructure development and grid development to support resiliency and reliability of the grid. 
Those things together along with electrification, I think, are really going to be tailwinds for this industry going forward, but in particular, AEP is the largest transmission provider, we have a large distribution footprint and we have a significant amount, as I said in the last earnings call, we were on the precipice of clean energy transformation. 
So a lot of opportunity for AEP. We just need to make sure we manage all those throttles to ensure that we're consistently driving forward."

Just wondering like how are you thinking about inorganic growth maybe on the regulated side? Or how are you prioritizing sort of all those different opportunities in front of you?"

So obviously, our priorities are around transmission, distribution infrastructure, certainly, on the regulated transformation of the resources that are ongoing. Chuck's business is really with AEP energy and so forth. They've done a great job of managing risk around that business, but they've also done a great job in terms of their allocation of capital and being able to manage it, not only within their own part of the business, but also in total the entire enterprise. 
So Chuck is more than willing to turn capital over, if it's a better use anywhere else in the corporation and vice versa. But we like for that business to be less than 10% of the overall business. So -- and it continues to track that. And it gives us the ability to not only further optimize that business, and you're seeing continued -- really continued opportunities on that part of the business with AEP Onsite Partners on special relationships with customers around resources that really drive tremendous benefit for us because we can also approach that on the regulated side as well. So I think there's an opportunity there. 
But certainly, our focus is ensuring that we're able to move forward with this clean energy transformation and all the optimization around the grid and the grid resiliency and the issues there and do it in a very pragmatic way. That means we're going to have to make sure that whoever is progressing better from that perspective, that's where the equity is going to go, and we need to ensure that we're managing that portfolio in that fashion. 
So we can now look at this business like it's a fully regulated business, and we can make decisions based upon -- there obviously are  things that we look at, like, what's the quality of the service territory? What's the quality of the regulatory environment? What's the ongoing view of valuation of any particular entity for us, for someone else? And what that means in terms of rotation of capital in terms of optimization? 
So we are continuing that approach. And I would say that we said in the past that if we -- for all of our utilities, if we see the ability to continue sustainable growth and quality growth in those jurisdictions, they make a lot of sense to us. And then, of course, we have to look at also those that are challenged and understand what those challenges are, can we raise those challenges? Are they systemic challenges? Those are the kinds of things we have to look at, and we'll continue to do that, and that's what Brian is doing."

We just have to manage the portfolio in a way that optimizes that going forward. And so that's the way we sort of think about it.

Thanks, Darcy. And Darcy says happy birthday Bette Jo, this one's for you. But welcome, everyone, to the American Electric Power's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. 2020 was a year of tremendous challenges, the likes of which we have never seen. It appears that 2021 has thus far had its own set of challenges.
Our hearts go out to everyone that has been and are impacted by the ongoing challenges of COVID, and all the customers impacted by the severe cold and ice conditions that precipitated significant outages from Texas to West Virginia and beyond.
There will be plenty of opportunities to do a postmortem of the conditions that led to these outages and to address changes to help ensure these kinds of events do not occur again. But as of now, getting customers back and some return to normalcy is paramount in everyone's mind.
I'll discuss these issues a little later, but I want to tell you, in the midst of significant challenges, comes tremendous accomplishments that make us even stronger for the future, and AEP has once again delivered.
The fourth quarter further illustrate the resiliency of AEP and its employees to deliver and exceed expectations in ensuring the consistent quality of earnings and dividend growth that you would expect from our premium regulated utility.
AEP's operating earnings for the quarter came in at $0.87 a share, ending the year at $4.44 per share, which is the top of the operating earnings range that we projected for 2020, an excellent outcome, buoyed by our employees' aggressive moves to control costs during the COVID downturn of the economy, the arbitrage of residential to industrial and commercial loads that we have discussed in previous earnings calls, and certain tax and investment related outcomes that went our way, along with positive regulatory outcomes in several of our cases that concluded in 2020.
Given the progress that we have made on cost control with our Achieving Excellence Program and in updating our load forecast for 2021, AEP is now revising our operating earnings guidance range for 2021, upward from a midpoint of $4.61 per share to $4.65 per share, bringing our new guidance range to $4.55 to $4.75 per share.
We're also rebasing our 5% to 7% operating earnings growth rate on the new 2021 guidance range and continue in our view that we would be disappointed not to be in the upper half of the guidance range. AEP is reaffirming our $37 billion 5-year capital plan and are committed to our credit ratings quality as we move forward.
Additionally, after further analysis, as we do each and every year through our corporate accountability reporting process, AEP is now prepared to accelerate our carbon dioxide emission reduction goals to reach 80% by 2030 and to achieve net 0 by 2050.
We will be releasing a new climate scenario analysis report during the first quarter that has been over a year in the making, and you will find this to be a state-of-the-art report, covering everything from extensive scenario analysis of carbon reduction efforts, to technology innovations, to just transition-related aspects of the complex path before us as we require substantial stakeholder engagement as we go along.
Like all these commercials, but wait, there's more. As I mentioned to you in the last earnings call, we were refining our integrated resource plan recommendations for all of our operating jurisdictions, which we'll roll out at our next first quarter '21 earnings call or before.
Just a brief teaser on the future plans. We are proposing up to 3,300 megawatts of new renewable energy to serve SWEPCO customers to be delivered in the 2025 to 2028 time frame.
We will give further updates on this, as I said, by next quarter's earnings call. AEP has a lot of work to do to manage regulatory and project-related activities as well as financial activities that are respectable to our balance sheet and credit metrics.
I'm reminded that of my favorite movies Gladiator in which Maximus Decimus Meridius says ""the time for half measures and talk are over."" It is time for serious execution by AEP to transform ourselves to embrace our clean energy future on behalf and for our customers and communities.
Additionally, we will actively manage our portfolio of assets and companies to enable this movement, while ensuring our balance sheet and credit metrics strength as we define this path forward. This execution has been recently evidenced by our sale of the Racine hydro plant. This form of asset optimization will continue as we focus on our core growth opportunities. 
Moving on to our economy and load. The AEP load forecast is up considering the recent improvement in our commercial and industrial loads, still trailing pre-COVID levels, but improving. We are optimistic about the recovery in both our service territory and with load during 2021.
Modest overall growth should occur, led by industrials and a focus on infrastructure by the administration and in developing the hardening and resiliency related investments, such as pipelines, natural gas distribution and other infrastructure, particularly after the winter weather events.
Julia will be covering load related topics in more detail in a couple of minutes. Our rate case activity across our jurisdictions continues to be robust. In Virginia, Appalachian Power received an order in its Virginia Triennial rate case on November 24, 2020. We were extremely disappointed in the commission's finding that APCo finished the Triennial -- with the earnings -- within the earnings band, and therefore, was not entitled to a rate increase. This result hinged on the commission's determination that APCo should have amortized the disposition of certain coal plant balances over 10 years, starting in June 2015  versus impairing the assets in 2019, which we believe was consistent with state law.
The company believe the commission erred in this determination. And as a result, immediately sought both rehearing and appealed the decision to the Virginia Supreme Court. So more to come on that.  
AEP Ohio filed its base rate case in June of 2020. The parties have been engaged in ongoing settlement discussions, and we'll update the commission on or before March 4, as to whether a settlement was reached. If not, the commission will proceed with a full hearing, but I will say that the settlement discussions continue to be positive and constructive.
In Kentucky, the commission issued a constructive order on January 13, awarding the company a net revenue increase of $52 million out of its $65 million request, with a 9.3% ROE and modified the transmission tracker from 80% to 100%.
In our SWEPCO jurisdictions, we have rate cases pending in Louisiana and Texas. SWEPCO filed its Texas case in October, seeking a net revenue increase of $73 million and ROE of 10.35%. The following included investments made from February 2018 accelerated depreciation for 3 coal plants and an increase in storm reserves and vegetation management.
Hearings are scheduled for the end of May with a final order expected at the end of October. In Louisiana, the company filed its base rate case on December 18, seeking a 10.35% ROE and a net revenue increase of $93 million.
A little over a month into the year, and we've experienced ice storms in the East and record cold temperatures in the West. Our APCo and Kentucky territory sustained significant ice and tree damage through our transmission and distribution system with back-to-back storms. Our teams, along with significant support from our operating companies and mutual assistance teams, have made headway on restoring service to our impacted communities.
We intend to file for the appropriate regulatory recovery as we have with other major storms. The tragedy that unfolded in Texas is an important one for me to address. First and foremost, again, our thoughts and prayers go out to the people of Texas, and particularly to those families and communities who lost family members or experienced loss and damage as a result of the polar vortex that engulfed the state.
As you know, our AEP Texas affiliate provides energy delivery services to a little over 1 million customers in the state. The unprecedented weather conditions required ERCOT to direct AEP and others to immediately curtail load and to operate in an emergency condition to maintain the stability and integrity of the Texas grid.
During this event, our focus centered on responding to the Directors from ERCOT to ensure that the flow of available power continued throughout this crisis. We also worked with our communities to identify critical loads such as hospitals and other first-responder resources in an effort to mitigate the impacts of key resources within our communities.
Throughout this emergency, I could not have been more proud of our team's response in dealing with the situation that confronted them. This event serves as a sober reminder as to the critical nature of our nation's energy supply and maintaining and supporting not only our economy, but also our fundamental way of life.
As a T&D utility with cost base rates in the ERCOT portion of Texas, our AEP Texas subsidiary is not a generator, nor is it a retail electric provider, so we expect minimal, if any, financial impact from the ERCOT, Texas weather events.
Our AEP wind assets in ERCOT began to experience outages on February 10 and started returning to service on February 19. We expect all 3 wind farms to -- be -- returned to full availability soon. We have no financial exposure from our hedges, which are all based upon unit contingent performance.
Also, financial performance related to wholesale loads served by AEP Energy Partners and ERCOT is not material. In the SPP, we also experienced minimal load shedding events, but fuel costs were substantially higher during this event. And as you know, we recover fuel through our fuel clauses as a pass-through. That being said, in the SWEPCO and PSO jurisdictions, we will work with the various state commissions on any alternative fuel recovery mechanisms to lessen the impacts to our customers, much like we do with major storm costs, but we have to be respectful of the cash flow metrics and the capital structure of the company going forward.
So certainly, a weighted average cost of capital is extremely important from that perspective. These events, along with others around the country, have indicated the need for specific policy changes that focus on further refinements and reliability and resiliency of the grid.
Specifically, we would encourage more robust reliability assessments across electric, gas and other critical infrastructure classes determine where interdependencies exist. And market designs that promote adequate capacity levels and increased generation reserve margins to provide us sufficient safety net during emergency situations. In addition to counteract the frequency, intensity and impact of storms, we need to ensure a higher level of system resilience by implementing transmission planning and interconnection reforms to enable regions to lean on each other during times of crisis as well as winterization requirements for power plants, natural gas delivery systems and critical infrastructure. I actually, in 2014, testified before the Senate Energy Committee regarding some of these recommendations after the polar vortex hit the PJM territories.
All stakeholders must do better to address the issues that led us to these failures that have impacted so many customers at the worst possible time. Whether it's winter and summer weather event reliability or the speed at which the clean energy future can occur, AEP stands ready to be an active participant in resolving these issues, both from the state and national perspective.
We will also remain active on other significant issues impacting our society from racial injustice to COVID-related safety as we strive to advance in a positive way in the communities that we are so fortunate to serve.
So now I'll move to the equalizer chart, and that's the, I think, the second page of the handout, and I'll go through that. So our overall ROE is 9.1% across the board. We generally target the ROE for our regulated segments combined to be in the 9.5% to 10% range.
But as you see, the ROEs below are not weather normalized, and keep in mind that we're also thickening the equity layers as we go along as well. And you also note in the table -- at least the indication of the size of the bubbles that you see, AEP Transmission Holdco is now our largest company based on average equity, followed by APCo with AEP Texas, I&M, AEP Ohio and SWEPCO being comparable to each other.
So first with AEP Ohio. The ROE for AEP Ohio at the end of the fourth quarter was 10.7%. AEP Ohio's ROE was above authorized, primarily due to favorable regulatory items, partially offset by the roll-off of the legacy fuel and capacity carrying charge recoveries that we've discussed in the past.
We expect the ROE to trend around authorized levels of 10% as we maintain concurrent capital recovery of distribution and transmission investment. In June 2020, as I said earlier, AEP Ohio filed the base case, and certainly, we'll see an outcome of that pretty soon.
APCo -- the ROE for APCo at the end of the fourth quarter was 8.6%. Its ROE was below authorized due to lower normalized usage and higher amortization and depreciation from increased Virginia depreciation rates and increased capital investments, partially offset by lower O&M expenses.
And of course, we already talked about the Virginia Triennial review. APCo did subsequently file a petition for reconsideration with the commission, which was granted in December 2020 and resulted in suspension of that final order at this point.
As far as Kentucky is concerned, we ended the fourth quarter at 5.5% ROE. The ROE was below authorized due to loss of load from weak economic conditions and loss of major customers, along with higher expenses.
Transmission revenues were also lower due to the delay of some capital projects. And of course, you knew we filed a base rate case there. So we fully expect that ROE to improve after the rate case outcome.
I&M, its ROE is 11.4%. I&M's ROE was above authorized due to continued management O&M expenses, reduced interest expense and rates true-ups, partially offset by lower commercial and industrial sales. I&M is projecting to trend below 10%, consistent with the authorized ROEs of 9.86% in Michigan and 9.7% in Indiana.
PSO. The ROE there is 9%. Its ROE was below its authorized level, primarily due to lower normalized usage and unfavorable weather in 2020, partially offset by continued management of O&M expenses. And PSO's 2019 base case approved a transmission tracker, a partial distribution tracker and an ROE of 9.4%.
PSO's 2019 base case settlement also required filing a case, no later than October of 2021. So more to come on that.
SWEPCO. The ROE for SWEPCO at the end of the fourth quarter was 7.5%. ROE was below authorized due to loss of load and a continued impact of the Arkansas share of Turk, which we've discussed several times, that equates to about 110 basis points discount associated with Turk.
And then in October 2020, as you know, I already talked about this, filed a Texas case, and then we recently filed Louisiana case as well. So more to come on that one.
AEP Texas. The ROE is 7.9% at the end of the fourth quarter. It's below authorized due to lag associated with the timing of annual cost recovery filings and onetime adjustments from our finalized base rate case earlier in 2020. Favorable regulatory treatment allows AEP Texas to file annual DCRF and biannual TCOS filings to recover cost and capital investment and had to wait until after the rate case to file those.
While the exception is for the ROE to trend towards an authorized ROE of 9.4% in the longer term, continued significant levels of investment in Texas will continue to impact the ROE.
AEP Transmission Holdco came in at fourth quarter at 9.9%. It was below authorized, primarily driven by the annual revenue true-up in the second quarter of 2020 to return the overcollection of 2019 revenues and then transmission is forecasting their ROE to be in the mid-10% range in 2021.
So all in all, an outstanding year, both financially and operationally, given the significant challenges in 2020, and we are off to a great start in 2021. AEP has shown time and time again, our agility and resilience and meeting our objective of consistent quality of earnings and dividends that embody a truly premium electric utility.
And as we emerge from the COVID challenge and get the economy back on track in 2021, while working on a clean energy future to paraphrase the lyrics of Jonny Nash, he passed away in 2020, ""I can see clearly now the rain has gone, and we can remove all obstacles in our way to a bright sunshiny day.""
As many of you already know, Brian Tierney has moved on to take over our focus on corporate strategy after serving over 11 years as CFO. I want to thank him for his dedication to the company and to our investors while in this important role.
Now I'll turn it over to our new CFO, who many of you already know, Julia Sloat. She approaches everything with the infectious energy and focus that will take AEP to the next level, even Brian would agree with that. Julie, you're up."

Thank you, Darcy, and happy birthday, Bette Jo. It's good to be with everyone this morning. I'm going to walk us through the fourth quarter results, spend a little more time on the full year financial results, share some thoughts on our service territory load and economy, review our balance sheet and liquidity and then we'll finish up with our revised outlook for 2021.
So let's go to Slide #6, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter and for the year-to-date periods. GAAP earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.88 per share compared to $0.31 per share in 2019. GAAP earnings for the year were $4.44 per share compared to $3.89 per share in 2019.
There's a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on Pages 15 and 16 of the presentation today.
So let's walk through our fourth quarter operating earnings performance by segment, which is laid out on Slide #7. Operating earnings for the fourth quarter totaled $0.87 per share compared to $0.60 per share in 2019. The detail by segment is provided in the boxes on the chart.
But to summarize, the change in our collective regulated businesses was driven by lower O&M and the return on incremental investment to serve our customers, which more than offset higher depreciation and unfavorable weather.
On the generation and marketing side, earnings were up $0.05 from 2019. This was driven by land sales and favorable effects associated with the retirement of plant and the generation business as well as higher wholesale margins. Lower retail margins were offset by the expected timing of income taxes.
Corporate and Other was up $0.10 from last year, primarily due to lower taxes relating to state tax adjustments and consolidating items and investment gain on a privately held investment, all of which was partially offset by higher O&M.
So let's take a look at our full year results on Page #8. Annual operating earnings for 2020 were $4.44 per share or $2.2 billion compared to $4.24 per share or $2.1 billion in 2019.
Looking at the drivers by segment. Operating earnings for Vertically Integrated Utilities were $2.21 per share, up $0.04 year-over-year. Favorable items in this segment included lower O&M, the impact of rate changes across multiple jurisdictions and higher transmission revenue, primarily due to true-ups.
Weather was unfavorable due to warmer-than-normal temperatures in 2020 and a warmer summer in 2019. Other decreases included higher depreciation and tax expenses and lower revenue items in AFUDC.
Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $1.03 per share, up $0.03 from 2019. Favorable drivers in this segment included higher rate changes, the recovery of increased transmission investment in ERCOT and the impact of the Ohio transmission true-up, both on O&M and transmission revenue.
Other O&M was favorable due to the concerted effort to decrease O&M expenditures through onetime and sustainable reductions. These items were partially offset by the 2019 reversal of a regulatory provision in Ohio and higher depreciation associated with the increased investment. Other smaller drivers include things like higher interest and tax expenses. The roll-off of legacy riders in Ohio, prior year Texas carrying charges, unfavorable weather and AFUDC.
The transmission -- the AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $1.03 per share, down $0.02 from 2019 due to the impacts of the annual true-up and prior year FERC settlements.  
Our fundamental return on investment growth continued as net plant increased by $1.3 billion or 13% since December of 2019.
Generation & Marketing produced $0.36 per share, up $0.06 year-over-year. The Renewables business grew with asset acquisitions. Land sales and other onetime items more than offset the impact of weaker wholesale prices on the Generation business and lower retail margins.
Finally, Corporate and Other was up $0.09 per share, driven by taxes from lower state taxes and adjustments as well as an investment gain, partially offsetting these items with higher interest expense.
Overall, we're pleased with our 2020 financial results as we landed in the upper half of our operating earnings guidance range. So let's take a look at our normalized load for the quarter on Page 9.
Starting in the lower right corner, our fourth quarter normalized load came in 0.2% above the fourth quarter of 2019. This was significant, not only because it was the first time we saw positive load growth since the pandemic began, but it was also the strongest quarter for load growth in over 2 years.
For the year, AEP's 2020 normalized load finished down 2.2% compared to 2019. Normalized load has continued to improve since bottoming out in the second quarter of 2020 when COVID restrictions were at their highest levels.
A strong finish for the year and our retail load is one of the drivers that enabled us to reach the upper end of our guidance range in 2020. I'll talk a little bit more about why this occurred when we get to Slide 11, where we can view some economic data specific to our service territory.
But for 2021, we're projecting 0.2% growth in normalized load. While this will be an improvement from the 2.2% decline in 2020, it also shows that our service territory is gradually getting back to its normal growth trajectory.
In the upper left quadrant, our normalized residential sales increased by 5.2% in the fourth quarter and ended the year, up 3.2%. For both the quarter and year-to-date comparisons, growth in residential sales was spread across every operating company.
Residential loads spiked in the second quarter of 2020 when the COVID restrictions were at their highest and people were spending the majority of their time at home.
Looking to this year, while we expect residential sales to decline by 1.1% in 2021 as vaccinations are rolled out and as we migrate to our post-pandemic lives, we are assuming a moderate sustained load benefit from this segment, given the stickiness from work-from-home relationships or arrangements for many office workers across our service territory for the foreseeable future.
So let's slide over to commercial sales in the upper right quadrant. Normalized commercial sales decreased by 2.1% in the fourth quarter and finished the year down 4.2%. Even though commercial sales were down across all operating companies in the quarter, we're seeing steady improvement since the pandemic began.
In fact, the same sectors that were hardest hit by the shutdowns in the second quarter of 2020 were the most improved sectors in the fourth quarter. Specifically these sectors included schools, churches, restaurants and hotels. As when you look forward to 2021, we expect commercial sales to experience a modest 0.5% decline as the service territory continues to recover, which is still a significant improvement from the record-setting 4.2% decline we saw in 2020.
The improvement in commercial sales will likely track with vaccinations and as a service territory population acquires additional immunity, this class of customers should be positioned for a strong recovery.
In the lower left chart, industrial sales increased -- or decreased by 2% in the quarter, ending the year down 5.7%. Even though industrial sales were down for the quarter in aggregate, we did have a few operating companies, namely I&M, AEP Ohio and AEP Texas post growth in industrial sales compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.
Our projection for 2021 assumes industrial sales will continue to recover and end the year, up 1.9%. On Slide 10, we have a little more color on the industrial recovery we saw in the fourth quarter. The blue bar show the growth in sales to our oil and gas customers, led by growth in the pipeline transportation sector.
Our total oil and gas sector sales in the fourth quarter came in 1.3% above last year. In fact, the pipeline transportation sector has been the fastest-growing sector since 2018. The orange bars show the growth in industrial sales, excluding oil and gas. While it was still down 3.3% for the quarter, you can see how dramatic the sequential improvement has been since the second quarter. The industrial sectors that are experiencing the strongest growth for the quarter were pipeline transportation and plastics and rubber manufacturing.
This is mostly offset by softer demand from oil and gas extraction, mining and primary metals. Overall, we're seeing evidence of faster recovery in the industrial sector, which supports our projected growth in industrial sales for 2021. We anticipate improvements across most sectors with the exception of the coal mining sector as the industry faces headwinds with the shift toward reduced carbon dioxide emissions.
So if you join me on Slide 11, I can provide the update, I mentioned a few moments ago, on the latest economic conditions within the AEP footprint. Starting with the chart on the left, you'll notice that AEP service territory experienced a 2% decline in gross regional product compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. This was 40 basis points better than the U.S. The AEP service territory was less impacted by the virus and had fewer restrictions on businesses than other parts of the country, which allowed our territory economy to fare better than the U.S. throughout the pandemic.
Looking forward, the AEP service territory is expected to grow by 4.8% in 2021, relatively consistent with the economic recovery in the U.S. Moving to employment on the right, you can see that the job market for the AEP service territory also performed better than the U.S. throughout the pandemic.
For the quarter, employment was down 4.6%, which was 1.4% better than the U.S. This is largely the result of the mix of jobs within our local economy, which has a heavier relative concentration of manufacturing and government jobs and a smaller share of leisure and hospitality jobs. Going forward, we expect the job growth of 1.1% in our service territory in 2021. 
So let's turn over to Page 12 to check on the company's capitalization and liquidity position. Our debt-to-cap ratio increased 0.7% in the fourth quarter to 61.8%. FFO to debt increased by 0.2% during the quarter to 13% on a Moody's basis, primarily due to changes in regulatory assets and working capital.
Our liquidity position remains strong at $2.5 billion, supported by our revolving credit facility. I'd like to touch base on a couple of things relating to our financing plan as we receive questions from time to time on this.
So our current financing plan does not include an assumption of any asset rotation. I'd like to share that we do believe it is incumbent upon us to engage an analysis of any opportunity within our portfolio that can generate more value for another party than it can generate for us.
So to the extent that we engage in such activity that would result in the sale of an asset or a business unit, the associated proceeds would likely supplant some of the planned equity and/or debt financing you see on Page 39 in the appendix of the presentation today.
Nick talked about the severe winter weather in Texas, which impacted both SPP and ERCOT. I want to take a moment to provide some quantification exposure details, since that's top of mind for us and also for you.
As you know, the winter storm increased the demand for natural gas and limited natural gas supply availability, resulting in unanticipated market prices for natural gas power plants to meet reliability needs for the SPP electric system.
PSO's preliminary estimate of natural gas cost and purchases of electricity are approximately $825 million.
SWEPCO's preliminary estimate of natural gas cost is $375 million. To provide some perspective, PSO's annual fuel and purchase power costs are roughly $550 million to $600 million. So you get the sense of how big that is.
Importantly, PSO and SWEPCO have active fuel clauses that permit recovery of prudently incurred fuel and purchase power expenses. However, we would expect this recovery to likely occur over an extended period of time in an effort to mitigate the impact on customer bills, which is consistent with the filing we submitted yesterday, seeking a regulatory asset and mechanism to recover the costs, inclusive of PSO's weighted average cost of capital.
So we're taking this into consideration as it relates to our financing plans since the payments to suppliers are due in March. On that note, we're contemplating the use of long-term debt and the possibility of making funding contributions to PSO and SWEPCO from the parent company.
As far as ERCOT exposure goes, as Nick mentioned, this would be related to AEP Texas' receipt of funds from the reps, AEP Renewables' wind generation assets and the wholesale load served by AEP Energy Partners, this exposure should not be significant.
Switching gears. Our qualified pension funding increased 5% during the quarter to 101.8%, and our OPEB funding increased 20.4% to 160.9%. Strong equity returns in both plans were the primary driver for the funded status increases during the fourth quarter. The OPEB-planned funded status also benefited from lower-than-expected per capita and Medicare advantage rates, which reduced the liability.
So let's go to Slide 13 to do a quick recap of where we've been and where we're going. So we begin 2020 with a proven track record. Our earnings in 2020 -- sorry, we began 2021 with a proven track record. Our earnings were strong in 2020, as we continue to invest capital in our businesses and earn a return on this investment in response to expect the decline in sales from the pandemic and early mild weather, we implemented O&M savings from both onetime and sustainable reductions and we also got some help from favorable sales mix shift.
We received approval of our North Central Wind project in Oklahoma, and that will be a benefit to our PSO and SWEPCO customers. In addition, over time, we've been able to grow our dividend in line with earnings and expect to be able to do so going forward. Our dividend payout ratio is solidly within our stated target range of 60% to 70%.
So as we look forward to 2020, we feel confident in raising our operating earnings guidance range to $4.55 per share to $4.75 per share. This is up from our previously stated 2021 operating earnings guidance range of $4.51 per share to $4.71 per share.
There's an operating earnings waterfall on Page 31 of the appendix reflecting the midpoint of this updated guidance. The primary differences from what we shared at EEI relate to normalized load and weather reflecting 2020 actual results as well as continued focus on sustainable O&M savings from lessons learned during the pandemic.
Not surprisingly, examples on the O&M front include things like reduced nonessential travel and training since we know now a great deal of this can be done very effectively in a virtual format, sustaining some of the reduction in material and supply expenses, minimizing over time and efficiency modifications in our field crew practices, et cetera, just to name a few.
Specifically, we're originally forecasting our 2021 untracked O&M to be $2.7 billion. but now we are forecasting this to be $2.62 billion compared to the $2.68 billion actual for 2020. So as we proceed through 2021, we'll finalize our pending rate cases and move forward with additional opportunities in the renewable space, supporting our ESG focus, as we transition toward a clean energy future.
We will continue our disciplined approach to allocating capital, and we're confident there is significant runway in our capital programs to reaffirm our 5% to 7% growth rate of the increased 2021 operating earnings guidance range.
So thanks so much for joining us for the call today. With that, I'm going to turn it over to the operator for your questions."

And we have investments that have gone positively. We've had investments that have gone negatively. And this is -- this happened to be a year where it was positive from an investment standpoint. So -- but from an ongoing perspective, it really is not so much driven. There still is some investment related activity that bleeds over into '21.
But I'd say the story of '21 is, when we had -- we didn't know exactly where the load was going, didn't know where the economy was going. We're feeling much better about that and the progress in 2021. And also our Achieving Excellence Program. We continue to advance in a very positive way from that perspective. So we felt like -- certainly, the confidence level was much more for us to raise guidance, but also continue to encourage that we'll be in the upper half of that guidance range."

We would certainly like to own as much of that as possible because I think it's really important for -- from a capital structure perspective and these companies to be well funded and have a firm foundation within the states we serve. We feel like that these generation resources, particularly the renewable resources need to be vested within the operating company.
So we'll continue that approach. And that -- those are the filings that we'll make. And obviously, some portion of it may wind up being PPAs, but I think we have to get the message across that it's important to the vitality of the operating companies and the operating utilities in these states that we continue to flourish from a capital standpoint.
And so I think, obviously, too, the weather events in SPP demonstrate that -- and I'm going to be probably testifying again on this pretty soon. But I really think it's important for the utility to have a view of what Generation looks like in these particular events, and the interaction and interoperability of these resources with the transmission and distribution system is incredibly important.
I started my career in -- as an electrical engineer and system operations, and I went through an ice storm, and actually, I'll tell my age now, it was 1984. But mills were tripping with coal, pipeline was freezing, valves were freezing, all these activities were occurring, and it was our ability to redispatch and utilize the ties and those kinds of things that were important for us to be able to manage through that crisis.
And that's why I think it's important for there to be control features in place and from an ownership perspective, be able to focus on ensuring those benefits for our customers. You look at even some of the coal-fired generation that was in place that mitigated some of the impact from a fuel cost perspective going forward with natural gas prices going up so much. So there's a reason for each part the portfolio, and I think it's important for the utility to be the party that runs those particular facilities.
So that's my view. And certainly, we'll go into these cases with a firm view toward that."

So things that we're talking about include things like data analytics, automation, digital tools, drone usage, outsourcing, workforce planning and then other related items, essentially, those types of things that I mentioned in my kind of preamble at the beginning of the call here.
So reducing nonessential travel and training. I mean we've been able to be very successful in a virtual format.

I hear your comments about reserve margins, et cetera, I was just curious if you can elaborate a little bit further? What are your lessons learned from 2014 and 1984 here, as you see them being applied perhaps in Texas holistically? And especially as you see your specific dialogues kicking off whether in Texas, or frankly, the other adjacent states as well?"

So in 2014, I really testified over 3 issues. One was capacity markets and understanding the value of capacity and certainly 24/7 baseload generation.

One was capacity markets and understanding the value of capacity and certainly 24/7 baseload generation. But also the second part of it was the -- at that point in 2014, it was the dash to gas. And then was gas and renewables, if we're going to depend upon natural gas for substantial part supply in this country, then we really have to reinforce the ability for natural gas to perform during these types of events.
And that means someone's going to have to be able to pay for it and markets will have to compensate generators for those kinds of investments. And then for the utility system itself, it really is around infrastructure to support resiliency and hardening of the system. And also, one of the other areas, I talked about in 2014, was how quickly we retire units and what the replacements of those are and how we're changing the nature of the generation mix and those have different factors associated with the planning and operation of the grid.
So those are critical areas where I think for really, if I were to opine on Texas, it'd be more around market reform to support weatherization, market reform around communications that exist during crisis times because it's important for operators to know and even T&D operators to know where the generation is coming from to make adjustments from a transmission and distribution standpoint. And so when you think about some of these opportunities that exist for us, it seems projects, on the seams of the RTOs, is particularly important to have interchange capability.
Now for Texas, it may be more DC ties, it could be -- well, obviously, it could be more transmission in general, but Texas will have to decide that. But I think there's opportunities for more levels of interchange, more ability to put infrastructure in place to support weatherization and then market changes to support the ability for capacity to be valued the way it should be based upon its contribution to the total grid.
So those are key points that continue, and really, we sort of see -- let me -- with California, you sort of see the same thing. I mean they're depending on heavy level of imports from out of state. If out of state has issues, then they have issues internal, within the state. So when you think about all those things, I think the planning and the optimization of what occurs is going to really carry the day in terms of our ability to better take care of these types of situations."

I think you have to see those decisions start this year because when you think about -- I think what's crystallized for us is really the path that we're taking. We're moving to a clean energy future. We need to be able to move from a regulatory standpoint to ensure that we're achieving the balance sheet capacity to do the things that need to be done for the transition and the optimization of the grid, and I think it's really important for us to be able to manage internally, not only from an OEM perspective, but also our assets, with generally what the assets are that contribute to not only an improved return for our investors, but also in terms of optimization of the business itself.
So that will be part of the path because you have 2 -- you really have 2 -- maybe 3 forcing functions, but, one of those is the movement to a clean energy economy, the other is the capital structure and balance sheet of the company and then the third is really focused on those 2 objectives, but ensuring that we're moving forward with infrastructure development and grid development to support resiliency and reliability of the grid.
Those things, together, along with electrification, I think, are really going to be tailwinds for this industry going forward, but in particular, AEP is the largest transmission provider, we have a large distribution footprint and we have a significant amount, as I said in the last earnings call, we were on the precipice of clean energy transformation.
So a lot of opportunity for AEP. We just need to make sure we manage all those throttles to ensure that we're consistently driving forward."

So obviously, our priorities are around transmission, distribution infrastructure, certainly, on the regulated transformation of the resources that are ongoing. Chuck's business is really with AEP Energy and so forth. They've done a great job of managing risk around that business, but they've also done a great job in terms of their allocation of capital and being able to manage it, not only within their own part of the business, but also in total -- the entire enterprise.
So Chuck is more than willing to turn capital over, if it's a better use anywhere else in the corporation and vice versa. But we like for that business to be less than 10% of the overall business. So -- and it continues to track that. And it gives us the ability to, not only further optimize that business, and you're seeing continued -- really continued opportunities on that part of the business with  AEP OnSite Partners on special relationships with customers around resources that really drive tremendous benefit for us because we can also approach that on the regulated side as well. So I think there's an opportunity there.
But certainly, our focus is ensuring that we're able to move forward with this clean energy transformation and all the optimization around the grid and the grid resiliency and the issues there and do it in a very pragmatic way. That means we're going to have to make sure that whoever is progressing better from that perspective, that's where the equity is going to go, and we need to ensure that we're managing that portfolio in that fashion.
So we can now look at this business like it's a fully regulated business, and we can make decisions based upon -- there obviously are things that we look at, like, what's the quality of the service territory? What's the quality of the regulatory environment? What's the ongoing view of valuation of any particular entity for us, for someone else? And what that means in terms of rotation of capital in terms of optimization?
So we are continuing that approach. And I would say that we said in the past that if we -- for all of our utilities, if we see the ability to continue sustainable growth and quality growth in those jurisdictions, they make a lot of sense to us. And then, of course, we have to look at also those that are challenged and understand what those challenges are, can we erase those challenges? Are they systemic challenges?

Before I get started with our results for the quarter, I just have to say I was struck with the public relation -- public react",2529,"Thanks, Darcy, and welcome again, everyone, to American Electric Power's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call, and Happy Earth Day. Before I get started with our results for the quarter, I just have to say I was struck with the public relation -- public reactions to the Chauvin verdict has been a long wait, but justice and faith in our legal system does prevail. I bring this up because it happens had chosen a song, which I do every quarter, as you know, for a different reason, but now it serves 2 purposes. One of the most mesmerizing singers I ever heard was the late Marvin Gaye. I thought of a song when actually thinking about our quarter and the multitude of activities that AEP continues to accomplish and was thinking of what's going on, the Marvin Gaye hit from 1971, written during another tumultuous time in America. This song was a plea for peace, justice and understanding perspectives to move forward in a positive way together. 
As I said, this song was released in 1971, 50 years ago, but it could not be more appropriate today. We need our leaders, our communities, and indeed, our companies to continue to come together and stop the divisiveness, which the new cycle tends to feed off of and recognize we have a lot more in common than our differences. That would be a great start to advancing this nation in a positive way. 
That being said, getting to my original purpose, as I said earlier, what's going on with AEP, as the lyric say, ""Hey, man, what's happening? Who? Everything is everything."" We're going to do a get down today, boy, I'll tell you. 
So here we go. The first quarter of 2021 came in with operating earnings of $1.15 per share versus $1.02 for first quarter '20, which met our expectations, particularly given winter storm Yuri's impact in Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, which we reported on in last quarter's earnings call. AEP continues to reaffirm our 2021 guidance range of $4.55 to $4.75 per share and our 5% to 7% long-term growth rate. And we would still be disappointed not to be in the upper half of the guidance range. 
It's hard to believe it's been over a year since we entered into the pandemic. I continue to be impressed by the resiliency of our employees, their dedication and commitment to our customers and communities. We continue to practice social distancing, are encouraging vaccinations and looking forward to putting COVID in the rearview mirror. 
As we look towards the future, we are seeing our communities starting to rebound from the shadow of the pandemic. Job growth and electric consumption show continued improvement, supporting our view that the economy within our service territory will continue to rebound. 
While our normalized load was down 1.9% for the quarter, this is largely attributable to the onetime Yuri weather event in February. If not for the disruptive impact of the storm on manufacturing in the supply chain, we believe our load growth would have been more robust. And other key sign posts continue to point towards a healthy recovery in 2021. Julie will be covering this in more detail later. 
We continue to make significant progress in diversifying our generation fleet. Last week, we proudly commissioned the first of our 3 projects that make up our $2 billion North Central wind investment. On April 14, the 199-megawatt Sundance Wind Energy Center came online on budget despite the challenges of COVID-19 and extreme weather. Commercial operation of the project means our PSO and SWEPCO Louisiana and Arkansas customers will start saving on their energy bills by taking advantage of this clean, low-cost wind resource. 
We continue to look forward to the Maverick and Travers projects coming online at the end of 2021 and early 2022, respectively. 
At EEI, we announced the retirement of several fossil plants, which, combined with previously announced retirements, results in 8,000 megawatts of planned retirements and expiring PPAs over the next 10 years. This drives the need for incremental capacity, economic energy and furthers the opportunity to continue to transform our fleet and invest in regulated renewables for the benefit of our customers. For each of our vertically integrated companies, we updated our resource plans and identified approximately 15,000 megawatts of wind and solar investment opportunity over the next 10 years in addition to our North Central wind investment. This amounts to 8,566 more megawatts than we mentioned last November at EEI. In fact, almost 10,000 megawatts are proposed during the 2021 to 2025 time period. 
By building on the success of North Central wind, we are focusing on pursuing regulated renewable investments for the benefit of our shareholders, customers and our communities. We look forward to continuing to work collaboratively with stakeholders as part of our integrated resource planning process, many of which will be filed during the fourth quarter of this year. And we'll be issuing requests for proposals for these resources in both the near and over the long term. 
These updated resource plans are consistent with our emission reduction goals that we announced in February and will put us on a path to achieve 80% reductions in carbon by 2030 and net-zero carbon by 2050. As we mentioned in our newly released climate report, we are committed to making the energy we provide as clean as possible, as fast as we can without compromising reliability, affordability or the security of the electric power grid. We will provide updates on our progress as we move to the execution stage of what we call our Future Forward strategy. By focusing on investments in support of clean, affordable and reliable energy, our customers and communities will be well positioned to adapt to the needs of a clean energy economy. 
Another important milestone that further enables our clean energy transition, I&M and its affiliate AEG reached an agreement to acquire the 1,300-megawatt Rockport Unit 2 from the lessors at the end of the lease in 2022. And PAUSE I&M has leased the unit and operated it since construction. If approved by the Indiana Commission, AEP's actions will provide a valuable short-term capacity bridge for the company, resolve pending litigation and bring certainty to the closure of both Rockport units by 2028. This agreement also provides further flexibility in advancing our clean energy transition more quickly if appropriate. 
Our rate case activity continues and it's robust, obviously, across all the jurisdictions. In Virginia, Appalachian Power received an order in its Virginia Triennial rate case reconsideration request on March 26. The commission did not change the initial holding. APCo is now focused on its appeal to the Supreme Court of Virginia and the errors in applying the statutes of the company believes the commission relied upon to reach its decision. 
In Ohio, a settlement was reached, showing the productive relationship AEP, Ohio has with various Ohio stakeholders. The settlement agreement balance the interest of the settling parties, including the commission staff, the Ohio Consumers Counsel, industrial, commercial and other entities like the Ohio Hospital Association. Testimony in support of the settlement was followed by the company, and the matter is set for a hearing focused on the settlement agreement on May 12. 
In our SWEPCO jurisdictions, we have rate cases pending in Louisiana and Texas and are preparing a filing in Arkansas. In Texas, we are seeking a net revenue increase of $73 million and an ROE of 10.35%. The filing included investments made from February 2018, accelerated depreciation for 3 coal plants, an increase in storm reserve and vegetation management. Intervening parties and staff filed testimony. Company rebuttal testimony is due April 23, and there's a May 19 hearing date. We expect to receive an order in this case by December. 
In Louisiana, the $93 million net revenue increase seeking a 10.35% ROE is before the commission awaiting a procedural schedule. In Arkansas, SWEPCO filed notice that it would not be filling the formula rate update because it would be filing a new base rate -- base case filing to update rates. This was expected as a result of North Central approval and will incorporate the facilities in base rates in Arkansas. A notice of intent to file a rate case was also filed in Oklahoma for PSO on March 16. The case will be filed by April 30. The filing is intended to address, among other things, general updates, the eroding ROE and a following requirement related to incorporating the North Central assets in base rates and minimizing the length of the right of recovering those costs. 
We also continue to engage the Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas commissions regarding the appropriate mechanisms for recovery of the approximately $1.2 billion of fuel expense that occurred with winter Storm Yuri. AEP continues to request WACC recovery to maintain balance sheet strength and capital structures of the operating companies. Julie will update the state of the alternatives being discussed. 
And an otherwise great story, I would be remiss if I did not express extreme disappointment with the FERC decision to consider the possible reduction or removal of the RTO 50 basis points adder for transmission investment. As evidenced by every reputable expert on what is necessary to achieve our net-zero goals, transmission is an integral part of the solution. Ensuring a reliable and resilient grid is foundational to support a clean energy economy. It's vital that federal policy continues to support transmission investments and particularly those that are made by companies who are participants in RTOs. Participation RTOs has resulted in ensuring the most efficient regional solutions are advanced. Participation should be encouraged and not discouraged. There is a cost of being in an RTO, and upsetting this cost benefit equation could change the dynamic of RTO participation. 
Under the Federal Power Act, FERC is required to provide incentives to each utility that joins an RTO. FERC's abrupt about-face on incentives will certainly lead to litigation, as is consistent with its previously well-established and correct approach that incentives should not expire until the utility leaves the RTO. 
On to our Achieving Excellence Program. Our Achieving Excellence Program, we continue to harness the ideas of our team members by focusing on operational efficiency gains. As a substantial part of our effort to bend the O&M curve, this specific program is set to deliver sustainable annual O&M savings that will continue to support our earnings growth expectations. I continue to be proud of the wealth of ideas that our team members bring to ensure that we are maximizing the value of services that we provide to our customers and our communities.
Lastly, regarding our efforts regarding portfolio management. We now will announce an ongoing strategic review of our Kentucky assets. We expect to complete this review during 2021. As we have mentioned before and as for all practical purposes, we are a fully regulated utility. We're now focused on portfolio optimization and capital allocation prioritization to address future capital needs with balance sheet expectations while improving shareholder value. So more to come in the future regarding this review. 
Now I'll move to the equalizer chart. Overall, our operations ROE is currently 9.1%. We generally targeted in the 9.5% to 10% range. The ROEs that we were discussing here are not weather-normalized. So keep in mind, we're also thickening equity layers over the last several years as well. So that reflects in the ROEs as well. 
So as -- moving to AEP, Ohio. The ROE for AEP Ohio at the end of first quarter 2021 was 10.3%, slightly above the authorized primarily due to timely recovery of capital investments. We expect the ROE to trend around authorized levels as we maintain concurrent capital recovery of distribution and transmission investments. 
Regarding APCo. The APCO at the end of first quarter was 8.6%. That's below authorized due to lower normalized usage, higher amortization primarily related to the retired coal-fired generation assets and higher depreciation from increased Virginia depreciation rates and capital investments, partially offset by continued management of O&M expenses. And keep in mind, the Virginia Triennial review is part of that process as well. 
Kentucky. The ROE for Kentucky at the end of first quarter was 4.8%. It's well below authorized due to loss of load from weak economic conditions and loss of major customers, along with higher expenses. Transmission revenues were also lower due to a delay of some capital projects. And I've already discussed in relation to Kentucky what we're doing there. 
I&M. The ROE of I&M at the end of the first quarter was 10.4%. It's above authorized due to continued discipline managing O&M expenses, reduced interest expenses and rate true-ups, partially offset by lower-than-expected retail sales during first quarter '21. 
Regarding PSO. PSO at the end of first quarter 2021 was 9.1%. It's slightly below its authorized level primarily due to increased capital investment, not currently in base rates, partially offset by continued management of O&M expenses. And I mentioned earlier, we are giving notification of filing a base rate case there. 
SWEPCO was below authorized at 9.1%. And due to loss of load and continued impact of the Arkansas share of the Turk plant, which we've said on several occasions is about 110 basis points and also partially offset by off-system sales in the first quarter '21 resulting from the severe winter storm event. 
AEP Texas at the end of the first quarter was 7.7%. It was below authorized primarily due to lag associated with the timing of annual cost recovery filings. Favorable regulatory treatment allows AEP Texas to file DCRF and TCOS filings to recover costs on capital investment. So while the expectation is for the ROE to trend towards an authorized ROE of 9.4% in the longer term, continued significant levels of investment in Texas will impact the ROE. 
And then the ROE for AEP Transmission Holdco at the end of the first quarter was 10.1%. AEP Transmission Holdco's ROE was slightly below authorized primarily driven by the annual revenue true-up in the second quarter of 2020 to return the over-collection of 2019 revenues. Transmission's forecasting this ROE to be in the mid-10% range in 2021. 
So I'll conclude by stealing a comment from one of my international CEO peers, who made the observation that we are in a magical moment for the electric industry given the move to a clean energy future through electrification. It has been a very busy quarter for AEP, but the work really starts now regarding the execution of a plan to transform this company from what was the largest coal-fired utility to one of the largest regulated renewable companies in the U.S., an amazing transition that will benefit customers with clean energy with a continued eye on reliability and affordability. Along with being the largest transmission supplier in the country that will also benefit from the resource transformation and the further emphasis being placed on infrastructure and electrification through transportation, AEP is well positioned to experience a truly magic moment in our history that will set the tone for our continued quest of remaining the premier regulated utility. 
Julie, I'll turn it over to you."

It's good to be with everyone this morning. I'm going to walk us through the financial results for the quarter, share some thoughts on our service territory load and economy and then finish with a review of our credit metrics and liquidity. 
So let's go to Slide 7, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter. GAAP earnings were $1.16 per share compared to $1 per share in 2020. There's a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on Page 15 of the presentation today. 
Let's walk through our quarterly operating earnings performance by segment. This is laid out on Slide 8. Operating earnings for the first quarter totaled $1.15 per share or $571 million compared to $1.02 per share or $504 million in 2020. 
Looking at the drivers by segment. Operating earnings for the Vertically Integrated Utilities were $0.54 per share, up $0.04, driven by the favorable impact of weather due to warmer-than-normal winter temps in 2020. Other favorable items in the segment included off-system sales, higher transmission revenue and the impact of rate changes across multiple jurisdictions. Partially offsetting these favorable items were higher depreciation, lower normalized retail load, higher O&M, a prior period fuel adjustment and higher other taxes. 
The Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.23 per share, down $0.01 from last year. Earnings in this segment declined primarily due to lower normalized retail load attributable in part to storm Yuri. 
Other smaller decreases included higher depreciation, tax and O&M expenses. Favorable drivers in this segment included transmission revenue, rate changes and weather. 
The AEP Transmission Holdco segment continued to grow contributing $0.35 per share, an improvement of $0.07 per share from last year. Net plant increased by $1.3 billion or 13% since March of last year. 
Generation & Marketing produced $0.06 per share, down $0.01 from last year. The favorable impact of the retirement of Oklaunion and land sales on the generation business offset the unfavorable ERCOT market prices on the wholesale business during Storm Yuri in February. The decrease in the Renewables business was driven by lower energy margins and higher expenses. 
Finally, Corporate and Other was up $0.04 per share driven by an investment gain and lower interest expense. Partially offsetting these items was the higher -- impact of higher taxes. Overall, we experienced a solid quarter, and we're confident in reaffirming our annual operating earnings guidance. 
So let's take a look at our normalized load for the quarter on Page 9. Starting on the lower-right corner. Our first quarter normalized load came in 1.9% below the first quarter of 2020. There are 2 important factors to consider when evaluating the year-over-year comparison for the quarter. The first factor is that last year included an extra leap year day. Assuming everything else equal, you would expect about a 1% decline in sales due to 1 less day in the quarter. And the second factor is that the pandemic started during the last 2 weeks of the 2020 first quarter. In other words, the first quarter analysis is comparing a pre-pandemic view of our service territory load to a view after COVID began. Importantly, we still expect a stronger recovery in the second half of this year as vaccinations increase, positioning more communities to relax restrictions on businesses without jeopardizing public health and as the benefit of the American Rescue Plan stimulus that was signed in late March works its way through the economy. I'll talk a little bit more about the latest economic projections when we get to Slide 11. 
So let's take a look at the upper-left quadrant. Our normalized residential sales increased by 1.5% in the first quarter compared to last year. The growth in the residential sales was spread across most operating companies. As the pandemic recovery progresses, growth in residential sales has begun to moderate. While we expect residential sales to decline by 1.1% in 2021, we're assuming a moderate sustained load benefit from this customer class, given the stickiness of work-from-home arrangements for many office workers across our service territory for the foreseeable future. 
So if you go over to the right, normalized commercial sales decreased by 1.6% in the first quarter. Even though commercial sales were down across every operating company excluding Ohio, we are seeing steady sequential improvement since the pandemic began. In fact,  AEP Ohio was the first operating company to post positive commercial sales growth. This correlates well with the fact that the AEP Ohio territory added the most jobs in the first quarter. 
We also continue to see significant improvement in the same sectors that were hardest hit by the shutdowns in the second quarter of 2020. These sectors include schools, churches, restaurants and hotels. 
So finally, if you look in the lower-left chart, you'll see that industrial sales decreased by 6.1% in the quarter compared to 2020. Industrial sales were down across every operating company and most industrial sectors. Not surprisingly, the biggest declines were located in the Western territory where Storm Yuri in February caused a significant yet temporary disruptions to many manufacturing facilities located in ERCOT and SPP. 
In addition to the numerous electric generators unable to run due to frozen natural gas supply lines, there are a number of other manufacturing processes that rely on natural gas supply to produce their product. Many of those businesses were unable to produce for up to a week while the pipelines were being thawed out. And in some cases, industrial loads were stalled as long as 42 days in Texas. 
So the key takeaway here is that the dip in industrial sales in the first quarter was largely due to the onetime winter storm, which does not impact our fundamental outlook. 
So here's an interesting data point that illustrates this. Our industrial sales in the eastern part of our service territory were down 2.6% as compared to the significant 12.8% drop in the western part of our service territory, which was impacted by Yuri. So obviously, that's a pretty dramatic difference. That being said, we're still very bullish about the second half of the year as the U.S. acquires a significantly greater concentration of immunity from vaccinations and as the full impact of the additional fiscal stimulus is felt throughout the service territory economy. 
So let's go over to Slide 10, where I can provide a little color on the industrial sales performance in the first quarter. The blue bars show the change in sales to our oil and gas customers. In aggregate, the sales to oil and gas sectors were down 9.6% in the first quarter, led by the 21% reduction in oil and gas extraction. Most of the decline in this sector is in response to the challenging market signals from last year when the drop in global demand, along with the temporary price war, caused oil prices to fall below many producers' break-even point. 
However, we do not expect the weakness in oil and gas to persist. In fact, natural gas prices in March were up about 60% from last year, and domestic oil prices last month have more than doubled since March of 2020. 
We fully expect the higher prices today will provide the necessary signal that producers are looking for to increase their production within the service territory. And once we see the production increase in the upstream sectors, it's only a matter of time before we see the corresponding increase in the midstream and downstream operations. 
The orange bars in the chart show the change in industrial sales excluding oil and gas. While it was still down 3.3% for the quarter, we expect to see stronger improvement in the second half of the year as the global economy recovers from the pandemic. Some of the weakness in manufacturing right now is related to supply chain disruptions. As efforts continue to strengthen the resiliency of the domestic supply chain for manufacturing, the AEP service territory is certainly positioned to benefit from any movement in that direction. 
So let's go over to Slide #11, where I can provide an update that I mentioned a few moments ago on the latest economic conditions within the AEP footprint. Starting in the lower-left chart -- or on the left chart. You'll see that AEP service territory experienced a 1.6% increase in gross regional product compared to the first quarter of 2020. This was much better than the U.S., which had a relatively flat first quarter in terms of year-over-year GDP growth. 
The AEP service territory was less impacted by the virus and had fewer restrictions on businesses than other parts of the country, which has allowed the regional economy to fare better than the U.S. throughout the pandemic. Looking forward, the AEP service territory is expected to grow by 5.2% in 2021, lagging the economic recovery in the U.S., as you might expect. 
Moving to employment on the right. You can see that the job market for the AEP service territory has also outperformed the U.S. throughout the pandemic. For the quarter, employment growth was only down 1.6%, which was 4.4% better than the U.S. during the first quarter. This is largely the result of the mix of jobs in our local economy, which has a heavier relative concentration of manufacturing and government jobs and a smaller share of leisure and hospitality jobs. Going forward, we expect job growth of 1.7% in 2021. 
So let's go over to Page 12 to check in on the company's capitalization and liquidity position. On a GAAP basis, our debt-to-capital ratio is 62.5%. When adjusted for the Storm Yuri event, the ratio remains consistent with our year-end 2020 ratio at 61.8%. 
Let's talk about our FFO-to-debt metric because, as you would expect and as we've been signaling, the impact of Storm Yuri has and will have a temporary and noticeable impact in 2021 on this metric. 
Taking a look at the upper-right quadrant on this page, you see our FFO-to-debt metric based on the traditional Moody's and GAAP-calculated basis as well as on an adjusted Moody's and GAAP-calculated basis. On a traditional unadjusted basis, our FFO-to-debt ratio decreased by 3.9% during the quarter to 9.1% on a Moody's basis. While this is a pretty dramatic impact, the rating agencies are very much aware of this and have taken the metric data point as well as the anticipated recovery into consideration as it relates to our credit rating. 
On an adjusted basis, the Moody's FFO-to-debt metric is 12.9%. To be very clear, this 12.9% figure removes or adjusts the calculation to eliminate the impact of approximately $1.2 billion of cash outflows associated with covering the unplanned Yuri-driven fuel and purchase power in the SPP region, directly impacting PSO and SWEPCO in particular. The metric is also adjusted to remove the effect of the associated debt we used to fund the unplanned payments. This should give you a sense of where we would be from a business-as-usual perspective, so 12.9% business-as-usual. 
As you know, we're in frequent in contact with the rating agencies to keep them apprised of all aspects of our business. And importantly, there is no change in our equity financing plan. 
On the topic of anticipated recovery, there's no debate that Storm Yuri was an extreme event. And consequently, the various states would like to resolve recovery dockets as expeditiously as practical. Assuming recovery begins this year, our cash flow metrics will quickly return to the low to mid-teens target range next year, as expected. So this should be a 1-year phenomenon for us. 
As many of you know, we have initiated regulatory cases in our respective states to evaluate the cost and determine the recovery plan. Let me provide a quick update where we are in this process. 
On February 24, PSO filed with the commission for recovery of fuel costs through a -- with a regulatory asset and weighted average cost of capital carrying charge and subsequently filed a motion seeking recovery of a $650 million regulatory asset with a 5-year amortization. At this point, PSO has received approval to defer the storm-related costs with recovery of the established regulatory asset over 5 years at an interim rate of PSO short-term financing cost us like 75 basis points. 
This is intended to be an interim order, and the actual carrying charge will be determined in a future review, and the regulatory asset amount is subject to finalization. Importantly, Oklahoma has also taken up a securitization bill to address the extraordinary fuel and purchase power costs felt by all utilities. PSO will evaluate if the securitization is appropriate for the recovery. And if so, we would expect it to occur as early as next year. 
In March, the Arkansas Public Service Commission issued an order authorizing recovery of the approximate $113 million Arkansas jurisdictional share of the retail customer fuel costs over 5 years, with the carrying charge to be determined at a later date and the actual amount to be recovered being subject to finalization. We requested a WACC rate, which was supported by the staff. In accordance with the order, SWEPCO began recovery in its jurisdiction in April. That was at a customer deposit rate of something like 80 basis points. The recovery period and associated carrying charge will be further reviewed and a hearing that's already been set for July 8 of this year, so 2021. 
In March, the Louisiana Public Service Commission approved a special order granting a temporary modification to the fuel adjustment clause to allow utilities to spread recovery over a longer period of time. In April, SWEPCO began recovery of the Louisiana jurisdictional share of these fuel costs. That was about $150 million based on a 5-year recovery period in a fuel over under recovery mechanism. SWEPCO will be working with the Louisiana Commission to finalize the actual recovery period and determine the appropriate carrying charge. 
And in Texas, SWEPCO intends to file for recovery under a fuel surcharge, most likely in the second quarter. Our current plan is to request recovery over 5 years with a WACC carrying charge. Obviously, we have a lot in process on the regulatory recovery front on this matter, and we'll keep you apprised as we make progress because, as we all know, this is extremely important. 
Let's take a quick moment to visit our liquidity summary on the lower right of Slide 12. In March -- on March 31, AEP renewed its $4 billion bank revolver for 5 years and also entered into a 2-year $1 billion revolving credit facility to fortify our liquidity position as we go forward. This placed our net liquidity position as of March 31 at a strong $3.4 billion. 
Switching gears. Our qualified pension funding increased 1.7% during the quarter to 103.5%, and our OPEB funding increased 9.6% to 170.5%. Rising interest rates that decreased plan liabilities, along with positive equity returns, were the primary drivers for the funded status increases in both plans during the first quarter. 
So let's go to Slide 13, so we can wrap this thing up and get your questions. But I just want to call out a couple of quick things before we do that. So top of mind for many folks, I know this, we want to mention to you that we've completed the planned $175 million equity funding portion of the North Central wind Sundance Project. We used our at-the-market mechanism so that we could time the equity need with our purchase of the Sundance Project, which occurred last week. As you know, we will continue to move forward with additional opportunities in the renewable space supporting our ESG focus as we transition toward a clean energy future. 
Our performance in the first quarter and stability of our regulated business model gives us the confidence to reaffirm our operating earnings guidance range of $4.55 per share to $4.75 per share. Because of our ability to continue to invest in our own system organically, we are confident in our ability to grow the company at our stated long-term growth rate of 5% to 7%. 
So we surely do appreciate your time and attention today. And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to the operator for your questions."

135470,711188339,2255292,"American Electric Power Company, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2021",2021-04-22,"Earnings Calls","American Electric Power Company, Inc.","Executives","Yes.

I think we have a -- the last part -- last to your question first. I think we have a pretty compelling argument now for ownership of these facilities given even past the winter storm activity that we learned operationally. Certainly, what we learned from the -- really the provisions of the agreements that we put in place relative to the approvals really stands better in terms of our ability to manage the project, manage congestion, manage other factors that really provide benefits to our customers. So we're going to make a strong position that we should own those assets. 
And actually, when you think about the strength of the utilities, it's going to be important for the states to really focus on how do we keep our utilities strong, and PPAs don't do it from a capital structure perspective. We need to make sure that ownership and their flexibility of operations is key in that regard. 
And regarding the other 8,600 megawatts, yes, it is a sizable number. But obviously, when you look at the evaluation of the retirements, when you look at the needs of the operating companies -- and also North Central certainly showed you can deploy capital and reduce the overall bills to consumers. So when you think about the retirements of coal-fired generation, the imposition of additional transmission, having the benefits of the fuel cost aspects of it are tremendously important. 
So when you look at the analysis, having some level of carbon pricing in there certainly increases the focus on the ability for renewables to come into play. And that's certainly what we've been focusing on. 
So as you look at the financeability of it, the financeability will pretty much work like it did for North Central. Although it is a large number, so we'll have to be very aware of what our balance sheet strength looks like during the process, the timing of when the different tranches of these renewables come into play, the cash position that supported with these projects coming online. And being able to improve, as Julie mentioned, this FFO-to-debt thing, where it is today is really a 2021 issue. In 2022, FFO-to-debt comes back up. And certainly, with the ability to put these projects in place, it will help in terms of our ability to continue to fund these projects. 
So it'll probably -- we certainly would like for it all to be incremental. But in reality, when you go through this process, it'll probably be around capital allocation and prioritization associated with that within the existing plan but also incremental. So it'd be a combination of both. 
Yet to be seen. Obviously, if load continues to grow, if the position relative to the regulatory framework, getting concurrent recovery, making sure that we get off the tax ADIT issues, that's all going to be helpful in terms of our ability to finance. So it's still a work-in-progress."

So obviously, we're right out of the gate in terms of the announcement of what's included in each jurisdiction. So we'll have discussions with the commissions, and that's part of the integrated resource planning processes. And keep in mind, too, when we do this evaluation during the RFP -- I mean they're in the process. It's always solving for whatever the lease cost is in terms of what those resources are. So it shows up as wind. And then solar, typically, it's showing up as more wind early on then solar starts to pick up. But that's pretty fungible as you go forward. I mean these plans will change as we go forward based upon where technologies go, certainly, where the opportunities exist. 
Now Oklahoma may want more wind and less solar, but that won't matter. It'll be a part of the the total renewables piece that's included there. 
The other part of it, too, is we'll be very mindful of how much renewables are placed into service in relation to 24/7 supply. And there's some natural gas that's built into this plan as well that enables more renewables to be put in place. But the real focus going forward during this transitional period will be for units that provide 24/7 to be more of a reliability component, certainly more of a -- sort of an insurance backstop for weather events or other events that may occur that impact the grid security. And we'll have to be very mindful of how those studies actually go. 
And I'll tell you, in our climate report, we saw for 2050 with a $15 carbon price and a more aggressive $30 carbon price. The 2035 case didn't solve because of the timing of getting resources in place and system-related issues. So you have to really think about how that's done. 
And I'm -- we've looked at these plans, and we certainly believe that with the level of 24/7 supply we still have out there and the additional opportunity associated with just the diversity of some of these projects, it's going to be of particular value to our customers going forward. 
And I guess, I'll just remind you that North Central, had it been operational during this time of the Texas and Oklahoma outages with the Yuri would have saved customers $227 million. So you think about the savings associated with that. 
And the other thing, too, the previous question, someone was -- Shar was asking, when the utilities do it, they focus on the long term. And North Central already had the weather packages already in place, where you don't find that in a large part of the market. So we think the long term when we go after these investments, and that's why ownership is clearly important."

We don't know what that number is at this point. And I think we've got to get through the process and fully understand that. 
But when you do the net benefits associated with fuel and the capital cost of the renewables projects and transmission, it's still a benefit to consumers. So we'll go through that process. 
But you're right to be bullish about transmission in relation to these investments, but also everyone else's investments because we are the largest transmission provider in the country, and most of this has to come through us."

And so we are -- and actually, we're looking for provisions like that even in legislation that's occurring. Because you're seeing all kinds of incentives developed for extension of PTCs, ITCs. Direct pay, we like, so direct pay not only for renewables projects, but also for transmission if you have an ITC. 
But I think also, we'd like to see incentives for the undepreciated plant balances of coal units to further accelerate the ability to retire and obviate the impact to our customers. But the current plan doesn't assume any of these advancements. So -- and this happens all the time where we have plans that are out there that are public, but a lot of things get worked on. And we'll continue to work on these objectives because our objective is to move as quickly as possible to derisk these investments, and particularly with new environmental rules, with CCR and other things. We're making decisions about these plants. And you've seen the last 2 quarters, we've announced earlier retirements of coal and lignite plant operations.

And as it relates to what's embedded in our guidance, I will tell you, we actually updated our cash flow forecast. That's included in the slide deck that you have today to incorporate the impact of this particular circumstance as well as the fact that we did have some ice storms and more -- I characterize more kind of normal storm-related activities that occurred in the eastern portion of our jurisdictions here during the first quarter. 
So all of that is factored into those new cash flow forecast details, which you'll see impacting the cash flow from operations line in the slide included in the deck today. 
As you know, we did take on some additional debt to be able to accommodate the fuel and purchase power spike that was not anticipated. And so that is now being absorbed into our 2021 operations, and therefore, into our earnings. 
Interestingly, if you look at Page #8 of the slide deck that we have out there today, on the Corporate and Other segment, you'll actually see that interest expense was a benefit to us this time despite the fact that we have taken on a little additional debt in that capacity because we took a $500 million term loan on at the parent company. Interest rates have -- in terms of interest cost, I should say, was much lower in this particular quarter versus last year. We do still have lower debt outstanding from a short-term perspective versus last year. So all of those factors interestingly helped to have this impact be one of benefit to us in this particular period.

And really, it is directly opposite to years of precedence of encouraging the development of transmission. 
So I'm certainly hopeful as we get through the dialogue of what this all means. And actually, with RTO participation -- when we originally joined RTO years ago, we were making a lot of money off of through and out rates of transmission. We traded that in for generation benefits because we were selling a lot of generation. We're not selling generation, so -- to any real extent. And certainly, when you look at the value proposition of an RTO, it is centered on the ability to optimize across a larger jurisdiction. But from an AEP perspective, you got the cost of the RTO. And certainly, customers need to be able to benefit from that. 
So if you disrupt that cost-benefit opportunity, you will have people making different decisions about RTO participation. So I think it's just sort of a policy move in the wrong direction, but I certainly am hopeful that the commission comes together on that."

And keep in mind, we're thinking about the resiliency and reliability of the grid, too. So there's limitations, and we have to go through that process. But the ones we have in this plan, we can do. 
And certainly, when you look at the benefits of North Central, for example, it was $3 billion of benefit to the customers. And so when you have those kinds of economics in play, if you're able to run your 24/7 generation as more of reliability and as an insurance policy essentially and layer in as much renewables as you can, put in transmission to make sure the system continues to operate the way it should, then it could be pretty powerful combination to benefit customers in the future."

So obviously, we were looking at future requirements instead of environmental requirements on the units. And if we kept them operating longer than 2028, that would be a challenge from an economic perspective. We didn't want to start making those kinds of investments not knowing how long the unit would actually be operational. So that was a consideration. 
The other, as I mentioned, was litigation to clear all that out to make sure we took ownership and we took control. And then, of course, the value of the short-term bridge that exists that gives us the flexibility to make decisions with the Indiana Commission to focus on what is the right path for that transition. So it gives us a lot of optionality, a lot of flexibility and the control. 
And by the way, I mean, there's 2 units there: so 1 we own, 1 we leased. And it just made more sense for us to own both of them and make the decision of the plant as a whole and be able to adjust accordingly. So it worked out well overall from that perspective. And like I said, it gives us a lot of optionality and flexibility. 
And actually, at a pretty -- at a price that -- I think it was $115 million. So it's an opportunity for us to really pay for that degree of optionality that has considerable value."

Chuck gets allocated capital -- or the AEP energy gets allocated capital. And he's perfectly willing to throw it back over the fence because we make evaluations based upon his threshold, which is commensurate with the regulated part. 
And also just -- his business is important because it keeps us in a part of -- like, for example, we're doing a lot of projects here in Ohio directly with customers. And it enables us to -- with customers and corporations actually, and enables us to be in that business. But at the same time, we're able to manage the capital such that you can throw it back over the fence if we see a better opportunity on the regulated side. So we have that working very well, where we can make those trade-offs on a continual basis. 
So yes, it can be a source of capital to do some of these things. And again, that lends itself to the portfolio management approach to ensure that we're putting the money in the right place at the right time. 
So -- and like I said, he's doing an incredible job with that and that organization. And the fact is, they're still doing the renewable part of it, but they're also doing specific relationships with customers with microgrids and those types of applications. So the value proposition of that business is so important to us seeing the leading edge of what we need to be doing and making cases in our regulated business to ensure that we continue to grow from those perspectives as well. 
So all in all, it's working fine. But yes, your -- the answer is yes, we can utilize that as a source."

Before I get started with our results for the quarter, I just have to say I was struck with the public relation -- public reactions to the Chauvin verdict, has been a long wait, but justice and faith in our legal system does prevail. I bring this up because it happens. I had chosen a song, which I do every quarter, as you know, for a different reason, but now it serves 2 purposes. One of the most mesmerizing singers I ever heard was the late Marvin Gaye. I thought of a song when actually thinking about our quarter and the multitude of activities that AEP continues to accomplish and was thinking of what's going on, the Marvin Gaye hit from 1971, written during another tumultuous time in America. This song was a plea for peace, justice and understanding perspectives to move forward in a positive way together.  
As I said, this song was released in 1971, 50 years ago, but it could not be more appropriate today. We need our leaders, our communities and, indeed, our companies to continue to come together and stop the divisiveness, which the new cycle tends to feed off of and recognize that we have a lot more in common than our differences. That would be a great start to advancing this nation in a positive way.  
That being said, getting to my original purpose, as I said earlier, what's going on with AEP, as the lyric say, ""Hey, man, what's happening? Everything is everything."" We're going to do a get down today, boy, I'll tell you. So here we go. 
The first quarter of 2021 came in with operating earnings of $1.15 per share versus $1.02 for first quarter '20, which met our expectations, particularly given winter storm Yuri's impact in Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, which we reported on in the last quarter's earnings call. AEP continues to reaffirm our 2021 guidance range of $4.55 to $4.75 per share and our 5% to 7% long-term growth rate. And we would still be disappointed not to be in the upper half of the guidance range.  
It's hard to believe it's been over a year since we entered into the pandemic. I continue to be impressed by the resiliency of our employees, their dedication and commitment to our customers and communities. We continue to practice social distancing, are encouraging vaccinations and looking forward to putting COVID in the rearview mirror.  
As we look towards the future, we are seeing our communities starting to rebound from the shadow of the pandemic. Job growth and electric consumption show continued improvement, supporting our view that the economy within our service territory will continue to rebound.  
While our normalized load was down 1.9% for the quarter, this is largely attributable to the onetime Yuri weather event in February. If not for the disruptive impact of the storm on manufacturing and the supply chain, we believe our load growth would have been more robust. And other key sign posts continue to point towards a healthy recovery in 2021. Julie will be covering this in more detail later.  
We continue to make significant progress in diversifying our generation fleet. Last week, we proudly commissioned the first of our 3 projects that make up our $2 billion North Central wind investment. On April 14, the 199-megawatt Sundance Wind Energy Center came online on budget despite the challenges of COVID-19 and extreme weather. Commercial operation of the project means our PSO and SWEPCO Louisiana and Arkansas customers will start saving on their energy bills by taking advantage of this clean, low-cost wind resource.  
We continue to look forward to the Maverick and Travers projects coming online at the end of 2021 and early 2022, respectively.  
At EEI, we announced the retirement of several fossil plants, which, combined with previously announced retirements, results in 8,000 megawatts of planned retirements and expiring PPAs over the next 10 years. This drives the need for incremental capacity, economic energy and furthers the opportunity to continue to transform our fleet and invest in regulated renewables for the benefit of our customers. For each of our vertically integrated companies, we updated our resource plans and identified approximately 15,000 megawatts of wind and solar investment opportunity over the next 10 years in addition to our North Central wind investment. This amounts to 8,566 more megawatts than we mentioned last November at EEI. In fact, almost 10,000 megawatts are proposed during the 2021 to 2025 time period.  
By building on the success of North Central wind, we are focusing on pursuing regulated renewable investments for the benefit of our shareholders, customers and our communities. We look forward to continuing to work collaboratively with stakeholders as part of our integrated resource planning process, many of which will be filed during the fourth quarter of this year. And we'll be issuing requests for proposals for these resources in both the near and over the long term.  
These updated resource plans are consistent with our emission reduction goals that we announced in February and will put us on a path to achieve 80% reductions in carbon by 2030 and net-zero carbon by 2050. As we mentioned in our newly released climate report, we are committed to making the energy we provide as clean as possible, as fast as we can without compromising reliability, affordability or the security of the electric power grid. We will provide updates on our progress as we move to the execution stage of what we call our Future Forward strategy. By focusing on investments in support of clean, affordable and reliable energy, our customers and communities will be well positioned to adapt to the needs of a clean energy economy.  
Another important milestone that further enables our clean energy transition, I&M and its affiliate AEG reached an agreement to acquire the 1,300-megawatt Rockport Unit 2 from the lessors at the end of the lease in 2022. I&M has leased the unit and operated it since construction. If approved by the Indiana Commission, AEP's actions will provide a valuable short-term capacity bridge for the company, resolve pending litigation and bring certainty to the closure of both Rockport units by 2028. This agreement also provides further flexibility in advancing our clean energy transition more quickly if appropriate.  
Our rate case activity continues, and it's robust, obviously, across all the jurisdictions. In Virginia, Appalachian Power received an order in its Virginia Triennial rate case reconsideration request on March 26. The commission did not change the initial holding. APCo is now focused on its appeal to the Supreme Court of Virginia, and the errors in applying the statutes the company believes the commission relied upon to reach its decision.  
In Ohio, a settlement was reached, showing the productive relationship AEP, Ohio has with various Ohio stakeholders. The settlement agreement balance the interest of the settling parties, including the commission staff, the Ohio Consumers Counsel, industrial, commercial and other entities like the Ohio Hospital Association. Testimony in support of the settlement was followed by the company, and the matter is set for a hearing focused on the settlement agreement on May 12.  
In our SWEPCO jurisdictions, we have rate cases pending in Louisiana and Texas and are preparing a filing in Arkansas. In Texas, we are seeking a net revenue increase of $73 million and an ROE of 10.35%. The filing included investments made from February 2018, accelerated depreciation for 3 coal plants, an increase in storm reserve and vegetation management. Intervening parties and staff filed testimony. Company rebuttal testimony is due April 23, and there's a May 19 hearing date. We expect to receive an order in this case by December.  
In Louisiana, the $93 million net revenue increase seeking a 10.35% ROE is before the commission awaiting a procedural schedule. In Arkansas, SWEPCO filed notice that it would not be filling the formula rate update because it would be filing a new base rate -- base case filing to update rates. This was expected as a result of North Central approval and will incorporate the facilities in base rates in Arkansas. A notice of intent to file a rate case was also filed in Oklahoma for PSO on March 16. The case will be filed by April 30. The filing is intended to address, among other things, general updates, the eroding ROE and a following requirement related to incorporating the North Central assets in base rates and minimizing the length of the right of recovering those costs.  
We also continue to engage the Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas commissions regarding the appropriate mechanisms for recovery of the approximately $1.2 billion of fuel expense that occurred with winter Storm Yuri. AEP continues to request WACC recovery to maintain balance sheet strength and capital structures of the operating companies. Julie will update the state of the alternatives being discussed.  
And an otherwise great story, I would be remiss if I did not express extreme disappointment with the FERC decision to consider the possible reduction or removal of the RTO 50 basis points adder for transmission investment. As evidenced by every reputable expert on what is necessary to achieve our net-zero goals, transmission is an integral part of the solution. Ensuring a reliable and resilient grid is foundational to support a clean energy economy. It's vital that federal policy continues to support transmission investments and particularly those that are made by companies who are participants in RTOs. Participation RTOs has resulted in ensuring the most efficient regional solutions are advanced. Participation should be encouraged and not discouraged. There is a cost of being in an RTO. And upsetting this cost benefit equation could change the dynamic of RTO participation.  
Under the Federal Power Act, FERC is required to provide incentives to each utility that joins an RTO. FERC's abrupt about-face on incentives will certainly lead to litigation, as is consistent with its previously well-established and correct approach that incentives should not expire until the utility leaves the RTO.  
On to our Achieving Excellence Program. Our Achieving Excellence Program, we continue to harness the ideas of our team members by focusing on operational efficiency gains. As a substantial part of our effort to bend the O&M curve, this specific program is set to deliver sustainable annual O&M savings that will continue to support our earnings growth expectations. I continue to be proud of the wealth of ideas that our team members bring to ensure that we are maximizing the value of services that we provide to our customers and our communities. 
Lastly, regarding our efforts regarding portfolio management, we now will announce an ongoing strategic review of our Kentucky assets. We expect to complete this review during 2021. As we have mentioned before and as for all practical purposes, we are a fully regulated utility. We're now focused on portfolio optimization and capital allocation prioritization to address future capital needs with balance sheet expectations while improving shareholder value. So more to come in the future regarding this review.  
Now I'll move to the equalizer chart. Overall, our operations ROE is currently 9.1%. We generally targeted in the 9.5% to 10% range. There were ROEs that we were discussing here are not weather-normalized. So keep in mind, we're also thickening equity layers over the last several years as well. So that reflects in the ROEs as well.  
So as -- moving to AEP, Ohio. The ROE for AEP Ohio at the end of first quarter 2021 was 10.3%, slightly above the authorized primarily due to timely recovery of capital investments. We expect the ROE to trend around authorized levels as we maintain concurrent capital recovery of distribution and transmission investments.  
Regarding APCo. The APCO at the end of first quarter was 8.6%. That's below authorized due to lower normalized usage, higher amortization primarily related to the retired coal-fired generation assets and higher depreciation from increased Virginia depreciation rates and capital investments, partially offset by continued management of O&M expenses. And keep in mind, the Virginia Triennial review is part of that process as well.  
Kentucky. The ROE for Kentucky at the end of first quarter was 4.8%. It's well below authorized due to loss of load from weak economic conditions and loss of major customers, along with higher expenses. Transmission revenues were also lower due to a delay of some capital projects. And I've already discussed in relation to Kentucky what we're doing there.  
I&M. The ROE of I&M at the end of the first quarter was 10.4%. It's above authorized due to continued discipline managing O&M expenses, reduced interest expenses and rate true-ups, partially offset by lower-than-expected retail sales during first quarter '21.  
Regarding PSO. PSO at the end of first quarter 2021 was 9.1%. It's slightly below its authorized level primarily due to increased capital investment, not currently in base rates, partially offset by continued management of O&M expenses. And I mentioned earlier, we are giving notification of filing a base rate case there.  
SWEPCO was below authorized at 9.1%. And due to loss of load and continued impact of the Arkansas share of the Turk plant, which we've said on several occasions is about 110 basis points and also partially offset by off-system sales in the first quarter '21 resulting from the severe winter storm event.  
AEP Texas at the end of the first quarter was 7.7%. It was below authorized primarily due to lag associated with the timing of annual cost recovery filings. Favorable regulatory treatment allows AEP Texas to file DCRF and TCOS filings to recover costs on capital investment. So while the expectation is for the ROE to trend towards an authorized ROE of 9.4% in the longer term, continued significant levels of investment in Texas will impact the ROE.  
And then the ROE for AEP Transmission Holdco at the end of the first quarter was 10.1%. AEP Transmission Holdco's ROE was slightly below authorized primarily driven by the annual revenue true-up in the second quarter of 2020 to return the over-collection of 2019 revenues. Transmission's forecasting this ROE to be in the mid-10% range in 2021.  
So I'll conclude by stealing a comment from one of my international CEO peers, who made the observation that we are in a magical moment for the electric industry given the move to a clean energy future through electrification. It has been a very busy quarter for AEP, but the work really starts now regarding the execution of a plan to transform this company from what was the largest coal-fired utility to one of the largest regulated renewable companies in the U.S., an amazing transition that will benefit customers with clean energy with a continued eye on reliability and affordability, along with being the largest transmission supplier in the country that will also benefit from the resource transformation and the further emphasis being placed on infrastructure and electrification through transportation, AEP is well positioned to experience a truly magic moment in our history that will set the tone for our continued quest of remaining the premier regulated utility.  
Julie, I'll turn it over to you."

It's good to be with everyone this morning. I'm going to walk us through the financial results for the quarter, share some thoughts on our service territory load and economy and then finish with a review of our credit metrics and liquidity. 
So let's go to Slide 7, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter. GAAP earnings were $1.16 per share compared to $1 per share in 2020. There's a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on Page 15 of the presentation today. 
Let's walk through our quarterly operating earnings performance by segment. This is laid out on Slide 8. Operating earnings for the first quarter totaled $1.15 per share or $571 million compared to $1.02 per share or $504 million in 2020. 
Looking at the drivers by segment. Operating earnings for the Vertically Integrated Utilities were $0.54 per share, up $0.04, driven by the favorable impact of weather due to warmer-than-normal winter temps in 2020. Other favorable items in the segment included off-system sales, higher transmission revenue and the impact of rate changes across multiple jurisdictions. Partially offsetting these favorable items were higher depreciation, lower normalized retail load, higher O&M, a prior period fuel adjustment and higher other taxes. 
The Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.23 per share, down $0.01 from last year. Earnings in this segment declined primarily due to lower normalized retail load attributable in part to storm Yuri. 
Other smaller decreases included higher depreciation, tax and O&M expenses. Favorable drivers in this segment included transmission revenue, rate changes and weather. 
The AEP Transmission Holdco segment continued to grow contributing $0.35 per share, an improvement of $0.07 per share from last year. Net plant increased by $1.3 billion or 13% since March of last year. 
Generation & Marketing produced $0.06 per share, down $0.01 from last year. The favorable impact of the retirement of Oklaunion and land sales on the generation business offset the unfavorable ERCOT market prices on the wholesale business during Storm Yuri in February. The decrease in the Renewables business was driven by lower energy margins and higher expenses. 
Finally, Corporate and Other was up $0.04 per share driven by an investment gain and lower interest expense. Partially offsetting these items was the higher -- impact of higher taxes. Overall, we experienced a solid quarter, and we're confident in reaffirming our annual operating earnings guidance. 
So let's take a look at our normalized load for the quarter on Page 9. Starting on the lower-right corner, our first quarter normalized load came in 1.9% below the first quarter of 2020. There are 2 important factors to consider when evaluating the year-over-year comparison for the quarter. The first factor is that last year included an extra leap year day. Assuming everything else equal, you would expect about a 1% decline in sales due to 1 less day in the quarter. And the second factor is that the pandemic started during the last 2 weeks of the 2020 first quarter. In other words, the first quarter analysis is comparing a pre-pandemic view of our service territory load to a view after COVID began. Importantly, we still expect a stronger recovery in the second half of this year as vaccinations increase, positioning more communities to relax restrictions on businesses without jeopardizing public health and as the benefit of the American Rescue Plan stimulus that was signed in late March works its way through the economy. I'll talk a little bit more about the latest economic projections when we get to Slide 11. 
So let's take a look at the upper-left quadrant. Our normalized residential sales increased by 1.5% in the first quarter compared to last year. The growth in the residential sales was spread across most operating companies. As the pandemic recovery progresses, growth in residential sales has begun to moderate. While we expect residential sales to decline by 1.1% in 2021, we're assuming a moderate sustained load benefit from this customer class, given the stickiness of work-from-home arrangements for many office workers across our service territory for the foreseeable future. 
So if you go over to the right, normalized commercial sales decreased by 1.6% in the first quarter. Even though commercial sales were down across every operating company excluding Ohio, we are seeing steady sequential improvement since the pandemic began. In fact,  AEP Ohio was the first operating company to post positive commercial sales growth. This correlates well with the fact that the AEP Ohio territory added the most jobs in the first quarter. 
We also continue to see significant improvement in the same sectors that were hardest hit by the shutdowns in the second quarter of 2020. These sectors include schools, churches, restaurants and hotels. 
So finally, if you look in the lower-left chart, you'll see that industrial sales decreased by 6.1% in the quarter compared to 2020. Industrial sales were down across every operating company and most industrial sectors. Not surprisingly, the biggest declines were located in the Western territory where Storm Yuri in February caused a significant yet temporary disruptions to many manufacturing facilities located in ERCOT and SPP. 
In addition to the numerous electric generators unable to run due to frozen natural gas supply lines, there are a number of other manufacturing processes that rely on natural gas supply to produce their product. Many of those businesses were unable to produce for up to a week while the pipelines were being thawed out. And in some cases, industrial loads were stalled as long as 42 days in Texas. 
So the key takeaway here is that the dip in industrial sales in the first quarter was largely due to the onetime winter storm, which does not impact our fundamental outlook. 
So here's an interesting data point that illustrates this. Our industrial sales in the eastern part of our service territory were down 2.6% as compared to the significant 12.8% drop in the western part of our service territory, which was impacted by Yuri. So obviously, that's a pretty dramatic difference. That being said, we're still very bullish about the second half of the year as the U.S. acquires a significantly greater concentration of immunity from vaccinations and as the full impact of the additional fiscal stimulus is felt throughout the service territory economy. 
So let's go over to Slide 10, where I can provide a little color on the industrial sales performance in the first quarter. The blue bars show the change in sales to our oil and gas customers. In aggregate, the sales to oil and gas sectors were down 9.6% in the first quarter, led by the 21% reduction in oil and gas extraction. Most of the decline in this sector is in response to the challenging market signals from last year when the drop in global demand, along with the temporary price war, caused oil prices to fall below many producers' break-even point. 
However, we do not expect the weakness in oil and gas to persist. In fact, natural gas prices in March were up about 60% from last year, and domestic oil prices last month have more than doubled since March of 2020. 
We fully expect the higher prices today will provide the necessary signal that producers are looking for to increase their production within the service territory. And once we see the production increase in the upstream sectors, it's only a matter of time before we see the corresponding increase in the midstream and downstream operations. 
The orange bars in the chart show the change in industrial sales excluding oil and gas. While it was still down 3.3% for the quarter, we expect to see stronger improvement in the second half of the year as the global economy recovers from the pandemic. Some of the weakness in manufacturing right now is related to supply chain disruptions. As efforts continue to strengthen the resiliency of the domestic supply chain for manufacturing, the AEP service territory is certainly positioned to benefit from any movement in that direction. 
So let's go over to Slide #11, where I can provide an update that I mentioned a few moments ago on the latest economic conditions within the AEP footprint. Starting in the lower-left chart -- or on the left chart, you'll see that AEP service territory experienced a 1.6% increase in gross regional product compared to the first quarter of 2020. This was much better than the U.S., which had a relatively flat first quarter in terms of year-over-year GDP growth. 
The AEP service territory was less impacted by the virus and had fewer restrictions on businesses than other parts of the country, which has allowed the regional economy to fare better than the U.S. throughout the pandemic. Looking forward, the AEP service territory is expected to grow by 5.2% in 2021, lagging the economic recovery in the U.S., as you might expect. 
Moving to employment on the right. You can see that the job market for the AEP service territory has also outperformed the U.S. throughout the pandemic. For the quarter, employment growth was only down 1.6%, which was 4.4% better than the U.S. during the first quarter. This is largely the result of the mix of jobs in our local economy, which has a heavier relative concentration of manufacturing and government jobs and a smaller share of leisure and hospitality jobs. Going forward, we expect job growth of 1.7% in 2021. 
So let's go over to Page 12 to check in on the company's capitalization and liquidity position. On a GAAP basis, our debt-to-capital ratio is 62.5%. When adjusted for the Storm Yuri event, the ratio remains consistent with our year-end 2020 ratio at 61.8%. 
Let's talk about our FFO-to-debt metric because, as you would expect and as we've been signaling, the impact of Storm Yuri has and will have a temporary and noticeable impact in 2021 on this metric. 
Taking a look at the upper-right quadrant on this page, you see our FFO-to-debt metric based on the traditional Moody's and GAAP-calculated basis as well as on an adjusted Moody's and GAAP-calculated basis. On a traditional unadjusted basis, our FFO-to-debt ratio decreased by 3.9% during the quarter to 9.1% on a Moody's basis. While this is a pretty dramatic impact, the rating agencies are very much aware of this and have taken the metric data point as well as the anticipated recovery into consideration as it relates to our credit rating. 
On an adjusted basis, the Moody's FFO-to-debt metric is 12.9%. To be very clear, this 12.9% figure removes or adjusts the calculation to eliminate the impact of approximately $1.2 billion of cash outflows associated with covering the unplanned Yuri-driven fuel and purchase power in the SPP region, directly impacting PSO and SWEPCO in particular. The metric is also adjusted to remove the effect of the associated debt we used to fund the unplanned payments. This should give you a sense of where we would be from a business-as-usual perspective, so 12.9% business-as-usual. 
As you know, we're in frequent contact with the rating agencies to keep them apprised of all aspects of our business. And importantly, there is no change in our equity financing plan. 
On the topic of anticipated recovery, there's no debate that Storm Yuri was an extreme event. And consequently, the various states would like to resolve recovery dockets as expeditiously as practical. Assuming recovery begins this year, our cash flow metrics will quickly return to the low to mid-teens target range next year, as expected. So this should be a 1-year phenomenon for us. 
As many of you know, we have initiated regulatory cases in our respective states to evaluate the cost and determine the recovery plan. Let me provide a quick update where we are in this process. 
On February 24, PSO filed with the commission for recovery of fuel costs through a -- with a regulatory asset and weighted average cost of capital carrying charge and subsequently filed a motion seeking recovery of a $650 million regulatory asset with a 5-year amortization. At this point, PSO has received approval to defer the storm-related costs with recovery of the established regulatory asset over 5 years at an interim rate of PSO short-term financing cost. That's like 75 basis points. 
This is intended to be an interim order, and the actual carrying charge will be determined in a future review, and the regulatory asset amount is subject to finalization. Importantly, Oklahoma has also taken up a securitization bill to address the extraordinary fuel and purchase power costs felt by all utilities. PSO will evaluate if the securitization is appropriate for the recovery. And if so, we would expect it to occur as early as next year. 
In March, the Arkansas Public Service Commission issued an order authorizing recovery of the approximate $113 million Arkansas jurisdictional share of the retail customer fuel costs over 5 years, with the carrying charge to be determined at a later date and the actual amount to be recovered being subject to finalization. We requested a WACC rate, which was supported by the staff. In accordance with the order, SWEPCO began recovery in its jurisdiction in April. That was at a customer deposit rate of something like 80 basis points. The recovery period and associated carrying charge will be further reviewed and a hearing that's already been set for July 8 of this year, so 2021. 
In March, the Louisiana Public Service Commission approved a special order granting a temporary modification to the fuel adjustment clause to allow utilities to spread recovery over a longer period of time. In April, SWEPCO began recovery of the Louisiana jurisdictional share of these fuel costs. That was about $150 million based on a 5-year recovery period in a fuel over under recovery mechanism. SWEPCO will be working with the Louisiana Commission to finalize the actual recovery period and determine the appropriate carrying charge. 
And in Texas, SWEPCO intends to file for a recovery under a fuel surcharge, most likely in the second quarter. Our current plan is to request recovery over 5 years with a WACC carrying charge. Obviously, we have a lot in process on the regulatory recovery front on this matter, and we'll keep you apprised as we make progress because, as we all know, this is extremely important. 
Let's take a quick moment to visit our liquidity summary on the lower right of Slide 12. In March -- on March 31, AEP renewed its $4 billion bank revolver for 5 years and also entered into a 2-year $1 billion revolving credit facility to fortify our liquidity position as we go forward. This placed our net liquidity position as of March 31 at a strong $3.4 billion. 
Switching gears. Our qualified pension funding increased 1.7% during the quarter to 103.5%, and our OPEB funding increased 9.6% to 170.5%. Rising interest rates that decreased plan liabilities, along with positive equity returns, were the primary drivers for the funded status increases in both plans during the first quarter. 
So let's go to Slide 13, so we can wrap this thing up and get your questions. But I just want to call out a couple of quick things before we do that. So top of mind for many folks, I know this, we want to mention to you that we've completed the planned $175 million equity funding portion of the North Central wind Sundance Project. We used our at-the-market mechanism so that we could time the equity need with our purchase of the Sundance Project, which occurred last week. As you know, we will continue to move forward with additional opportunities in the renewable space supporting our ESG focus as we transition toward a clean energy future. 
Our performance in the first quarter and stability of our regulated business model gives us the confidence to reaffirm our operating earnings guidance range of $4.55 per share to $4.75 per share. Because of our ability to continue to invest in our own system organically, we are confident in our ability to grow the company at our stated long-term growth rate of 5% to 7%. 
So we surely do appreciate your time and attention today. And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to the operator for your questions."

135470,711188339,2255628,"American Electric Power Company, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2021",2021-04-22,"Earnings Calls","American Electric Power Company, Inc.","Executives","Yes.

I think we have a -- the last part -- last to your question first. I think we have a pretty compelling argument now for ownership of these facilities given even past the winter storm activity that we learned operationally. Certainly, what we learned from the -- really the provisions of the agreements that we put in place relative to the approvals really stands better in terms of our ability to manage the project, manage congestion, manage other factors that really provide benefits to our customers. So we're going to make a strong position that we should own those assets. 
And actually, when you think about the strength of the utilities, it's going to be important for the states to really focus on how do we keep our utilities strong, and PPAs don't do it from a capital structure perspective. We need to make sure that ownership and their flexibility of operations is key in that regard. 
And regarding the other 8,600 megawatts, yes, it is a sizable number. But obviously, when you look at the evaluation of the retirements, when you look at the needs of the operating companies -- and also North Central certainly showed you can deploy capital and reduce the overall bills to consumers. So when you think about the retirements of coal-fired generation, the imposition of additional transmission, having the benefits of the fuel cost aspects of it are tremendously important. 
So when you look at the analysis, having some level of carbon pricing in there certainly increases the focus on the ability for renewables to come into play. And that's certainly what we've been focusing on. 
So as you look at the financeability of it, the financeability will pretty much work like it did for North Central. Although it is a large number, so we'll have to be very aware of what our balance sheet strength looks like during the process, the timing of when the different tranches of these renewables come into play, the cash position that supported with these projects coming online. And being able to improve, as Julie mentioned, this FFO-to-debt thing, where it is today is really a 2021 issue. In 2022, FFO-to-debt comes back up. And certainly, with the ability to put these projects in place, it will help in terms of our ability to continue to fund these projects. 
So it'll probably -- we certainly would like for it all to be incremental. But in reality, when you go through this process, it'll probably be around capital allocation and prioritization associated with that within the existing plan but also incremental. So it'd be a combination of both. 
Yet to be seen. Obviously, if load continues to grow, if the position relative to the regulatory framework, getting concurrent recovery, making sure that we get off the tax ADIT issues, that's all going to be helpful in terms of our ability to finance. So it's still a work-in-progress."

So obviously, we're right out of the gate in terms of the announcement of what's included in each jurisdiction. So we'll have discussions with the commissions, and that's part of the integrated resource planning processes. And keep in mind, too, when we do this evaluation during the RFP -- I mean during the process, it's always solving for whatever the lease cost is in terms of what those resources are. So it shows up as wind and then solar. Typically, it's showing up as more wind early on then solar starts to pick up. But that's pretty fungible as you go forward. I mean these plans will change as we go forward based upon where technologies go, certainly, where the opportunities exist. 
Now Oklahoma may want more wind and less solar, but that won't matter. It'll be a part of the total renewables piece that's included there. 
The other part of it, too, is we'll be very mindful of how much renewables are placed into service in relation to 24/7 supply. And there's some natural gas that's built into this plan as well that enables more renewables to be put in place. But the real focus going forward during this transitional period will be for units that provide 24/7 to be more of a reliability component, certainly more of a -- sort of an insurance backstop for weather events or other events that may occur that impact the grid security. And we'll have to be very mindful of how those studies actually go. 
And I'll tell you, in our climate report, we saw for 2050 with a $15 carbon price and a more aggressive $30 carbon price. The 2035 case didn't solve because of the timing of getting resources in place and system-related issues. So you have to really think about how that's done. 
And I'm -- we've looked at these plans, and we certainly believe that with the level of 24/7 supply we still have out there and the additional opportunity associated with just the diversity of some of these projects, it's going to be of particular value to our customers going forward. 
And I guess, I'll just remind you that North Central, had it been operational during this time of the Texas and Oklahoma outages with the Yuri, would have saved customers $227 million. So you think about the savings associated with that. 
And the other thing, too, the previous question, someone was -- Shar was asking, when the utilities do it, they focus on the long term. And North Central already had the weather packages already in place, where you don't find that in a large part of the market. So we think the long term when we go after these investments, and that's why ownership is clearly important."

We don't know what that number is at this point. And I think we've got to get through the process and fully understand that. 
But when you do the net benefits associated with fuel and the capital cost of the renewables projects and transmission, it's still a benefit to consumers. So we'll go through that process. 
But you're right to be bullish about transmission in relation to these investments but also everyone else's investments because we are the largest transmission provider in the country, and most of this has to come through us."

So yes, we'll take that cash with no debt on the balance sheet. We like that very much. So we are definitely poised and ready and waiting."

And so we are -- and actually, we're looking for provisions like that even in legislation that's occurring. Because you're seeing all kinds of incentives developed for extension of PTCs, ITCs. Direct pay, we like, so direct pay not only for renewables projects but also for transmission if you have an ITC. 
But I think also, we'd like to see incentives for the undepreciated plant balances of coal units to further accelerate the ability to retire and obviate the impact to our customers. But the current plan doesn't assume any of these advancements. So -- and this happens all the time where we have plans that are out there that are public, but a lot of things get worked on. And we'll continue to work on these objectives because our objective is to move as quickly as possible to derisk these investments, and particularly with new environmental rules, with CCR and other things. We're making decisions about these plants. And you've seen the last 2 quarters, we've announced earlier retirements of coal and lignite plant operations.

And as it relates to what's embedded in our guidance, I will tell you, we actually updated our cash flow forecast. That's included in the slide deck that you have today to incorporate the impact of this particular circumstance as well as the fact that we did have some ice storms and more -- I characterize more kind of normal storm-related activities that occurred in the eastern portion of our jurisdictions here during the first quarter. 
So all of that is factored into those new cash flow forecast details, which you'll see impacting the cash flow from operations line in the slide included in the deck today. 
As you know, we did take on some additional debt to be able to accommodate the fuel and purchase power spike that was not anticipated. And so that is now being absorbed into our 2021 operations, and therefore, into our earnings. 
Interestingly, if you look at Page #8 of the slide deck that we have out there today, on the Corporate and Other segment, you'll actually see that interest expense was a benefit to us this time despite the fact that we have taken on a little additional debt in that capacity because we took a $500 million term loan on at the parent company. Interest rates have -- in terms of interest cost, I should say, was much lower in this particular quarter versus last year. We do still have lower debt outstanding from a short-term perspective versus last year. So all of those factors interestingly helped to have this impact be one of benefit to us in this particular period.

And I'm sure there'll be others in the industry with that as well. But it just seems like a direct polar opposite to where the administration is trying to go with movement to a clean energy economy. And really, it is directly opposite to years of precedence of encouraging the development of transmission, so I'm certainly hopeful as we get through the dialogue of what this all means. 
And actually, with RTO participation -- when we originally joined RTO years ago, we were making a lot of money off of through and out rates of transmission. We traded that in for generation benefits because we were selling a lot of generation. We're not selling generation, so -- to any real extent. And certainly, when you look at the value proposition of an RTO, it is centered on the ability to optimize across a larger jurisdiction. But from an AEP perspective, you got the cost of the RTO. And certainly, customers need to be able to benefit from that. 
So if you disrupt that cost-benefit opportunity, you will have people making different decisions about RTO participation. So I think it's just sort of a policy move in the wrong direction, but I certainly am hopeful that the commission comes together on that."

And keep in mind, we're thinking about the resiliency and reliability of the grid, too. So there's limitations, and we have to go through that process. But the ones we have in this plan, we can do. 
And certainly, when you look at the benefits of North Central, for example, it was $3 billion of benefit to the customers. And so when you have those kinds of economics in play, if you're able to run your 24/7 generation as more of reliability and as an insurance policy essentially and layer in as much renewables as you can, put in transmission to make sure the system continues to operate the way it should, then it could be a pretty powerful combination to benefit customers in the future."

So obviously, we were looking at future requirements instead of environmental requirements on the units. And if we kept them operating longer than 2028, that would be a challenge from an economic perspective. We didn't want to start making those kinds of investments not knowing how long the units would actually be operational. So that was a consideration. 
The other, as I mentioned, was litigation to clear all that out to make sure we took ownership and we took control. And then, of course, the value of the short-term bridge that exists that gives us the flexibility to make decisions with the Indiana Commission to focus on what is the right path for that transition. So it gives us a lot of optionality, a lot of flexibility and the control. 
And by the way, I mean, there's 2 units there: so 1 we own and 1 we leased. And it just made more sense for us to own both of them and make the decision of the plant as a whole and be able to adjust accordingly. So it worked out well overall from that perspective. And like I said, it gives us a lot of optionality and flexibility. 
And actually, at a pretty -- at a price that -- I think it was $115 million, so it's an opportunity for us to really pay for that degree of optionality that has considerable value."

Just curious, how do you think about the renewable portfolio at the G&M segment?

Chuck gets allocated capital -- or the AEP energy gets allocated capital. And he's perfectly willing to throw it back over the fence because we make evaluations based upon his threshold, which is commensurate with the regulated part. 
And also just -- his business is important because it keeps us in a part of -- like, for example, we're doing a lot of projects here in Ohio directly with customers. And it enables us to -- with customers and corporations actually, and enables us to be in that business. But at the same time, we're able to manage the capital such that you can throw it back over the fence if we see a better opportunity on the regulated side. So we have that working very well, where we can make those trade-offs on a continual basis. 
So yes, it can be a source of capital to do some of these things. And again, that lends itself to the portfolio management approach to ensure that we're putting the money in the right place at the right time. 
So -- and like I said, he's doing an incredible job with that and that organization. And the fact is, they're still doing the renewable part of it, but they're also doing specific relationships with customers with microgrids and those types of applications. So the value proposition of that business is so important to us seeing the leading edge of what we need to be doing and making cases in our regulated business to ensure that we can continue to grow from those perspectives as well. 
So all in all, it's working fine. But yes, your -- the answer is yes, we can utilize that as a source."

Thanks, Darcy, and welcome again, everyone, to American Electric Power's Second quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Today, we reported a strong second quarter operating earnings of $1.18 per share versus $1.08 for the same period of 2020. Our second quart",2602,"Okay. Thanks, Darcy, and welcome again, everyone, to American Electric Power's Second quarter 2021 Earnings Call. 
Today, we reported a strong second quarter operating earnings of $1.18 per share versus $1.08 for the same period of 2020. Our second quarter results reflect significant progress in terms of economic recovery throughout AEP's service territory, with a continued focus on O&M as we navigate through what is hopefully an emergence from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Gross regional product has already exceeded its pre-pandemic levels and employment across AEP service territory is now within 2% of its pre-pandemic levels after adding over 163,000 jobs in the first 6 months this year. Increased vaccinations, combined with the additional fiscal stimulus from the American Rescue Plan, are contributing to the strong demand for goods and services throughout the economy. 
AEP's normalized retail sales in the second quarter of 2021 were the highest we've seen since the second quarter of 2018. Clearly, we are pleased with the improvements we've seen thus far, and we'll continue to monitor the recovery's progress over the second half of the year. Accordingly, we are reaffirming our 2021 guidance range of $4.55 to $4.75 per share. And a 5% to 7% long-term growth rate and would be, again, disappointed not to be in the upper half of our stated guidance range, as we have previously stated. Julie will be discussing these issues in more detail in her report. 
Rate case activity across our jurisdictions continues to be active and substantial. In Ohio, we are awaiting an order by the commission on the settlement reach and filed with the commission earlier this year. As a reminder, the settlement has broad support from the settling parties, including the commission staff, the Ohio Consumers Counsel, industrial companies, commercial companies and other entities like the Ohio Hospital Association. We expect a decision in the third quarter of this year. 
Public Service Company of Oklahoma filed a rate case at the end of April. PSO is seeking $115.4 million net revenue increase and a 10% ROE. The following transitions North Central costs from the rider established in the approval into base rates. The case also seeks to continue a distribution rider, recover RTO expenses and update depreciation rates. Testimony of the parties is due in August with a hearing scheduled for September and an order expected in the fourth quarter of 2021. 
In Indiana, I&M filed a base rate case on July 1. The following is based on the future test year model and seeks a $97 million net revenue increase with a 10% ROE. The major items in the case include the recognition of over $500 million in capital investments per year in Indiana, continuation of the transmission tracker, the federal tax rider should those changes occur and deployment of AMI meters to provide customers more control and insight into their usage. 
In our SWEPCO jurisdictions, we have rate cases pending in Louisiana and Texas and are preparing a filing in Arkansas for tomorrow, July 23. In Texas, the hearing was held in May and SWEPCO filed its reply brief and proposed findings of facts in law on July 1. SWEPCO is seeking a net revenue increase of $73 million and an ROE of 10.35%. The filing includes investment made from February 2018, accelerated depreciation for 3 coal plants, an increase in storm reserve and vegetation management. We expect an order in the fourth quarter with rates relating back to the effective date of March 2021. 
In Louisiana, a procedural schedule was set with testimony due in the third quarter of 2021 and a hearing in January of 2022. The case seeks a $93 million net revenue increase and a 10.35% ROE, an order is expected between the second and third quarter of 2022. 
In Arkansas, the case will contain a formula rate plan for subsequent years and consider the retirement of of previously announced coal lignite assets. This filing is time to align with the North Central in-service dates and to provide a mechanism, both for recovery of costs associated with the investment and flow-through of the PTC to SWEPCO customers. 
We have certificate filings in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky, related to investments needed to comply with the CCR and ELG rules on coal plants in the region. We have received an order in Kentucky and an ALJ decision in Virginia denying ELG investments. Final decisions from the Virginia Commission and the West Virginia Commission will be received in the third quarter of 2021. We understand that these are difficult decisions for states to make regarding the future of their generation resources. We'll be working with our commissions to navigate the implications of how each state's decision will affect the ongoing operations of these plants. 
SWEPCO and PSO continue to make good progress with their commissions to recognize the storm Yuri expenditures Julie will cover this in more detail in her comments. But as a reminder, we filed for recovery of a WACC return over 5 years in Louisiana, Arkansas and Oklahoma, and will do so in the near future in Texas. PSO has filed for a financing authority to explore the securitization option that was established by the legislature. 
The company's plan to transition its generation fleet and reduce carbon emissions by 80% by 2030 and net zero by 2050 is well underway. In April, we announced new resource plans that include the addition of up to 16,600 megawatts of regulated renewable resources over the next decade. This plan provides a meaningful opportunity to invest in clean energy resources while benefiting our customers and strengthening our communities. 
Our $2 billion investment in the North Central wind facilities is the first in a very significant step forward in this transition. And it provides a solid foundation for our clean energy transformation. The Sundance facility was placed in service in the second quarter, and the Maverick and facilities remain on time and on budget for completion during the fourth quarter '21 and first quarter '22, respectively. Solicitations also are underway for additional large-scale renewable acquisitions at APCo and SWEPCO. And we expect to issue the RFP to begin to fill the resource needs for PSO in October 2021. 
Our transmission investments continue to be strong helping our communities prepare for a clean, more efficient and resilient energy future. Our Transmission Holdco contributed $0.34 per share in the second quarter, up $0.15 from the same period last year. We remain engaged in the various processes at RTOs and FERC as we advocate the need for transmission and more robust comprehensive planning methodologies to ensure that our path to a clean energy economy is as smooth as possible. 
We also continue to be a strong advocate, like many supportive of achieving net zero targets for the continuation of the 50 basis point RTO incentive. This important incentive, codified in the Federal Power Act, is critical to ensuring that needed transmission investment is made as we transition to a clean energy economy. If this nation is to move quickly to a clean energy environment, there must be a resolution and clarity around the important issues of investment return expectations as well as long-standing issues of transmission siting processes and cost allocation mechanisms. FERC certainly seems to be on the right track as they look at transmission related planning issues to spur additional development. But of course, investment related incentives are important in that equation as well. 
Okay. Now regarding the strategic process that is ongoing regarding our Kentucky assets. We're on track with the time line we shared previously to have an announcement of a complete process one way or another by year-end. As we have stated previously, keep in mind that we must obtain FERC and Kentucky Public Service Commission approvals before a deal could close, so that could push into 2022. As we focus on reaching a suitable transaction deal, we would announce in 2021 and move forward expeditiously on these 2 filings in parallel and reach closing as soon as possible. These regulatory approval processes are 180 days for the FERC Section 203 filing and 120 days for the Kentucky Public Service Commission transfer of control review. 
While this is an ongoing confidential process, progress is being made. It reminds me of the Carly Simon Song, Anticipation. And if I paraphrase some of the lyrics, we can never know about the days to come, but we think about them anyway, and hopefully, you're chasing after some finer day. More to come during the rest of 2021 on what that finer day looks like for AEP. 
Last but not least, our Achieving Excellence Program is a year-over-year effort to maintain our cost discipline. Our efforts year-to-date have largely centered on the returning to the workplace. The vast majority of those that will be in the office are returning in August. Like many employers, we will accommodate remote, hybrid and on-site work going forward. What was once 100% on-site for our office staff prior to the pandemic will become approximately 24% remote, 43% hybrid and 33% on-site when we finally -- when we fully return -- and that excludes field level employees, of course. 
We plan to reap the benefits of reduced travel, less occupied office space, savings on real estate, a broader talent pool and improved worker efficiency through digitization and automation initiatives that accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
As you know, one of the highest priorities involves ensuring AEP is active in supporting our communities and serving as a positive voice and force for social justice and advancing racial equality. We have engaged both in community dialogues as well as conversations within the company to promote a deeper understanding and commitment to meaningful change. Our efforts include a renewed focus in our charitable giving to support our organizations that are focused on these efforts. Our AEP Foundation has announced significant additional focus on social injustice-related initiatives. These activities not only support the culture we expect within AEP, but also sets an example for our communities in the nation on what could be in this country. 
So now I'll move to the equalizer chart. And I think you have that with the bubbles of each company. For that, I'll remind everybody, we generally target the ROE for the regulated segments to be in the 9.5% to 10% range. The ROEs, we have to keep in mind, though, that we are and have been in the process of thickening the equity layers over the last several years so we have to take that into account. For AEP Ohio, the ROE for AEP Ohio comes in at 9.7%. It's already newly authorized primarily due to timely recovery of capital investments. We expect the ROE to continue to trend around those authorized levels. And of course, I mentioned earlier, we're waiting on the commission order as well. 
At APCo, the ROE is coming in at 8.1%. Its ROE was below authorized due to higher amortization, primarily related to the retired coal-fired generating assets and higher depreciation from increased Virginia depreciation rates and capital investments. And of course, I've already talked about previously about the Virginia case and where it stands with the Virginia Supreme Court. 
In Kentucky, the ROE is 5.9%. Kentucky's ROE is below authorized due to loss of load from weak economic conditions and loss of major customers, along with higher expenses. In June 2020, Kentucky Power filed a base rate case seeking $65 million revenue increase, an ROE of 10%. Kentucky Power received a file order in space case rates that went into effect in January of 2021 authorizing ROE of 9.3% and a revenue increase of $52 million. 
I&M came in at 9.8%. Their ROE is consistent with authorized ROEs, which are 9.8 -- 9.6% in Michigan and 9.7% in Indiana. Earlier in July 2021, as I mentioned earlier, they filed a new rate case in Indiana and we'll continue on with that. 
PSO came in at 7.9%, and it's below its authorized level primarily due to increased capital investment currently made in base rates and higher-than-anticipated equity due to the extreme February winter weather event, which Julie will be talking about a little bit later. And then, of course, we -- in April 2021, as I mentioned earlier, we filed a new base rate case there as well. 
For SWEPCO, the ROE at SWEPCO is 7.9%. It's below authorized primarily due to increased capital investment, currently not in base rates and the continued impact of the Arkansas share of the plant that is not in retail rates. And of course, I've mentioned earlier, it affects it by about 110 basis points. So we have the 3 cases in October 2020, SWEPCO filed the Texas case, which we're still awaiting an outcome. SWEPCO also is following the Arkansas case. And then I mentioned earlier, the Louisiana case as well. 
AEP Texas is at 7.9%. Their ROE below authorized, primarily again to a significant level of investment in Texas and the timing of the annual cost recovery filings associated with that investment. As you recall, we have DCRF and TCOS filings that recover on a pretty regular basis. So the expectation is for the ROE to continue to hover around that 8% because of all the investment that's going in that state, but should trend toward 9.4% in the long-term -- longer term. 
AEP Transmission Holdco, the ROE for the Holdco is at 11%. The ROE is above authorized, primarily driven by higher revenues due to differences between actual and forecasted revenues. The Transco's benefit from a forward-looking formula rate mechanism, which helps minimize regulatory lag. So transmission is forecasting to continue to be around that 11% in 2021. So the overall is about 9%. But again, I remind you of the equity layers have increased actually pretty substantially over the last few years. So that's one of the trade-offs that are being made there. 
Okay. So in closing, we had a strong quarter in the first half of the year. I'm proud of the accomplishments our employees have made in 2021 and the commitment that our team makes day in and day out to the communities we serve, especially during the pandemic and as we come out of this trying time. Our employees continue to focus on maintaining a high level of discipline and controlling costs. And with the board economy on the certainly gives us confidence in the rest of the year and delivering on the mission of consistent earnings and dividend growth expectations that we have produced year after year. 
If I look at the key areas for AEP to address for the remainder of '21 and into '22, they are to conclude the strategic review of Kentucky, conclude North Central with the appropriate financing ownership and recovery, advance our clean energy transition with a 16,600 megawatts of renewable resources and continue the improvement of our credit metrics in line with our 2022 expectations, which Julie will talk about again. Of course, all of this is grounded fundamentally by safety, cultural and operational excellence expectations with a focus on execution. If we have any Foo Fighter fans on the call, the Rock Hall is inducting them in this year's class of inductees. They did a song called, This Will Be Our Year, which was originally recorded by The Zombies, but it says, now we're there, and we've only just begun. This would be our year. Took a long time to come. This is true for AEP regarding our clean energy transition and our execution towards portfolio optimization. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Julie."

Thanks, Nick. Thanks, Darcy. It's good to be with everyone this morning. I'm going to walk us through the second quarter and year-to-date financial results, share some thoughts on our service territory load and finish with a review of our credit metrics and liquidity. 
So let's go to Slide #6, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter and year-to-date periods. GAAP earnings for the second quarter were $1.16 per share compared to $1.05 per share in 2020. GAAP earnings through June were $2.31 per share compared to $2.05 per share in 2020. There's a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on Pages 14 and 15 of the presentation today. 
So let's walk through our quarterly operating earnings performance by segment. That's laid out on Slide #7. Operating earnings for the second quarter totaled $1.18 per share or $590 million compared to $1.08 per share or $534 million in 2020. Operating earnings for the vertically integrated utilities were $0.45 per share, down $0.10, driven by a year-over-year increase in the O&M due to lower prior year O&M, which included actions we took to adjust to the pandemic. Other pressures included lower wholesale load and higher depreciation and other taxes. These items were partially offset by the impact of rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, higher normalized retail load, transmission revenue and off-system sales. 
The transmission and distribution utilities segment earned $0.31 per share, up $0.02 from last year. Favorable drivers in this segment included higher normalized retail load, transmission revenue and rate changes. Partially offsetting these favorable items were higher tax, depreciation and O&M expenses as well as unfavorable weather and lower AFUDC. 
The AEP Transmission Holdco segment continued to grow contributing $0.34 per share, an improvement of $0.15, which got a boost because of the unfavorable annual true-up last year, consistent with the 2021 earnings guidance assumptions we had provided to you. Our fundamental return on investment growth continued as net plant increased by $1.4 billion or 13% since June of last year. Generation and marketing produced $0.09 per share, down $0.02 from last year, influenced by the prior year land sales and onetime items relating to an Oklaunion ARO adjustment and the sale of Conesville. These are mostly offset in the generation business by higher energy margins and lower expenses from the retirement of Oklaunion. Finally, corporate and other was up $0.05 per share, driven by investment gains, lower tax and lower taxes which was partially offset by higher O&M and net interest expense. So bear with me a moment. I'm going to talk a little bit more about that investment gain as we walk through the year-to-date view. 
So if you flip to Slide 8, we can look at year-to-date results. Operating earnings through June totaled $2.33 per share or $1.2 billion compared to $2.10 per share or $1 billion in 2020. Looking at the drivers by segment, operating earnings for vertically integrated utilities were $1 per share, down $0.05 due to higher O&M and depreciation expenses. Other smaller increases included lower normalized retail and wholesale load, other -- higher other taxes and a prior period fuel adjustment. The impact of weather was favorable due to the warmer than normal temps in the winter of 2020. Other favorable items in this segment included the impact of rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, higher off-system sales and transmission revenue. 
The transmission and distribution segment earned $0.54 per share, up $0.01 from last year. Earnings in this segment were up due to higher transmission revenue, rate changes, weather and normalized retail load. Partially offsetting these favorable items were higher tax, depreciation, O&M and interest expenses as well as lower AFUDC. 
The AEP Transmission holdco segment contributed $0.68 per share, up $0.21 from last year for the same reasons identified in the quarterly comparison. Generation and marketing produced $0.16 per share, down $0.02 from last year due to favorable onetime items in the prior year relating to an Oklaunion ARO adjustment in the sale of Conesville. Higher energy margins and lower expenses in the generation business offset the unfavorable ERCOT market prices on the wholesale business during Storm Yuri in February. The decrease in renewables business was driven by lower energy margins and higher expenses. 
Finally, corporate and other was up $0.08 per share, driven by investment gains and lower taxes and partially offset by higher O&M. So let me take a quick moment to comment about the investment gain, which is predominantly a function of our direct and indirect investment in charge point. As you'll see on the waterfall, this produced a $0.09 benefit year-to-date in 2021 as compared to the corresponding 2020 period. You may recall that in the fourth quarter and full year 2020, this investment produced a $0.05 contribution, and we would expect the year-over-year variance to be more pronounced at this point in 2021 as we had no benefit during the same period in 2020. 
So turning to Page 9. I'll update you on our normalized load performance for the quarter. Before I talk about class level trends, I'd like to start with a couple of observations at a macro level. 
So first of all, since all of these charts are showing a year-over-year growth, it is important to recall that the second quarter of 2020 was at the trough of the recession when restrictions on businesses to manage the public health crisis were at their greatest. So the magnitude of growth percentages is being influenced by the comparison basis. And the second observation is that there has been a steady path to recovery since bottoming out in the second quarter of last year. The momentum we're seeing is a positive sign for the economic recovery throughout the service territory. 
So if you start in the upper left corner, you'll see that normalized residential sales were down 3.1% compared to last year, bringing the year-to-date decline down to 0.5%. As mentioned earlier, the comparison basis is the key here. You'll notice that residential sales were up 6.2% when the COVID restrictions were at their greatest. In fact, 1 year later, they're only down 3.1%, which suggests some of the increase in residential is having some staying power as more businesses have embraced a remote workforce for jobs that can be easily performed at home. In fact, the second quarter normalized sales in 2021 were the second highest second quarter on record, exceeding every second quarter before the pandemic began. 
So moving to the right, weather-normalized commercial sales increased by 10%, bringing the year-to-date growth up to 3.9%. If you compare this with the residential class, you'll notice the commercial sales growth in the second quarter is more symmetrical with last year when sales were down just over 10%. The growth in commercial sales for the quarter is spread across all operating companies and most sectors. The only sector that was down slightly compared to last year was grocery stores, which were very busy at the onset of the pandemic trying to keep shelves stocked when panic purchasing was at its highest. 
So moving to the lower left corner, you'll see that the industrial sales also bounced back in the second quarter. Industrial sales for the quarter increased by 12.8%, bringing the year-to-date growth up to -- up 2.8%. Similar to commercial -- the commercial class, you'll see a symmetrical recovery compared to the second quarter of 2020 when sales were down 12.4%. Also, industrial sales were up at every operating company in nearly every sector. The only industrial sector in our top 10 that reported less sales this year compared to the second quarter of 2020 is a paper manufacturing sector, which ironically was also higher last year, partially due to panic purchasing of toilet paper. This is a phenomenon that none of us is likely to forget, especially if you were one of the folks who didn't get a jump on it. 
Finally, in the lower right corner, you can see that in total, normalized retail sales increased by 6.3% for the quarter and were up 1.9% through the first half of the year. By all indications, recovery from the pandemic and recession are on a firm footing. 
So let's go to Slide 10. There are 2 more charts here that help put the second quarter normalized sales performance into perspective. The bar chart shows the last 5 years of weather-normalized retail sales in the second quarters for the AEP system. Our retail load performance in the second quarter of 2021 has not only recovered from the recession, but it is also the highest second quarter since 2018. 
The line chart on the bottom of this page shows the seasonally adjusted retail sales by quarter, which provides an illustration of the trend of the recovery, and again, confirms that our current level of sales the highest since the second quarter of 2018. 
So before we leave the load story, let me remind you of an important factor to consider when evaluating the impact of load growth. The mix matters. So while we're seeing strong growth now in commercial and industrial sales, those are priced at much lower realizations than the decline we're seeing in residential sales. To further illustrate this point, the impact of the pandemic was most pronounced in our biggest metropolitan area, that's Columbus, Ohio. Since Columbus -- since AEP Ohio is in the T&D utility segment where we only collect an unbundled rate, the strong recovery that we're seeing this year is coming in at much lower realizations than the system average. 
Finally, let me remind you that there are rate design mechanisms in place to limit the exposure when entering a downturn that can also limit the impact when you're coming out of a recession. So while the industrial sales are up significantly this year versus last year, it does not mean the revenues will increase by the same percentage. 
So what does all this mean as we think about the remainder of 2020? Well, it means that our confidence in our earnings guidance range is fortified by what we're seeing. It suggests that the load trends we anticipated are coming to fruition as the chart on Page 9 illustrates. Our continued investment at Transco is fueling strong performance in this segment beyond the favorable true-up impact that we had anticipated. And while O&M is up, it's enabling us to take care of our business and customer needs, given the low growth we're seeing. Obviously, we have the second half of the year to navigate, but we are pleased with the direction and are keeping a watchful eye on economic activity in our service territory while scanning for any impact associated with the rise in COVID variants. 
So let's check in on the company's capitalization and liquidity position on Page 11. On a GAAP basis, our debt-to-capital ratio increased 0.1% from the prior year quarter to 62.6%. When adjusted for the Storm Yuri event, the ratio remains consistent with year-end 2020 at 61.8%. 
Let's talk about our FFO-to-debt metric. As it did in the first quarter, the effect of storm Yuri continues to have a temporary and noticeable impact in 2021 on this metric. Taking a look at the upper right quadrant on this page, you'll see that our FFO-to-debt metric based on the traditional Moody's and GAAP-calculated basis as well as on an adjusted Moody's and GAAP-calculated basis. 
On a traditional unadjusted basis, our FFO-to-debt ratio increased by 0.2% during the quarter to 9.3% on a Moody's basis. On an adjusted basis, the Moody's FFO-to-debt metric is 12.8%. To be very clear, this 12.8% figure removes or adjust the calculation to eliminate the impact of approximately $1.2 billion of cash outflows associated covering the unplanned Yuri-driven fuel and purchase power costs in the SPP region, directly impacting PSO and SWEPCO in particular. 
This metric is also adjusted to remove the effect of the associated debt we used to fund the unplanned payments. This should give you a sense of where we would be from a business as usual perspective. As you know, we are in frequent contact with the rating agencies to keep them apprised of all aspects of our business. The rating agencies continue to take the anticipated regulatory recovery into consideration as it relates to our credit rating. And importantly, there continues to be no change in our equity financing plan and our multiyear cash flow forecast that's laid out on Page 39 does not assume any asset rotation proceeds. 
Given the regulatory recovery activity that's currently in flight, we do expect our FFO-to-debt cash flow metric to return to the low to mid-teens target range next year. 
So here's a quick refresh on where all this regulatory activity stands today for PSO and SWEPCO. In Oklahoma, we're working through the regulatory process and anticipate issuing securitization bonds in the first half of 2022. In both Arkansas and Louisiana, recovery is underway, while final details get worked out in the regulatory process, and we'll be filing for recovery in Texas in the third quarter of 2021. 
So let's take a quick moment to visit our liquidity summary on Slide 11. You'll see here that our liquidity position remains strong at $3.3 billion, supported by our 5-year $4 billion bank revolver and 2-year $1 billion revolving credit facility that we entered into on March 31 of this year. If you look at the lower left side of the page, you'll see that our qualified pension continues to be well funded, and our OPEB is funded at 174.2%. 
So let's go to Slide 12. We'll do a quick wrap up, and we can get to your questions. Our performance in the first half of the year gives us confidence to reaffirm our operating earnings guidance range of $4.55 per share to $4.75 per share because of our ability to continue to invest in our own system organically, including both our energy delivery system and the transformation of our generation fleet. We're confident in our ability to grow the company at our stated long-term growth rate of 5% to 7%. 
So we surely do appreciate your time and attention today. So with that, I'm going to turn the call over to the operator for your questions."

We're still early as in the year because third quarter is particularly meaningful. And we typically look after third quarter to see where we actually stand. But again, as Julie mentioned, O&M goes up commensurate with all the customer expansion as well. And we have pretty sizable customer expansion. If you look at the industrial and commercial numbers, they're up considerably. So -- and I think it obviously is outstripping our estimate going into the year of what overall load growth would be, but it remains to be seen because I think we're sort of in a very cyclical period of trying to figure out what the future holds in terms of whether this other variant of COVID is going to have an impact or what happens actually is there just pent-up frustration, then it starts to moderate. 
What's promising is, though, that we're seeing -- we're still seeing residential load, although it's negative to 2020, it's still positive overall. So our original thesis of more residential load going forward and if we could tie that together with improved industrial and commercial load as well, it could be very positive. But we certainly have to feel our way through that and really understand that. So it will be past third quarter before we really have a good feel of that. Julie?"

Just to maybe add a little finer point to if you're thinking sequentially for the remainder of the year, our load growth rates are expected to moderate in the second half of the year based on prior year comps. So when you think about it, restrictions were most severe in the second quarter. And by the third quarter of last year, so by the third quarter of last year, the service territory had begun essentially a phase reopening. And so as a result, the 6.3% growth for the second quarter is probably not only the highest growth in the quarter and actually, it is the highest growth in AEP's history. But it will also be the highest load growth stat during the recovery. 
So if you think about the second half of the year, I would expect it year-over-year to moderate a little bit. And so we're just keeping a watchful eye on how the trend continues to click along. I know I saw in the Wall Street Journal this morning, CFO is commenting on where they think the economy is going to go. It doesn't look like anybody is changing their estimates based on COVID trends, but we're keeping an eye on that."

And really, we think of T&D and what part of the business is associated with T&D, we have made some inroads in terms of backup generation, those kinds of things in terms of transmission. I really think there's probably continued opportunity for development of storage capability of other transmission-related investments on the grid to ensure that we're able to adjust for us. We're doing a lot in terms of line in sight into the transmission grid itself in continuing to expand our abilities, continuing to focus on our ability to have even more transmission in place because if you're looking for additional generation to be placed in various areas, well, transmission is a big part of that solution as well. 
So is that -- and I think Texas is sort of a microcosm of the country when you start reevaluating the system based upon the needs from not only a natural gas perspective, but also from a renewable perspective, that brings in the whole planning effort and communication in real time associated with the operations of the transmission and for that matter, the distribution system as well. So I think they're making the right steps and I think there's more steps to be made. So -- and it's going to be a sort of a multiyear type of effort. And of course, we're a big part of the transmission in Texas. So we'll be certainly very focused on how the T&D business can be expanded to improve the resiliency of the T&D efforts. But that means Texas is really going to have to start thinking about resources and a broader view of resources like we're having to do for the rest of the system. And transmission technologies, and for that matter, distribution technologies are going to have to be recognized in its ability to provide a more resilient grid. You can't have these trickle ons drawn between generation and transmission and distribution because that's not the world we're in anymore. So we'll continue that focus. Every legislative session, every regulatory session will be centered on that effort."

So we have to make sure that there's some compatibility of the jurisdictions that are involved. 
We'll go through the process, we'll get the initial views of the commissions. And then if they are on different tracks, we'll have to further analyze and resolve that with the commissions. And there's a lot of resolutions that could occur. Some are shorter, some are longer. But we have to understand where all 3 commissions are before really doing anything here. I think it's good to get clarity, though. And I think it's pretty important that whether it's the ELG or the CCR, if they approve CCR investments but don't approve ELG investments, then that effectively brings the generation retirement dates back from 2040 to 2028. 
So that's something we have to consider along with with those commissions. But we'll know more about this in the August time frame. But I'd be hesitant to say what Kentucky -- it's pretty interesting that they would be looking at the ELG part of it. And I think there is becoming more of an awareness of -- there has to be a plan. Now what that plan is, we've got to fully resolved with all those commissions. So more to come on that."

I know, Nick, you obviously mentioned that further optimization is always a possibility. Remind us if like the sugar point is the shaping of that, for instance, that 16.6 gigawatts of renewables you discussed in the prior call. Obviously, Kentucky will more than likely backfill some of your North Central equity needs. So as we're thinking about further optimization, should we be watching like the outcomes at the IRPs, the PSC approval, how much you plan to own versus PPAs, which I guess would stipulate your incremental equity needs and the resulting size of potentially further optimization measures?"

I'd like to own all of it. But certainly, if -- but operationally and from a contracting standpoint and certainly, the ability for us to respond to system-related activities, it's important for us to own and control those assets. And I think that as we go forward, you're right, it will be the integrated resource planning filings that are made, they'll start that dialogue. Now we're in the process of doing RFPs to get more information, obviously, for the market in terms of what's out there from a developmental perspective. And that process is ongoing. So that will certainly fortify any CCN filings we have to make or anything like that after the resource planning filings, but the resource planning filings will be your first real dialogue around how quickly this transformation will occur in each one of the jurisdictions. 
And so we're feeling pretty good about it because it's getting you to a point where we have to decide from a capacity standpoint, how we support these utilities. And it's pretty clear to me that the movement is to that clean energy economy, the movement is toward as long as you have some element of baseload 24/7 capacity, that renewables will be a big part of that. So a lot of that's just becoming -- I think it's becoming much more transparent. And in our jurisdictions, I think their conditions, both federally and from a state perspective, there's just a better realization of what the options are and the timing of those options. And that's what we'll drive forward through that resource planning process."

But as we go through that process, there's At APCo, we issued an RFP there for 300 megawatts of solar and wind resources, really for a completion date of 2023 or 2024. And then in May of 2021, APCo issued an RFP to obtain, I guess, there's 100 megawatts of solar and wind energy via PPA and RFP for the renewable energy certificates only, which is consistent with the Virginia and what their requirements are. And then SWEPCO issued an RFP for owned resources up to 3,000 megawatts of wind and up to 300 megawatts of solar resources with optional battery storage, by the way, that can achieve completion by 2024 to 2025. And they're also seeking 200 megawatts of capacity in the 23% to 24% range and another 250 in the 25% to 27% range. So those bids are due in mid-August. 
And then at PSO, we -- in June, we notified the regulators that intends -- we intend to issue an RFP seeking up to 2,600 megawatts of wind and up to 1,350 megawatts of solar, again, with options for battery storage consideration, and that's meeting capacity needs by 2025. So -- and then PSO plans to issue the RFP in October of this year. So those are the ones that are on the Board right now and have really some near-term related requirements, and most are capacity-related requirements. So -- and again, they're being done pretty much the same way as the others with North Central that we'll certainly do more of a turnkey type of thing where we take ownership at the time that it's approved in rate. So -- and then, of course, we'll go through the process of of approvals by the various commissions along the way. 
So -- but that's the plan right now. And then we'll continue to -- as a matter of fact, we're spending a lot of time with our Board focused on the strategies related to these types of filings and the plan long term. And it's important for everyone to understand, this is going to be a continual process and you're just seeing the first part of these really driven by capacity requirements and not just sort of an energy convenience. So I think they're really good to go out with right now. And that's what we have at this point."

So obviously, we'd like to see much better transmission-related planning across regions. And AEP does a pretty good job itself in terms of transmission planning because we do have a large system to consider. But at the same time, RTO-to-RTO type of planning process to try to make them more consistent. So you can have this large transmission being built across regions and across states. If you're going to get that going, particularly as you're trying to get renewable resources to load centers we're going to have to resolve these issues around multi-jurisdictional multi-RTO type of analyses and making sure that we're consistent. 
The other part, too, is we've got to have consistency in terms of ratemaking. And this notion of reevaluating incentives, structures and those types of things is not good for making decisions relative to transmission or -- and it's not good relative to the RTO model itself. So I think FERC really needs to sort of step back and take a look at -- I think it's a real positive approach to be focusing on the planning aspects and addressing RTO-to-RTO boundaries, addressing areas where what's competitive, what's not competitive, all those types of things, that's fine. But we have to have a clear planning process and first of all, you can't have coming back later after a project, multimillions have been spent on the project to say, we're going to stop the project. That has to change. And the other part of it is we've got to be able to make these investments with some sense of certainty and be able to move quickly to make that happen. 
So I just -- I think there's only so much -- there's a lot of value in being in an RTO for customers. But there also has to be value for the companies involved to make the investments that benefit customers in orders of magnitude greater than what the costs are related to any incentives related to transmission. And if you want to send a bad message for anybody to join an RTO or anybody to stay in an RTO, it's just not good to start messing around with what the assumptions are relative to the future recovery of transmission investment. And now when you start questioning incentives, you're really questioning anybody that's trying to put a multiyear model together to show the benefits of transmission, has to take that into account that something may change. It's sort of like trying to make an investment in a coal unit with clean energy activities going on in Washington. So you really do have to really think this process through and think about what you're trying to achieve. Sorry, I went on about that one, but..."

So obviously, we have the, I guess, it's $1.2 trillion, the infrastructure bill that it's interesting we talk in trillions as opposed to billions now. But in terms of the hard infrastructure side of things, it appears there's some kind of convergence in Washington on that particular issue, although more has to be done on the actual language and things like that. But as far as pursuing the advancement of certainly transmission investment, but direct pay and those kinds of issues are clearly important along the way. We also have to -- as far as renewables and clean energy, PTCs, ITCs, extensions of those, I think that makes sense, particularly RS already did delays because of COVID and that kind of thing. So I think there's opportunities for that. 
And then as far as electric vehicles, certainly, we'd like to see electric vehicle infrastructure continue to be developed. So I think all of those areas are positive. The issue is how you leverage into the private companies like ours that instead of the government funding. And for transmission, for example, we think that mechanisms already exist for the development of transmission as long as you keep all the incentives and all that kind of stuff. But so federal government funding of that now, I think, you have to sort of think about what level of encouragement in what area. So if they can make siding much better, if they can make certainly the focus on planning, those issues that enable transmission to get investments, we have no problem financing transmission investments. So I think the government probably ought to pick and choose between what they truly want to focus on that's not already leveraged into the utilities, for example. 
They could certainly encourage the development of electric vehicles with the focus on charging station infrastructure and those types of things, that would be a benefit. And then as far as the renewables transformation for the clean energy transformation, any kind of hard infrastructure around being able to move more quickly from a renewable standpoint, whether tax incentives and also other technologies like storage. And then also we'd like to see benefits related to either tax incentives for coal-fired generation to reduce the undepreciated plant balances, for example. If you want to have a national plan around moving to a clean energy economy, then the more quickly we can reduce undepreciated plant balances, the better we're able to make decisions and commissions and states can make decisions about what future resource replacements would be. So I think there's several ways to really focus on this, but we're all moving toward a clean energy economy. We just need to make sure that the government doesn't try to do too much across the board as opposed to very selected areas that enable investment to continue in the private sector. That would be my view."

No, that's spot on, Nick. And thanks for the question, Michael. As I'm sitting here thinking about this and as we were preparing for the earnings call, one of the things I'm looking at is to Nick's point, you look at where loads coming in. And as I mentioned in a previous answer to a question, we do expect that load on a relative basis. When you compare it to last year for the second half, it would not be as pronounced, although we do expect it to continue to improve. So that's a good thing. And that allows us to be a little more comfortable with O&M costs where they are because that does help the customer in the long run. So we keep that top of mind and continue to be very diligent about managing costs. 
But if you're trying to model for the rest of the year, let me start by saying this. We are not changing our guidance. But as you know, once we start the year and we give you that plan, so you see that waterfall that we give to you, how we get to the end of the year, obviously, changes, right, because it's a dynamic business. So I wouldn't be surprised if relative to that plan, if you saw O&M be running a little richer, but I would hope that load would be hanging in there, too. And then as you know, we're doing well on the Transmission Holdco segment already kind of clicking along where we thought we would be for the full year. So there may be some benefit there, too. So do keep that in mind, when you go back and compare and contrast to that guidance walk that we gave to you, I think it was on February 25, during our earnings call. And then we're happy to help you with any modeling that you have offline."

Thanks, Darcy, and welcome again, everyone, to American Electric Power's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Today, we reported a strong second quarter operating earnings of $1.18 per share versus $1.08 for the same period of 2020. Our second quart",2599,"Okay. Thanks, Darcy, and welcome again, everyone, to American Electric Power's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. 
Today, we reported a strong second quarter operating earnings of $1.18 per share versus $1.08 for the same period of 2020. Our second quarter results reflect significant progress in terms of economic recovery throughout AEP's service territory with a continued focus on O&M as we navigate through what is hopefully an emergence from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Gross regional product has already exceeded its pre-pandemic levels and employment across AEP service territory is now within 2% of its pre-pandemic levels after adding over 163,000 jobs in the first 6 months this year. Increased vaccinations, combined with the additional fiscal stimulus from the American Rescue Plan, are contributing to the strong demand for goods and services throughout the economy. 
AEP's normalized retail sales in the second quarter of 2021 were the highest we've seen since the second quarter of 2018. Clearly, we are pleased with the improvements we've seen thus far, and we'll continue to monitor the recovery's progress over the second half of the year. Accordingly, we are reaffirming our 2021 guidance range of $4.55 to $4.75 per share and a 5% to 7% long-term growth rate and would be again disappointed not to be in the upper half of our stated guidance range as we have previously stated. Julie will be discussing these issues in more detail in her report. 
Rate case activity across our jurisdictions continues to be active and substantial. In Ohio, we are awaiting an order by the commission on the settlement reached and filed with the commission earlier this year. As a reminder, the settlement has broad support from the settling parties, including the commission staff, the Ohio Consumers' Counsel, industrial companies, commercial companies and other entities like the Ohio Hospital Association. We expect a decision in the third quarter of this year. 
Public Service Company of Oklahoma filed a rate case at the end of April. PSO is seeking $115.4 million net revenue increase and a 10% ROE. The following transitions North Central costs from the rider established in the approval into base rates. The case also seeks to continue a distribution rider, recover RTO expenses and update depreciation rates. Testimony of the parties is due in August with a hearing scheduled for September and an order expected in the fourth quarter of 2021. 
In Indiana, I&M filed a base rate case on July 1. The following is based on the future test year model and seeks a $97 million net revenue increase with a 10% ROE. The major items in the case include the recognition of over $500 million in capital investments per year in Indiana, continuation of the transmission tracker, the federal tax rider, should those changes occur, and deployment of AMI meters to provide customers more control and insight into their usage. 
In our SWEPCO jurisdictions, we have rate cases pending in Louisiana and Texas and are preparing a filing in Arkansas for tomorrow, July 23. In Texas, a hearing was held in May and SWEPCO filed its reply brief and proposed findings of facts in law on July 1. SWEPCO is seeking a net revenue increase of $73 million and an ROE of 10.35%. The filing includes investment made from February 2018, accelerated depreciation for three coal plants, an increase in storm reserve and vegetation management. We expect an order in the fourth quarter with rates relating back to the effective date of March 2021. 
In Louisiana, a procedural schedule was set with testimony due in the third quarter of 2021 and a hearing in January of 2022. The case seeks a $93 million net revenue increase and a 10.35% ROE. An order is expected between the second and third quarter of 2022. In Arkansas, the case will contain a formula rate plan for subsequent years and consider the retirement of previously announced coal lignite assets. This filing is timed to align with the North Central in-service dates and to provide a mechanism both for recovery of cost associated with the investment and flow-through of the PTC to SWEPCO customers. 
We have certificate filings in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky related to investments needed to comply with the CCR and ELG rules on coal plants in the region. We have received an order in Kentucky and an ALJ decision in Virginia denying ELG investments. Final decisions from the Virginia commission and the West Virginia commission will be received in the third quarter of 2021. We understand that these are difficult decisions for states to make regarding the future of their generation resources. We'll be working with our commissions to navigate the implications of how each state's decision will affect the ongoing operations of these plants. 
SWEPCO and PSO continue to make good progress with their commissions to recognize the storm Uri expenditures. Julie will cover this in more detail in her comments. But as a reminder, we filed for recovery of a WACC return over 5 years in Louisiana, Arkansas and Oklahoma and will do so in the near future in Texas. PSO has filed for a financing authority to explore the securitization option that was established by the legislature. 
The company's plan to transition its generation fleet and reduce carbon emissions by 80% by 2030 and net zero by 2050 is well underway. In April, we announced new resource plans that include the addition of up to 16,600 megawatts of regulated renewable resources over the next decade. This plan provides a meaningful opportunity to invest in clean energy resources while benefiting our customers and strengthening our communities. 
Our $2 billion investment in the North Central Wind facilities is the first in a very significant step forward in this transition. And it provides a solid foundation for our clean energy transformation. The Sundance facility was placed in service in the second quarter. And the Maverick and Traverse facilities remain on time and on budget for completion during the fourth quarter '21 and first quarter '22, respectively. Solicitations also are underway for additional large-scale renewable acquisitions at APCo and SWEPCO. And we expect to issue the RFP to begin to fill the resource needs for PSO in October 2021. 
Our transmission investments continue to be strong, helping our communities prepare for a clean, more efficient and resilient energy future. Our Transmission Holdco contributed $0.34 per share in the second quarter, up $0.15 from the same period last year. We remain engaged in the various processes at RTOs and FERC as we advocate the need for transmission and more robust comprehensive planning methodologies to ensure that our path to a clean energy economy is as smooth as possible. 
We also continue to be a strong advocate, like many supportive of achieving net zero targets, for the continuation of the 50 basis point RTO incentive. This important incentive, codified in the Federal Power Act, is critical to ensuring that needed transmission investment is made as we transition to a clean energy economy. If this nation is to move quickly to a clean energy environment, there must be a resolution and clarity around the important issues of investment return expectations as well as long-standing issues of transmission siting processes and cost allocation mechanisms. FERC certainly seems to be on the right track as they look at transmission-related planning issues to spur additional development. But of course, investment-related incentives are important in that equation as well. 
Okay. Now regarding the strategic process that is ongoing regarding our Kentucky assets. We're on track with the timeline we shared previously to have an announcement of a complete process one way or another by year-end. As we have stated previously, keep in mind that we must obtain FERC and Kentucky Public Service Commission approvals before a deal could close. So that could push into 2022. As we focus on reaching a suitable transaction deal, we would announce in 2021 and move forward expeditiously on these two filings in parallel and reach closing as soon as possible. 
These regulatory approval processes are 180 days for the FERC Section 203 filing and 120 days for the Kentucky Public Service Commission transfer of control review. While this is an ongoing confidential process, progress is being made. It reminds me of the Carly Simon song, Anticipation. And if I paraphrase some of the lyrics, ""We can never know about the days to come, but we think about them anyway. And hopefully, you're chasing after some finer day."" More to come during the rest of 2021 on what that finer day looks like for AEP. 
Last but not least, our Achieving Excellence Program is a year-over-year effort to maintain our cost discipline. Our efforts year-to-date have largely centered on the returning to the workplace. The vast majority of those that will be in the office are returning in August. Like many employers, we will accommodate remote, hybrid and on-site work going forward. What was once 100% on-site for our office staff prior to the pandemic will become approximately 24% remote, 43% hybrid and 33% on-site when we finally -- when we fully return, and that excludes field-level employees, of course. We plan to reap the benefits of reduced travel, less occupied office space, savings on real estate, a broader talent pool and improved worker efficiency through digitization and automation initiatives that accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
As you know, one of the highest priorities involves ensuring AEP is active in supporting our communities and serving as a positive voice and force for social justice and advancing racial equality. We have engaged both in community dialogues as well as conversations within the company to promote a deeper understanding and commitment to meaningful change. Our efforts include a renewed focus in our charitable-giving to support organizations that are focused on these efforts. Our AEP Foundation has announced significant additional focus on social injustice-related initiatives. These activities not only support the culture we expect within AEP but also sets an example for our communities in the nation on what could be in this country. 
So now I'll move to the equalizer chart. And I think you have that with the bubbles of each company. For that, I'll remind everybody, we generally target the ROE for the regulated segments to be in the 9.5% to 10% range. The ROEs, you have to keep in mind though, that we are and have been in the process of thickening the equity layers over the last several years, so we have to take that into account. For AEP Ohio, the ROE for AEP Ohio comes in at 9.7%. Its ROE was near authorized primarily due to timely recovery of capital investments. We expect the ROE to continue to trend around those authorized levels. And of course, I mentioned earlier, we're waiting on the commission order as well. 
At APCo, the ROE is coming in at 8.1%. Its ROE was below authorized due to higher amortization, primarily related to the retired coal-fired generating assets and higher depreciation from increased Virginia depreciation rates and capital investments. And of course, I've already talked about -- previously about the Virginia case and where it stands with the Virginia Supreme Court. 
In Kentucky, the ROE is 5.9%. Kentucky's ROE is below authorized due to loss of load from weak economic conditions and loss of major customers, along with higher expenses. In June 2020, Kentucky Power filed a base rate case seeking $65 million revenue increase and ROE of 10%. Kentucky Power received a file order in its base case rates that went into effect in January of 2021 authorizing ROE of 9.3% and a revenue increase of $52 million. 
I&M came in at 9.8%. Their ROE is consistent with authorized ROEs, which are 9.8 -- 9.6% in Michigan and 9.7% in Indiana. Earlier in July 2021, as I mentioned earlier, they filed a new rate case in Indiana. And we'll continue on with that. 
PSO came in at 7.9% and it's below its authorized level primarily due to increased capital investment currently made in base rates and higher-than-anticipated equity due to the extreme February winter weather event, which Julie will be talking about a little bit later. And then of course, we -- in April 2021, as I mentioned earlier, we filed a new base rate case there as well. 
For SWEPCO, the ROE at SWEPCO is 7.9%. It's below authorized primarily due to increased capital investment, currently not in base rates and the continued impact of the Arkansas share of the Turk plant that is not in retail rates. And of course, I've mentioned earlier, it affects it by about 110 basis points. So we have the three cases: in October 2020, SWEPCO filed the Texas case, which we're still awaiting an outcome; SWEPCO also is following the Arkansas case; and then I mentioned earlier, the Louisiana case as well. 
AEP Texas is at 7.9%. Their ROE below authorized, primarily again to a significant level of investment in Texas and the timing of the annual cost recovery filings associated with that investment. As you recall, we have DCRF and TCOS filings that recover on a pretty regular basis. So the expectation is for the ROE to continue to hover around that 8% because of all the investment that's going in that state but should trend toward 9.4% in the long term -- longer term. 
AEP Transmission Holdco, the ROE for the holdco is at 11%. The ROE is above authorized, primarily driven by higher revenues due to differences between actual and forecasted revenues. The Transcos benefit from a forward-looking formula rate mechanism, which helps minimize regulatory lag. So transmission is forecasting to continue to be around that 11% in 2021. So the overall is about 9%. But again, remind you of the equity layers have increased actually pretty substantially over the last few years. So that's one of the tradeoffs that are being made there. 
Okay. So in closing, we had a strong quarter and a first half of the year. I'm proud of the accomplishments our employees have made in 2021 and the commitment that our team makes day in and day out to the communities we serve, especially during the pandemic and as we come out of this trying time. Our employees continue to focus on maintaining a high level of discipline in controlling costs. And with the buoyed economy on the mend, it certainly gives us confidence in the rest of the year in delivering on the mission of consistent earnings and dividend growth expectations that we have produced year-after-year. 
If I look at the key areas for AEP to address for the remainder of '21 and into '22, they are: to conclude the strategic review of Kentucky; conclude North Central with the appropriate financing ownership and recovery; advance our clean energy transition with a 16,600 megawatts of renewable resources; and continue the improvement of our credit metrics in line with our 2022 expectations, which Julie will talk about again. Of course, all of this is grounded fundamentally by safety, cultural and operational excellence expectations with a focus on execution. 
If we have any Foo Fighter fans on the call, the Rock Hall is inducting them in this year's class of inductees. They did a song called This Will Be Our Year, which was originally recorded by The Zombies. But it says, ""Now we're there and we've only just begun. This will be our year, took a long time to come."" This is true for AEP regarding our clean energy transition and our execution towards portfolio optimization. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Julie."

Thanks, Nick. Thanks, Darcy. It's good to be with everyone this morning. I'm going to walk us through the second quarter and year-to-date financial results, share some thoughts on our service territory load and finish with a review of our credit metrics and liquidity. 
So let's go to Slide #6, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter and year-to-date periods. GAAP earnings for the second quarter were $1.16 per share compared to $1.05 per share in 2020. GAAP earnings through June were $2.31 per share compared to $2.05 per share in 2020. There's a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on Pages 14 and 15 of the presentation today. 
So let's walk through our quarterly operating earnings performance by segment. That's laid out on Slide #7. Operating earnings for the second quarter totaled $1.18 per share or $590 million compared to $1.08 per share or $534 million in 2020. Operating earnings for the Vertically Integrated Utilities were $0.45 per share, down $0.10, driven by a year-over-year increase in the O&M due to lower prior year O&M, which included actions we took to adjust to the pandemic. Other pressures included lower wholesale load and higher depreciation and other taxes. These items were partially offset by the impact of rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, higher normalized retail load, transmission revenue and off-system sales. 
The Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.31 per share, up $0.02 from last year. Favorable drivers in this segment included higher normalized retail load, transmission revenue and rate changes. Partially offsetting these favorable items were higher tax, depreciation and O&M expenses as well as unfavorable weather and lower AFUDC. 
The AEP Transmission Holdco segment continued to grow contributing $0.34 per share, an improvement of $0.15, which got a boost because of the unfavorable annual true-up last year consistent with the 2021 earnings guidance assumptions we had provided to you. Our fundamental return on investment growth continued as net plant increased by $1.4 billion or 13% since June of last year. 
Generation & Marketing produced $0.09 per share, down $0.02 from last year, influenced by the prior year land sales and one-time items relating to an Oklaunion ARO adjustment and the sale of Conesville. These were mostly offset in the generation business by higher energy margins and lower expenses from the retirement of Oklaunion. 
Finally, Corporate and Other was up $0.05 per share, driven by investment gains, lower tax -- and lower taxes which was partially offset by higher O&M and net interest expense. So bear with me a moment, I'm going to talk a little bit more about that investment gain as we walk through the year-to-date view. 
So if you flip to Slide 8, we can look at year-to-date results. Operating earnings through June totaled $2.33 per share or $1.2 billion compared to $2.10 per share or $1 billion in 2020. Looking at the drivers by segment, operating earnings for Vertically Integrated Utilities were $1 per share, down $0.05, due to higher O&M and depreciation expenses. Other smaller increases included lower normalized retail and wholesale load, other -- higher other taxes and a prior period fuel adjustment. The impact of weather was favorable due to the warmer than normal temps in the winter of 2020. Other favorable items in this segment included the impact of rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, higher off-system sales and transmission revenue. 
The Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.54 per share, up $0.01 from last year. Earnings in this segment were up due to higher transmission revenue, rate changes, weather and normalized retail load. Partially offsetting these favorable items were higher tax, depreciation, O&M and interest expenses as well as lower AFUDC. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.68 per share, up $0.21 from last year, for the same reasons identified in the quarterly comparison. 
Generation & Marketing produced $0.16 per share, down $0.02 from last year, due to favorable one-time items in the prior year relating to an Oklaunion ARO adjustment and the sale of Conesville. Higher energy margins and lower expenses in the generation business offset the unfavorable ERCOT market prices on the wholesale business during storm Uri in February. The decrease in renewables business was driven by lower energy margins and higher expenses. Finally, Corporate and Other was up $0.08 per share, driven by investment gains and lower taxes and partially offset by higher O&M. 
So let me take a quick moment to comment about the investment gain, which is predominantly a function of our direct and indirect investment in charge point. As you'll see on the waterfall, this produced a $0.09 benefit year-to-date in 2021 as compared to the corresponding 2020 period. You may recall that in the fourth quarter and full year 2020, this investment produced a $0.05 contribution. And we would expect the year-over-year variance to be more pronounced at this point in 2021 as we had no benefit during the same period in 2020. 
So turning to Page 9. I'll update you on our normalized load performance for the quarter. Before I talk about class-level trends, I'd like to start with a couple of observations at a macro level. So first of all, since all of these charts are showing a year-over-year growth, it is important to recall that the second quarter of 2020 was at the trough of the recession when restrictions on businesses to manage the public health crisis were at their greatest. So the magnitude of growth percentages is being influenced by the comparison basis. And the second observation is that there has been a steady path to recovery since bottoming-out in the second quarter of last year. The momentum we're seeing is a positive sign for the economic recovery throughout the service territory. 
So if you start in the upper left corner, you'll see that normalized residential sales were down 3.1% compared to last year, bringing the year-to-date decline down to 0.5%. As mentioned earlier, the comparison basis is the key here. You'll notice that residential sales were up 6.2% when the COVID restrictions were at their greatest. In fact, 1 year later, they're only down 3.1%, which suggests some of the increase in residential is having some staying power as more businesses have embraced the remote workforce for jobs that can be easily performed at home. In fact, the second quarter normalized sales in 2021 were the second-highest second quarter on record, exceeding every second quarter before the pandemic began. 
So moving to the right, weather-normalized commercial sales increased by 10%, bringing the year-to-date growth up to 3.9%. If you compare this with the residential class, you'll notice that commercial sales growth in the second quarter is more symmetrical with last year, when sales were down just over 10%. The growth in commercial sales for the quarter is spread across all operating companies and most sectors. The only sector that was down slightly compared to last year was grocery stores, which were very busy at the onset of the pandemic trying to keep shelves stocked when panic purchasing was at its highest. 
So moving to the lower left corner, you'll see that the industrial sales also bounced back in the second quarter. Industrial sales for the quarter increased by 12.8%, bringing the year-to-date growth up to -- up 2.8%. Similar to commercial -- the commercial class, you'll see a symmetrical recovery compared to the second quarter of 2020, when sales were down 12.4%. Also, industrial sales were up at every operating company in nearly every sector. The only industrial sector in our top 10 that reported less sales this year compared to the second quarter of 2020 is the paper manufacturing sector, which ironically was also higher last year, partially due to panic purchasing of toilet paper. This is a phenomenon that none of us is likely to forget, especially if you were one of the folks who didn't get a jump on it. 
Finally, in the lower right corner, you can see that, in total, normalized retail sales increased by 6.3% for the quarter and were up 1.9% through the first half of the year. By all indications, recovery from the pandemic and recession are on a firm footing. 
So let's go to Slide 10. There are two more charts here that help put the second quarter normalized sales performance into perspective. The bar chart shows the last 5 years of weather-normalized retail sales in the second quarters for the AEP system. Our retail load performance in the second quarter of 2021 has not only recovered from the recession, but it is also the highest second quarter since 2018. The line chart on the bottom of this page shows the seasonally adjusted retail sales by quarter, which provides an illustration of the trend of the recovery and again confirms that our current level of sales is the highest since the second quarter of 2018. 
So before we leave the load story, let me remind you of an important factor to consider when evaluating the impact of load growth. The mix matters. So while we're seeing strong growth now in commercial and industrial sales, those are priced at much lower realizations than the decline we're seeing in residential sales. To further illustrate this point, the impact of the pandemic was most pronounced in our biggest metropolitan area, that's Columbus, Ohio. Since Columbus -- since AEP Ohio is in the T&D Utilities segment, where we only collect an unbundled rate, the strong recovery that we're seeing this year is coming in at much lower realizations than the system average. 
Finally, let me remind you that there are rate design mechanisms in place to limit the exposure when entering a downturn that can also limit the impact when you're coming out of a recession. So while the industrial sales are up significantly this year versus last year, it does not mean the revenues will increase by the same percentage. So what does all this mean when we think about the remainder of 2020? 
Well, it means that our confidence in our earnings guidance range is fortified by what we're seeing. It suggests that the load trends we anticipated are coming to fruition as the chart on Page 9 illustrates. Our continued investment at Transco is fueling strong performance in this segment beyond the favorable true-up impact that we had anticipated. And while O&M is up, it's enabling us to take care of our business and customer needs, given the load growth we're seeing. Obviously, we have the second half of the year to navigate. But we are pleased with the direction and are keeping a watchful eye on economic activity in our service territory while scanning for any impact associated with the rise in COVID variants. 
So let's check in on the company's capitalization and liquidity position on Page 11. On a GAAP basis, our debt-to-capital ratio increased 0.1% from the prior year quarter to 62.6%. When adjusted for the storm Uri event, the ratio remains consistent with year-end 2020 at 61.8%. Let's talk about our FFO-to-debt metric. As it did in the first quarter, the effect of storm Uri continues to have a temporary and noticeable impact in 2021 on this metric. Taking a look at the upper right quadrant on this page, you'll see that our FFO-to-debt metric based on the traditional Moody's and GAAP-calculated basis as well as on an adjusted Moody's and GAAP-calculated basis. 
On a traditional unadjusted basis, our FFO-to-debt ratio increased by 0.2% during the quarter to 9.3% on a Moody's basis. On an adjusted basis, the Moody's FFO-to-debt metric is 12.8%. To be very clear, this 12.8% figure removes or adjusts the calculation to eliminate the impact of approximately $1.2 billion of cash outflows associated covering the unplanned Uri-driven fuel and purchase power costs in the SPP region, directly impacting PSO and SWEPCO in particular. This metric is also adjusted to remove the effect of the associated debt we used to fund the unplanned payments. This should give you a sense of where we would be from a business-as-usual perspective. 
As you know, we are in frequent contact with the rating agencies to keep them apprised of all aspects of our business. The rating agencies continue to take the anticipated regulatory recovery into consideration as it relates to our credit rating. And importantly, there continues to be no change in our equity financing plan. And our multiyear cash flow forecast that's laid out on Page 39 does not assume any asset rotation proceeds. Given the regulatory recovery activity that's currently in flight, we do expect our FFO-to-debt cash flow metric to return to the low- to mid-teens target range next year. 
So here's a quick refresh on where all this regulatory activity stands today for PSO and SWEPCO. In Oklahoma, we're working through the regulatory process and anticipate issuing securitization bonds in the first half of 2022. In both Arkansas and Louisiana, recovery is underway while final details get worked out in the regulatory process. And we'll be filing for recovery in Texas in the third quarter of 2021. 
So let's take a quick moment to visit our liquidity summary on Slide 11. You'll see here that our liquidity position remains strong at $3.3 billion, supported by our 5-year $4 billion bank revolver and 2-year $1 billion revolving credit facility that we entered into on March 31 of this year. If you look at the lower left side of the page, you'll see that our qualified pension continues to be well-funded and our OPEB is funded at 174.2%. 
So let's go to Slide 12. We'll do a quick wrap-up, then we can get to your questions. Our performance in the first half of the year gives us confidence to reaffirm our operating earnings guidance range of $4.55 per share to $4.75 per share. Because of our ability to continue to invest in our own system organically, including both our energy delivery system and the transformation of our generation fleet, we're confident in our ability to grow the company at our stated long-term growth rate of 5% to 7%. 
So we surely do appreciate your time and attention today. So with that, I'm going to turn the call over to the operator for your questions."

We're still early as in the year because third quarter is particularly meaningful. And we typically look after third quarter to see where we actually stand. But again, as Julie mentioned, O&M goes up commensurate with all the customer expansion as well. And we have pretty sizable customer expansion. If you look at the industrial and commercial numbers, they're up considerably. 
So -- and I think it obviously is outstripping our estimate going into the year of what overall load growth would be, but it remains to be seen. Because I think we're sort of in a very cyclical period of trying to figure out what the future holds in terms of whether this other variant of COVID is going to have an impact or what happens actually is there are just pent-up frustration and it starts to moderate. 
What's promising is though that we're seeing -- we're still seeing residential load, although it's negative to 2020, it's still positive overall. So our original thesis of more residential load going forward, and if we could tie that together with improved industrial and commercial load as well, it could be very positive. But we certainly have to feel our way through that and really understand that. So it will be past third quarter before we really have a good feel of that. Julie?"

Just to maybe add a little finer point, too, if you're thinking sequentially for the remainder of the year, our load growth rates are expected to moderate in the second half of the year based on prior year comps. So when you think about it, restrictions were most severe in the second quarter. And by the third quarter of last year, so by the third quarter of last year, the service territory had begun essentially a phased reopening. And so as a result, the 6.3% growth for the second quarter is probably not only the highest growth in the quarter -- and actually, it is the highest growth in AEP's history, but it will also be the highest load growth stat during the recovery. 
So if you think about the second half of the year, I would expect it year-over-year to moderate a little bit. And so we're just keeping a watchful eye on how the trend continues to click along. I know I saw in The Wall Street Journal this morning, CFOs commenting on where they think the economy is going to go. It doesn't look like anybody is changing their estimates based on COVID trends, but we're keeping an eye on that."

And really, we think of T&D and what part of the business is associated with T&D, we have made some inroads in terms of backup generation, those kinds of things. In terms of transmission, I really think there's probably continued opportunity for development of storage capability of other transmission-related investments on the grid to ensure that we're able to adjust. For us, we're doing a lot in terms of line in sight into the transmission grid itself, continuing to expand our [ state ] abilities, continuing to focus on our ability to have even more transmission in place because if you're looking for additional generation to be placed in various areas, well, transmission is a big part of that solution as well. 
So as that -- and I think Texas is sort of a microcosm of the country when you start reevaluating the system based upon the needs from not only a natural gas perspective but also from a renewable perspective, that brings in the whole planning effort and communication in real time associated with the operations of the transmission and, for that matter, the distribution system as well. So I think they're making the right steps. And I think there's more steps to be made, so -- and it's going to be a sort of a multiyear type of effort. And of course, we're a big part of the transmission in Texas. 
So we'll be certainly very focused on how the T&D business can be expanded to improve the resiliency of the T&D efforts. But that means Texas is really going to have to start thinking about resources and a broader view of resources like we're having to do for the rest of the system. And transmission technologies, and for that matter, distribution technologies are going to have to be recognized in its ability to provide a more resilient grid. You can't have these trickle-ons drawn between generation and transmission and distribution because that's not the world we're in anymore. So we'll continue that focus. Every legislative session, every regulatory session will be centered on that effort."

And I think Kentucky obviously is the first shoe to drop in this regard. But we've also made it clear that these are multi-jurisdictional units. So we have to make sure that there's some compatibility of the jurisdictions that are involved. 
We'll go through the process. We'll get the initial views of the commissions. And then if they are on different tracks, we'll have to further analyze and resolve that with the commissions. And there's a lot of resolutions that could occur. Some are shorter, some are longer. But we have to understand where all three commissions are before really doing anything here. I think it's good to get clarity though. And I think it's pretty important that whether it's the ELG or the CCR, if they approve CCR investments but don't approve ELG investments, then that effectively brings the generation retirement dates back from 2040 to 2028. 
So that's something we have to consider along with those commissions. But we'll know more about this in the August time frame. But I'd be hesitant to say what Kentucky -- it's pretty interesting that they would be looking at the ELG part of it. And I think there is becoming more of an awareness of that there has to be a plan. Now what that plan is, we've got to fully resolve with all those commissions, so more to come on that."

But certainly, if -- but operationally and from a contracting standpoint and certainly the ability for us to respond to system-related activities, it's important for us to own and control those assets. 
And I think that as we go forward, you're right, it will be the integrated resource planning filings that are made that will start that dialogue. Now we're in the process of doing RFPs to get more information obviously for the market in terms of what's out there from a developmental perspective. And that process is ongoing. So that will certainly fortify any CCN filings we have to make or anything like that after the resource planning filings. But the resource planning filings will be your first real dialogue around how quickly this transformation will occur in each one of the jurisdictions. 
And so we're feeling pretty good about it because it's getting to a point where we have to decide from a capacity standpoint how we support these utilities. And it's pretty clear to me that the movement is to that clean energy economy, the movement is toward as long as you have some element of baseload 24/7 capacity, that renewables will be a big part of that. So a lot of that's just becoming -- I think it's becoming much more transparent. And in our jurisdictions, I think their conditions, both federally and from a state perspective, there's just a better realization of what the options are and the timing of those options.

But as we go through that process, there's -- at APCo, we issued an RFP there for 300 megawatts of solar and wind resources really for a completion date of 2023 or 2024. And then in May of 2021, APCo issued an RFP to obtain, I guess, there's 100 megawatts of solar and wind energy via PPA and RFP for the renewable energy certificates only, which is consistent with Virginia and what their requirements are. And then SWEPCO issued an RFP for owned resources up to 3,000 megawatts of wind and up to 300 megawatts of solar resources with optional battery storage, by the way, that can achieve completion by 2024 to 2025. And they're also seeking 200 megawatts of capacity in the '23 to '24 range and another 250 in the '25 to '27 range. So those bids are due in mid-August. 
And then at PSO, we -- in June, we notified the regulators that intends -- we intend to issue an RFP seeking up to 2,600 megawatts of wind and up to 1,350 megawatts of solar again with options for battery storage consideration. And that's meeting capacity needs by 2025, so -- and then PSO plans to issue the RFP in October of this year. So those are the ones that are on the board right now and have really some near-term-related requirements. And most are capacity-related requirements, so -- and again, they're being done pretty much the same way as the others with North Central that we'll certainly do more of a turnkey type of thing, where we take ownership at the time that it's approved in rate, so -- and then of course, we'll go through the process of approvals by the various commissions along the way. 
So -- but that's the plan right now. And then we'll continue to -- as a matter of fact, we're spending a lot of time with our Board focused on the strategies related to these types of filings and the plan long term. And it's important for everyone to understand, this is going to be a continual process, and you're just seeing the first part of these really driven by capacity requirements and not just sort of an energy convenience. So I think they're really good to go out with right now. And that's what we have at this point."

So obviously, we'd like to see much better transmission-related planning across regions. And AEP does a pretty good job itself in terms of transmission planning because we do have a large system to consider. But at the same time, RTO-to-RTO type of planning process to try to make them more consistent. So you can have this large transmission being built across regions and across states. If you're going to get that going, particularly as you're trying to get renewable resources to load centers, we're going to have to resolve these issues around multi-jurisdictional, multi-RTO type of analyses and making sure that we're consistent. 
The other part, too, is we've got to have consistency in terms of ratemaking. And this notion of reevaluating incentives, structures and those types of things is not good for making decisions relative to transmission or -- and it's not good relative to the RTO model itself. So I think FERC really needs to sort of step back and take a look at -- and I think it's a real positive approach to be focusing on the planning aspects and addressing RTO-to-RTO boundaries, addressing areas where what's competitive, what's not competitive, all those types of things, that's fine. But we have to have a clear planning process. And first of all, you can't have coming back later after a project, multimillions have been spent on the project, to say, ""We're going to stop the project."" That has to change. 
And the other part of it is we've got to be able to make these investments with some sense of certainty and be able to move quickly to make that happen. So I just -- I think there's only so much -- there's a lot of value in being in an RTO for customers. But there also has to be value for the companies involved to make the investments that benefit customers in orders of magnitude greater than what the costs are related to any incentives related to transmission. And if you want to send a bad message for anybody to join an RTO or anybody to stay in an RTO, it's just not good to start messing around with what the assumptions are relative to the future recovery of transmission investment. 
And now when you start questioning incentives, you're really questioning anybody that's trying to put a multiyear model together to show the benefits of transmission, has to take that into account that something may change. It's sort of like trying to make an investment in a coal unit with clean energy activities going on in Washington. So you really do have to really think this process through and think about what you're trying to achieve. Sorry, I went on about that one a bit."

So obviously, we have the -- I guess, it's $1.2 trillion, the infrastructure bill that -- it's interesting we talk in trillions as opposed to billions now. But in terms of the hard infrastructure side of things, it appears there's some kind of convergence in Washington on that particular issue, although more has to be done on the actual language and things like that. But as far as pursuing the advancement of certainly transmission investment, but direct pay and those kinds of issues are clearly important along the way, we also have to -- as far as renewables and clean energy, PTCs, ITCs, extensions of those, I think that makes sense, particularly the RSR already did delays because of COVID and that kind of thing. So I think there's opportunities for that. 
And then as far as electric vehicles, certainly we'd like to see electric vehicle infrastructure continue to be developed. So I think all of those areas are positive. The issue is how you leverage into the private companies like ours that instead of the government funding. And for transmission, for example, we think that mechanisms already exist for the development of transmission as long as you keep all the incentives and all that kind of stuff, but -- so federal government funding of that -- now I think, you have to sort of think about what level of encouragement in what area. So if they can make siting much better, if they can make certainly the focus on planning, those issues that enable transmission to get investments, we have no problem financing transmission investments. 
So I think the government probably ought to pick and choose between what they truly want to focus on that's not already leveraged into the utilities, for example. They could certainly encourage the development of electric vehicles with the focus on charging station infrastructure and those types of things, that would be a benefit. And then as far as the renewables transformation or the clean energy transformation, any kind of hard infrastructure around being able to move more quickly from a renewable standpoint, whether tax incentives and also other technologies like storage. And then also we'd like to see benefits related to either tax incentives for coal-fired generation to reduce the undepreciated plant balances, for example. 
If you want to have a national plan around moving to a clean energy economy, then the more quickly we can reduce undepreciated plant balances, the better we're able to make decisions and commissions and states can make decisions about what our future resource replacements would be. So I think there's several ways to really focus on this. But we're all moving toward a clean energy economy. We just need to make sure that the government doesn't try to do too much across the board as opposed to very selected areas that enable investment to continue in the private sector. That would be my view."

So we continue to take account of the good O&M that supports expansion from a customer load perspective but also continue to not only optimize that, but also continue the overall optimization of the O&M budget itself. 
So yes, you may see it. And that's why obviously we're watching what third quarter looks like and fourth quarter what the load does. But we want to make absolutely sure that we're continuing to make progress consistent with that plan of consistent earnings and dividend improvements in that 5% to 7% growth trajectory. So that's what we're doing. We're not just saying, ""Oh, yes, load is going up, let's spend more O&M."" It really is a measured approach from our perspective. Julie?"

As I'm sitting here thinking about this and as we were preparing for the earnings call, one of the things I'm looking at is to Nick's point, you look at where loads coming in. And as I mentioned in a previous answer to a question, we do expect that load on a relative basis. When you compare it to last year for the second half, it would not be as pronounced, although we do expect it to continue to improve. So that's a good thing. And that allows us to be a little more comfortable with O&M costs, where they are, because that does help the customer in the long run. So we keep that top of mind and continue to be very diligent about managing costs. 
But if you're trying to model for the rest of the year, let me start by saying this. We are not changing our guidance. But as you know, once we start the year and we give you that plan, so you see that waterfall that we give to you, how we get to the end of the year obviously changes, right, because it's a dynamic business. So I wouldn't be surprised if relative to that plan, if you saw O&M be running a little richer. But I would hope that load would be hanging in there, too. And then as you know, we're doing well on the Transmission Holdco segment, already kind of clicking along where we thought we would be for the full year. So there may be some benefit there, too. So do keep that in mind when you go back and compare and contrast to that guidance walk that we gave to you. I think it was on February 25 during our earnings call. And then we're happy to help you with any modeling that you have offline."

The strength and diversity of our portfolio, the robustness of our organic growth opportunities and our consistent ability to execute against our plan places AEP among what we believe should be one of the country's premium regulated utilities. 
Our strong performance this quarter, coupled with the level of economic recovery experienced within our footprint provides us once again the confidence needed to raise our midpoint to $4.70 share and near the 2021 guidance range to $4.65 to $4.75 while reaffirming our 5% to 7% long-term earnings growth rate. And as I've stated previously, I would still be disappointed if we were not in that upper half of our long-term growth rate. A driver of our strong performance is the talent and commitment of our employees. Our frontline and essential service work teams have continued to adapt to ensure the needs of our customers and communities are met day in and day out throughout the pandemic. Like many industries, the face of work for AEP will never be the same. As employees return to the office, we have taken actions to ensure the safe return to the workplace environment. I remain appreciative of the dedication of our employees and have the utmost confidence in their continuing ability to successfully check and adjust as we adapt to the future. We believe that this new work environment will continue to enable more efficiency, flexibility and creativity that will contribute to the culture that excels in meeting our strategic objectives. This new future of work, along with digitization and automation will continue to provide benefits for our achieving excellence program. 
Our growth opportunities over the next decade are significant, driven by our future forward renewables plan of over 16 gigawatts of new renewables resources by 2030 and the transmission and distribution investments needed to support the needs of a clean energy economy for our customers and communities. Additionally, the completion of a strategic review of our Kentucky companies and our decision to move forward with the sale to Liberty Utilities enables us to focus our attention on executing that transaction and delivering on our growth strategy. 
So let's cover the announced sale of Kentucky Power. Earlier this week, on Tuesday at market close, we announced the sale of Kentucky Power and Kentucky Transco to Liberty Utilities, the regulated utility operation of Algonquin Power. The sale is a result of the strategic review that we launched back in April. The sale is subject to regulatory approvals approvals from the Fellow Engie Regulatory Commission, which is within 180 days, and the Kentucky Public Service Commission within 120 days. The transaction is also subject to federal clearance pursuant to Hart-Scott-Rodino, which typically is within 30 to 60 days, and the clearance from the committee on foreign investment in the United States within 90 and 120 days for that approval. We anticipate making these regulatory filings in late November and early December. 
Separately, we will file with both the Kentucky, West Virginia and Fort commissions the necessary changes to the Mitchell plant operating agreement to accommodate the ELG investments recently approved by the West Virginia Commission. The filing will include a plan to resolve the question of Mitchel ownership post 2028. Both state commissions are expecting these filings as both issued recent orders directing us to do so. These filings will be made in the mid- to -late November time frame. 
We're also very pleased with the outcome of a strategic review and know that the future owner of our Kentucky assets will be a great steward for all stakeholders in Kentucky, our valued employees, customers and certainly the communities. Lastly I want to thank all the Kentucky employees and the corporate support employees for their patients during this review and for their continued focus on safety and operational excellence during this period and as the transaction is completed. 
Now moving to several of the regulatory activities. In Ohio, we expect an order in the fourth quarter on the settlement reached and filed with the commission earlier this year. As a reminder, the settlement has broad support from the settling parties including the commission staff, the has consumers council, industrial companies, commercial companies and other entities like the Ohio Hospital Association. Additionally, AEP Ohio's Grid Smart Phase III settlement was filed yesterday, and it paves the way to continue our deployment of advanced smart grid technologies, including completion of our AMI meter rollout to the remaining 475,000 rural customers. The unopposed settlement with support from commission staff allows consumers to counsel and several of our largest customers demonstrates that AEP Ohio continues to maintain a great working relationship with our regulator and interested parties. 
Public service company of Oklahoma reached a settlement in the rate case with the Oklahoma staff and other parties. The settlement was presented to the commission on October 5. The black box settlement includes $50.7 million net increase in rates while adding another $102.7 million in base rates. In addition to continuing the practice of allowing some interim recovery of CapEx riders, the rider collecting for Maverick and Sundance North Central wind assets was also included in order is expected by year-end with rates reflected in November bills. 
In Indiana, the filed its base rate case on the July 1 based on a future test year model, seeking $97 million net revenue increase with a 10% ROE. Major items included recognition of over $500 million in capital investment per year in Indiana, continuation of the transmission tracker, a federal tax writer in the event of a change in federal tax rate and the advancement of AMI to provide customers greater control and insight into their usage. The hearing is set before the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission on December 2 with an order expected by April of '22. 
In our Southwestern vector power company jurisdictions, cases are pending in Louisiana, Texas and Arkansas. The SWEPCO Texas Commission deliberation is set for November 18, parties filed exceptions to the preliminary draft order issued by the hearing examiner and replies to those exceptions were filed yesterday. SWEPCO was seeking a net revenue increase of $73 million with an ROE of 10.35%. Our filing includes investments made from February 2018, accelerated depreciation for the Dollar Hills plant, a storm reserve and increased vegetation management. We expect an order in the fourth quarter with rates being retroactive back to March of '21. In SWEPCO Louisiana, testimony has been filed and hearing is scheduled for January of '22. Our case 6 of $73 million net revenue increase and a 10.35% ROE, in orders expected between the second and third quarter of '22. 
In SWEPCO Arkansas, we are seeking a $56 million net revenue increase with a 10.35% ROE. The filing contains a formula rate plan for subsequent years and consider the pending etonously announced cold lignite assets. This filing is time to align with the North Central in-service dates and the provided mechanism, both for recovery of costs associated with the investment and flow through the PTC of SWEPCO customers. The hearing is set for March '22. Both SWEPCO and PSO continue to make progress to recognize the storm Uri expenditures. As a reminder, we filed for recovery of a WAC return over 5 years in Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas. PSO is moving forward with the state on the securitization of costs as premier under Oklahoma law. We have continued our efforts to secure approvals and clarity regarding investments necessary to comply with the EPA CCR and ELG requirements. We received certificates to construct the CCR compliance plans in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky, while West Virginia approved LG investments, Virginia and Kentucky did not. West Virginia has since determined it was in the public interest to move forward with ELG investments for all 3 plants and has issued order regarding its support of West Virginia investing to preserve the option for these these plants to run past 2028, approving both the investment and cost recovery from West Virginia customers. 
We'll be working with our commissions to implement the West Virginia decision and making necessary adjustments to respect each state's decision. The Virginia Commission asked us to come back with more information. So we'll do that. We plan to lay out all the options before them on how to satisfy their capacity needs. The Virginia PSC approved the first year revenue requirement of $4.8 million for broadband, which means we now have recovery for our rural broadband efforts in both rural Virginia and West Virginia. We continue to engage legislators and commissions in other states and stand ready to invest in synergistic mid-mile broadband to support advanced grid technologies and rural broadband for our communities. We also understand all that execution. 
On September 10, AEP began commercial operation of a 287-megawatt Maverick Wind Energy Center in North Central Oklahoma. Maverick is 1 of 3 wind projects that compose the North Central energy facilities, which will provide 1485 megawatts of clean energy to customers of our PSO and SWEPCO subsidiaries. The reverse project, the largest single-site wind farm in North America is well under construction and will come online in the January to April 2022 time frame. Transforming the way energy is generated, delivered and consumed as necessary to the needs of a clean energy economy, and AEP continues to drive that transformation for the benefit of our customers and communities. 
With the success of Doris Central setting the foundation of our future board regulated renewables platform, we are diligently working on securing additional renewable opportunities for our customers. Our filings are going are ongoing and planned in multiple states. So more to come on this as we file for approval after resources as a result of the RFPs that were out in the market for which some of you probably have heard of, we will be able to provide greater detail on the progress being made. Further federal efforts through the various tax proposals to extend and expand PTCs and ITCs for clean energy resources succeed, even more benefits will be enjoyed by our customers. 
So now I'll move quickly to the equalizer chart at this point, and I'll go quickly through this. So far, the average for the overall regulated operations is currently 9%. And generally target in the 9.5% to 10% range. So obviously, we continue to work on that. AEP Ohio came in at 9.3% for the third quarter and was below authorized primarily due to timely recovery of capital investments, partially offset by higher O&M expenses. We expect that ROE to trend around authorized levels as we maintain concurrent capital recovery of distribution and transmission investments. We also, as I mentioned earlier, expect the commission order here in the fourth quarter of '21. APCo came in at 7.3%, it's below authorized due to higher amortization primarily related to retired coal-fired generating assets and higher depreciation from increased Virginia depreciation rates and capital investments. And as you know, we are still at the appeals court appealing the Virginia Supreme Court, which is currently outstanding. We filed an appeal with that being a Supreme Court. So we're still waiting on that. 
As far as Kentucky is concerned, 6.9% below authorized due to loss of load from weak economic conditions and loss of major customers. Transmission revenues were also lower due to a delay in some capital projects. I&M came in at 10.3%. It's befits authorized ROE primarily due to increase in sales, partially offset by increased O&M and depreciation expenses associated with I&M's continued capital investment programs. As far as PSO is concerned, it came in at 7.6%. It's below its authorized level, primarily due to increased capital investment currently not in base rates and higher-than-anticipated equity due to the extreme February winter weather event. And of course, we expect a commission order here on the rate case in the fourth quarter of 2021.
SWEPCO came in at 8.2%. It's below authorized due to increased capital investment currently not in base rates and the continued impact of the Arkansas here Turk plant that is not in retail rates. Turk issue again, accounts for about 110 basis points that we're not recovering in Arkansas. Again, as I mentioned earlier, we expect various commission orders and particularly in Texas in the fourth quarter of 2021 that's retroactive back to March. AP Texas came in at 8.2%. It's below authorized primarily due to the significant level of investment in Texas. Of course, we have favorable regulatory treatment there with annual DCRF and biannual TCOS filings to recover rates. So significant levels of investment in Texas will continue to impact the ROE. But the expectation is for the ROE to trend towards an authorized 9.4% in the longer term. AEP Transmission Holdco came in at 11.2%. It was a bet of rise primarily driven by differences between actual and forecasted expenses, the Transcos benefit from a forward-looking formula rate mechanism, which helps minimize regulatory lag and that forecasted ROE is around 11% in 2021. So overall, continue to make progress. cases, obviously, we're waiting to hear the results of several cases that should provide some additional benefits, but that work continues. 
So in closing, we're executing on all cylinders and continue to drive the results expected of a premium regulated utility. The AP portfolio is 1 that has enabled our investments in the wire side of the business, supporting our transmission investments including the $0.33 per share this quarter through our AP transmission holdco investments. Our plan to transition our generation fleet and reduce carbon emissions by 80% by 2030 and net 0 by 2050 is well underway with 2 of our 3 wind facilities of our $2 billion investment in North Central wind under our belt, providing a solid foundation for the next decade of growth. Throughout this transition, we remain engaged in a trusted voice on energy transformation efforts, helping to ensure a responsible transition to a clean energy economy, and we'll continue to support federal efforts in that regard and state efforts as well. 
Finally, our strong quarter performance gives us the confidence again to set our midpoint at $4.70 with a range of $4.65 to $4.75, and we continue to have all 17,000 employees dedicated to our customers and communities to enable this strong performance. Our discipline in controlling costs, our progress to manage the portfolio and the significance of our future organic growth opportunities provides us with the confidence needed in raising the midpoint and nearing the guidance range. Two weeks ago, I was really struck by the halftime performance of the Ohio State Buckeyes marching ban. They set their goals, in my opinion, really, really high. Never did I expect to see a marching band dedicate their halftime show to the music of rush. To hear Tom Sauer, aiZe, limit and others was truly amazing when they are difficult even play even though they were also marching in guitar players, drums and other choreography on the field, the creativity and the execution came through to deliver a truly remarkable show. They maybe think of our team at AEP. On November 11, I've been AP's CEO for 10 years, and fortunate to lead a great company with great people who have an outstanding track record of delivering on the promises made to investors and customers consistently year in and year out. and we fully expect to continue our drive to take this company to the next level toward a clean energy economy and a solid infrastructure foundation by setting aggressive goals and delivering with creativity and solid execution. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Julie."

A big game this weekend. Anyway, it's good to be with everybody. This morning, I'm going to walk us through the third quarter and year-to-date financial results, share some updates on our service territory load and finish with some commentary on financing plans, credit metrics and liquidity. 
Let's go to Slide 6, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter and year-to-date periods. GAAP earnings for the third quarter were $1.59 per share compared to $1.51 share in 2020. GAAP earnings through September were $3.90 per share compared to $3.56 per share in 2020. There's a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on Pages 14 and 15 of the presentation today. 
Let's go to Slide 7, where we can talk about our quarterly operating earnings performance by segment. Operating earnings for the third quarter totaled $1.43 per share or $717 million compared to $1.47 per share or $728 million in 2020. Operating earnings from the vertically integrated utilities were $0.87 per share, up $0.02. Favorable drivers included rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, whether primarily in the west, transmission revenue and lower income tax. These items were offset somewhat by higher O&M expenses due in part to lower prior year O&M, which included actions we took to adjust to the pandemic and higher depreciation expense as well as lower normalized margins and lower AFUDC. 
The Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.31 per share, flat to last year. Favorable drivers in this segment included rate changes, transmission revenue and income taxes, offsetting these favorable items were O&M expenses, again, a function of lower prior year O&M associated with pandemic grown efforts, depreciation and property taxes. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment continued to grow, contributing $0.33 per share that was an improvement of $0.05, driven by the return on investment growth. Generation and Marketing produced $0.04 per share, down $0.09 from last year, includes by the prior year land sales, lower retail volumes and margins, generation and income taxes. Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.02 per share, driven by lower investment gains and unfavorable net interest expense. This was partially offset by lower income taxes. The lower investment gains are related to a pullback of some of the charge point related gains we've talked about in prior quarters. Let's have a look at our year-to-date results on Slide #8. Operating earnings through September totaled $3.76 per share or $1.9 billion compared to $3.56 per share or $1.8 billion in 2020. 
Looking at the drivers by segment. Operating earnings for vertically integrated utilities were $1.87 per share, down $0.03 due to higher O&M and depreciation expenses. Other smaller decreases included lower normalized sales and wholesale load, higher other taxes and a prior period fuel adjustment. Offsetting these unfavorable variances were rate changes across various operating companies and the impact of weather due to warmer-than-normal temps in the winter of 2020 and the summer 2021, which created a favorable year-over-year comp for us. Other favorable items in this segment included higher off-system sales, transmission revenue, net interest expense and income taxes. The Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.85 per share, up $0.01 from last year. Earnings in this segment were up due to higher transmission revenue, rate changes, weather normalized load and income taxes. Partially offsetting these favorable items were increased depreciation, O&M, other taxes and interest expenses. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $1.02 per share, up $0.27 from last year related to investment growth and favorable year-over-year true-up. Generation and Marketing produced $0.20 per share, down $0.11 from last year due to favorable onetime items in the prior year relating to an OkoUnion ARO adjustment in the sale of Konevill and reduced land sales in 2021. Higher energy margins and lower expenses in the generation business offset the unfavorable ERCOT market prices on the wholesale business during storm Uri in in February. We also saw an unfavorable result in retail due to lower power and gas margins. Income taxes were also unfavorable. 
Finally, Corporate and Other was up $0.06 per share driven by investment gains and lower taxes and partially offset by higher O&M. Let me take a quick minute here to talk about the investment gain, which is predominantly a function of our direct and indirect investment charge point. As you'll see on the waterfall, this produced a $0.06 benefit year-to-date in 2021 as compared to the corresponding 2020 period. You may recall that in the fourth quarter and full year 2020, this investment produced $0.05 contribution, and we would expect the year-over-year badge to be more pronounced at this point in 2021 as we have no benefit during the same period in 2020. 
Turning to Page 9. I'll update you on our normalized load performance for the quarter. We get into the specifics, let me start by reminding everyone that everything you see on this slide is showing year-over-year growth. That means these numbers can be influenced by what was going on last year or what is happening now in 2021. Given all that occurred in the economy last year, it's obvious that these growth rates are at least partially being influenced by the comparison basis. This leads to the natural follow-up question like how does today's load compared to pre-pandemic level? And I'll get to that question on the next slide. But before I do, let's take a look at what our normalized load growth was for the quarter. Starting in the upper left corner, normalized residential sales were down 1.6% compared to last year, bringing the year-to-date decline down to [ 9/10th of a percent ]. You noticed that last year, residential sales were up 3.8% in the third quarter when the economy was just starting reopen. One year later, they are down only 1.6%, which suggests there's been a shift up in residential sales as more businesses have embraced a remote workforce for jobs that can be performed at home. 
The last item to point out on the residential chart is that you'll notice that we added a new bar to the right showing our latest projection for 2021 based on the load forecast update. The original guidance assumed residential sales would decrease by 1.1% in 2021. The latest update shows an improvement as we now expect residential to end the year down [ 9/10th of a percent]. Moving right Weather normalized commercial sales increased by 5%, bringing the year-to-date growth up to 4.3%. Last year's third quarter commercial sales were down 4.6%. So again, we're seeing a net positive story as the commercial sales class is bouncing back faster than expected. And while we're seeing a strong bounce back in the sectors most impacted by the pandemic, such as schools, churches and hotels, we're actually seeing the strongest growth commercial sales this year from growth in data centers, especially in Central Ohio. 
To give you some perspective, last year, the sector was the ninth largest commercial sector across the AP system. Today, it's the 6th largest and will likely move further up in the rankings as more data center loads are expected to come in online over the next several years. You also notice that our latest load forecast update now suggests that commercial sales will end the year up 3.7% and as opposed to the 0.5% decline assumed in the original guidance forecast. The economy has recovered much faster than the originally assumed, which is 1 of the reasons why we've updated the forecast and showing you an improvement in that regard. 
In the lower left corner, you'll see that industrial sales also had a very strong quarter. Industrial sales for the quarter increased by 7%, bringing the year-to-date up to 4.2%. Industrial sales were up at every operating company in nearly every sector. I'll point out, however, that the 7% growth in the third quarter this year did not quite offset the 7.8% decline experienced last year, which means we still have a little more room to grow before the industrial class fully recovers from the pandemic recession. The good news is we have a lot of momentum to work with. You'll notice that the latest node update now projects industrial sales will end the year up 4.3%, which is 2.4% h higher than assumed in the original guidance forecast. 
Finally, when you put it all together in the lower right corner, you'll see that normalized retail sales increased by 3% for the quarter and were up 2.3% for the first 9 months. All indications the recovery from the pandemic and recession is happening faster than expected in our service territory is positioned to benefit from future economic growth. You'll recall that the original guidance forecast assume normalized low growth of [ 0.2% ] in 2021. Based on our latest update, we're now expecting to end the year up 2.2%, which is a supportive factor in narrowing our earnings guidance range and raising the midpoint for 2021. 
Turning to Slide 10. I want to answer the question from earlier to ask how our current low performance compares to pretend pre-pandemic levels. This bar chart is designed to answer that question. The blue bars are the same year-to-date bars that we shared on the prior page. As a reminder, these represent growth versus 2020, which was influenced by the restrictions implemented to manage the public health crisis. The lounge bars here show how the year-to-date sales in 2021 compared to 2019, which was the most recent pre-pandemic year for comparison. These bars tell us how close we are to a full recovery from the pandemic. Starting at the left, you'll notice that our reported residential sales are down [ 9/10th of a percent ] compared to last year, but they're actually up 1.6% compared to our pre-pandemic levels. This is a gauge for how our customers' behaviors have changed since the pandemic with more people working from home. 
The next bar shows that while commercial sales are up 4.3% compared to last year, they are still [ 8/10th of a percent ] below the pre-pandemic levels. Given the recent growth we're seeing, especially in the data center loads, we would expect commercial sales -- the commercial sales class to fully recover very soon. Moving further right, I noticed that while the industrial sales are up 4.2% compared to last year, they are still 3% lower than pre-pandemic levels. Due to some of the headwinds for manufacturing today with supply chain disruptions, later shortages, et cetera. It may take a little longer before the industrial class fully recovers from the pandemic recession, but we do expect to eclipse the prepandemic levels in 2022. 
In total, our normalized load is up 2.3% compared to last year and is now within [ 7/10th of a percent ] of being fully recovered from the pandemic. So it's safe to say that we're pleased with the strength and balance of this recovery in the AEP system. 
Let's check on the company's capitalization and liquidity on Page 11. On a GAAP basis, our debt-to-capital ratio decreased 0.4% from the prior quarter 62.2%. When adjusted for the storm Uri event, the ratio is slightly lower than it was at year-end 2022 -- or sorry, 2020 and now stands at 61.5%. Let's talk about our FFO to debt metric. As in the first and second quarter, the effect of storm Uri continues to have a temporary and noticeable impact on this 2021 metric. Taking a look at the upper right quadrant on this page, you'll see our FFO to debt metric based on traditional Moody's and GAAP calculated basis as well as on an adjusted Moody's and GAAP calculated basis. 
On a traditional unadjusted basis, our FFO to debt ratio increased by 0.9% during the quarter to 10.2% on a Moody's basis. And just again, reiterating rating agencies continue to take the anticipated recovery into consideration as it relates to our credit ratings. So very important to note that. On an adjusted basis, the Moody's FFO to debt metric is 13.6%. This figure removes or adjust the calculation to eliminate the impact of approximately $1.2 billion of cash outflows associated with covering unplanned [indiscernible] driven fuel and purchase power in the SPP region directly impacting PSO and SWEPCO in particular. The metric is also adjusted to remove the effect of the associated debt we used to fund the unplanned payments. This should give you a sense of where we would be from a business as usual perspective with that 13.6%. 
Importantly, as Nick mentioned, the recovery of the unit-driven fuel and purchase power expense in the PSO as SWEPCO jurisdictions is well underway, and we're making progress. As a result, and consistent with what we have previously communicated, we still anticipate our cash flow metrics to return low to mid-teens target range next year. Obviously, we're trying to push towards the mid-teens range, but that will take us a little while longer, but we're definitely on our way there. And as you know, we'll keep you posted on our progress. 
Before we leave the balance sheet topic, I do want to make note of the intended change to our 2022 financing plan in light of our announced sale of Cutty Power and Kentucky Transco. You may recall that we had planned to issue $1.4 billion of equity in 2022. That's inclusive of our $100 million dividend reinvestment plan to fund our growth CapEx program. While we will provide our typical 3-year forward annual review of our cash flows and financial metrics at the upcoming EEI conference, what we can expect to see that the 2022 forecast will be adjusted to eliminate the previous deployment $1.4 billion of equity financing that I just mentioned with any residual proceeds being used to reduce a small portion of the 2022 debt financing that we had planned. These actions will have no impact on our previously stated credit metric targets or messaging in regard. 
In the slide deck today on Page 39, you'll see our current cash flow forecast with which you're already familiar. We've included a note on the slide to reflect the fact that the numbers have not been updated for the announced Kentucky transaction, along with the around the 2022 financing, equity financing amount that will be changed and updated when we roll out the new view in a couple of weeks in conjunction with the EEI conference. So while we're talking about the Kentucky transaction, I can also share that we expect that the sale will be $0.01 to $0.02 accretive in 2022, and we'll reflect this in our 2022 earnings guidance that we provided to you at the EEI conference. 
Okay. So back to our regular scheduled earnings call programming and commentary. Let's take a quick moment to visit our liquidity summary on the lower right side of Slide 11. Our 5-year $4 billion bank revolver and 2-year $1 billion revolving credit facility, along with proceeds from a quarter-end debt issuance to support our liquidity position, which remains really strong at $5.1 billion. If you look at the lower left side of the page, you'll see that our qualified pension continues to be well funded at 104%. Additionally, our OPEB is funded at 173.9%. Let's go to Slide 12, and I'll do a quick wrap up and we can get to your questions. Our performance through the first 3 quarters of this year give us confidence to narrow our operating guidance to the upper half of our current range, resulting in a new range of $4.65 per share to $4.75 per share midpoint of $4.70 per share. As we've stated, we are committed to our long-term growth rate target of 5% to 7%. 
Today's 2021 earnings guidance revision is yet another demonstration of our drive to deliver performance in the upper half of our guidance range. From a strategic perspective, we are making significant progress in addressing items that are top of mind for our current and prospective investors are now in contract to sell Kentucky Power and Kentucky Transco, which we expect to complete in the second quarter of 2022. This transaction enables us to avoid the $1.4 billion equity issuance that was part of our original forecast. We had shared with you for 2022 and therefore, alleviates the overhang, the equity overhang and also allows us to deliver a action that we estimate to be $0.01 to $0.02 accretive in 2022. Furthermore, we're able to do this while concurrently preserving our ability to get our FFO to debt metrics comfortably into that mid- to low teens range by 2022, which is commensurate with a Moody's BAA2 stable rating. As you know, we continue to target that. The intention is to remain in this credit metric range, again, with the preference to try to get closer to that midpoint as we move along in time. All of this positions us to continue our generation transformation, which is underpinned by the renewable investment opportunity we've shared with you and complemented by our ongoing energy delivery investment. So here's what you can expect to see from us at the upcoming EEI conference in early November. 
In addition to the updated 3-year forward cash flow and financing plan, we'll be introducing and sharing the details behind our 2022 earnings guidance and our longer-term capital plan, we typically go out 5 years, all of which will incorporate the effects of the announced Kentucky sales. So with that, sure, we do appreciate your time and attention. And I'm going to turn it over to the operator so we can get to your questions."

And then we'll continue working with the West Virginia and Tucky commission to get resolved the operating agreement related issues. And then, of course, at the end of 2028, it transfers over it at a fair market value type of approach. So that's the plan. 
And I get filed here in November and December time frame, and we'll go through that. And actually, both commissions have have the incentive to get this resolved because we do have various views of the ELG piece of it. So regardless of whether we had this transaction or not, we would be needing to file for the operating agreement change out just because of the different directions of the commissions have gone. So we'll get that resolved as part and parcel to the overall approvals."

I mean, I've said over and over, I guess, for a couple of years now, but even beyond that, we do have to get to portfolio management to enable us to look at the sources and uses of the [indiscernible] needs that we have and to manage the balance sheet as Julie has mentioned. We target the mid-teens, and we want to get there. And obviously, we're well on our way of getting there. So we want to do that. But at the same time, be able to fund the capital growth. And when you think about it, we've sold the unregulated generation. We sold River Ops, we sold some hydro-related facilities and with Kentucky. You're talking about $6 billion of assets that have been sold, but they fueled substantial growth, I mean, to the tune of $7 billion a year in capital. So it's part of the process to determine what the portfolio needs to be in the future, and we'll continue to do that. Certainly, we have Chuck and Julie and others, we'll continue to review that portfolio and we'll manage it in a proper way. I think -- and I'll say this, Kentucky Power, you think about the threshold, at 1 point, we talked about, we always invested in coal no matter what. And obviously, we've changed that focus to make sure it's more deliberative in terms of the decision points that were made, it's quite a a move for AEP to get to a point where we're managing our portfolio in a way that, first of all, we became fully regulated. And then we start to look at that portfolio to determine, okay, what's the best approach to fuel $20 billion in potential renewables investment. So when you think about that, we have to consider it. 
And I can tell you, I mean, the last time we sold a regulated utility was, I guess, the Scranton, Pennsylvania system in the Pennsylvania. I mean, in Pennsylvania and the New Jersey system back in the like 1940s and '50s. So it's a pretty substantial change. And when you think about Kentucky Power itself, it was 1 of the first acquisitions of American Gas & Electric in 1922. So by the time we get through this, it's been 100 years. So when you think about the threshold level of portfolio management that has occurred in this company, it really should shine a lot in terms of our seriousness of making sure that we're managing that portfolio in a proper way. Probably a longer answer than what you asked for, but I wanted to at least get all that out there."

So we get the cash flow to support those investments at the time they come online. And that means, obviously, our AFFO yet doesn't suffer as a result of that. So if we continue that approach. And keep in mind too, I've always said that for us to take a look at a regulated entity or other parts of our portfolio doesn't match the future needs in terms of where we are and where we're going as a company is there -- if we have a chronically underperforming part of the portfolio, then it's important for us to take a look at. 
Now that may be temporary, it could be long term. But certainly, we have to make sure that we're evaluating each 1 of these assets in a way that says, okay, it doesn't matter where it's located as long as we're getting certainly the return expectation and also the forward view of the utility is positive, and that's comparative with others.

But also the administration has a focus on clean energy, and it will have an effect on the renewables transformation that's existing as well. So I think put a pall over all the utilities' ability to continue investing capital in the way that we are. 
Now if we do do that, then obviously, there's customer impacts associated with it. And again, it's sort of a hidden tax on our customers. So we're for it. We're not for that provision. I think actually, we've been very forthright about this and trying to be an honest broker when we were talking about CEPP and all the other things that it was important for us to be able to make this transformation from a clean energy standpoint. And certainly, the PTCs, ITCs, with expansion of long-term storage nuclear and -- but certainly in terms of wind and solar are very important to continue this process to move to a clean energy economy, and we can get a long way there this industry is very focused on doing that.

And then the other thing that we think through just to take it a step further is if we avoid issuing equity, we avoid having to cover off additional dividends that were in our original plan. So I'm able to sidestep that as well. And that comes with maybe also having some additional dollars to reduce debt at the part, as I mentioned in my opening comments, anything above and beyond that $1.4 billion will channel toward debt reduction that was otherwise planned for 2022. 
And then also keep in mind that Kentucky Power had very strained FFO to debt to begin with. So to eliminate that piece of, I guess, drag to the overall average FFO to debt for the organization is also a net positive for us. So we're able to be able to put these numbers together. And quite frankly, from an FFO to debt perspective, it is very mildly then official. And obviously, a little bit of a cost on the debt to cap because we're not issuing additional equity, but the numbers all do hang together and coincidentally, we're able to take literally that $1.4 billion of planned equity out of the plan.

The impact to customer rates varies significantly from 1 operating company to the next, depending on the fuel mix. So for example, if I looked at Appalachian Power Company, the average residential impact price and in terms of a 10% hike in gas prices would equate to about a 0.9% increase in the customers' rate. Let's compare and contrast that to, say, PSO or SWEPCO, where there's much more gas concentration. So PSO, we'd be talking about 1.6% increase in customer rates, SWEPCO 1.5%.

Rough here for your BayBingles this year. A lot of change. Got a couple of questions for you. With the Kentucky sale and you guys have -- your Slide #5, I think it is over the years, has done a good job of detailing how hard it's been on authorized in Kentucky. Now that Kentucky will be kind of off your plate when you look at the other jurisdictions, what are the ones where you say, hey, we still struggle to unauthorized here? And what are the structural changes, whether it's legislation, and we've seen lots of utilities in places like North Carolina, Kansas, Missouri, go in and make structural changes via legislation. What are the structural changes you're going to see outside normal rate case filings that could help improve authorized versus owned returns in those jurisdictions?"

We've made a lot of progress on riders, and we have a lot of on getting concurrent recovery and cash in the door. And what you're seeing really in terms of a lot of these lags is the amount of investment that we're placing in these companies. But as well, as you make the transition from -- certainly from wires-related activities with riders and then the renewables conversion that occurs. The way we're doing the renewables is commensurate with the recovery. So we should see the authorized, our returns be closer to the authorized as time goes forward. We don't see any fundamental issues in any of the jurisdictions that are left that says that we have significant headwinds. I mean the only thing you could probably point to is the Turk issue at SWEPCO. But other than that, -- and actually, when you think about Arkansas, and we keep saying we're not recovering the Arkansas portion of Turk that's not because of the cushion. That is because of the Supreme Court of Arkansas. So we've got very good relations with the commissions in all the jurisdictions. And we feel like the fundamentals are there for continued improvement relative to that to that regulatory lag that exists and because we're spending on more areas and our generation is really renewables and that's helping out every time we put an investment in and the timing of the investment improves FFO to debt improves the returns of the individual companies, and I think we'll continue to make progress in that regard. 
So I would be -- I'm pretty optimistic that we'll continue to make progress in all of these jurisdictions."

And so Michael, we always -- as Nick mentioned, we strive to be in the upper half of the guidance range, not necessarily the upper end, although that would be very nice. So just a point of clarification there. And as it relates to returns, as you can see, we've kind of been hovering around the 9% ROE return level. I think that's a safe place for you to assume that will kind of hang out there for a while until we get a little more traction. Another thing, if I could, circling back to your original question, when you look at the equalizer chart, oftentimes, we get questions around AEP Texas and why the lower ROE relative to authorize there? And so back to your question around growth and how do you manage the business. AEP Texas, we continue to invest significant amount of capital on an annualized basis. And while we have very progressive rate recovery mechanisms in place that we really enjoy, I can tell you this, while the ROE may look at touch depressed relative to authorized that company continues to produce earnings growth in, say, the 8% to 10% range. So that certifies our ability to -- back to your original point, get in that upper half of the range. So again, ROE, a system-wide average assume roughly around 9%-ish and trending upward over time. And then around AEP Texas, keep in mind the capital is intentional there as we continue to try to take care of the customer and grow that business, and it's paying dividends in sense we're getting 8% to 10% EPS growth out of it."

Welcome again, everyone, to American Electric Power's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Today, we are pleased to report a strong third quarter operating earnings of $1.43 per share for the third quarter. This brings our year-to-date operating earnings to $3.76 per share versus $3.56 per share last year, which gives us confidence in raising the midpoint of our guidance range for 2021. AEP service territory continues to prove its resiliency and stability with continued economic recovery experienced in the third quarter. In fact, AEP posted its strongest sales quarter in over a decade and the gross regional product for the AEP footprint in the third quarter was the highest on record as well as job growth being the strongest since 1984. 
The strength and diversity of our portfolio, the robustness of our organic growth opportunities and our consistent ability to execute against our plan places AEP among what we believe should be one of the country's premium regulated utilities. Our strong performance this quarter, coupled with the level of economic recovery experienced within our footprint provides us once again the confidence needed to raise our midpoint to $4.70 share and near the 2021 guidance range to $4.65 to $4.75 while reaffirming our 5% to 7% long-term earnings growth rate. And as I've stated previously, I would still be disappointed if we were not in that upper half of our long-term growth rate. 
A driver of our strong performance is the talent and commitment of our employees. Our frontline and essential service work teams have continued to adapt to ensure the needs of our customers and communities are met day in and day out throughout the pandemic. Like many industries, the face of work for AEP will never be the same. As employees return to the office, we have taken actions to ensure the safe return to the workplace environment. I remain appreciative of the dedication of our employees and have the utmost confidence in their continuing ability to successfully check and adjust as we adapt to the future. We believe that this new work environment will continue to enable more efficiency, flexibility and creativity that will contribute to the culture that excels in meeting our strategic objectives. This new future of work, along with digitization and automation will continue to provide benefits for our Achieving Excellence Program. 
Our growth opportunities over the next decade are significant, driven by our future forward renewables plan of over 16 gigawatts of new renewables resources by 2030 and the transmission and distribution investments needed to support the needs of a clean energy economy for our customers and communities. Additionally, the completion of a strategic review of our Kentucky companies and our decision to move forward with the sale to Liberty Utilities enables us to focus our attention on executing that transaction and delivering on our growth strategy. 
So let's cover the announced sale of Kentucky Power. Earlier this week, on Tuesday at market close, we announced the sale of Kentucky Power and Kentucky Transco to Liberty Utilities, the regulated utility operation of Algonquin Power. The sale is a result of the strategic review that we launched back in April. The sale is subject to regulatory approvals including approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which is within 180 days, and the Kentucky Public Service Commission within 120 days. The transaction is also subject to federal clearance pursuant to Hart-Scott-Rodino, which typically is within 30 to 60 days, and the clearance from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States within 90 and 120 days for that approval. We anticipate making these regulatory filings in late November and early December. 
Separately, we will file with both the Kentucky, West Virginia Hanford commissions with necessary changes to the Mitchell plant operating agreement to accommodate the ELG investments recently approved by the West Virginia Commission. The filing will include a plan to resolve the question of Mitchell ownership post 2028. Both state commissions are expecting these filings as both issued recent orders directing us to do so. These filings will be made in the mid- to late November time frame. 
We're also very pleased with the outcome of a strategic review and know that the future owner of our Kentucky assets will be a great steward for all stakeholders in Kentucky, our valued employees, customers and certainly the communities. Lastly, I want to thank all the Kentucky employees and the corporate support employees for their patients during this review and for their continued focus on safety and operational excellence during this period and as the transaction is completed. 
Now moving to several of the regulatory activities. In Ohio, we expect an order in the fourth quarter on the settlement reached and filed with the commission earlier this year. As a reminder, the settlement has broad support from the settling parties including the commission staff, the Ohio Consumers' Counsel, industrial companies, commercial companies and other entities like the Ohio Hospital Association. Additionally, AEP Ohio's Grid Smart Phase III settlement was filed yesterday, and it paves the way to continue our deployment of advanced smart grid technologies, including completion of our AMI meter rollout to the remaining 475,000 rural customers. The unopposed settlement with support from commission staff allows consumers counsel and several of our largest customers demonstrates that AEP Ohio continues to maintain a great working relationship with our regulator and interested parties.
Public Service Company of Oklahoma reached a settlement in the rate case with the Oklahoma staff and other parties. The settlement was presented to the commission on October 5. The black box settlement includes $50.7 million net increase in rates while adding another $102.7 million in base rates. In addition to continuing the practice of allowing some interim recovery of CapEx riders, the rider collecting for Maverick and Sundance North Central wind assets was also included. An order is expected by year-end with rates reflected in November bills. 
In Indiana, I&M filed its base rate case on the July 1 based on a future test year model, seeking $97 million net revenue increase with a 10% ROE. Major items included recognition of over $500 million in capital investment per year in Indiana, continuation of the transmission tracker, a federal tax rider in the event of a change in federal tax rate and the advancement of AMI to provide customers greater control and insight into their usage. The hearing is set before the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission on December 2 with an order expected by April of '22. 
In our Southwestern Electric Power Company jurisdictions, cases are pending in Louisiana, Texas and Arkansas. The SWEPCO Texas Commission deliberation is set for November 18, parties filed exceptions to the preliminary draft order issued by the hearing examiner and replies to those exceptions were filed yesterday. SWEPCO was seeking a net revenue increase of $73 million with an ROE of 10.35%. Our filing includes investments made from February 2018, accelerated depreciation for the Dolet Hills plant, a storm reserve and increased vegetation management. We expect an order in the fourth quarter with rates being retroactive back to March of '21. 
In SWEPCO Louisiana, testimony has been filed and hearing is scheduled for January of '22. Our case seeks a $73 million net revenue increase and a 10.35% ROE. An order is expected between the second and third quarter of '22. In SWEPCO Arkansas, we are seeking a $56 million net revenue increase with a 10.35% ROE. The filing contains a formula rate plan for subsequent years and considers the pending retirement of previously announced cold lignite assets. This filing is timed to align with the North Central in-service dates and the provided mechanism, both for recovery of costs associated with the investment and flow through the PTC of SWEPCO customers. The hearing is set for March '22. 
Both SWEPCO and PSO continue to make progress to recognize the storm Uri expenditures. As a reminder, we filed for recovery of a WACC return over 5 years in Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas. PSO is moving forward with the state on the securitization of costs as permitted under Oklahoma law. We have continued our efforts to secure approvals and clarity regarding investments necessary to comply with the EPA CCR and ELG requirements. We received certificates to construct the CCR compliance plants in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky, while West Virginia approved ELG investments, Virginia and Kentucky did not. West Virginia has since determined it was in the public interest to move forward with ELG investments for all 3 plants and has issued an order regarding its support of West Virginia investing to preserve the option for these plants to run past 2028, approving both the investment and cost recovery from West Virginia customers. 
We'll be working with our commissions to implement the West Virginia decision and making necessary adjustments to respect each state's decision. The Virginia Commission asked us to come back with more information. So we'll do that. We plan to lay out all the options before them on how to satisfy their capacity needs. The Virginia PSC approved the first year revenue requirement of $4.8 million for broadband, which means we now have recovery for our rural broadband efforts in both rural Virginia and West Virginia. We continue to engage legislators and commissions in other states and stand ready to invest in synergistic mid-mile broadband to support advanced grid technologies and rural broadband for our communities. We also understand all that execution. 
On September 10, AEP began commercial operation of a 287-megawatt Maverick Wind Energy Center in North Central Oklahoma. Maverick is one of 3 wind projects that compose the North Central energy facilities, which will provide 1,485 megawatts of clean energy to customers of our PSO and SWEPCO subsidiaries. The Traverse project, the largest single-site wind farm in North America is well under construction and will come online in the January to April 2022 time frame, transforming the way energy is generated, delivered and consumed as necessary to support the needs of a clean energy economy, and AEP continues to drive that transformation for the benefit of our customers and communities. 
With the success of North Central setting the foundation of our future forward regulated renewables platform, we are diligently working on securing additional renewable opportunities for our customers. Our fee filings are going -- are ongoing and planned in multiple states. So more to come on this as we file for approval after resources as a result of the RFPs that were out in the market for which some of you probably have heard of, we will be able to provide greater detail on the progress being made. Further federal efforts through the various tax proposals to extend and expand PTCs and ITCs for clean energy resources succeed, even more benefits will be enjoyed by our customers. 
So now I'll move quickly to the equalizer chart at this point, and I'll go quickly through this. So far, the average for the overall regulated operations is currently 9%. We generally target in the 9.5% to 10% range. So obviously, we continue to work on that. AEP Ohio came in at 9.3% for the third quarter and was below authorized primarily due to timely recovery of capital investments, partially offset by higher O&M expenses. We expect that ROE to trend around authorized levels as we maintain concurrent capital recovery of distribution and transmission investments. We also, as I mentioned earlier, expect the commission order here in the fourth quarter of '21. APCo came in at 7.3%, it's below authorized due to higher amortization primarily related to retired coal-fired generating assets and higher depreciation from increased Virginia depreciation rates and capital investments. And as you know, we are still at the appeals court appealing the Virginia Supreme Court, which is currently outstanding. We filed an appeal with Virginia Supreme Court. So we're still waiting on that. 
As far as Kentucky is concerned, 6.9%, below authorized due to loss of load from weak economic conditions and loss of major customers. Transmission revenues were also lower due to a delay in some capital projects. I&M came in at 10.3%. It's above its authorized ROE primarily due to increase in sales, partially offset by increased O&M and depreciation expenses associated with I&M's continued capital investment programs. As far as PSO is concerned, it came in at 7.6%. It's below its authorized level, primarily due to increased capital investment currently not in base rates and higher-than-anticipated equity due to the extreme February winter weather event. And of course, we expect a commission order here on the rate case in the fourth quarter of 2021. 
SWEPCO came in at 8.2%. It's below authorized due to increased capital investment currently not in base rates and the continued impact of the Arkansas share of the Turk Plant that is not in retail rates. Turk issue again, accounts for about 110 basis points that we're not recovering in Arkansas. Again, as I mentioned earlier, we expect various commission orders and -- particularly in Texas in the fourth quarter of 2021 that's retroactive back to March. AEP Texas came in at 8.2%. It's below authorized primarily due to the significant level of investment in Texas. Of course, we have favorable regulatory treatment there with annual DCRF and biannual TCOS filings to recover rates. 
So significant levels of investment in Texas will continue to impact the ROE. But the expectation is for the ROE to trend towards an authorized 9.4% in the longer term. AEP Transmission Holdco came in at 11.2%. It was below authorized primarily driven by differences between actual and forecasted expenses, the Transcos benefit from a forward-looking formula rate mechanism, which helps minimize regulatory lag and that forecasted ROE is around 11% in 2021. So overall, continue to make progress. Cases, obviously, we're waiting to hear the results of several cases that should provide some additional benefits, but that work continues. 
So in closing, we're executing on all cylinders and continue to drive the results expected of a premium regulated utility. The AEP portfolio is one that has enabled our investments in the wire side of the business, supporting our transmission investments, including the $0.33 per share this quarter through our AEP Transmission Holdco investments. Our plan to transition our generation fleet and reduce carbon emissions by 80% by 2030 and net 0 by 2050 is well underway with 2 of our 3 wind facilities of our $2 billion investment in North Central wind under our belt, providing a solid foundation for the next decade of growth. Throughout this transition, we remain engaged in a trusted voice on energy transformation efforts, helping to ensure a responsible transition to a clean energy economy, and we'll continue to support federal efforts in that regard and state efforts as well. 
Finally, our strong quarter performance gives us the confidence again to set our midpoint at $4.70 with a range of $4.65 to $4.75, and we continue to have all 17,000 employees dedicated to our customers and communities to enable this strong performance. Our discipline in controlling costs, our progress to manage the portfolio and the significance of our future organic growth opportunities provides us with the confidence needed in raising the midpoint and nearing the guidance range. 
Two weeks ago, I was really struck by the halftime performance of the Ohio State Buckeyes marching band. They set their goals, in my opinion, really, really high. Never did I expect to see a marching band dedicate their halftime show to the music of rush. To hear Tom Sawyer was the limelight and others was truly amazing when they are difficult to even play even though they were also marching while designing guitar players, drums and other choreography on the field. The creativity and the execution came through to deliver a truly remarkable show. They maybe think of our team at AEP. 
On November 11, I've been AEP's CEO for 10 years, and fortunate to lead a great company of great people who have an outstanding track record of delivering on the promises made to investors and customers consistently year in and year out. And we fully expect to continue our drive to take this company to the next level toward a clean energy economy and a solid infrastructure foundation by setting aggressive goals and delivering with creativity and solid execution. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Julie."

A big game this weekend. Anyway, it's good to be with everybody. This morning, I'm going to walk us through the third quarter and year-to-date financial results, share some updates on our service territory load and finish with some commentary on financing plans, credit metrics and liquidity. 
Let's go to Slide 6, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter and year-to-date periods. GAAP earnings for the third quarter were $1.59 per share compared to $1.51 share in 2020. GAAP earnings through September were $3.90 per share compared to $3.56 per share in 2020. There's a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on Pages 14 and 15 of the presentation today. 
Let's go to Slide 7, where we can talk about our quarterly operating earnings performance by segment. Operating earnings for the third quarter totaled $1.43 per share or $717 million compared to $1.47 per share or $728 million in 2020. Operating earnings from the vertically integrated utilities were $0.87 per share, up $0.02. Favorable drivers included rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, weather primarily in the west, transmission revenue and lower income tax. These items were offset somewhat by higher O&M expenses due in part to lower prior year O&M, which included actions we took to adjust to the pandemic and higher depreciation expense as well as lower normalized margins and lower AFUDC. 
The Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.31 per share, flat to last year. Favorable drivers in this segment included rate changes, transmission revenue and income taxes. Offsetting these favorable items were O&M expenses, again, a function of lower prior year O&M associated with pandemic-driven efforts, depreciation and property taxes. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment continued to grow, contributing $0.33 per share that was an improvement of $0.05, driven by the return on investment growth. Generation & Marketing produced $0.04 per share, down $0.09 from last year, influenced by the prior year land sales, lower retail volumes and margins, generation and income taxes. Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.02 per share, driven by lower investment gains and unfavorable net interest expense. This was partially offset by lower income taxes. The lower investment gains are related to a pullback of some of the charge point related gains we've talked about in prior quarters. 
Let's have a look at our year-to-date results on Slide #8. Operating earnings through September totaled $3.76 per share or $1.9 billion compared to $3.56 per share or $1.8 billion in 2020. Looking at the drivers by segment. Operating earnings for vertically integrated utilities were $1.87 per share, down $0.03 due to higher O&M and depreciation expenses. Other smaller decreases included lower normalized sales and wholesale load, higher other taxes and a prior period fuel adjustment. Offsetting these unfavorable variances were rate changes across various operating companies and the impact of weather due to warmer-than-normal temps in the winter of 2020 and the summer 2021, which created a favorable year-over-year comp for us. Other favorable items in this segment included higher off-system sales, transmission revenue, net interest expense and income taxes. The Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.85 per share, up $0.01 from last year. Earnings in this segment were up due to higher transmission revenue, rate changes, weather, normalized load and income taxes. Partially offsetting these favorable items were increased depreciation, O&M, other taxes and interest expenses. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $1.02 per share, up $0.27 from last year related to investment growth and favorable year-over-year true-up. 
Generation & Marketing produced $0.20 per share, down $0.11 from last year due to favorable onetime items in the prior year relating to an Oklaunion ARO adjustment in the sale of Conesville and reduced land sales in 2021. Higher energy margins and lower expenses in the generation business offset the unfavorable ERCOT market prices on the wholesale business during storm Uri in February. We also saw an unfavorable result in retail due to lower power and gas margins. Income taxes were also unfavorable. 
Finally, Corporate and Other was up $0.06 per share driven by investment gains and lower taxes and partially offset by higher O&M. Let me take a quick minute here to talk about the investment gain, which is predominantly a function of our direct and indirect investment charge point. As you'll see on the waterfall, this produced a $0.06 benefit year-to-date in 2021 as compared to the corresponding 2020 period. You may recall that in the fourth quarter and full year 2020, this investment produced $0.05 contribution, and we would expect the year-over-year advantage to be more pronounced at this point in 2021 as we have no benefit during the same period in 2020. 
Turning to Page 9. I'll update you on our normalized load performance for the quarter. Before we get into the specifics, let me start by reminding everyone that everything you see on this slide is showing year-over-year growth. That means these numbers can be influenced by what was going on last year or what is happening now in 2021. Given all that occurred in the economy last year, it's obvious that these growth rates are at least partially being influenced by the comparison basis. This leads to the natural follow-up question like how does today's load compared to pre-pandemic level? And I'll get to that question on the next slide. 
But before I do, let's take a look at what our normalized load growth was for the quarter. Starting in the upper left corner, normalized residential sales were down 1.6% compared to last year, bringing the year-to-date decline down to 9/10th of a percent. You'll notice that last year, residential sales were up 3.8% in the third quarter when the economy was just starting to reopen. One year later, they are down only 1.6%, which suggests there's been a shift up in residential sales as more businesses have embraced a remote workforce for jobs that can be performed at home. 
The last item to point out on the residential chart is that you'll notice that we added a new bar to the right showing our latest projection for 2021 based on the load forecast update. The original guidance assumed residential sales would decrease by 1.1% in 2021. The latest update shows an improvement as we now expect residential to end the year down 9/10th of a percent. Moving right, weather-normalized commercial sales increased by 5%, bringing the year-to-date growth up to 4.3%. Last year's third quarter commercial sales were down 4.6%. So again, we're seeing a net positive story as the commercial sales class is bouncing back faster than expected. And while we're seeing a strong bounce back in the sectors most impacted by the pandemic, such as schools, churches and hotels, we're actually seeing the strongest growth in commercial sales this year from growth in data centers, especially in Central Ohio. 
To give you some perspective, last year, this sector was the 9th largest commercial sector across the AEP system. Today, it's the 6th largest and will likely move further up in the rankings as more data center loads are expected to come in online over the next several years. You'll also notice that our latest load forecast update now suggests that commercial sales will end the year up 3.7% as opposed to the 0.5% decline assumed in the original guidance forecast. The economy has recovered much faster than originally assumed, which is one of the reasons why we've updated the forecast and showing you an improvement in that regard. 
In the lower left corner, you'll see that industrial sales also had a very strong quarter. Industrial sales for the quarter increased by 7%, bringing the year-to-date up to 4.2%. Industrial sales were up at every operating company in nearly every sector. I'll point out, however, that the 7% growth in the third quarter this year did not quite offset the 7.8% decline experienced last year, which means we still have a little more room to grow before the industrial class fully recovers from the pandemic recession. The good news is we have a lot of momentum to work with. You'll notice that the latest load update now projects industrial sales will end the year up 4.3%, which is 2.4% higher than assumed in the original guidance forecast. 
Finally, when you put it all together, in the lower right corner, you'll see that normalized retail sales increased by 3% for the quarter and were up 2.3% for the first 9 months. By all indications, the recovery from the pandemic and recession is happening faster than expected and our service territory is positioned to benefit from future economic growth. You'll recall that the original guidance forecast assumed normalized low growth of 2/10th of a percent in 2021. Based on our latest update, we're now expecting to end the year up 2.2%, which is a supporting factor in narrowing our earnings guidance range and raising the midpoint for 2021. 
Turning to Slide 10. I want to answer the question from earlier to ask how our current low performance compares to pre-pandemic levels. This bar chart is designed to answer that question. The blue bars are the same year-to-date bars that we shared on the prior page. As a reminder, these represent growth versus 2020, which was influenced by the restrictions implemented to manage the public health crisis. The orange bars here show how the year-to-date sales in 2021 compare to 2019, which was the most recent pre-pandemic year for comparison. These bars tell us how close we are to a full recovery from the pandemic. Starting at the left, you'll notice that our reported residential sales are down 9/10th of a percent compared to last year, but they're actually up 1.6% compared to our pre-pandemic levels. This is a gauge for how our customers' behaviors have changed since the pandemic with more people working from home. 
The next bar shows that while commercial sales are up 4.3% compared to last year, they are still 8/10th of a percent below the pre-pandemic levels. Given the recent growth we're seeing, especially in the data center loads, we would expect commercial sales -- the commercial sales class to fully recover very soon. Moving further right, you'll notice that while the industrial sales are up 4.2% compared to last year, they are still 3% lower than pre-pandemic levels. Given some of the headwinds from manufacturing today with supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, et cetera, it may take a little longer before the industrial class fully recovers from the pandemic recession, but we do expect to eclipse the pre-pandemic levels in 2022. 
In total, our normalized load is up 2.3% compared to last year and is now within 7/10th of a percent of being fully recovered from the pandemic. So it's safe to say that we're pleased with the strength and balance of this recovery in the AEP system. 
Let's check on the company's capitalization and liquidity on Page 11. On a GAAP basis, our debt-to-capital ratio decreased 0.4% from the prior quarter to 62.2%. When adjusted for the storm Uri event, the ratio is slightly lower than it was at year-end 2022 -- or sorry, 2020 and now stands at 61.5%. Let's talk about our FFO to debt metric as in the first and second quarter, the effect of storm Uri continues to have a temporary and noticeable impact on this 2021 metric. Taking a look at the upper right quadrant on this page, you'll see our FFO to debt metric based on traditional Moody's and GAAP-calculated basis as well as on an adjusted Moody's and GAAP-calculated basis. 
On a traditional unadjusted basis, our FFO to debt ratio increased by 0.9% during the quarter to 10.2% on a Moody's basis. And just again, reiterating rating agencies continue to take the anticipated recovery into consideration as it relates to our credit ratings. So very important to note that. On an adjusted basis, the Moody's FFO to debt metric is 13.6%. This figure removes or adjusts the calculation to eliminate the impact of approximately $1.2 billion of cash outflows associated with covering the unplanned Uri-driven fuel and purchase power in the SPP region directly impacting PSO and SWEPCO in particular. The metric is also adjusted to remove the effect of the associated debt we used to fund the unplanned payments. This should give you a sense of where we would be from a business-as-usual perspective with that 13.6%. 
Importantly, as Nick mentioned, the recovery of the Uri-driven fuel and purchase power expense in the PSO and SWEPCO jurisdictions is well underway, and we're making progress. As a result, and consistent with what we have previously communicated, we still anticipate our cash flow metrics to return low to mid-teens target range next year. Obviously, we're trying to push towards the mid-teens range, but that will take us a little while longer, but we're definitely on our way there. And as you know, we'll keep you posted on our progress. 
Before we leave the balance sheet topic, I do want to make note of the intended change to our 2022 financing plan in light of our announced sale of Kentucky Power and Kentucky Transco. You may recall that we had planned to issue $1.4 billion of equity in 2022. That's inclusive of our $100 million dividend reinvestment plan to fund our growth CapEx program. While we will provide our typical 3-year forward annual review of our cash flows and financial metrics at the upcoming EEI conference, what we can expect to see that the 2022 forecast will be adjusted to eliminate the previously planned $1.4 billion of equity financing that I just mentioned with any residual proceeds being used to reduce a small portion of the 2022 debt financing that we had planned. These actions will have no impact on our previously stated credit metric targets or messaging in regard. 
In the slide deck today on Page 39, you'll see our current cash flow forecast with which you're already familiar. We've included a note on the slide to reflect the fact that the numbers have not been updated for the announced Kentucky transaction, along with the red circle around the 2022 financing -- equity financing amount that will be changed and updated when we roll out the new view in a couple of weeks in conjunction with the EEI conference. So while we're talking about the Kentucky transaction, I can also share that we expect that the sale will be $0.01 to $0.02 accretive in 2022, and we'll reflect this in our 2022 earnings guidance that we provide to you at the EEI conference. 
Okay. So back to our regularly scheduled earnings call programming and commentary. Let's take a quick moment to visit our liquidity summary on the lower right side of Slide 11. Our 5-year $4 billion bank revolver and 2-year $1 billion revolving credit facility, along with proceeds from a quarter-end debt issuance to support our liquidity position, which remains really strong at $5.1 billion. If you look at the lower left side of the page, you'll see that our qualified pension continues to be well funded at 104%. Additionally, our OPEB is funded at 173.9%. 
Let's go to Slide 12, and I'll do a quick wrap up and we can get to your questions. Our performance through the first 3 quarters of this year give us confidence to narrow our operating guidance to the upper half of our current range, resulting in a new range of $4.65 per share to $4.75 per share with a midpoint of $4.70 per share. As we've stated, we are committed to our long-term growth rate target of 5% to 7%. 
Today's 2021 earnings guidance revision is yet another demonstration of our drive to deliver performance in the upper half of our guidance range. From a strategic perspective, we are making significant progress in addressing items that are top of mind for our current and prospective investors. We are now in contract to sell Kentucky Power and Kentucky Transco, which we expect to complete in the second quarter of 2022. This transaction enables us to avoid the $1.4 billion equity issuance that was part of our original forecast we had shared with you for 2022 and therefore, alleviates the overhang, the equity overhang and also allows us to deliver a transactions that we estimate to be $0.01 to $0.02 accretive in 2022. 
Furthermore, we're able to do this while concurrently preserving our ability to get our FFO to debt metrics comfortably into that mid- to low teens range by 2022, which is commensurate with a Moody's Baa2 stable rating. As you know, we continue to target that. The intention is to remain in this credit metric range, again, with the preference to try to get closer to that midpoint as we move along in time. All of this positions us to continue our generation transformation, which is underpinned by the renewable investment opportunity we've shared with you and complemented by our ongoing energy delivery investment. So here's what you can expect to see from us at the upcoming EEI conference in early November. 
In addition to the updated 3-year forward cash flow and financing plan, we'll be introducing and sharing the details behind our 2022 earnings guidance and our longer-term capital plan, we typically go out 5 years, all of which will incorporate the effects of the announced Kentucky sale. So with that, sure, we do appreciate your time and attention. And I'm going to turn it over to the operator so we can get to your questions."

And then we'll continue working with the West Virginia and Kentucky commission to get resolved the operating agreement related issues. And then, of course, at the end of 2028, the transfer is over at a fair market value type of approach. So that's the plan. 
And that'll get filed here in November and December time frame, and we'll go through that. And actually, both commissions have the incentive to get this resolved because we do have various views of the ELG piece of it. So regardless of whether we had this transaction or not, we would be needing to file for the operating agreement change out just because of the different directions the commissions have gone. So we'll get that resolved as part and parcel to the overall approvals."

I mean, I've said over and over, I guess, for a couple of years now, but even beyond that, we do have to get to portfolio management to enable us to look at the sources and uses of the capital needs that we have and to manage the balance sheet as Julie has mentioned. We target the mid-teens, and we want to get there. And obviously, we're well on our way of getting there. So we want to do that but at the same time, be able to fund the capital growth. 
And when you think about it, we've sold the unregulated generation. We sold river ops, we sold some hydro-related facilities and with Kentucky, you're talking about $6 billion of assets that have been sold, but they fueled substantial growth, I mean, to the tune of $7 billion a year in capital. So it's part of the process to determine what the portfolio needs to be in the future, and we'll continue to do that. Certainly, we have Chuck and Julie and others, we'll continue to review that portfolio and we'll manage it in a proper way. 
I think -- and I'll say this, Kentucky Power, you think about the threshold. At one point, we talked about, we always invested in coal units no matter what. And obviously, we've changed that focus to make sure it's more deliberative in terms of the decision points that were made. It's quite a move for AEP to get to a point where we're managing our portfolio in a way that, first of all, we became fully regulated. And then we start to look at that portfolio to determine, okay, what's the best approach to fuel $20 billion in potential renewables investment. So when you think about that, we have to consider it. 
And I can tell you, I mean, the last time we sold a regulated utility was, I guess, the Scranton, Pennsylvania system in the Pennsylvania -- I mean, in Pennsylvania and the New Jersey system back in the like 1940s and '50s. So it's a pretty substantial change. And when you think about Kentucky Power itself, it was one of the first acquisitions of American Gas & Electric in 1922. So by the time we get through this, it's been 100 years. So when you think about the threshold level of portfolio management that has occurred in this company, it really should shine a lot in terms of our seriousness of making sure that we're managing that portfolio in a proper way. Probably a longer answer than what you asked for, but I wanted to at least get all that out there."

So we get the cash flow to support those investments at the time they come online. And that means, obviously, our FFO yet doesn't suffer as a result of that. So if we continue that approach and keep in mind too, I've always said that for us to take a look at a regulated entity or other parts of our portfolio doesn't match the future needs in terms of where we are and where we're going as a company, is there -- if we have a chronically underperforming part of the portfolio, then it's important for us to take a look at. 
Now that may be temporary, it could be long term. But certainly, we have to make sure that we're evaluating each one of these assets in a way that says, okay, it doesn't matter where it's located as long as we're getting certainly the return expectation and also the forward view of the utility is positive, and that's comparative with others. So we have to compare in various parts of our service territories, and that's where we make those decisions."

But overall, nominally, it should be on path to what we've talked about. And we'll have more to report on that probably during the first quarter '22 because we'll have the integrated resource plans. 
And when those integrated resource plans are filed, that's what I mentioned today is you'll have a more definitive view of what those projects look like because there'll be the results of RFPs and there'll be the results of actual projects that are put in for regulated approval.

So an increase in the -- with a minimum tax, would certainly have a cooling effect on our ability to continue with not only development of infrastructure and have an effect on that, not to mention customers' bills ultimately because the taxes are a pass-through to our customers. But also, the administration has a focus on clean energy, and it will have an effect on the renewables transformation that's existing as well. So I think it'll put a pall over all the utilities' ability to continue investing capital in the way that we are. 
Now if we do that, then obviously, there's customer impacts associated with it. And again, it's sort of a hidden tax on our customers. So we're for it. We're not for that provision. I think actually, we've been very forthright about this and trying to be an honest broker when we were talking about CEPP and all the other things that it was important for us to be able to make this transformation from a clean energy standpoint. And certainly, the PTCs, ITCs, with expansion of long-term storage, nuclear and -- but certainly in terms of wind and solar are very important to continue this process to move to a clean energy economy, and we can get a long way there. This industry is very focused on doing that. And any kind of tax headwind that goes the other direction is not helpful. And I think you'll probably hear that across the board."

Thanks for the question, Steve. You're right. I mean, we do lose the funds from operations as it relates to Kentucky and Kentucky Transco, although we got to keep in mind that we also eliminate about $1.3 billion of debt associated with those assets, too, because that goes away. And then the other thing that we think through just to take it a step further is if we avoid issuing equity, we avoid having to cover off additional dividends that were in our original plan. So I'm able to sidestep that as well. And that comes with maybe also having some additional dollars to reduce debt at the parent, as I mentioned in my opening comments. Anything above and beyond that $1.4 billion will channel toward debt reduction that was otherwise planned for 2022. 
And then also keep in mind that Kentucky Power had very strained FFO to debt to begin with. So to eliminate that piece of, I guess, drag to the overall average FFO to debt for the organization is also a net positive for us. So we're able -- to be able to put these numbers together. And quite frankly, from an FFO to debt perspective, it is very mildly beneficial and obviously, a little bit of a cost on the debt to cap because we're not issuing additional equity. But the numbers all do hang together and coincidentally, we're able to take literally that $1.4 billion of planned equity out of the plan. And again, you'll see that at EEI when we refresh the forecast."

I'll take this from a customer rate perspective, if I could because that's how we think about it, because ultimately, this impacts our customers. When you think about, for example, do some sensitivity analysis around, let's say, a 10% hike in natural gas prices. As we all know, they've gone up substantially. The impact to customer rates varies significantly from one operating company to the next, depending on the fuel mix. So for example, if I looked at Appalachian Power Company, the average residential impact price and in terms of a 10% hike in gas prices would equate to about a 0.9% increase in the customers' rate. Let's compare and contrast that to, say, PSO or SWEPCO, where there's much more gas concentration. So PSO, we'd be talking about 1.6% increase in customer rates, SWEPCO 1.5%. So this is something we are very sensitive to because as you know, overall, we're extremely sensitive to customer rate increases in the aggregate as we continue to execute on our general CapEx program.

Now that Kentucky will be kind of off your plate when you look at the other jurisdictions, what are the ones where you say, hey, we still struggle to unauthorized here? And what are the structural changes, whether it's legislation, and we've seen lots of utilities in places like North Carolina, Kansas, Missouri, go in and make structural changes via legislation.

We've made a lot of progress on riders, and we have a lot of focus on getting concurrent recovery and cash in the door. And what you're seeing really in terms of a lot of these lags is the amount of investment that we're placing in these companies. But as well, as you make the transition from -- certainly from wires-related activities with riders and then the renewables conversion that occurs. The way we're doing the renewables is commensurate with the recovery. 
So we should see the authorized -- our returns be closer to the authorized as time goes forward. We don't see any fundamental issues in any of the jurisdictions that are left that says that we have significant headwinds. I mean the only thing you could probably point to is the Turk issue at SWEPCO. But other than that, -- and actually, when you think about Arkansas, and we keep saying we're not recovering the Arkansas portion of Turk. That's not because of the commission. That is because of the Supreme Court of Arkansas. So we've got very good relations with the commissions in all the jurisdictions. 
And we feel like the fundamentals are there for continued improvement relative to that regulatory lag that exists and because we're spending on more areas and our generation is really renewables and that's helping out every time we put an investment in, and the timing of the investment improves, FFO to debt improves the returns of the individual companies, and I think we'll continue to make progress in that regard. So I would be -- I'm pretty optimistic that we'll continue to make progress in all of these jurisdictions."

And so Michael, we always -- as Nick mentioned, we strive to be in the upper half of the guidance range, not necessarily the upper end, although that would be very nice. So just a point of clarification there. And as it relates to returns, as you can see, we've kind of been hovering around the 9% ROE return level. I think that's a safe place for you to assume that will kind of hang out there for a while until we get a little more traction. 
Another thing, if I could, circling back to your original question, when you look at the equalizer chart, oftentimes, we get questions around AEP Texas and why the lower ROE relative to authorized there. And so back to your question around growth and how do you manage the business. AEP Texas, we continue to invest a significant amount of capital on an annualized basis. And while we have very progressive rate recovery mechanisms in place that we really enjoy, I can tell you this, while the ROE may look a touch depressed relative to authorized that company continues to produce earnings growth in, say, the 8% to 10% range. So that certifies our ability to -- back to your original point, get in that upper half of the range. So again, ROE, a system-wide average assumes roughly around 9%-ish and trending upward over time. And then around AEP Texas, keep in mind the capital is intentional there as we continue to try to take care of the customer and grow that business, and it's paying dividends in sense that we're getting 8% to 10% EPS growth out of it."
