As I reflect on the year, 2020 was a year of profound societal and economic disruptions globally. Despite these challenges, I'm extremely proud of the continued resiliency of our company. Our global teams have worked aggressively to keep our employees and customers safe, our supply chains open and our growth commitments on track. 
Our progress as a company in managing through the pandemic and other disruptions over the last year confirms the strength and durability of our strategy. Underpinning our progress is our strong organic sales growth for the full year, where our teams delivered gains in both Seed and Crop Protection and across all regions. 
Transforming our cost structure remains a priority for Corteva to deliver on our targeted earnings growth. We demonstrated our commitment to cost reductions in 2020 by managing spending and delivering on our productivity programs. These savings were mostly offset from headwinds that we had anticipated, such as higher input costs and investments to support growth in addition to unfavorable currency. Despite these hurdles, we delivered solid operating EBITDA improvement for the year. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We continue to strengthen our financial position as we ended the year with cash and investments of roughly $3.8 billion. Further, our cash net of debt, improved by approximately $1 billion over the prior year as a result of the organization's focus on disciplined capital deployment and strong execution on working capital productivity. The company made progress on returning cash to shareholders with more than $660 million returned via dividends and share repurchases. 
Looking ahead, we see 2021 as a year in which we will accelerate on our path and expect to capitalize on the significant momentum we have built as the investments we made since 2017, and begin to drive substantial earnings improvement. Our entire team is focused on executing to deliver further value for our shareholders from a number of in-flight strategic initiatives, including the ramp-up of Enlist, the launch of Brevant in the U.S. retail channel and the continued advancement of our Crop Protection pipeline following 2020, and where we obtained more than 140 registrations globally for new active ingredients and formulations that we will start selling in 2021. 
We recognize that our 2020 performance was not where we need to be in terms of realizing the full operating leverage from organic growth and productivity programs in our earnings. For 2021, I am confident that we have made the necessary adjustments and are well positioned to deliver 15% to 20% operating EBITDA improvement for the year, including more than 200 basis points of margin improvement as the organization remains focused on executing on our targeted productivity actions. 
On capital allocation, you may recall that we discussed last quarter that we plan to accelerate the completion of our $1 billion share repurchase program by the end of 2021, which was 6 months ahead of our initial plan. Given our current cash position and outlook for 2021, we expect to complete most of the repurchases by midyear, while maintaining our strong balance sheet and investing for growth. The bottom line, we view 2021 as a big step forward for Corteva, and I am confident we remain on track and laser-focused on delivering on our midterm targets. 
Turning next to Slide 5 and briefly touching on 2020 performance for the total company. For sales, strong organic growth in both segments and across all regions led to improved performance compared to our revised guidance, with double-digit organic growth for the year in both Latin America and Asia Pacific. Continued penetration of new and differentiated technology drove the increases, including 2% pricing in our corn and soybean portfolios globally. 
On operating EBITDA, we delivered 5% improvement for the year, exceeding our expectations compared to our revised guidance as organic growth and cost and productivity actions were partially offset by higher input costs and an unfavorable net currency impact. On currency, net of pricing, results were better than we had anticipated for the year as teams delivered strong execution on local pricing, coupled with favorable movement in exchange rates late in the fourth quarter. As a result, despite a 15 basis point decline in the fourth quarter on the absence of prior year divestitures, we extracted 33 basis points of margin expansion for the year, establishing a strong foundation for solid growth moving forward. 
Shifting the discussion to the market backdrop on Slide 6. While more resilient than some other sectors, the ag markets faced unexpected impacts resulted from the COVID-related disruptions. Throughout the year, we observed tremendous volatility, including commodity demand levels, acreage levels and foreign currency exchange rates. As our business is highly sensitive to these movements, we have closely and continuously monitored market conditions and remain agile to adjust our actions accordingly. 
As we enter the fourth quarter, fundamentals shifted and the outlook began to improve. Commodity demand has stabilized considerably with constructive trends out of China on grain purchases from the U.S. This trend, coupled with lower yields for 2020 U.S. crop and uncertainty in Brazil has led to higher commodity prices, which also leads to improved outlook on-farm income levels, resulting in the highest levels we've seen in 7 years. Government stimulus payments in the U.S. are also supporting farm income improvement. 
So after 2 straight years of unprecedented impacts from weather and the pandemic, we are pleased to see signs of a more favorable market environment for 2021. Taking our operational momentum into consideration, we are encouraged as strengthening ag fundamentals add additional support to our expectations to further accelerate our strategy and deliver strong growth in 2021. 
Now moving to Slide 7 for full year highlights on the top line performance from our teams around the globe. In North America, we delivered organic sales growth of 4% for the year, powered by high-performing technologies like chrome corn seed, which provides growers an approximate 8 to 10-bushel per acre yield advantage over comparable products. 
In soybeans, as the recovery in planted acres helped volumes, we drove 2% pricing with a yield advantage lineup and disciplined execution by our teams. We also continue to make progress in accelerating the ramp-up of our Enlist system. While we entered 2020 expecting Enlist E3 soybeans to represent just 10% of our soybean volume, we finished the year well ahead of those expectations at approximately 17% of our volume and on 20% of total U.S. soybean acres. That has helped drive strong early demand for Enlist herbicides, which delivered $140 million in fourth quarter sales, more than double the prior year period. The full Enlist system delivered approximately $440 million in sales for the year, and we could not be more excited about how the system is gaining traction in the market. 
In Europe, Middle East and Africa, organic sales grew 8% in 2020 on strong demand for new and differentiated crop protection products, such as Arylex and Rinskor herbicides. Arylex is a product we are particularly excited about. As it progressed through the European regulatory process faster than any product I can remember in recent years and really exemplifies our advantages in sustainable chemistry solutions. An area of growing demand where we have highly effective products in the market and in our pipeline. 
In Seed, we were able to drive volume and price gains as a result of our route-to-market expansions in Russia and Ukraine as well as share gains in corn. While significant currency volatility from the Brazilian real weighed on net sales in Latin America, we delivered 17% organic growth for the year. Here, we executed on market share gains in both Seed and Crop Protection and gained meaningful market share in the Brazil safrinha market, while we continue to drive adoption of our novel crop protection products. The teams displayed strong execution on managing the volatility of local currency, which is evident in the $150 million in pricing for currency in Brazil for the year. 
In Asia Pacific, we realized 13% organic sales growth compared to prior year on both volume and price improvements. This progress is another proof point of continued penetration of our new technology as we drove the adoption of Rinskor and Arylex herbicides as well as other advantaged products like the Spinosyn insecticide. 
During the period, we also benefited from strong demand for Seeds in India. Moving to Slide 8 for a more detailed review of our 2020 operating EBITDA performance. We delivered strong price/mix benefits of $210 million and volume benefits of $160 million from the continued penetration of our new and differentiated technology across all regions, representing important progress on our targets. Through these actions, we delivered $100 million in earnings improvement on the sales growth of $250 million of new Crop Protection products in 2020. At the same time, we drove Seed share gains in Europe and Latin America. Seed pricing improved operating EBITDA for the year, led by a 2% improvement globally for corn and 2% improvement for soybeans in North America. 
On cost, we delivered approximately $30 million in net operating EBITDA improvement for the year. This improvement reflects execution on the $230 million in productivity and cost actions, which were largely offset by higher input costs and reinvestments to accelerate future growth and profitability. Other was a headwind for 2020 and predominantly reflects the impact of asset divestitures in 2019. 
Lastly, gross currency impact to operating EBITDA was approximately $330 million before pricing and was predominantly due to the devaluation of the Brazilian real. To offset this headwind, local teams delivered approximately $150 million in pricing for currency, resulting in a net currency headwind of approximately $180 million for the year. 
Our growth initiatives are taking hold. And we continue to take action to reduce costs and drive productivity across the organization. Yesterday, we announced a restructuring program that includes facilities consolidations, footprint efficiencies and headcount reductions. This is part of delivering on our broader productivity programs. We are confident that we have reached the point where the investments we have made over the past few years will begin to accelerate earnings growth in 2021 and beyond. 
Now I'll turn it over to Greg to provide more detail on our results and the 2021 outlook."

Moving to Slide 9 and a more in-depth look at our performance in the Crop Protection segment, organic sales for the fourth quarter grew 21% driven by an 11% improvement in volume and a 10% improvement in price. Robust demand for Enlist herbicides, coupled with fall applications of Optanyte in North America drove organic sales up 31% over prior year. Strong demand for our new products and pricing actions to offset currency also led to organic growth of 21% in Latin America and 17% in Asia Pacific for the quarter. Coupled with our productivity actions, this growth drove an approximate 70 basis point operating EBITDA margin benefit for the segment in the quarter despite the net impact of asset divestitures in 2019. 
For the full year, organic sales increased 11%, supported by continued growth in new products and in our differentiated Spinosyn insecticides, both up double digits on an organic basis over prior year. This growth was partially offset by our strategic decision to phase out [indiscernible] and ramp down of selected low-margin third-party products. Overall, Crop Protection results reflects price and volume gains in all regions, showing the balance and diversity of our new and differentiated products globally as well as our ability to grow organically above the market. Despite this organic sales growth, operating EBITDA for the segment has declined for the year due to the impact of currency, coupled with higher input costs, investments to support growth and the impact of asset divestitures in 2019. 
On costs, as we mentioned last quarter, we have taken several actions starting back at the completion of the merger in 2017 to streamline our manufacturing operations to drive better operating leverage and crop protection. Given the regulatory approval requirements in each of the jurisdictions where we sell our products, it takes several years for the benefit of our asset footprint actions to impact the bottom line. We should begin to see those benefits in 2021. 
On currency, we have recognized approximately $150 million in pricing for the year to offset the weakening Brazilian real. And pricing will continue to be a strategic lever for us going forward. 
Moving to the Seed segment on Slide 10. Organic sales for the fourth quarter were up 9%, driven by strong safrinha corn sales in Brazil and deliveries in North America and Europe on an early start to the season. Operating EBITDA for the segment declined for the quarter due to the impact of currency and higher commodity costs. Full year organic sales grew 6% due to the soybean acreage rebound and improved price in North America, market share gains in Brazil and Europe corn and strong volume and price gains on new products particularly chrome, PowerCore Ultra and Enlist E3 soybeans. Overall, price and volume gains, coupled with productivity actions, drove an approximate 190 basis point operating EBITDA margin benefit for the segment for the year. 
Turning now to Slide 11. I'll provide our full year guidance for 2021. Starting with net sales, we expect reported net sales to be between $14.4 billion and $14.6 billion, up roughly 2% over prior year at the midpoint of the range, with organic growth of about 3%. This primarily reflects the continued ramp of new products globally in both our Crop Protection and Seed segments, partially offset by the strategic decisions we made in our Crop Protection portfolio to further drive margin improvement. 
On operating EBITDA, we expect to deliver between $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion, an improvement of 17% year-over-year at the midpoint. With our expected top line growth and continued focus on delivering cost savings commitments, we expect to improve operating EBITDA margins by over 200 basis points on a total company basis. 
Turning to operating EPS. We expect to deliver between $1.85 and $1.95 per share, which would represent a 27% improvement over 2020 using the midpoint. We have provided supplemental information on our guidance in the appendix of our presentation. 
Focusing on operating EBITDA, Slide 12 provides our key assumptions. Starting with seed, global demand for agricultural products continues to be strong. If new crop prices sustain current levels and weather remains favorable for our normal spring planting pace, we anticipate combined U.S. 2021 corn and soybean area will increase between 5 million and 8 million acres. Based on relative commodities prices, we expect that the planned area increase will be heavily biased towards soybeans. We will refine our assumptions when the market data is available as part of the March prospective planting estimates published by the USDA. 
In terms of Enlist expectations, consistent with what we shared on our third quarter call, we believe we could have greater than 35% of our units in Enlist E3 next year and anticipate as much as 30% of the soybean units in North America will carry the Enlist E3 trait. 
On Seed pricing, we expect to maintain our 2020 momentum and continue to extract value for yield advantage technology in corn globally, including further penetration of chrome in our corn lineup. 
Turning to Crop Protection. We expect to deliver continued growth in our new product sales. This growth is underpinned by strong market demand for Enlist and Arylex herbicides and continued penetration of ISO class insecticide globally. In total, we expect new crop protection products to contribute approximately $300 million in incremental sales growth during 2021. 
With respect to our differentiated technologies, we expect to release an additional 10% of Spinosyn's capacity in 2021, resulting in approximately $80 million of additional sales opportunity as demand will continue to up exceed supply for this product in a growing targeted segment of the market. 
As I've mentioned, we have made strategic decisions to phase out chlorpyrifos and the ramp down selected low-margin third-party products. While these changes are accretive to our margins, we do expect an approximate $75 million headwind to earnings in 2021 as a result of these decisions, which is included in our volume assumptions. 
Moving on to cost. We are targeting approximately $150 million in net cost savings in 2021, which includes $250 million in savings from our productivity programs, mostly related to the manufacturing and supply chain rationalization work we have underway in Crop Protection. We also expect the majority of our COVID-related savings in 2020 will be sustained in 2021. These savings will be partially offset by an approximate $100 million headwind in Seed input costs as a result of higher grower compensation costs due to rising commodity prices, along with unfavorable yields in Europe. 
Finally, on currency, we expect a headwind in 2021, given the change in the year-over-year rates for the Brazilian real and seasonality. Pricing will continue to be a lever to offset this impact as our commercial teams in Brazil actively price for changes in local currency. We anticipate we will recognize approximately $100 million in pricing for the year, reflecting a rate of approximately 5 50. 
Through our dynamic pricing, coupled with the financial instruments we have in place, we expect to further reduce volatility in our guidance, and we'll continually monitor movement in local currency rates as that could more directly impact our ability to price for currency. 
Turning now to Slide 13, I'll provide an update on our capital deployment targets over the midterm. As a result of our strong operational performance throughout 2020, coupled with effective working capital management, we ended the year with approximately $3.8 billion in cash and investments. That's after returning more than $660 million to shareholders this year through dividends and share repurchases. 
Building on this momentum, we expect to generate between $3 billion and $3.5 billion of operating cash flow in total for 2021 and 2022 combined, largely driven by earnings growth and continued focus on working capital productivity. Taking a look at the potential uses for cash, we have outlined several key priorities. Our first priority is to maintain a strong balance sheet with financial flexibility to support our industry-leading business model, which will allow us to fund investments in the business annually. These investments will reinforce and renew our innovation and market capabilities. We will also continue to explore paths to optimize our portfolio through opportunistic bolt-on M&A, including fruit and vegetable seeds, digital technology and biologicals. 
Finally, we are committed to accelerating the return of cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. In short, we see tremendous opportunity to return capital to our shareholders over the midterm. As you can see, we view the cash generation capabilities of this business as very strong, and we are excited to share more details as we move forward in our journey. With that, I'll turn it back to Jim."

We've made tremendous progress in the short time we've been an independent company, but we know we have more work to do. Our recent results and guidance indicate we are well positioned to accelerate value creation in 2021 and beyond, including progressing on our products through the ramp-up of our proprietary Enlist system and strengthening our advantaged multi channel, multi-brand route to market, continuing to transform our crop protection portfolio and enhance our higher-value product mix and further streamlining costs and disciplined execution on our productivity actions. We will also maintain our balanced capital allocation program, continuing to return cash to shareholders even as we invest in long-term sustainable growth. 
Corteva's Board and management team are fully aligned on a strategy to deploy our competitive advantages to deliver increased value that is durable. Our plan is solid. We are executing and it is working. At the same time, we are always open to perspectives that benefit all of our shareholders. At Corteva, we believe in the fundamental importance of listening and incorporating ideas that will help advance our mission and our objectives, and we continue to do that. 
While I am pleased with our progress, I am not satisfied with our relatively flat earnings over the past 3 years. We have learned, we've adapted and are now very well positioned to accelerate our growth and deliver on the tremendous opportunities we have created through our targeted investments and disciplined emphasis on cost and productivity. So as I consider our path ahead, there is no doubt we have aligned our culture and gained the trust of our customers. At the same time, we have the right products and our portfolio transformation is underway and we have the productivity programs in place to deliver our future. Through disciplined and focused execution, we are confident this plan will deliver meaningful earnings growth and margin expansion in the near-term and significant sustained long-term value for all of our shareholders. And importantly, puts Corteva fully on track to achieve our midterm targets.

And yes, as we've said in the opening comments, 2021 is a big step forward for us. And I really believe we've reached an acceleration point given the investments and the strategies that we've been putting in place since 2017 and believe they will drive substantial earnings for the years ahead. And as a starting point for '21, I think you got to look at that fourth quarter momentum. That momentum is there and it's real, and it gives you a strong sense for where that growth is going to come from. So as we've guided for '21, as you see on the chart, 15% to 20% improvement in EBITDA, and that's a 200 basis point improvement in EBITDA margin. So I believe that guide is strong, and it's realistic. And as you've asked, let me give you some proof points on why I have some confidence in it. 2/3 of the improvement in the business this next year is going to come through our crop Protection business. And that's tied to the productivity improvements that we put in place. A number of footprint reduction projects as they have started to flow through cost of sales. And you can really begin to see that in our CP margins. You add to that, the continued ramp-up of either the new products that we've talked so much about, about $300 or so million of new incremental new product sales. And then you start to unleash the Spinosyn capacity that we have been investing in. And so overall, you get about $400 million of growth there. And then all of that on Crop Protection is net of now the strategic decisions that we made to exit a number of key products. So while those decisions have been headwinds in the past, and we've got those behind us now. And so the numbers we're talking to you about our net numbers. And then about 1/3 of that improvement next year is tied to our Seed business, and really got to start that discussion by just looking at Latin America, the tremendous momentum we carried in the fourth quarter. And then you add to that expectations of I don't know, 5 million to 8 million acres of new crop coming back into corn and soybeans in North America, probably heavily weighted to soybeans but it's real out there. You can see it tied to the really strong demand that's in the marketplace, and that's being reflected in commodity prices. And then the other confidence I have in our Seed business is with respect to pricing. You look at what we delivered in 2020, kind of 2% price improvement in corn and 2% price improvement in soybeans globally. We've got a track record now there and so we're going to count on that track record. We will have a little headwind in the Seed business tied to commodity prices and cost of sales. And then don't forget about Brevant as we're thinking about the bridge next year. We're just scratching the surface of what Brevant and as well as Enlist is going to be able to deliver for us. So I think this is a strong and realistic guide for 2021 and I have a lot of confidence in this plan and my team that we can deliver that."

On Crop Protection, the main story there is momentum. We delivered $250 million of new product incremental revenue in 2020. '21 is going to be another strong year with about $300 million of incremental from those new products. We had 140 new product registrations that we receive right here at the end of 2020 that will just start having momentum in '21, and you'll feel that again in '22. And then on top of the top line revenue that we'll get from Crop Protection, by '22, you're really starting to see the compounding effects of better margins on that new chemistry as higher volumes flow through that same asset base and take up -- we start to spread that fixed cost over a much broader base. So you're seeing some of that but as those new product sales continue to ramp, it shows up in '22. On top of that, the further improvements that you're going to see from the asset footprint work that we're doing. And we've got a good start of that this year coming up and show up next year. So all of these levers, we really have within our control. And again, while it's early, we've still got '21 to get through and, again, tough to predict what that market will look like. But we've got our hands firmly on these levers, and that's what's going to propel us to those midterm targets."

And then this year, you're talking about another $100 million. So on a 2-year stack, if my math is right, you're up $175 million to $200 million. And I guess my question is, if we have sort of normal production in the U.S. and Europe this year and if the future is curve for corn and soy is correct and commodity prices are lower into next year. Does that mean there's going to be $170 million to $200 million Seed production cost tailwind in '22? Or would some of that be eaten up by other costs, maybe extend launch costs or anything else?

For 2021, we are expecting approximately $100 million in Seed input cost headwinds. Those are predominantly due to the higher commodity prices for soybeans that impact our grower compensation program. The way we compensate growers for producing seed. And we also had lower seed field yields in Europe. It was a tough seed production here. So just as a background, we go out and we contract with independent growers to produce our commercial seed and they have the opportunity to lock in a commodity price rate during a window and especially with soybeans. As we saw that run-up late in the season, they locked in at higher rates. We go into every year with our best foot forward. So as we put Seed in the ground in '21 for '22 production, clearly, we will lap those higher commodity prices. And if we see some tail off there, will benefit from that. And we'll expect to always have good solid yield production in our fields. We work with a lot of irrigated fields, so we try to take the weather out of that as much as possible. So we're -- we've seen good trends, and I think we've got a lot in play that should help support us as we come out of '21 into '22."

As we think about the market next -- this season, 2021, it's always a competitive marketplace, and it will be just as competitive as we saw in 2020. Even with the commodity pricing backdrop. So we're going to continue to go out there and get paid for the value that we deliver to growers, especially when it comes to the yield advantage technology that we're putting out there. And most notably, we really do see that in corn. And we've established a really strong track record that I mentioned earlier of extracting that value for our technology. And all you got to do is go back and look at our 2020 performance, where we delivered 2% pricing in corn and soybeans, and that's globally. So this is always a market-specific phenomenon. But when you step back and look at our performance last year, we did that everywhere. And so we're -- as we sit here today, we're very pleased with the pace of the orders that are coming in, in both our Pioneer brand in North America as well as Brevant brand through those channels. And so I'm confident on that value question that we'll carry that momentum into 2021. Greg, do you want to talk a little bit about royalties?"

Due to the merger, we did inherit a number of U.S. manufacturing locations that have been more expensive then what I had personally experienced in the past around a more outsourced or a more localized approach to the business. So we didn't wait to take any actions to start optimizing the supply chain. Since merge, since the close of the merger, we've shut down 9 manufacturing assets and we are starting to see the benefits of those lower cost supply chain. So I do believe that 2021 is really an inflection point for us. You really haven't seen much of the benefits of those actions yet. And that's kind of related to the amount of time that it takes to clear the regulatory hurdles. Every time you make a change in your supply chain, you have to go back and resubmit dossiers to regulatory authorities in every country around the world. So you saw some restructuring, the 8-K that we filed that had restructuring in it. That's just part of those programs that we've talked about, and we'll just kind of continue to roll forward. So in our guide, in our confirmation of our midterm targets, we've included those strategic decisions in those guides. It's one of the tools that we have and one of the ways that we get there and have confidence that they're achievable. And then we're always looking for opportunities and new ideas. We take every one of our active ingredients that we produce, and we ask ourselves a question, can we be the lowest cost producer of that product. And when that answer is no, the teams began looking for alternate sources. And when that answer is yes, but we need project work to get there, we began to put those initiatives in place to drive that. So the best example I can point to is if you look at 2021's EBITDA improvement, 2/3 of that improvement is going to be coming from those initiatives in our Crop Protection business. So I got a lot of confidence, a lot of great visibility of those initiatives that are in-flight and exactly where we are in each one of those manufacturing units and those cost of sales points to be able to point to that."

And so I don't understand why you would be generating so much EBITDA and so little operating cash flow. And then secondly, your pension liability really went down in the fourth quarter from, I think, sequentially from something like $5.8 billion to $5.1 billion, but interest rates really fell year-over-year.

And in addition to that, the rise in commodity prices towards the end of the year also generated some incremental income for our customers. And we got the benefit of that with some cash generation at the end of the year. As we go into 2021 and beyond, we are looking at increasing our capital spending. We were at 4.75% in 2020.

So I'm pretty confident in soy as well. We held. If not, we were up slightly.

And if you look at that another way, the growers that are locking in harvest month futures prices today versus what they were doing a year ago, they're looking at $100 an acre higher revenue today than they were a year ago. And so my question for you on that is, how do you think that most affects the decisions those farmers make? Is it C genetics? Is it shift to branded crop chemicals, is it application rates? How do you think it most affects your verticals? And then the second question there would be your 2021 guide of a 3% sales growth is the same as it was in 2020, is it reasonable to see that as not really middle the road, but a not to miss guide?"

Clearly, improving commodity price markets helps the psychology of everybody involved. And as what they think, farmers always think about their decisions as investments in their future to drive productivity and yield. And so higher commodity prices means they will continue to push for yield and be able to take advantage of that yield. And what I like about what we're seeing right now is we feel like the demand side of this equation that's driving those commodity prices is pretty durable for the 1- to 2-year term as we look out. China's demand curve seems to be strong as they're rebuilding their pork industry. And we know we've got demand for exports in other markets and strong demand for animal feed that we're seeing come back in North America. And with the carryover stocks where we're seeing them. So I like you believe that we have support for those commodity prices here for the next it 2 or 3 years. And that's driving our acreage assumptions as well. I would expect 180 million, 182 million corn and soybean acres when you combine them, a little hard to call the split there, but probably the best news we're hearing right now is we don't seem to be -- it's going to favor soybeans. We know that any increases will go into soybean acreage, but it's not coming out of corn. So it's really setting up both a strong corn and bean. When you look at our revenue guide for next year, as you mentioned, just remember that in that guide, there -- that is a net top line revenue number and it's net of about $300 million of revenue that we phased out of from 2020 going into '21. The first of those strategic decisions around chlorpyrifos. And then several other low-margin products, very, very generic and just probably not the right kind of products for our portfolio going forward. So we're certainly in a mix enrichment and refreshment of that portfolio and basically have the majority of those big strategic decisions now behind those. So back to my comment earlier, I think this guide, it's a strong and a realistic guide with all of those elements really baked into it. And we still have a full season ahead. We're sitting here early in '21, a lot to go but we're confident we've set this at the right spot. Thanks, Steve."

As I reflect on the year, 2020 was a year of profound societal and economic disruptions globally. Despite these challenges, I'm extremely proud of the continued resiliency of our company. Our global teams have worked aggressively to keep our employees and customers safe, our supply chains open and our growth commitments on track. Our progress as a company in managing through the pandemic and other disruptions over the last year confirms the strength and durability of our strategy. 
Underpinning our progress is our strong organic sales growth for the full year, where our teams delivered gains in both Seed and Crop Protection and across all regions. Transforming our cost structure remains a priority for Corteva to deliver on our targeted earnings growth. We demonstrated our commitment to cost reductions in 2020 by managing spending and delivering on our productivity programs. These savings were mostly offset from headwinds that we had anticipated, such as higher input costs and investments to support growth in addition to unfavorable currency. Despite these hurdles, we delivered solid operating EBITDA improvement for the year. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We continue to strengthen our financial position as we ended the year with cash and investments of roughly $3.8 billion. Further, our cash, net of debt, improved by approximately $1 billion over the prior year as a result of the organization's focus on disciplined capital deployment and strong execution on working capital productivity. The company made progress on returning cash to shareholders with more than $660 million returned via dividends and share repurchases. 
Looking ahead, we see 2021 as a year in which we will accelerate on our path and expect to capitalize on the significant momentum we have built as the investments we made since 2017 begin to drive substantial earnings improvement. Our entire team is focused on executing to deliver further value for our shareholders from a number of in-flight strategic initiatives, including the ramp-up of Enlist, the launch of Brevant in the U.S. retail channel and the continued advancement of our Crop Protection pipeline following 2020, where we obtained more than 140 registrations globally for new active ingredients and formulations that we will start selling in 2021. 
We recognize that our 2020 performance was not where we need to be in terms of realizing the full operating leverage from organic growth and productivity programs in our earnings. For 2021, I am confident that we have made the necessary adjustments and are well positioned to deliver 15% to 20% operating EBITDA improvement for the year, including more than 200 basis points of margin improvement as the organization remains focused on executing on our targeted productivity actions. 
On capital allocation, you may recall that we discussed last quarter that we plan to accelerate the completion of our $1 billion share repurchase program by the end of 2021, which was 6 months ahead of our initial plan. Given our current cash position and outlook for 2021, we expect to complete most of the repurchases by midyear while maintaining our strong balance sheet and investing for growth. The bottom line, we view 2021 as a big step forward for Corteva, and I am confident we remain on track and laser-focused on delivering on our midterm targets. 
Turning next to Slide 5 and briefly touching on 2020 performance for the total company. For sales, strong organic growth in both segments and across all regions led to improved performance compared to our revised guidance, with double-digit organic growth for the year in both Latin America and Asia Pacific. Continued penetration of new and differentiated technology drove the increases, including 2% pricing in our corn and soybean portfolios globally. 
On operating EBITDA, we delivered 5% improvement for the year, exceeding our expectations compared to our revised guidance as organic growth and cost and productivity actions were partially offset by higher input costs and an unfavorable net currency impact. On currency, net of pricing, results were better than we had anticipated for the year as teams delivered strong execution on local pricing, coupled with favorable movement in exchange rates late in the fourth quarter. As a result, despite a 15 basis point decline in the fourth quarter on the absence of prior year divestitures, we extracted 33 basis points of margin expansion for the year, establishing a strong foundation for solid growth moving forward. 
Shifting the discussion to the market backdrop on Slide 6. While more resilient than some other sectors, the ag markets faced unexpected impacts resulted from the COVID-related disruptions. Throughout the year, we observed tremendous volatility, including commodity demand levels, acreage levels and foreign currency exchange rates. As our business is highly sensitive to these movements, we have closely and continuously monitored market conditions and remain agile to adjust our actions accordingly. 
As we entered the fourth quarter, fundamentals shifted and the outlook began to improve. Commodity demand has stabilized considerably with constructive trends out of China on grain purchases from the U.S. This trend, coupled with lower yields for 2020 U.S. crop and uncertainty in Brazil, has led to higher commodity prices, which also leads to improved outlook on farm income levels, resulting in the highest levels we've seen in 7 years. Government stimulus payments in the U.S. are also supporting farm income improvement. 
So after 2 straight years of unprecedented impacts from weather and the pandemic, we are pleased to see signs of a more favorable market environment for 2021. Taking our operational momentum into consideration, we are encouraged as strengthening ag fundamentals add additional support to our expectations to further accelerate our strategy and deliver strong growth in 2021. 
Now moving to Slide 7 for full year highlights on the top line performance from our teams around the globe. In North America, we delivered organic sales growth of 4% for the year, powered by high-performing technologies like Qrome corn seed, which provides growers an approximate 8- to 10-bushel per acre yield advantage over comparable products. 
In soybeans, as the recovery in planted acres helped volumes, we drove 2% pricing with a yield advantage lineup and disciplined execution by our teams. We also continue to make progress in accelerating the ramp-up of our Enlist system. While we entered 2020 expecting Enlist E3 soybeans to represent just 10% of our soybean volume, we finished the year well ahead of those expectations at approximately 17% of our volume and on 20% of total U.S. soybean acres. That has helped drive strong early demand for Enlist herbicides, which delivered $140 million in fourth quarter sales, more than double the prior year period. The full Enlist system delivered approximately $440 million in sales for the year, and we could not be more excited about how the system is gaining traction in the market. 
In Europe, Middle East and Africa, organic sales grew 8% in 2020 on strong demand for new and differentiated Crop Protection products, such as Arylex and Rinskor herbicides. Arylex is a product we are particularly excited about as it progressed through the European regulatory process faster than any product I can remember in recent years and really exemplifies our advantages in sustainable chemistry solutions, an area of growing demand where we have highly effective products in the market and in our pipeline. In Seed, we were able to drive volume and price gains as a result of our route-to-market expansions in Russia and Ukraine as well as share gains in corn. 
While significant currency volatility from the Brazilian real weighed on net sales in Latin America, we delivered 17% organic growth for the year. Here, we executed on market share gains in both Seed and Crop Protection and gained meaningful market share in the Brazil safrinha market while we continue to drive adoption of our novel Crop Protection products. The teams displayed strong execution on managing the volatility of local currency, which is evident in the $150 million in pricing for currency in Brazil for the year. 
In Asia Pacific, we realized 13% organic sales growth compared to prior year on both volume and price improvements. This progress is another proof point of continued penetration of our new technology as we drove the adoption of Rinskor and Arylex herbicides as well as other advantaged products like the spinosyn insecticide. During the period, we also benefited from strong demand for Seeds in India. 
Moving to Slide 8 for a more detailed review of our 2020 operating EBITDA performance. We delivered strong price/mix benefits of $210 million and volume benefits of $160 million from the continued penetration of our new and differentiated technology across all regions, representing important progress on our targets. Through these actions, we delivered $100 million in earnings improvement on the sales growth of $250 million of new Crop Protection products in 2020. At the same time, we drove Seed share gains in Europe and Latin America. Seed pricing improved operating EBITDA for the year, led by a 2% improvement globally for corn and 2% improvement for soybeans in North America. 
On cost, we delivered approximately $30 million in net operating EBITDA improvement for the year. This improvement reflects execution on the $230 million in productivity and cost actions, which were largely offset by higher input costs and reinvestments to accelerate future growth and profitability. Other was a headwind for 2020 and predominantly reflects the impact of asset divestitures in 2019. Lastly, gross currency impact to operating EBITDA was approximately $330 million before pricing and was predominantly due to the devaluation of the Brazilian real. To offset this headwind, local teams delivered approximately $150 million in pricing for currency, resulting in a net currency headwind of approximately $180 million for the year. 
Our growth initiatives are taking hold. And we continue to take action to reduce costs and drive productivity across the organization. Yesterday, we announced a restructuring program that includes facilities consolidations, footprint efficiencies and headcount reductions. This is part of delivering on our broader productivity programs. We are confident that we have reached the point where the investments we have made over the past few years will begin to accelerate earnings growth in 2021 and beyond. 
Now I'll turn it over to Greg to provide more detail on our results and the 2021 outlook."

Moving to Slide 9 and a more in-depth look at our performance in the Crop Protection segment. Organic sales for the fourth quarter grew 21% driven by an 11% improvement in volume and a 10% improvement in price. Robust demand for Enlist herbicides, coupled with fall applications of Optinyte in North America drove organic sales up 31% over prior year. Strong demand for our new products and pricing actions to offset currency also led to organic growth of 21% in Latin America and 17% in Asia Pacific for the quarter. Coupled with our productivity actions, this growth drove an approximate 70 basis point operating EBITDA margin benefit for the segment in the quarter despite the net impact of asset divestitures in 2019. 
For the full year, organic sales increased 11%, supported by continued growth in new products and in our differentiated spinosyns insecticide, both up double digits on an organic basis over prior year. This growth was partially offset by our strategic decision to phase out Chlorpyrifos and ramp-down of selected low-margin third-party products. Overall, Crop Protection results reflects price and volume gains in all regions, showing the balance and diversity of our new and differentiated products globally as well as our ability to grow organically above the market. Despite this organic sales growth, operating EBITDA for the segment has declined for the year due to the impact of currency, coupled with higher input costs, investments to support growth and the impact of asset divestitures in 2019. 
On costs, as we mentioned last quarter, we have taken several actions starting back at the completion of the merger in 2017 to streamline our manufacturing operations to drive better operating leverage in Crop Protection. Given the regulatory approval requirements in each of the jurisdictions where we sell our products, it takes several years for the benefit of our asset footprint actions to impact the bottom line. We should begin to see those benefits in 2021. On currency, we have recognized approximately $150 million in pricing for the year to offset the weakening Brazilian real. And pricing will continue to be a strategic lever for us going forward. 
Moving to the Seed segment on Slide 10. Organic sales for the fourth quarter were up 9% driven by strong safrinha corn sales in Brazil and deliveries in North America and Europe on an early start to the season. Operating EBITDA for the segment declined for the quarter due to the impact of currency and higher commodity costs. Full year organic sales grew 6% due to the soybean acreage rebound and improved price in North America, market share gains in Brazil and Europe corn and strong volume and price gains on new products particularly Qrome, PowerCore Ultra and Enlist E3 soybeans. Overall, price and volume gains coupled with productivity actions drove an approximate 190 basis point operating EBITDA margin benefit for the segment for the year. 
Turning now to Slide 11. I'll provide our full year guidance for 2021. Starting with net sales, we expect reported net sales to be between $14.4 billion and $14.6 billion, up roughly 2% over prior year at the midpoint of the range, with organic growth of about 3%. This primarily reflects the continued ramp of new products globally in both our Crop Protection and Seed segments, partially offset by the strategic decisions we made in our Crop Protection portfolio to further drive margin improvement. 
On operating EBITDA, we expect to deliver between $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion, an improvement of 17% year-over-year at the midpoint. With our expected top line growth and continued focus on delivering cost savings commitments, we expect to improve operating EBITDA margins by over 200 basis points on a total company basis. 
Turning to operating EPS. We expect to deliver between $1.85 and $1.95 per share, which would represent a 27% improvement over 2020 using the midpoint. We have provided supplemental information on our guidance in the appendix of our presentation. 
Focusing on operating EBITDA, Slide 12 provides our key assumptions. Starting with Seed, global demand for agricultural products continues to be strong. If new crop prices sustain current levels and weather remains favorable for a normal spring planting pace, we anticipate combined U.S. 2021 corn and soybean area will increase between 5 million and 8 million acres. Based on relative commodities prices, we expect that the planted area increase will be heavily biased towards soybeans. We will refine our assumptions when the market data is available as part of the March prospective planting estimates published by the USDA. 
In terms of Enlist expectations, consistent with what we shared on our third quarter call, we believe we could have greater than 35% of our units in Enlist E3 next year and anticipate as much as 30% of the soybean units in North America will carry the Enlist E3 trait. On Seed pricing, we expect to maintain our 2020 momentum and continue to extract value for yield-advantaged technology in corn globally, including further penetration of Qrome in our corn lineup. 
Turning to Crop Protection. We expect to deliver continued growth in our new product sales. This growth is underpinned by strong market demand for Enlist and Arylex herbicides and continued penetration of Isoclast insecticide globally. In total, we expect new Crop Protection products to contribute approximately $300 million in incremental sales growth during 2021. 
With respect to our differentiated technologies, we expect to release an additional 10% of spinosyns capacity in 2021, resulting in approximately $80 million of additional sales opportunity as demand will continue to exceed supply for this product in a growing targeted segment of the market. 
As I've mentioned, we have made strategic decisions to phase out Chlorpyrifos and to ramp down selected low-margin third-party products. While these changes are accretive to our margins, we do expect an approximate $75 million headwind to earnings in 2021 as a result of these decisions, which is included in our volume assumptions. 
Moving on to cost. We are targeting approximately $150 million in net cost savings in 2021, which includes $250 million in savings from our productivity programs, mostly related to the manufacturing and supply chain rationalization work we have underway in Crop Protection. We also expect the majority of our COVID-related savings in 2020 will be sustained in 2021. These savings will be partially offset by an approximate $100 million headwind in Seed input costs as a result of higher grower compensation costs due to rising commodity prices, along with unfavorable yields in Europe. 
Finally, on currency, we expect a headwind in 2021, given the change in the year-over-year rates for the Brazilian real and seasonality. Pricing will continue to be a lever to offset this impact as our commercial teams in Brazil actively price for changes in local currency. We anticipate we will recognize approximately $100 million in pricing for the year, reflecting a rate of approximately 5.50. Through our dynamic pricing, coupled with the financial instruments we have in place, we expect to further reduce volatility in our guidance, and we'll continually monitor movement in local currency rates as that could more directly impact our ability to price for currency. 
Turning now to Slide 13, I'll provide an update on our capital deployment targets over the midterm. As a result of our strong operational performance throughout 2020, coupled with effective working capital management, we ended the year with approximately $3.8 billion in cash and investments. That's after returning more than $660 million to shareholders this year through dividends and share repurchases. Building on this momentum, we expect to generate between $3 billion and $3.5 billion of operating cash flow in total for 2021 and 2022 combined, largely driven by earnings growth and continued focus on working capital productivity. 
Taking a look at the potential uses for cash, we have outlined several key priorities. Our first priority is to maintain a strong balance sheet with financial flexibility to support our industry-leading business model, which will allow us to fund investments in the business annually. These investments will reinforce and renew our innovation and market capabilities. We will also continue to explore paths to optimize our portfolio through opportunistic bolt-on M&A, including fruit and vegetable seeds, digital technology and biologicals. 
Finally, we are committed to accelerating the return of cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. In short, we see tremendous opportunity to return capital to our shareholders over the midterm. As you can see, we view the cash-generation capabilities of this business as very strong, and we are excited to share more details as we move forward in our journey. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Jim."

And yes, as we've said in the opening comments, 2021 is a big step forward for us. And I really believe we've reached an acceleration point given the investments and the strategies that we've been putting in place since 2017 and believe they will drive substantial earnings for the years ahead. And as a starting point for '21, I think you got to look at that fourth quarter momentum. That momentum is there and it's real, and it gives you a strong sense for where that growth is going to come from.
So as we've guided for '21, as you see on the chart, that 15% to 20% improvement in EBITDA, and that's a 200 basis point improvement in EBITDA margin. So I believe that guide is strong, and it's realistic. And as you've asked, let me give you some proof points on why I have some confidence in it. 2/3 of the improvement in the business this next year is going to come through our Crop Protection business. And that's tied to the productivity improvements that we put in place, a number of footprint reduction projects as they have started to flow through cost of sales. And you can really begin to see that in our CP margins. 
You add to that the continued ramp-up of either the new products that we've talked so much about, about $300-or-so million of new -- of incremental new product sales. And then you start to unleash the spinosyn capacity that we have been investing in. And so overall, you get about $400 million of growth there. And then all of that on Crop Protection is net of now the strategic decisions that we made to exit a number of key products. So while those decisions have been headwinds in the past, we've got those behind us now. So the numbers we're talking to you about are net numbers. 
And then about 1/3 of that improvement next year is tied to our Seed business, and really got to start that discussion by just looking at Latin America, the tremendous momentum we carried in the fourth quarter. And then you add to that expectations of, I don't know, 5 million to 8 million acres of new crop coming back into corn and soybeans in North America, probably heavily weighted to soybeans but it's real out there. You can see it tied to the really strong demand that's in the marketplace, and that's being reflected in commodity prices. 
And then the other confidence I have in our Seed business is with respect to pricing. You look at what we delivered in 2020, kind of 2% price improvement in corn and 2% price improvement in soybeans globally. We've got a track record now there and so we're going to count on that track record. We will have a little headwind in the Seed business tied to commodity prices and cost of sales. And then don't forget about Brevant as we're thinking about the bridge next year. We're just scratching the surface of what Brevant and as well as Enlist is going to be able to deliver for us. So I think this is a strong and realistic guide for 2021 and I have a lot of confidence in this plan and my team that we can deliver that."

And that's that kind of 12% to 16% EBITDA growth using that 2019 as a baseline. So we're not going to provide guidance for 2022, specific guidance for '22. But we do see that continued momentum that I was just talking about that we have going into 2021. And so it's a little hard to sit here today and predict the market in '22, but we can talk about the levers that are still going to be within our control that have given me confidence to confirm those midterm targets. 
And you start in Seed with, really, Enlist. And in 2021, we're just scratching the surface on the margin lift that Enlist can deliver for us. By 2022, we're really into the noticeable improvement in net royalty expense as we not only ramp up the top line revenue, but we ramp up the proprietary portion of those sales that are in Corteva germplasm. And then we're going to continue to see improvement in the rest of our portfolio in a few other areas. And then I mentioned -- I always need to keep reminding folks about Brevant. Again, '21, just -- it's going to be a good year, a good start year for us, but 2022 will allow us to continue that momentum into that retail channel with Brevant. 
On Crop Protection, the main story there is momentum. We delivered $250 million of new product incremental revenue in 2020. '21 is going to be another strong year with about $300 million of incremental from those new products. We had 140 new product registrations that we receive right here at the end of 2020 that will just start having momentum in '21, and you'll feel that again in '22. And then on top of the top line revenue that we'll get from Crop Protection, by '22, you're really starting to see the compounding effects of better margins on that new chemistry as higher volumes flow through that same asset base and take up -- we start to spread that fixed cost over a much broader base. So you're seeing some of that in '21, but as those new product sales continue to ramp, it shows up in '22. 
On top of that, the further improvements that you're going to see from the asset footprint work that we're doing. And we got a good start of that this year coming up and will show up next year. So all of these levers, we really have within our control. And again, while it's early, we've still got '21 to get through and, again, tough to predict what that market will look like, but we've got our hands firmly on these levers, and that's what's going to propel us to those midterm targets."

And then this year, you're talking about another $100 million. So on a 2-year stack, if my math's right, you're up $175 million to $200 million. And I guess my question is, is if we have sort of normal production in the U.S. and Europe this year and if the futures curve for corn and soy is correct and commodity prices are lower into next year, does that mean there's going to be $170 million to $200 million Seed production cost tailwind in '22?

For 2021, we are expecting approximately $100 million in Seed input cost headwinds. Those are predominantly due to the higher commodity prices for soybeans that impact our grower compensation program, the way we compensate growers for producing seed. And we also had lower seed field yields in Europe. It was a tough seed production here. So just as background, we go out and we contract with independent growers to produce our commercial seed and they have the opportunity to lock in a commodity price rate during a window. And especially with soybeans, as we saw that run-up late in the season, they locked in at higher rates. 
We go into every year with our best foot forward. So as we put seed in the ground in '21 for '22 production, clearly, we will lap those higher commodity prices. And if we see some tail-off there, we'll benefit from that. And we'll expect to always have good solid yield production in our fields. We work with a lot of irrigated fields, so we try to take the weather out of that as much as possible. So we're -- we've seen good trends, and I think we've got a lot in play that should help support us as we come out of '21 into '22."

As we think about the market next -- this season, 2021, it's always a competitive marketplace, and it will be just as competitive as we saw in 2020 even with the commodity pricing backdrop. So we're going to continue to go out there and get paid for the value that we deliver to growers, especially when it comes to the yield-advantaged technology that we're putting out there. And most notably, we really do see that in corn. 
And we've established a really strong track record, that I mentioned earlier, of extracting that value for our technology. And all you got to do is go back and look at our 2020 performance, where we delivered 2% pricing in corn and soybeans, and that's globally. So this is always a market-specific phenomenon. But when you step back and look at our performance last year, we did that everywhere. And so we're -- as we sit here today, we're very pleased with the pace of the orders that are coming in, in both our Pioneer brand in North America as well as Brevant brand through those channels. And so I'm confident on that value question that we'll carry that momentum into 2021.

Due to the merger, we did inherit a number of U.S. manufacturing locations that have been more expensive then what I had personally experienced in the past around a more outsourced or a more localized approach to the business. So we didn't wait to take any actions to start optimizing the supply chain. Since merge, since the close of the merger, we've shut down 9 manufacturing assets and we are starting to see the benefits of those lower-cost supply chains. 
So I do believe that 2021 is really an inflection point for us. You really haven't seen much of the benefits of those actions yet. And that's kind of related to the amount of time that it takes to clear the regulatory hurdles. Every time you make a change in your supply chain, you have to go back and resubmit dossiers to regulatory authorities in every country around the world. So you saw some restructuring. The 8-K that we filed, that had restructuring in it. That's just part of those programs that we've talked about, and we'll just kind of continue to roll forward.
So in our guides, in our confirmation of our midterm targets, we've included those strategic decisions in those guides. It's one of the tools that we have and one of the ways that we get there and have confidence that they're achievable. And then we're always looking for opportunities and new ideas. We take every one of our active ingredients that we produce and we ask ourselves the question, can we be the lowest-cost producer of that product? And when that answer is no, the teams begin looking for alternate sources. 
And when that answer is yes but we need project work to get there, we begin to put those initiatives in place to drive that. So the best example I can point to is if you look at 2021's EBITDA improvement, 2/3 of that improvement is going to be coming from those initiatives in our Crop Protection business. So I got a lot of confidence, a lot of great visibility of those initiatives that are in-flight and exactly where we are in each one of those manufacturing units and those cost-of-sales points to be able to point to that."

So I'm pretty confident in soy as well. We held. If not, we were up slightly.

Clearly, the improving commodity price markets helps the psychology of everybody involved. And as what they think, farmers always think about their decisions as investments in their future to drive productivity and yield. And so high",409,"Great. Thanks, Steve. Clearly, the improving commodity price markets helps the psychology of everybody involved. And as what they think, farmers always think about their decisions as investments in their future to drive productivity and yield. And so higher commodity prices means that they will continue to push for yield and be able to take advantage of that yield. 
And what I like about what we're seeing right now is we feel like the demand side of this equation that's driving those commodity prices is pretty durable for the 1- to 2-year term as we look out. China's demand curve seems to be strong as they're rebuilding their pork industry. And we know we've got demand for exports in other markets and strong demand for animal feed that we're seeing come back in North America and with the carryover stocks where we're seeing them. So I, like you, believe that we have support for those commodity prices here for the next 2 or 3 years. And that's driving our acreage assumptions as well. 
I would expect 180 million, 182 million corn and soybean acres when you combine them, a little hard to call the split there, but probably the best news we're hearing right now is what we don't seem to be -- it's going to favor soybeans. We know that any increases will go into soybean acreage, but it's not coming out of corn. So it's really setting up for both a strong corn and bean. When you look at our revenue guide for next year, as you mentioned, just remember that in that guide that there's -- that is a net top line revenue number and it's net of about $300 million of revenue that we phased out of from 2020 going into '21. 
The first of those strategic decisions around Chlorpyrifos. And then several other low-margin products, very, very generic and just probably not the right kind of products for our portfolio going forward. So we're certainly in a mix enrichment and a refreshment of that portfolio and basically have the majority of those big strategic decisions now behind us. So back to my comment earlier, I think this guide, it's a strong and a realistic guide with all of those elements really baked into it. And we still have a full season ahead. We're sitting here early in '21, a lot to go but we're confident we've set this at the right spot. Thanks, Steve."

As I reflect on the year, 2020 was a year of profound societal and economic disruptions globally. Despite these challenges, I'm extremely proud of the continued resiliency of our company. Our global teams have worked aggressively to keep our employees and customers safe, our supply chains open and our growth commitments on track. Our progress as a company in managing through the pandemic and other disruptions over the last year confirms the strength and durability of our strategy. 
Underpinning our progress is our strong organic sales growth for the full year, where our teams delivered gains in both Seed and Crop Protection and across all regions. Transforming our cost structure remains a priority for Corteva to deliver on our targeted earnings growth. We demonstrated our commitment to cost reductions in 2020 by managing spending and delivering on our productivity programs. These savings were mostly offset from headwinds that we had anticipated, such as higher input costs and investments to support growth in addition to unfavorable currency. Despite these hurdles, we delivered solid operating EBITDA improvement for the year. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We continue to strengthen our financial position as we ended the year with cash and investments of roughly $3.8 billion. Further, our cash, net of debt, improved by approximately $1 billion over the prior year as a result of the organization's focus on disciplined capital deployment and strong execution on working capital productivity. The company made progress on returning cash to shareholders with more than $660 million returned via dividends and share repurchases. 
Looking ahead, we see 2021 as a year in which we will accelerate on our path and expect to capitalize on the significant momentum we have built as the investments we made since 2017 begin to drive substantial earnings improvement. Our entire team is focused on executing to deliver further value for our shareholders from a number of in-flight strategic initiatives, including the ramp-up of Enlist, the launch of Brevant in the U.S. retail channel and the continued advancement of our Crop Protection pipeline following 2020, where we obtained more than 140 registrations globally for new active ingredients and formulations that we will start selling in 2021. 
We recognize that our 2020 performance was not where we need to be in terms of realizing the full operating leverage from organic growth and productivity programs in our earnings. For 2021, I am confident that we have made the necessary adjustments and are well positioned to deliver 15% to 20% operating EBITDA improvement for the year, including more than 200 basis points of margin improvement as the organization remains focused on executing on our targeted productivity actions. 
On capital allocation, you may recall that we discussed last quarter that we plan to accelerate the completion of our $1 billion share repurchase program by the end of 2021, which was 6 months ahead of our initial plan. Given our current cash position and outlook for 2021, we expect to complete most of the repurchases by midyear while maintaining our strong balance sheet and investing for growth. The bottom line, we view 2021 as a big step forward for Corteva, and I am confident we remain on track and laser-focused on delivering on our midterm targets. 
Turning next to Slide 5 and briefly touching on 2020 performance for the total company. For sales, strong organic growth in both segments and across all regions led to improved performance compared to our revised guidance, with double-digit organic growth for the year in both Latin America and Asia Pacific. Continued penetration of new and differentiated technology drove the increases, including 2% pricing in our corn and soybean portfolios globally. 
On operating EBITDA, we delivered 5% improvement for the year, exceeding our expectations compared to our revised guidance as organic growth and cost and productivity actions were partially offset by higher input costs and an unfavorable net currency impact. On currency, net of pricing, results were better than we had anticipated for the year as teams delivered strong execution on local pricing, coupled with favorable movement in exchange rates late in the fourth quarter. As a result, despite a 15 basis point decline in the fourth quarter on the absence of prior year divestitures, we extracted 33 basis points of margin expansion for the year, establishing a strong foundation for solid growth moving forward. 
Shifting the discussion to the market backdrop on Slide 6. While more resilient than some other sectors, the ag markets faced unexpected impacts resulted from the COVID-related disruptions. Throughout the year, we observed tremendous volatility, including commodity demand levels, acreage levels and foreign currency exchange rates. As our business is highly sensitive to these movements, we have closely and continuously monitored market conditions and remain agile to adjust our actions accordingly. 
As we entered the fourth quarter, fundamentals shifted and the outlook began to improve. Commodity demand has stabilized considerably with constructive trends out of China on grain purchases from the U.S. This trend, coupled with lower yields for 2020 U.S. crop and uncertainty in Brazil, has led to higher commodity prices, which also leads to improved outlook on farm income levels, resulting in the highest levels we've seen in 7 years. Government stimulus payments in the U.S. are also supporting farm income improvement. 
So after 2 straight years of unprecedented impacts from weather and the pandemic, we are pleased to see signs of a more favorable market environment for 2021. Taking our operational momentum into consideration, we are encouraged as strengthening ag fundamentals add additional support to our expectations to further accelerate our strategy and deliver strong growth in 2021. 
Now moving to Slide 7 for full year highlights on the top line performance from our teams around the globe. In North America, we delivered organic sales growth of 4% for the year, powered by high-performing technologies like Qrome corn seed, which provides growers an approximate 8- to 10-bushel per acre yield advantage over comparable products. 
In soybeans, as the recovery in planted acres helped volumes, we drove 2% pricing with a yield advantage lineup and disciplined execution by our teams. We also continue to make progress in accelerating the ramp-up of our Enlist system. While we entered 2020 expecting Enlist E3 soybeans to represent just 10% of our soybean volume, we finished the year well ahead of those expectations at approximately 17% of our volume and on 20% of total U.S. soybean acres. That has helped drive strong early demand for Enlist herbicides, which delivered $140 million in fourth quarter sales, more than double the prior year period. The full Enlist system delivered approximately $440 million in sales for the year, and we could not be more excited about how the system is gaining traction in the market. 
In Europe, Middle East and Africa, organic sales grew 8% in 2020 on strong demand for new and differentiated Crop Protection products, such as Arylex and Rinskor herbicides. Arylex is a product we are particularly excited about as it progressed through the European regulatory process faster than any product I can remember in recent years and really exemplifies our advantages in sustainable chemistry solutions, an area of growing demand where we have highly effective products in the market and in our pipeline. In Seed, we were able to drive volume and price gains as a result of our route-to-market expansions in Russia and Ukraine as well as share gains in corn. 
While significant currency volatility from the Brazilian real weighed on net sales in Latin America, we delivered 17% organic growth for the year. Here, we executed on market share gains in both Seed and Crop Protection and gained meaningful market share in the Brazil safrinha market while we continue to drive adoption of our novel Crop Protection products. The teams displayed strong execution on managing the volatility of local currency, which is evident in the $150 million in pricing for currency in Brazil for the year. 
In Asia Pacific, we realized 13% organic sales growth compared to prior year on both volume and price improvements. This progress is another proof point of continued penetration of our new technology as we drove the adoption of Rinskor and Arylex herbicides as well as other advantaged products like the spinosyn insecticide. During the period, we also benefited from strong demand for Seeds in India. 
Moving to Slide 8 for a more detailed review of our 2020 operating EBITDA performance. We delivered strong price/mix benefits of $210 million and volume benefits of $160 million from the continued penetration of our new and differentiated technology across all regions, representing important progress on our targets. Through these actions, we delivered $100 million in earnings improvement on the sales growth of $250 million of new Crop Protection products in 2020. At the same time, we drove Seed share gains in Europe and Latin America. Seed pricing improved operating EBITDA for the year, led by a 2% improvement globally for corn and 2% improvement for soybeans in North America. 
On cost, we delivered approximately $30 million in net operating EBITDA improvement for the year. This improvement reflects execution on the $230 million in productivity and cost actions, which were largely offset by higher input costs and reinvestments to accelerate future growth and profitability. Other was a headwind for 2020 and predominantly reflects the impact of asset divestitures in 2019. Lastly, gross currency impact to operating EBITDA was approximately $330 million before pricing and was predominantly due to the devaluation of the Brazilian real. To offset this headwind, local teams delivered approximately $150 million in pricing for currency, resulting in a net currency headwind of approximately $180 million for the year. 
Our growth initiatives are taking hold. And we continue to take action to reduce costs and drive productivity across the organization. Yesterday, we announced a restructuring program that includes facilities consolidations, footprint efficiencies and headcount reductions. This is part of delivering on our broader productivity programs. We are confident that we have reached the point where the investments we have made over the past few years will begin to accelerate earnings growth in 2021 and beyond. 
Now I'll turn it over to Greg to provide more detail on our results and the 2021 outlook."

Moving to Slide 9 and a more in-depth look at our performance in the Crop Protection segment. Organic sales for the fourth quarter grew 21% driven by an 11% improvement in volume and a 10% improvement in price. Robust demand for Enlist herbicides, coupled with fall applications of Optinyte in North America drove organic sales up 31% over prior year. Strong demand for our new products and pricing actions to offset currency also led to organic growth of 21% in Latin America and 17% in Asia Pacific for the quarter. Coupled with our productivity actions, this growth drove an approximate 70 basis point operating EBITDA margin benefit for the segment in the quarter despite the net impact of asset divestitures in 2019. 
For the full year, organic sales increased 11%, supported by continued growth in new products and in our differentiated spinosyns insecticide, both up double digits on an organic basis over prior year. This growth was partially offset by our strategic decision to phase out Chlorpyrifos and ramp-down of selected low-margin third-party products. Overall, Crop Protection results reflects price and volume gains in all regions, showing the balance and diversity of our new and differentiated products globally as well as our ability to grow organically above the market. Despite this organic sales growth, operating EBITDA for the segment has declined for the year due to the impact of currency, coupled with higher input costs, investments to support growth and the impact of asset divestitures in 2019. 
On costs, as we mentioned last quarter, we have taken several actions starting back at the completion of the merger in 2017 to streamline our manufacturing operations to drive better operating leverage in Crop Protection. Given the regulatory approval requirements in each of the jurisdictions where we sell our products, it takes several years for the benefit of our asset footprint actions to impact the bottom line. We should begin to see those benefits in 2021. On currency, we have recognized approximately $150 million in pricing for the year to offset the weakening Brazilian real. And pricing will continue to be a strategic lever for us going forward. 
Moving to the Seed segment on Slide 10. Organic sales for the fourth quarter were up 9% driven by strong safrinha corn sales in Brazil and deliveries in North America and Europe on an early start to the season. Operating EBITDA for the segment declined for the quarter due to the impact of currency and higher commodity costs. Full year organic sales grew 6% due to the soybean acreage rebound and improved price in North America, market share gains in Brazil and Europe corn and strong volume and price gains on new products particularly Qrome, PowerCore Ultra and Enlist E3 soybeans. Overall, price and volume gains coupled with productivity actions drove an approximate 190 basis point operating EBITDA margin benefit for the segment for the year. 
Turning now to Slide 11. I'll provide our full year guidance for 2021. Starting with net sales, we expect reported net sales to be between $14.4 billion and $14.6 billion, up roughly 2% over prior year at the midpoint of the range, with organic growth of about 3%. This primarily reflects the continued ramp of new products globally in both our Crop Protection and Seed segments, partially offset by the strategic decisions we made in our Crop Protection portfolio to further drive margin improvement. 
On operating EBITDA, we expect to deliver between $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion, an improvement of 17% year-over-year at the midpoint. With our expected top line growth and continued focus on delivering cost savings commitments, we expect to improve operating EBITDA margins by over 200 basis points on a total company basis. 
Turning to operating EPS. We expect to deliver between $1.85 and $1.95 per share, which would represent a 27% improvement over 2020 using the midpoint. We have provided supplemental information on our guidance in the appendix of our presentation. 
Focusing on operating EBITDA, Slide 12 provides our key assumptions. Starting with Seed, global demand for agricultural products continues to be strong. If new crop prices sustain current levels and weather remains favorable for a normal spring planting pace, we anticipate combined U.S. 2021 corn and soybean area will increase between 5 million and 8 million acres. Based on relative commodities prices, we expect that the planted area increase will be heavily biased towards soybeans. We will refine our assumptions when the market data is available as part of the March prospective planting estimates published by the USDA. 
In terms of Enlist expectations, consistent with what we shared on our third quarter call, we believe we could have greater than 35% of our units in Enlist E3 next year and anticipate as much as 30% of the soybean units in North America will carry the Enlist E3 trait. On Seed pricing, we expect to maintain our 2020 momentum and continue to extract value for yield-advantaged technology in corn globally, including further penetration of Qrome in our corn lineup. 
Turning to Crop Protection. We expect to deliver continued growth in our new product sales. This growth is underpinned by strong market demand for Enlist and Arylex herbicides and continued penetration of Isoclast insecticide globally. In total, we expect new Crop Protection products to contribute approximately $300 million in incremental sales growth during 2021. 
With respect to our differentiated technologies, we expect to release an additional 10% of spinosyns capacity in 2021, resulting in approximately $80 million of additional sales opportunity as demand will continue to exceed supply for this product in a growing targeted segment of the market. 
As I've mentioned, we have made strategic decisions to phase out Chlorpyrifos and to ramp down selected low-margin third-party products. While these changes are accretive to our margins, we do expect an approximate $75 million headwind to earnings in 2021 as a result of these decisions, which is included in our volume assumptions. 
Moving on to cost. We are targeting approximately $150 million in net cost savings in 2021, which includes $250 million in savings from our productivity programs, mostly related to the manufacturing and supply chain rationalization work we have underway in Crop Protection. We also expect the majority of our COVID-related savings in 2020 will be sustained in 2021. These savings will be partially offset by an approximate $100 million headwind in Seed input costs as a result of higher grower compensation costs due to rising commodity prices, along with unfavorable yields in Europe. 
Finally, on currency, we expect a headwind in 2021, given the change in the year-over-year rates for the Brazilian real and seasonality. Pricing will continue to be a lever to offset this impact as our commercial teams in Brazil actively price for changes in local currency. We anticipate we will recognize approximately $100 million in pricing for the year, reflecting a rate of approximately 5.50. Through our dynamic pricing, coupled with the financial instruments we have in place, we expect to further reduce volatility in our guidance, and we'll continually monitor movement in local currency rates as that could more directly impact our ability to price for currency. 
Turning now to Slide 13, I'll provide an update on our capital deployment targets over the midterm. As a result of our strong operational performance throughout 2020, coupled with effective working capital management, we ended the year with approximately $3.8 billion in cash and investments. That's after returning more than $660 million to shareholders this year through dividends and share repurchases. Building on this momentum, we expect to generate between $3 billion and $3.5 billion of operating cash flow in total for 2021 and 2022 combined, largely driven by earnings growth and continued focus on working capital productivity. 
Taking a look at the potential uses for cash, we have outlined several key priorities. Our first priority is to maintain a strong balance sheet with financial flexibility to support our industry-leading business model, which will allow us to fund investments in the business annually. These investments will reinforce and renew our innovation and market capabilities. We will also continue to explore paths to optimize our portfolio through opportunistic bolt-on M&A, including fruit and vegetable seeds, digital technology and biologicals. 
Finally, we are committed to accelerating the return of cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. In short, we see tremendous opportunity to return capital to our shareholders over the midterm. As you can see, we view the cash-generation capabilities of this business as very strong, and we are excited to share more details as we move forward in our journey. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Jim."

At Corteva, we believe in the fundamental importance of listening and incorporating ideas that will help advance our mission and our objectives, and we continue to do that. 
While I am pleased with our progress, I am not satisfied with our relatively flat earnings over the past 3 years. We have learned, we've adapted and are now very well positioned to accelerate our growth and deliver on the tremendous opportunities we have created through our targeted investments and disciplined emphasis on cost and productivity. So as I consider our path ahead, there is no doubt we have aligned our culture and gained the trust of our customers. At the same time, we have the right products and our portfolio transformation is underway and we have the productivity programs in place to deliver our future. Through disciplined and focused execution, we are confident this plan will deliver meaningful earnings growth and margin expansion in the near-term and significant sustained long-term value for all of our shareholders, and importantly, puts Corteva fully on track to achieve our midterm targets. 
I'll hand the call back to you, Jeff."

And I really believe we've reached an acceleration point given the investments and the strategies that we've been putting in place since 2017 and belie",555,"Great. Thanks, Joel. And yes, as we've said in the opening comments, 2021 is a big step forward for us. And I really believe we've reached an acceleration point given the investments and the strategies that we've been putting in place since 2017 and believe they will drive substantial earnings for the years ahead. And as a starting point for '21, I think you got to look at that fourth quarter momentum. That momentum is there and it's real, and it gives you a strong sense for where that growth is going to come from.
So as we've guided for '21, as you see on the chart, that 15% to 20% improvement in EBITDA, and that's a 200 basis point improvement in EBITDA margin. So I believe that guide is strong, and it's realistic. And as you've asked, let me give you some proof points on why I have some confidence in it. 2/3 of the improvement in the business this next year is going to come through our Crop Protection business. And that's tied to the productivity improvements that we put in place, a number of footprint reduction projects as they have started to flow through cost of sales. And you can really begin to see that in our CP margins. 
You add to that the continued ramp-up of either the new products that we've talked so much about, about $300-or-so million of new -- of incremental new product sales. And then you start to unleash the spinosyn capacity that we have been investing in. And so overall, you get about $400 million of growth there. And then all of that on Crop Protection is net of now the strategic decisions that we made to exit a number of key products. So while those decisions have been headwinds in the past, we've got those behind us now. So the numbers we're talking to you about are net numbers. 
And then about 1/3 of that improvement next year is tied to our Seed business, and really got to start that discussion by just looking at Latin America, the tremendous momentum we carried in the fourth quarter. And then you add to that expectations of, I don't know, 5 million to 8 million acres of new crop coming back into corn and soybeans in North America, probably heavily weighted to soybeans but it's real out there. You can see it tied to the really strong demand that's in the marketplace, and that's being reflected in commodity prices. 
And then the other confidence I have in our Seed business is with respect to pricing. You look at what we delivered in 2020, kind of 2% price improvement in corn and 2% price improvement in soybeans globally. We've got a track record now there and so we're going to count on that track record. We will have a little headwind in the Seed business tied to commodity prices and cost of sales. And then don't forget about Brevant as we're thinking about the bridge next year. We're just scratching the surface of what Brevant and as well as Enlist is going to be able to deliver for us. So I think this is a strong and realistic guide for 2021 and I have a lot of confidence in this plan and my team that we can deliver that."

And that's that kind of 12% to 16% EBITDA growth using that 2019 as a baseline. So we're not going to provide guidance for 2022, specific guidance for '22. But we do see that continued momentum that I was just talking about that we have going into 2021. And so it's a little hard to sit here today and predict the market in '22, but we can talk about the levers that are still going to be within our control that have given me confidence to confirm those midterm targets. 
And you start in Seed with, really, Enlist. And in 2021, we're just scratching the surface on the margin lift that Enlist can deliver for us. By 2022, we're really into the noticeable improvement in net royalty expense as we not only ramp up the top line revenue, but we ramp up the proprietary portion of those sales that are in Corteva germplasm. And then we're going to continue to see improvement in the rest of our portfolio in a few other areas. And then I mentioned -- I always need to keep reminding folks about Brevant. Again, '21, just -- it's going to be a good year, a good start year for us, but 2022 will allow us to continue that momentum into that retail channel with Brevant. 
On Crop Protection, the main story there is momentum. We delivered $250 million of new product incremental revenue in 2020. '21 is going to be another strong year with about $300 million of incremental from those new products. We had 140 new product registrations that we receive right here at the end of 2020 that will just start having momentum in '21, and you'll feel that again in '22. And then on top of the top line revenue that we'll get from Crop Protection, by '22, you're really starting to see the compounding effects of better margins on that new chemistry as higher volumes flow through that same asset base and take up -- we start to spread that fixed cost over a much broader base. So you're seeing some of that in '21, but as those new product sales continue to ramp, it shows up in '22. 
On top of that, the further improvements that you're going to see from the asset footprint work that we're doing. And we got a good start of that this year coming up and will show up next year. So all of these levers, we really have within our control. And again, while it's early, we've still got '21 to get through and, again, tough to predict what that market will look like, but we've got our hands firmly on these levers, and that's what's going to propel us to those midterm targets."

And then this year, you're talking about another $100 million. So on a 2-year stack, if my math's right, you're up $175 million to $200 million. And I guess my question is, is if we have sort of normal production in the U.S. and Europe this year and if the futures curve for corn and soy is correct and commodity prices are lower into next year, does that mean there's going to be $170 million to $200 million Seed production cost tailwind in '22?

For 2021, we are expecting approximately $100 million in Seed input cost headwinds. Those are predominantly due to the higher commodity prices for soybeans that impact our grower compensation program, the way we compensate growers for producing seed. And we also had lower seed field yields in Europe. It was a tough seed production here. So just as background, we go out and we contract with independent growers to produce our commercial seed and they have the opportunity to lock in a commodity price rate during a window. And especially with soybeans, as we saw that run-up late in the season, they locked in at higher rates. 
We go into every year with our best foot forward. So as we put seed in the ground in '21 for '22 production, clearly, we will lap those higher commodity prices. And if we see some tail-off there, we'll benefit from that. And we'll expect to always have good solid yield production in our fields. We work with a lot of irrigated fields, so we try to take the weather out of that as much as possible. So we're -- we've seen good trends, and I think we've got a lot in play that should help support us as we come out of '21 into '22."

As we think about the market next -- this season, 2021, it's always a competitive marketplace, and it will be just as competitive as we saw in 2020 even with the commodity pricing backdrop. So we're going to continue to go out there and get paid for the value that we deliver to growers, especially when it comes to the yield-advantaged technology that we're putting out there. And most notably, we really do see that in corn. 
And we've established a really strong track record, that I mentioned earlier, of extracting that value for our technology. And all you got to do is go back and look at our 2020 performance, where we delivered 2% pricing in corn and soybeans, and that's globally. So this is always a market-specific phenomenon. But when you step back and look at our performance last year, we did that everywhere. And so we're -- as we sit here today, we're very pleased with the pace of the orders that are coming in, in both our Pioneer brand in North America as well as Brevant brand through those channels. And so I'm confident on that value question that we'll carry that momentum into 2021.

Due to the merger, we did inherit a number of U.S. manufacturing locations that have been more expensive then what I had personally experienced in the past around a more outsourced or a more localized approach to the business. So we didn't wait to take any actions to start optimizing the supply chain. Since merge, since the close of the merger, we've shut down 9 manufacturing assets and we are starting to see the benefits of those lower-cost supply chains. 
So I do believe that 2021 is really an inflection point for us. You really haven't seen much of the benefits of those actions yet. And that's kind of related to the amount of time that it takes to clear the regulatory hurdles. Every time you make a change in your supply chain, you have to go back and resubmit dossiers to regulatory authorities in every country around the world. So you saw some restructuring. The 8-K that we filed, that had restructuring in it. That's just part of those programs that we've talked about, and we'll just kind of continue to roll forward.
So in our guides, in our confirmation of our midterm targets, we've included those strategic decisions in those guides. It's one of the tools that we have and one of the ways that we get there and have confidence that they're achievable. And then we're always looking for opportunities and new ideas. We take every one of our active ingredients that we produce and we ask ourselves the question, can we be the lowest-cost producer of that product? And when that answer is no, the teams begin looking for alternate sources. 
And when that answer is yes but we need project work to get there, we begin to put those initiatives in place to drive that. So the best example I can point to is if you look at 2021's EBITDA improvement, 2/3 of that improvement is going to be coming from those initiatives in our Crop Protection business. So I got a lot of confidence, a lot of great visibility of those initiatives that are in-flight and exactly where we are in each one of those manufacturing units and those cost-of-sales points to be able to point to that."

And in Brazil, both in the safrinha season as well as summer. And we've got just fantastic lineup and our teams really executed very, very well. It's a little too early to call on share gains in North America. We really have to get that last round of USDA data that gives us the plantings of what happened right down to a kind of a county level. So it's -- we'll kind of have that final call on North America in mid-March. But look, I'm confident that we held share, at least, for sure, in corn in North America while delivering above-market share -- above-market pricing gains. So our story in North America was really all about value. 
And in soybeans, from a global perspective, we saw some slight declines in volumes. But for us, it's the U.S. that really matters. And our U.S. Seed volumes in soybeans were up. So I'm pretty confident in soy as well. We held. If not, we were up slightly. And one more time in soybeans, that 2% pricing on a look-back basis shows that we not only -- we held, if not gained slightly, and drove much higher value. So those are the big markets. But maybe, Tim, you want to share either the broader perspective of how we're doing on market shares in other markets around the world, other crops?"

I think on a global basis, we obviously are still in the early days, and we don't have all competitive metrics in place, but that certainly seems like on a global basis that we would have outperformed the market on CP as well as I think we can confidently say in EMEA as well as Asia Pacific. We've been ahead of the market really throughout the year and had strong finishes there. 
In North America, we've sort of been hanging with the market for most of the year in Crop Protection. And we even -- we had a really strong finish to the year as well. And so we'll see where that puts us. Maybe a little optimistic that we will end up above the market for North America. We've had strong finish. And in Latin America, we -- fair to say that we started off the year behind the market in the first half. We felt like we were catching as we went through the third quarter and a really strong finish in the fourth quarter.
And as we anticipated and again, I think much like North America, we have some reason to believe that once everything's tallied up, that we're going to be certainly with the market and maybe just ahead of it on the Crop Protection side. So in conjunction with the Seed share position that Jim talked about, I think we can feel really proud of how we performed versus the market in the Crop Protection side, again, with strong pricing to support it."

Clearly, the improving commodity price markets helps the psychology of everybody involved.

Clearly, the improving commodity price markets helps the psychology of everybody involved. And as what they think, farmers always think about their decisions as investments in their future to drive productivity and yield. And so higher commodity prices means that they will continue to push for yield and be able to take advantage of that yield. 
And what I like about what we're seeing right now is we feel like the demand side of this equation that's driving those commodity prices is pretty durable for the 1- to 2-year term as we look out. China's demand curve seems to be strong as they're rebuilding their pork industry. And we know we've got demand for exports in other markets and strong demand for animal feed that we're seeing come back in North America and with the carryover stocks where we're seeing them. So I, like you, believe that we have support for those commodity prices here for the next 2 or 3 years. And that's driving our acreage assumptions as well. 
I would expect 180 million, 182 million corn and soybean acres when you combine them, a little hard to call the split there, but probably the best news we're hearing right now is what we don't seem to be -- it's going to favor soybeans. We know that any increases will go into soybean acreage, but it's not coming out of corn. So it's really setting up for both a strong corn and bean. When you look at our revenue guide for next year, as you mentioned, just remember that in that guide that there's -- that is a net top line revenue number and it's net of about $300 million of revenue that we phased out of from 2020 going into '21. 
The first of those strategic decisions around Chlorpyrifos. And then several other low-margin products, very, very generic and just probably not the right kind of products for our portfolio going forward. So we're certainly in a mix enrichment and a refreshment of that portfolio and basically have the majority of those big strategic decisions now behind us. So back to my comment earlier, I think this guide, it's a strong and a realistic guide with all of those elements really baked into it. And we still have a full season ahead. We're sitting here early in '21, a lot to go but we're confident we've set this at the right spot. Thanks, Steve."

As I reflect on the year, 2020 was a year of profound societal and economic disruptions globally. Despite these challenges, I'm extremely proud of the continued resiliency of our company. Our global teams have worked aggressively to keep our employees and customers safe, our supply chains open and our growth commitments on track. Our progress as a company in managing through the pandemic and other disruptions over the last year confirms the strength and durability of our strategy. 
Underpinning our progress is our strong organic sales growth for the full year, where our teams delivered gains in both Seed and Crop Protection and across all regions. Transforming our cost structure remains a priority for Corteva to deliver on our targeted earnings growth. We demonstrated our commitment to cost reductions in 2020 by managing spending and delivering on our productivity programs. These savings were mostly offset from headwinds that we had anticipated, such as higher input costs and investments to support growth in addition to unfavorable currency. Despite these hurdles, we delivered solid operating EBITDA improvement for the year. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We continue to strengthen our financial position as we ended the year with cash and investments of roughly $3.8 billion. Further, our cash, net of debt, improved by approximately $1 billion over the prior year as a result of the organization's focus on disciplined capital deployment and strong execution on working capital productivity. The company made progress on returning cash to shareholders with more than $660 million returned via dividends and share repurchases. 
Looking ahead, we see 2021 as a year in which we will accelerate on our path and expect to capitalize on the significant momentum we have built as the investments we made since 2017 begin to drive substantial earnings improvement. Our entire team is focused on executing to deliver further value for our shareholders from a number of in-flight strategic initiatives, including the ramp-up of Enlist, the launch of Brevant in the U.S. retail channel and the continued advancement of our Crop Protection pipeline following 2020, where we obtained more than 140 registrations globally for new active ingredients and formulations that we will start selling in 2021. 
We recognize that our 2020 performance was not where we need to be in terms of realizing the full operating leverage from organic growth and productivity programs in our earnings. For 2021, I am confident that we have made the necessary adjustments and are well positioned to deliver 15% to 20% operating EBITDA improvement for the year, including more than 200 basis points of margin improvement as the organization remains focused on executing on our targeted productivity actions. 
On capital allocation, you may recall that we discussed last quarter that we plan to accelerate the completion of our $1 billion share repurchase program by the end of 2021, which was 6 months ahead of our initial plan. Given our current cash position and outlook for 2021, we expect to complete most of the repurchases by midyear while maintaining our strong balance sheet and investing for growth. The bottom line, we view 2021 as a big step forward for Corteva, and I am confident we remain on track and laser-focused on delivering on our midterm targets. 
Turning next to Slide 5 and briefly touching on 2020 performance for the total company. For sales, strong organic growth in both segments and across all regions led to improved performance compared to our revised guidance, with double-digit organic growth for the year in both Latin America and Asia Pacific. Continued penetration of new and differentiated technology drove the increases, including 2% pricing in our corn and soybean portfolios globally. 
On operating EBITDA, we delivered 5% improvement for the year, exceeding our expectations compared to our revised guidance as organic growth and cost and productivity actions were partially offset by higher input costs and an unfavorable net currency impact. On currency, net of pricing, results were better than we had anticipated for the year as teams delivered strong execution on local pricing, coupled with favorable movement in exchange rates late in the fourth quarter. As a result, despite a 15 basis point decline in the fourth quarter on the absence of prior year divestitures, we extracted 33 basis points of margin expansion for the year, establishing a strong foundation for solid growth moving forward. 
Shifting the discussion to the market backdrop on Slide 6. While more resilient than some other sectors, the ag markets faced unexpected impacts resulted from the COVID-related disruptions. Throughout the year, we observed tremendous volatility, including commodity demand levels, acreage levels and foreign currency exchange rates. As our business is highly sensitive to these movements, we have closely and continuously monitored market conditions and remain agile to adjust our actions accordingly. 
As we entered the fourth quarter, fundamentals shifted and the outlook began to improve. Commodity demand has stabilized considerably with constructive trends out of China on grain purchases from the U.S. This trend, coupled with lower yields for 2020 U.S. crop and uncertainty in Brazil, has led to higher commodity prices, which also leads to improved outlook on farm income levels, resulting in the highest levels we've seen in 7 years. Government stimulus payments in the U.S. are also supporting farm income improvement. 
So after 2 straight years of unprecedented impacts from weather and the pandemic, we are pleased to see signs of a more favorable market environment for 2021. Taking our operational momentum into consideration, we are encouraged as strengthening ag fundamentals add additional support to our expectations to further accelerate our strategy and deliver strong growth in 2021. 
Now moving to Slide 7 for full year highlights on the top line performance from our teams around the globe. In North America, we delivered organic sales growth of 4% for the year, powered by high-performing technologies like Qrome corn seed, which provides growers an approximate 8- to 10-bushel per acre yield advantage over comparable products. 
In soybeans, as the recovery in planted acres helped volumes, we drove 2% pricing with a yield advantage lineup and disciplined execution by our teams. We also continue to make progress in accelerating the ramp-up of our Enlist system. While we entered 2020 expecting Enlist E3 soybeans to represent just 10% of our soybean volume, we finished the year well ahead of those expectations at approximately 17% of our volume and on 20% of total U.S. soybean acres. That has helped drive strong early demand for Enlist herbicides, which delivered $140 million in fourth quarter sales, more than double the prior year period. The full Enlist system delivered approximately $440 million in sales for the year, and we could not be more excited about how the system is gaining traction in the market. 
In Europe, Middle East and Africa, organic sales grew 8% in 2020 on strong demand for new and differentiated Crop Protection products, such as Arylex and Rinskor herbicides. Arylex is a product we are particularly excited about as it progressed through the European regulatory process faster than any product I can remember in recent years and really exemplifies our advantages in sustainable chemistry solutions, an area of growing demand where we have highly effective products in the market and in our pipeline. In Seed, we were able to drive volume and price gains as a result of our route-to-market expansions in Russia and Ukraine as well as share gains in corn. 
While significant currency volatility from the Brazilian real weighed on net sales in Latin America, we delivered 17% organic growth for the year. Here, we executed on market share gains in both Seed and Crop Protection and gained meaningful market share in the Brazil safrinha market while we continue to drive adoption of our novel Crop Protection products. The teams displayed strong execution on managing the volatility of local currency, which is evident in the $150 million in pricing for currency in Brazil for the year. 
In Asia Pacific, we realized 13% organic sales growth compared to prior year on both volume and price improvements. This progress is another proof point of continued penetration of our new technology as we drove the adoption of Rinskor and Arylex herbicides as well as other advantaged products like the spinosyn insecticide. During the period, we also benefited from strong demand for Seeds in India. 
Moving to Slide 8 for a more detailed review of our 2020 operating EBITDA performance. We delivered strong price/mix benefits of $210 million and volume benefits of $160 million from the continued penetration of our new and differentiated technology across all regions, representing important progress on our targets. Through these actions, we delivered $100 million in earnings improvement on the sales growth of $250 million of new Crop Protection products in 2020. At the same time, we drove Seed share gains in Europe and Latin America. Seed pricing improved operating EBITDA for the year, led by a 2% improvement globally for corn and 2% improvement for soybeans in North America. 
On cost, we delivered approximately $30 million in net operating EBITDA improvement for the year. This improvement reflects execution on the $230 million in productivity and cost actions, which were largely offset by higher input costs and reinvestments to accelerate future growth and profitability. Other was a headwind for 2020 and predominantly reflects the impact of asset divestitures in 2019. Lastly, gross currency impact to operating EBITDA was approximately $330 million before pricing and was predominantly due to the devaluation of the Brazilian real. To offset this headwind, local teams delivered approximately $150 million in pricing for currency, resulting in a net currency headwind of approximately $180 million for the year. 
Our growth initiatives are taking hold. And we continue to take action to reduce costs and drive productivity across the organization. Yesterday, we announced a restructuring program that includes facilities consolidations, footprint efficiencies and headcount reductions. This is part of delivering on our broader productivity programs. We are confident that we have reached the point where the investments we have made over the past few years will begin to accelerate earnings growth in 2021 and beyond. 
Now I'll turn it over to Greg to provide more detail on our results and the 2021 outlook."

Moving to Slide 9 and a more in-depth look at our performance in the Crop Protection segment. Organic sales for the fourth quarter grew 21% driven by an 11% improvement in volume and a 10% improvement in price. Robust demand for Enlist herbicides, coupled with fall applications of Optinyte in North America drove organic sales up 31% over prior year. Strong demand for our new products and pricing actions to offset currency also led to organic growth of 21% in Latin America and 17% in Asia Pacific for the quarter. Coupled with our productivity actions, this growth drove an approximate 70 basis point operating EBITDA margin benefit for the segment in the quarter despite the net impact of asset divestitures in 2019. 
For the full year, organic sales increased 11%, supported by continued growth in new products and in our differentiated spinosyns insecticide, both up double digits on an organic basis over prior year. This growth was partially offset by our strategic decision to phase out Chlorpyrifos and ramp-down of selected low-margin third-party products. Overall, Crop Protection results reflects price and volume gains in all regions, showing the balance and diversity of our new and differentiated products globally as well as our ability to grow organically above the market. Despite this organic sales growth, operating EBITDA for the segment has declined for the year due to the impact of currency, coupled with higher input costs, investments to support growth and the impact of asset divestitures in 2019. 
On costs, as we mentioned last quarter, we have taken several actions starting back at the completion of the merger in 2017 to streamline our manufacturing operations to drive better operating leverage in Crop Protection. Given the regulatory approval requirements in each of the jurisdictions where we sell our products, it takes several years for the benefit of our asset footprint actions to impact the bottom line. We should begin to see those benefits in 2021. On currency, we have recognized approximately $150 million in pricing for the year to offset the weakening Brazilian real. And pricing will continue to be a strategic lever for us going forward. 
Moving to the Seed segment on Slide 10. Organic sales for the fourth quarter were up 9% driven by strong safrinha corn sales in Brazil and deliveries in North America and Europe on an early start to the season. Operating EBITDA for the segment declined for the quarter due to the impact of currency and higher commodity costs. Full year organic sales grew 6% due to the soybean acreage rebound and improved price in North America, market share gains in Brazil and Europe corn and strong volume and price gains on new products particularly Qrome, PowerCore Ultra and Enlist E3 soybeans. Overall, price and volume gains coupled with productivity actions drove an approximate 190 basis point operating EBITDA margin benefit for the segment for the year. 
Turning now to Slide 11. I'll provide our full year guidance for 2021. Starting with net sales, we expect reported net sales to be between $14.4 billion and $14.6 billion, up roughly 2% over prior year at the midpoint of the range, with organic growth of about 3%. This primarily reflects the continued ramp of new products globally in both our Crop Protection and Seed segments, partially offset by the strategic decisions we made in our Crop Protection portfolio to further drive margin improvement. 
On operating EBITDA, we expect to deliver between $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion, an improvement of 17% year-over-year at the midpoint. With our expected top line growth and continued focus on delivering cost savings commitments, we expect to improve operating EBITDA margins by over 200 basis points on a total company basis. 
Turning to operating EPS. We expect to deliver between $1.85 and $1.95 per share, which would represent a 27% improvement over 2020 using the midpoint. We have provided supplemental information on our guidance in the appendix of our presentation. 
Focusing on operating EBITDA, Slide 12 provides our key assumptions. Starting with Seed, global demand for agricultural products continues to be strong. If new crop prices sustain current levels and weather remains favorable for a normal spring planting pace, we anticipate combined U.S. 2021 corn and soybean area will increase between 5 million and 8 million acres. Based on relative commodities prices, we expect that the planted area increase will be heavily biased towards soybeans. We will refine our assumptions when the market data is available as part of the March prospective planting estimates published by the USDA. 
In terms of Enlist expectations, consistent with what we shared on our third quarter call, we believe we could have greater than 35% of our units in Enlist E3 next year and anticipate as much as 30% of the soybean units in North America will carry the Enlist E3 trait. On Seed pricing, we expect to maintain our 2020 momentum and continue to extract value for yield-advantaged technology in corn globally, including further penetration of Qrome in our corn lineup. 
Turning to Crop Protection. We expect to deliver continued growth in our new product sales. This growth is underpinned by strong market demand for Enlist and Arylex herbicides and continued penetration of Isoclast insecticide globally. In total, we expect new Crop Protection products to contribute approximately $300 million in incremental sales growth during 2021. 
With respect to our differentiated technologies, we expect to release an additional 10% of spinosyns capacity in 2021, resulting in approximately $80 million of additional sales opportunity as demand will continue to exceed supply for this product in a growing targeted segment of the market. 
As I've mentioned, we have made strategic decisions to phase out Chlorpyrifos and to ramp down selected low-margin third-party products. While these changes are accretive to our margins, we do expect an approximate $75 million headwind to earnings in 2021 as a result of these decisions, which is included in our volume assumptions. 
Moving on to cost. We are targeting approximately $150 million in net cost savings in 2021, which includes $250 million in savings from our productivity programs, mostly related to the manufacturing and supply chain rationalization work we have underway in Crop Protection. We also expect the majority of our COVID-related savings in 2020 will be sustained in 2021. These savings will be partially offset by an approximate $100 million headwind in Seed input costs as a result of higher grower compensation costs due to rising commodity prices, along with unfavorable yields in Europe. 
Finally, on currency, we expect a headwind in 2021, given the change in the year-over-year rates for the Brazilian real and seasonality. Pricing will continue to be a lever to offset this impact as our commercial teams in Brazil actively price for changes in local currency. We anticipate we will recognize approximately $100 million in pricing for the year, reflecting a rate of approximately 5.50. Through our dynamic pricing, coupled with the financial instruments we have in place, we expect to further reduce volatility in our guidance, and we'll continually monitor movement in local currency rates as that could more directly impact our ability to price for currency. 
Turning now to Slide 13, I'll provide an update on our capital deployment targets over the midterm. As a result of our strong operational performance throughout 2020, coupled with effective working capital management, we ended the year with approximately $3.8 billion in cash and investments. That's after returning more than $660 million to shareholders this year through dividends and share repurchases. Building on this momentum, we expect to generate between $3 billion and $3.5 billion of operating cash flow in total for 2021 and 2022 combined, largely driven by earnings growth and continued focus on working capital productivity. 
Taking a look at the potential uses for cash, we have outlined several key priorities. Our first priority is to maintain a strong balance sheet with financial flexibility to support our industry-leading business model, which will allow us to fund investments in the business annually. These investments will reinforce and renew our innovation and market capabilities. We will also continue to explore paths to optimize our portfolio through opportunistic bolt-on M&A, including fruit and vegetable seeds, digital technology and biologicals. 
Finally, we are committed to accelerating the return of cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. In short, we see tremendous opportunity to return capital to our shareholders over the midterm. As you can see, we view the cash-generation capabilities of this business as very strong, and we are excited to share more details as we move forward in our journey. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Jim."

We've made tremendous progress in the short time we've been an independent company, but we know we have more work to do. Our recent results and guidance indicate we are well positioned to accelerate value creation in 2021 and beyond, including progressing on our products through the ramp-up of our proprietary Enlist system and strengthening our advantaged multichannel, multi-brand route to market, continuing to transform our Crop Protection portfolio and enhance our higher-value product mix and further streamlining costs and disciplined execution on our productivity actions. We will also maintain our balanced capital allocation program, continuing to return cash to shareholders even as we invest in long-term sustainable growth. 
Corteva's Board and management team are fully aligned on a strategy to deploy our competitive advantages to deliver increased value that is durable. Our plan is solid. We are executing and it is working. At the same time, we are always open to perspectives that benefit all of our shareholders. At Corteva, we believe in the fundamental importance of listening and incorporating ideas that will help advance our mission and our objectives, and we continue to do that. 
While I am pleased with our progress, I am not satisfied with our relatively flat earnings over the past 3 years. We have learned, we've adapted and are now very well positioned to accelerate our growth and deliver on the tremendous opportunities we have created through our targeted investments and disciplined emphasis on cost and productivity. So as I consider our path ahead, there is no doubt we have aligned our culture and gained the trust of our customers. At the same time, we have the right products and our portfolio transformation is underway and we have the productivity programs in place to deliver our future. Through disciplined and focused execution, we are confident this plan will deliver meaningful earnings growth and margin expansion in the near term and significant sustained long-term value for all of our shareholders, and importantly, puts Corteva fully on track to achieve our midterm targets. 
I'll hand the call back to you, Jeff."

And yes, as we've said in the opening comments, 2021 is a big step forward for us. And I really believe we've reached an acceleration point given the investments and the strategies that we've been putting in place since 2017 and believe they will drive substantial earnings for the years ahead. And as a starting point for '21, I think you got to look at that fourth quarter momentum. That momentum is there and it's real, and it gives you a strong sense for where that growth is going to come from.
So as we've guided for '21, as you see on the chart, that 15% to 20% improvement in EBITDA, and that's a 200 basis point improvement in EBITDA margin. So I believe that guide is strong, and it's realistic. And as you've asked, let me give you some proof points on why I have some confidence in it. 2/3 of the improvement in the business this next year is going to come through our Crop Protection business. And that's tied to the productivity improvements that we put in place, a number of footprint reduction projects as they have started to flow through cost of sales. And you can really begin to see that in our CP margins. 
You add to that the continued ramp-up of either the new products that we've talked so much about, about $300-or-so million of new -- of incremental new product sales. And then you start to unleash the spinosyn capacity that we have been investing in. And so overall, you get about $400 million of growth there. And then all of that on Crop Protection is net of now the strategic decisions that we made to exit a number of key products. So while those decisions have been headwinds in the past, we've got those behind us now. So the numbers we're talking to you about are net numbers. 
And then about 1/3 of that improvement next year is tied to our Seed business, and really got to start that discussion by just looking at Latin America, the tremendous momentum we carried in the fourth quarter. And then you add to that expectations of, I don't know, 5 million to 8 million acres of new crop coming back into corn and soybeans in North America, probably heavily weighted to soybeans but it's real out there. You can see it tied to the really strong demand that's in the marketplace, and that's being reflected in commodity prices. 
And then the other confidence I have in our Seed business is with respect to pricing. You look at what we delivered in 2020, kind of 2% price improvement in corn and 2% price improvement in soybeans globally. We've got a track record now there and so we're going to count on that track record. We will have a little headwind in the Seed business tied to commodity prices and cost of sales. And then don't forget about Brevant as we're thinking about the bridge next year. We're just scratching the surface of what Brevant and as well as Enlist is going to be able to deliver for us. So I think this is a strong and realistic guide for 2021 and I have a lot of confidence in this plan and my team that we can deliver that."

And that's that kind of 12% to 16% EBITDA growth using that 2019 as a baseline. So we're not going to provide guidance for 2022, specific guidance for '22. But we do see that continued momentum that I was just talking about that we have going into 2021. And so it's a little hard to sit here today and predict the market in '22, but we can talk about the levers that are still going to be within our control that have given me confidence to confirm those midterm targets. 
And you start in Seed with, really, Enlist. And in 2021, we're just scratching the surface on the margin lift that Enlist can deliver for us. By 2022, we're really into the noticeable improvement in net royalty expense as we not only ramp up the top line revenue, but we ramp up the proprietary portion of those sales that are in Corteva germplasm. And then we're going to continue to see improvement in the rest of our portfolio in a few other areas. And then I mentioned -- I always need to keep reminding folks about Brevant. Again, '21, just -- it's going to be a good year, a good start year for us, but 2022 will allow us to continue that momentum into that retail channel with Brevant. 
On Crop Protection, the main story there is momentum. We delivered $250 million of new product incremental revenue in 2020. '21 is going to be another strong year with about $300 million of incremental from those new products. We had 140 new product registrations that we receive right here at the end of 2020 that will just start having momentum in '21, and you'll feel that again in '22. And then on top of the top line revenue that we'll get from Crop Protection, by '22, you're really starting to see the compounding effects of better margins on that new chemistry as higher volumes flow through that same asset base and take up -- we start to spread that fixed cost over a much broader base. So you're seeing some of that in '21, but as those new product sales continue to ramp, it shows up in '22. 
On top of that, the further improvements that you're going to see from the asset footprint work that we're doing. And we got a good start of that this year coming up and will show up next year. So all of these levers, we really have within our control. And again, while it's early, we've still got '21 to get through and, again, tough to predict what that market will look like, but we've got our hands firmly on these levers, and that's what's going to propel us to those midterm targets."

And then this year, you're talking about another $100 million. So on a 2-year stack, if my math's right, you're up $175 million to $200 million. And I guess my question is, is if we have sort of normal production in the U.S. and Europe this year and if the futures curve for corn and soy is correct and commodity prices are lower into next year, does that mean there's going to be $170 million to $200 million Seed production cost tailwind in '22?

For 2021, we are expecting approximately $100 million in Seed input cost headwinds. Those are predominantly due to the higher commodity prices for soybeans that impact our grower compensation program, the way we compensate growers for producing seed. And we also had lower seed field yields in Europe. It was a tough seed production year. So just as background, we go out and we contract with independent growers to produce our commercial seed and they have the opportunity to lock in a commodity price rate during a window. And especially with soybeans, as we saw that run-up late in the season, they locked in at higher rates. 
We go into every year with our best foot forward. So as we put seed in the ground in '21 for '22 production, clearly, we will lap those higher commodity prices. And if we see some tail-off there, we'll benefit from that. And we'll expect to always have good solid yield production in our fields. We work with a lot of irrigated fields, so we try to take the weather out of that as much as possible. So we're -- we've seen good trends, and I think we've got a lot in play that should help support us as we come out of '21 into '22."

As we think about the market next -- this season, 2021, it's always a competitive marketplace, and it will be just as competitive as we saw in 2020 even with the commodity pricing backdrop. So we're going to continue to go out there and get paid for the value that we deliver to growers, especially when it comes to the yield-advantaged technology that we're putting out there. And most notably, we really do see that in corn. 
And we've established a really strong track record, that I mentioned earlier, of extracting that value for our technology. And all you got to do is go back and look at our 2020 performance, where we delivered 2% pricing in corn and soybeans, and that's globally. So this is always a market-specific phenomenon. But when you step back and look at our performance last year, we did that everywhere. And so we're -- as we sit here today, we're very pleased with the pace of the orders that are coming in, in both our Pioneer brand in North America as well as Brevant brand through those channels.

Due to the merger, we did inherit a number of U.S. manufacturing locations that have been more expensive than what I had personally experienced in the past around a more outsourced or a more localized approach to the business. So we didn't wait to take any actions to start optimizing the supply chain. Since merge, since the close of the merger, we've shut down 9 manufacturing assets and we are starting to see the benefits of those lower-cost supply chains. 
So I do believe that 2021 is really an inflection point for us. You really haven't seen much of the benefits of those actions yet. And that's kind of related to the amount of time that it takes to clear the regulatory hurdles. Every time you make a change in your supply chain, you have to go back and resubmit dossiers to regulatory authorities in every country around the world. So you saw some restructuring. The 8-K that we filed, that had restructuring in it. That's just part of those programs that we've talked about, and we'll just kind of continue to roll forward.
So in our guides, in our confirmation of our midterm targets, we've included those strategic decisions in those guides. It's one of the tools that we have and one of the ways that we get there and have confidence that they're achievable. And then we're always looking for opportunities and new ideas. We take every one of our active ingredients that we produce and we ask ourselves the question, can we be the lowest-cost producer of that product? And when that answer is no, the teams begin looking for alternate sources. 
And when that answer is yes but we need project work to get there, we begin to put those initiatives in place to drive that. So the best example I can point to is if you look at 2021's EBITDA improvement, 2/3 of that improvement is going to be coming from those initiatives in our Crop Protection business. So I got a lot of confidence, a lot of great visibility of those initiatives that are in-flight and exactly where we are in each one of those manufacturing units and those cost-of-sales points to be able to point to that."

So specifically on cash flow, we had a very strong cash-generation year, as you commented, this year. A lot of that was driven by real specific actions that we took to manage our working capital and also manage our capital spending, particularly during the pandemic. What also happened towards the end of the year is we saw some very good cash generation by our customers through the government programs that they received some benefit from. And in addition to that, the rise in commodity prices towards the end of the year also generated some incremental income for our customers. And we got the benefit of that with some cash generation at the end of the year. 
As we go into 2021 and beyond, we are looking at increasing our capital spending. We were at $475 million in 2020. And you'll see in our guide that we've included CapEx at about $550 million in 2021. So we put some of our CapEx on hold, and we plan to reinvest in our growth projects in 2021 and beyond. In addition to that, we do expect to return to a more normal cash credit mix with our customers. So there will be some changes in working capital as we move through 2021 and assuming a more normalized cash credit mix."

And in Brazil, both in the safrinha season as well as summer. And we've got just fantastic lineup and our teams really executed very, very well.

We really have to get that last round of USDA data that gives us the plantings of what happened right down to a kind of a county level. So it's -- we'll kind of have that final call on North America in mid-March. But look, I'm confident that we held share, at least, for sure, in corn in North America while delivering above-market share -- above-market pricing gains. So our story in North America was really all about value. 
And in soybeans, from a global perspective, we saw some slight declines in volumes. But for us, it's the U.S. that really matters. And our U.S. Seed volumes in soybeans were up. So I'm pretty confident in soy as well. We held. If not, we were up slightly. And one more time in soybeans, that 2% pricing on a look-back basis shows that we not only -- we held, if not gained slightly, and drove much higher value. So those are the big markets. But maybe, Tim, you want to share either the broader perspective of how we're doing on market shares in other markets around the world, other crops?"

We've been ahead of the market really throughout the year and had strong finishes there. 
In North America, we've sort of been hanging with the market for most of the year in Crop Protection. And we even -- we had a really strong finish to the year as well. And so we'll see where that puts us. Maybe a little optimistic that we will end up above the market for North America. We've had strong finish. And in Latin America, we -- fair to say that we started off the year behind the market in the first half. We felt like we were catching as we went through the third quarter and a really strong finish in the fourth quarter.
And as we anticipated and again, I think much like North America, we have some reason to believe that once everything's tallied up, that we're going to be certainly with the market and maybe just ahead of it on the Crop Protection side. So in conjunction with the Seed share position that Jim talked about, I think we can feel really proud of how we performed versus the market in the Crop Protection side, again, with strong pricing to support it."

Clearly, the improving commodity price markets helps the psychology of everybody involved.

Clearly, the improving commodity price markets helps the psychology of everybody involved. And as what they think, farmers always think about their decisions as investments in their future to drive productivity and yield. And so higher commodity prices means that they will continue to push for yield and be able to take advantage of that yield. 
And what I like about what we're seeing right now is we feel like the demand side of this equation that's driving those commodity prices is pretty durable for the 1- to 2-year term as we look out. China's demand curve seems to be strong as they're rebuilding their pork industry. And we know we've got demand for exports in other markets and strong demand for animal feed that we're seeing come back in North America and with the carryover stocks where we're seeing them. So I, like you, believe that we have support for those commodity prices here for the next 2 or 3 years. And that's driving our acreage assumptions as well. 
I would expect 180 million, 182 million corn and soybean acres when you combine them, a little hard to call the split there, but probably the best news we're hearing right now is what we don't seem to be -- it's going to favor soybeans. We know that any increases will go into soybean acreage, but it's not coming out of corn. So it's really setting up for both a strong corn and bean. When you look at our revenue guide for next year, as you mentioned, just remember that in that guide that there's -- that is a net top line revenue number and it's net of about $300 million of revenue that we phased out of from 2020 going into '21. 
The first of those strategic decisions around Chlorpyrifos. And then several other low-margin products, very, very generic and just probably not the right kind of products for our portfolio going forward. So we're certainly in a mix enrichment and a refreshment of that portfolio and basically have the majority of those big strategic decisions now behind us. So back to my comment earlier, I think this guide, it's a strong and a realistic guide with all of those elements really baked into it. And we still have a full season ahead. We're sitting here early in '21, a lot to go but we're confident we've set this at the right spot. Thanks, Steve."

As I reflect on the year, 2020 was a year of profound societal and economic disruptions globally. Despite these challenges, I'm extremely proud of the continued resiliency of our company. Our global teams have worked aggressively to keep our employees and customers safe, our supply chains open and our growth commitments on track. Our progress as a company in managing through the pandemic and other disruptions over the last year confirms the strength and durability of our strategy. 
Underpinning our progress is our strong organic sales growth for the full year, where our teams delivered gains in both Seed and Crop Protection and across all regions. Transforming our cost structure remains a priority for Corteva to deliver on our targeted earnings growth. We demonstrated our commitment to cost reductions in 2020 by managing spending and delivering on our productivity programs. These savings were mostly offset from headwinds that we had anticipated, such as higher input costs and investments to support growth in addition to unfavorable currency. Despite these hurdles, we delivered solid operating EBITDA improvement for the year. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We continue to strengthen our financial position as we ended the year with cash and investments of roughly $3.8 billion. Further, our cash, net of debt, improved by approximately $1 billion over the prior year as a result of the organization's focus on disciplined capital deployment and strong execution on working capital productivity. The company made progress on returning cash to shareholders with more than $660 million returned via dividends and share repurchases. 
Looking ahead, we see 2021 as a year in which we will accelerate on our path and expect to capitalize on the significant momentum we have built as the investments we made since 2017 begin to drive substantial earnings improvement. Our entire team is focused on executing to deliver further value for our shareholders from a number of in-flight strategic initiatives, including the ramp-up of Enlist, the launch of Brevant in the U.S. retail channel and the continued advancement of our Crop Protection pipeline following 2020, where we obtained more than 140 registrations globally for new active ingredients and formulations that we will start selling in 2021. 
We recognize that our 2020 performance was not where we need to be in terms of realizing the full operating leverage from organic growth and productivity programs in our earnings. For 2021, I am confident that we have made the necessary adjustments and are well positioned to deliver 15% to 20% operating EBITDA improvement for the year, including more than 200 basis points of margin improvement as the organization remains focused on executing on our targeted productivity actions. 
On capital allocation, you may recall that we discussed last quarter that we plan to accelerate the completion of our $1 billion share repurchase program by the end of 2021, which was 6 months ahead of our initial plan. Given our current cash position and outlook for 2021, we expect to complete most of the repurchases by midyear while maintaining our strong balance sheet and investing for growth. The bottom line, we view 2021 as a big step forward for Corteva, and I am confident we remain on track and laser-focused on delivering on our midterm targets. 
Turning next to Slide 5 and briefly touching on 2020 performance for the total company. For sales, strong organic growth in both segments and across all regions led to improved performance compared to our revised guidance, with double-digit organic growth for the year in both Latin America and Asia Pacific. Continued penetration of new and differentiated technology drove the increases, including 2% pricing in our corn and soybean portfolios globally. 
On operating EBITDA, we delivered 5% improvement for the year, exceeding our expectations compared to our revised guidance as organic growth and cost and productivity actions were partially offset by higher input costs and an unfavorable net currency impact. On currency, net of pricing, results were better than we had anticipated for the year as teams delivered strong execution on local pricing, coupled with favorable movement in exchange rates late in the fourth quarter. As a result, despite a 15 basis point decline in the fourth quarter on the absence of prior year divestitures, we extracted 33 basis points of margin expansion for the year, establishing a strong foundation for solid growth moving forward. 
Shifting the discussion to the market backdrop on Slide 6. While more resilient than some other sectors, the ag markets faced unexpected impacts resulted from the COVID-related disruptions. Throughout the year, we observed tremendous volatility, including commodity demand levels, acreage levels and foreign currency exchange rates. As our business is highly sensitive to these movements, we have closely and continuously monitored market conditions and remain agile to adjust our actions accordingly. 
As we entered the fourth quarter, fundamentals shifted and the outlook began to improve. Commodity demand has stabilized considerably with constructive trends out of China on grain purchases from the U.S. This trend, coupled with lower yields for 2020 U.S. crop and uncertainty in Brazil, has led to higher commodity prices, which also leads to improved outlook on farm income levels, resulting in the highest levels we've seen in 7 years. Government stimulus payments in the U.S. are also supporting farm income improvement. 
So after 2 straight years of unprecedented impacts from weather and the pandemic, we are pleased to see signs of a more favorable market environment for 2021. Taking our operational momentum into consideration, we are encouraged as strengthening ag fundamentals add additional support to our expectations to further accelerate our strategy and deliver strong growth in 2021. 
Now moving to Slide 7 for full year highlights on the top line performance from our teams around the globe. In North America, we delivered organic sales growth of 4% for the year, powered by high-performing technologies like Qrome corn seed, which provides growers an approximate 8- to 10-bushel per acre yield advantage over comparable products. 
In soybeans, as the recovery in planted acres helped volumes, we drove 2% pricing with a yield advantage lineup and disciplined execution by our teams. We also continue to make progress in accelerating the ramp-up of our Enlist system. While we entered 2020 expecting Enlist E3 soybeans to represent just 10% of our soybean volume, we finished the year well ahead of those expectations at approximately 17% of our volume and on 20% of total U.S. soybean acres. That has helped drive strong early demand for Enlist herbicides, which delivered $140 million in fourth quarter sales, more than double the prior year period. The full Enlist system delivered approximately $440 million in sales for the year, and we could not be more excited about how the system is gaining traction in the market. 
In Europe, Middle East and Africa, organic sales grew 8% in 2020 on strong demand for new and differentiated Crop Protection products, such as Arylex and Rinskor herbicides. Arylex is a product we are particularly excited about as it progressed through the European regulatory process faster than any product I can remember in recent years and really exemplifies our advantages in sustainable chemistry solutions, an area of growing demand where we have highly effective products in the market and in our pipeline. In Seed, we were able to drive volume and price gains as a result of our route-to-market expansions in Russia and Ukraine as well as share gains in corn. 
While significant currency volatility from the Brazilian real weighed on net sales in Latin America, we delivered 17% organic growth for the year. Here, we executed on market share gains in both Seed and Crop Protection and gained meaningful market share in the Brazil safrinha market while we continue to drive adoption of our novel Crop Protection products. The teams displayed strong execution on managing the volatility of local currency, which is evident in the $150 million in pricing for currency in Brazil for the year. 
In Asia Pacific, we realized 13% organic sales growth compared to prior year on both volume and price improvements. This progress is another proof point of continued penetration of our new technology as we drove the adoption of Rinskor and Arylex herbicides as well as other advantaged products like the spinosyn insecticide. During the period, we also benefited from strong demand for Seeds in India. 
Moving to Slide 8 for a more detailed review of our 2020 operating EBITDA performance. We delivered strong price/mix benefits of $210 million and volume benefits of $160 million from the continued penetration of our new and differentiated technology across all regions, representing important progress on our targets. Through these actions, we delivered $100 million in earnings improvement on the sales growth of $250 million of new Crop Protection products in 2020. At the same time, we drove Seed share gains in Europe and Latin America. Seed pricing improved operating EBITDA for the year, led by a 2% improvement globally for corn and 2% improvement for soybeans in North America. 
On cost, we delivered approximately $30 million in net operating EBITDA improvement for the year. This improvement reflects execution on the $230 million in productivity and cost actions, which were largely offset by higher input costs and reinvestments to accelerate future growth and profitability. Other was a headwind for 2020 and predominantly reflects the impact of asset divestitures in 2019. Lastly, gross currency impact to operating EBITDA was approximately $330 million before pricing and was predominantly due to the devaluation of the Brazilian real. To offset this headwind, local teams delivered approximately $150 million in pricing for currency, resulting in a net currency headwind of approximately $180 million for the year. 
Our growth initiatives are taking hold. And we continue to take action to reduce costs and drive productivity across the organization. Yesterday, we announced a restructuring program that includes facilities consolidations, footprint efficiencies and headcount reductions. This is part of delivering on our broader productivity programs. We are confident that we have reached the point where the investments we have made over the past few years will begin to accelerate earnings growth in 2021 and beyond. 
Now I'll turn it over to Greg to provide more detail on our results and the 2021 outlook."

Moving to Slide 9 and a more in-depth look at our performance in the Crop Protection segment. Organic sales for the fourth quarter grew 21% driven by an 11% improvement in volume and a 10% improvement in price. Robust demand for Enlist herbicides, coupled with fall applications of Optinyte in North America drove organic sales up 31% over prior year. Strong demand for our new products and pricing actions to offset currency also led to organic growth of 21% in Latin America and 17% in Asia Pacific for the quarter. Coupled with our productivity actions, this growth drove an approximate 70 basis point operating EBITDA margin benefit for the segment in the quarter despite the net impact of asset divestitures in 2019. 
For the full year, organic sales increased 11%, supported by continued growth in new products and in our differentiated spinosyns insecticide, both up double digits on an organic basis over prior year. This growth was partially offset by our strategic decision to phase out Chlorpyrifos and ramp-down of selected low-margin third-party products. Overall, Crop Protection results reflects price and volume gains in all regions, showing the balance and diversity of our new and differentiated products globally as well as our ability to grow organically above the market. Despite this organic sales growth, operating EBITDA for the segment has declined for the year due to the impact of currency, coupled with higher input costs, investments to support growth and the impact of asset divestitures in 2019. 
On costs, as we mentioned last quarter, we have taken several actions starting back at the completion of the merger in 2017 to streamline our manufacturing operations to drive better operating leverage in Crop Protection. Given the regulatory approval requirements in each of the jurisdictions where we sell our products, it takes several years for the benefit of our asset footprint actions to impact the bottom line. We should begin to see those benefits in 2021. On currency, we have recognized approximately $150 million in pricing for the year to offset the weakening Brazilian real. And pricing will continue to be a strategic lever for us going forward. 
Moving to the Seed segment on Slide 10. Organic sales for the fourth quarter were up 9% driven by strong safrinha corn sales in Brazil and deliveries in North America and Europe on an early start to the season. Operating EBITDA for the segment declined for the quarter due to the impact of currency and higher commodity costs. Full year organic sales grew 6% due to the soybean acreage rebound and improved price in North America, market share gains in Brazil and Europe corn and strong volume and price gains on new products particularly Qrome, PowerCore Ultra and Enlist E3 soybeans. Overall, price and volume gains coupled with productivity actions drove an approximate 190 basis point operating EBITDA margin benefit for the segment for the year. 
Turning now to Slide 11. I'll provide our full year guidance for 2021. Starting with net sales, we expect reported net sales to be between $14.4 billion and $14.6 billion, up roughly 2% over prior year at the midpoint of the range, with organic growth of about 3%. This primarily reflects the continued ramp of new products globally in both our Crop Protection and Seed segments, partially offset by the strategic decisions we made in our Crop Protection portfolio to further drive margin improvement. 
On operating EBITDA, we expect to deliver between $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion, an improvement of 17% year-over-year at the midpoint. With our expected top line growth and continued focus on delivering cost savings commitments, we expect to improve operating EBITDA margins by over 200 basis points on a total company basis. 
Turning to operating EPS. We expect to deliver between $1.85 and $1.95 per share, which would represent a 27% improvement over 2020 using the midpoint. We have provided supplemental information on our guidance in the appendix of our presentation. 
Focusing on operating EBITDA, Slide 12 provides our key assumptions. Starting with Seed, global demand for agricultural products continues to be strong. If new crop prices sustain current levels and weather remains favorable for a normal spring planting pace, we anticipate combined U.S. 2021 corn and soybean area will increase between 5 million and 8 million acres. Based on relative commodities prices, we expect that the planted area increase will be heavily biased towards soybeans. We will refine our assumptions when the market data is available as part of the March prospective planting estimates published by the USDA. 
In terms of Enlist expectations, consistent with what we shared on our third quarter call, we believe we could have greater than 35% of our units in Enlist E3 next year and anticipate as much as 30% of the soybean units in North America will carry the Enlist E3 trait. On Seed pricing, we expect to maintain our 2020 momentum and continue to extract value for yield-advantaged technology in corn globally, including further penetration of Qrome in our corn lineup. 
Turning to Crop Protection. We expect to deliver continued growth in our new product sales. This growth is underpinned by strong market demand for Enlist and Arylex herbicides and continued penetration of Isoclast insecticide globally. In total, we expect new Crop Protection products to contribute approximately $300 million in incremental sales growth during 2021. 
With respect to our differentiated technologies, we expect to release an additional 10% of spinosyns capacity in 2021, resulting in approximately $80 million of additional sales opportunity as demand will continue to exceed supply for this product in a growing targeted segment of the market. 
As I've mentioned, we have made strategic decisions to phase out Chlorpyrifos and to ramp down selected low-margin third-party products. While these changes are accretive to our margins, we do expect an approximate $75 million headwind to earnings in 2021 as a result of these decisions, which is included in our volume assumptions. 
Moving on to cost. We are targeting approximately $150 million in net cost savings in 2021, which includes $250 million in savings from our productivity programs, mostly related to the manufacturing and supply chain rationalization work we have underway in Crop Protection. We also expect the majority of our COVID-related savings in 2020 will be sustained in 2021. These savings will be partially offset by an approximate $100 million headwind in Seed input costs as a result of higher grower compensation costs due to rising commodity prices, along with unfavorable yields in Europe. 
Finally, on currency, we expect a headwind in 2021, given the change in the year-over-year rates for the Brazilian real and seasonality. Pricing will continue to be a lever to offset this impact as our commercial teams in Brazil actively price for changes in local currency. We anticipate we will recognize approximately $100 million in pricing for the year, reflecting a rate of approximately 5.50. Through our dynamic pricing, coupled with the financial instruments we have in place, we expect to further reduce volatility in our guidance, and we'll continually monitor movement in local currency rates as that could more directly impact our ability to price for currency. 
Turning now to Slide 13, I'll provide an update on our capital deployment targets over the midterm. As a result of our strong operational performance throughout 2020, coupled with effective working capital management, we ended the year with approximately $3.8 billion in cash and investments. That's after returning more than $660 million to shareholders this year through dividends and share repurchases. Building on this momentum, we expect to generate between $3 billion and $3.5 billion of operating cash flow in total for 2021 and 2022 combined, largely driven by earnings growth and continued focus on working capital productivity. 
Taking a look at the potential uses for cash, we have outlined several key priorities. Our first priority is to maintain a strong balance sheet with financial flexibility to support our industry-leading business model, which will allow us to fund investments in the business annually. These investments will reinforce and renew our innovation and market capabilities. We will also continue to explore paths to optimize our portfolio through opportunistic bolt-on M&A, including fruit and vegetable seeds, digital technology and biologicals. 
Finally, we are committed to accelerating the return of cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. In short, we see tremendous opportunity to return capital to our shareholders over the midterm. As you can see, we view the cash-generation capabilities of this business as very strong, and we are excited to share more details as we move forward in our journey. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Jim."

We've made tremendous progress in the short time we've been an independent company, but we know we have more work to do. Our recent results and guidance indicate we are well positioned to accelerate value creation in 2021 and beyond, including progressing on our products through the ramp-up of our proprietary Enlist system and strengthening our advantaged multichannel, multi-brand route to market, continuing to transform our Crop Protection portfolio and enhance our higher-value product mix and further streamlining costs and disciplined execution on our productivity actions. We will also maintain our balanced capital allocation program, continuing to return cash to shareholders even as we invest in long-term sustainable growth. 
Corteva's Board and management team are fully aligned on a strategy to deploy our competitive advantages to deliver increased value that is durable. Our plan is solid. We are executing and it is working. At the same time, we are always open to perspectives that benefit all of our shareholders. At Corteva, we believe in the fundamental importance of listening and incorporating ideas that will help advance our mission and our objectives, and we continue to do that. 
While I am pleased with our progress, I am not satisfied with our relatively flat earnings over the past 3 years. We have learned, we've adapted and are now very well positioned to accelerate our growth and deliver on the tremendous opportunities we have created through our targeted investments and disciplined emphasis on cost and productivity. So as I consider our path ahead, there is no doubt we have aligned our culture and gained the trust of our customers. At the same time, we have the right products and our portfolio transformation is underway and we have the productivity programs in place to deliver our future. Through disciplined and focused execution, we are confident this plan will deliver meaningful earnings growth and margin expansion in the near term and significant sustained long-term value for all of our shareholders, and importantly, puts Corteva fully on track to achieve our midterm targets. 
I'll hand the call back to you, Jeff."

And yes, as we've said in the opening comments, 2021 is a big step forward for us. And I really believe we've reached an acceleration point given the investments and the strategies that we've been putting in place since 2017 and believe they will drive substantial earnings for the years ahead. And as a starting point for '21, I think you got to look at that fourth quarter momentum. That momentum is there and it's real, and it gives you a strong sense for where that growth is going to come from.
So as we've guided for '21, as you see on the chart, that 15% to 20% improvement in EBITDA, and that's a 200 basis point improvement in EBITDA margin. So I believe that guide is strong, and it's realistic. And as you've asked, let me give you some proof points on why I have some confidence in it. 2/3 of the improvement in the business this next year is going to come through our Crop Protection business. And that's tied to the productivity improvements that we put in place, a number of footprint reduction projects as they have started to flow through cost of sales. And you can really begin to see that in our CP margins. 
You add to that the continued ramp-up of either the new products that we've talked so much about, about $300-or-so million of new -- of incremental new product sales. And then you start to unleash the spinosyn capacity that we have been investing in. And so overall, you get about $400 million of growth there. And then all of that on Crop Protection is net of now the strategic decisions that we made to exit a number of key products. So while those decisions have been headwinds in the past, we've got those behind us now. So the numbers we're talking to you about are net numbers. 
And then about 1/3 of that improvement next year is tied to our Seed business, and really got to start that discussion by just looking at Latin America, the tremendous momentum we carried in the fourth quarter. And then you add to that expectations of, I don't know, 5 million to 8 million acres of new crop coming back into corn and soybeans in North America, probably heavily weighted to soybeans but it's real out there. You can see it tied to the really strong demand that's in the marketplace, and that's being reflected in commodity prices. 
And then the other confidence I have in our Seed business is with respect to pricing. You look at what we delivered in 2020, kind of 2% price improvement in corn and 2% price improvement in soybeans globally. We've got a track record now there and so we're going to count on that track record. We will have a little headwind in the Seed business tied to commodity prices and cost of sales. And then don't forget about Brevant as we're thinking about the bridge next year. We're just scratching the surface of what Brevant and as well as Enlist is going to be able to deliver for us. So I think this is a strong and realistic guide for 2021 and I have a lot of confidence in this plan and my team that we can deliver that."

And that's that kind of 12% to 16% EBITDA growth using that 2019 as a baseline. So we're not going to provide guidance for 2022, specific guidance for '22. But we do see that continued momentum that I was just talking about that we have going into 2021. And so it's a little hard to sit here today and predict the market in '22, but we can talk about the levers that are still going to be within our control that have given me confidence to confirm those midterm targets. 
And you start in Seed with, really, Enlist. And in 2021, we're just scratching the surface on the margin lift that Enlist can deliver for us. By 2022, we're really into the noticeable improvement in net royalty expense as we not only ramp up the top line revenue, but we ramp up the proprietary portion of those sales that are in Corteva germplasm. And then we're going to continue to see improvement in the rest of our portfolio in a few other areas. And then I mentioned -- I always need to keep reminding folks about Brevant. Again, '21, just -- it's going to be a good year, a good start year for us, but 2022 will allow us to continue that momentum into that retail channel with Brevant. 
On Crop Protection, the main story there is momentum. We delivered $250 million of new product incremental revenue in 2020. '21 is going to be another strong year with about $300 million of incremental from those new products. We had 140 new product registrations that we receive right here at the end of 2020 that will just start having momentum in '21, and you'll feel that again in '22. And then on top of the top line revenue that we'll get from Crop Protection, by '22, you're really starting to see the compounding effects of better margins on that new chemistry as higher volumes flow through that same asset base and take up -- we start to spread that fixed cost over a much broader base. So you're seeing some of that in '21, but as those new product sales continue to ramp, it shows up in '22. 
On top of that, the further improvements that you're going to see from the asset footprint work that we're doing. And we got a good start of that this year coming up and will show up next year. So all of these levers, we really have within our control. And again, while it's early, we've still got '21 to get through and, again, tough to predict what that market will look like, but we've got our hands firmly on these levers, and that's what's going to propel us to those midterm targets."

And I guess my question is, is if we have sort of normal production in the U.S. and Europe this year and if the futures curve for corn and soy is correct and commodity prices are lower into next year, does that mean there's going to be $170 million to $200 million Seed production cost tailwind in '22?

For 2021, we are expecting approximately $100 million in Seed input cost headwinds. Those are predominantly due to the higher commodity prices for soybeans that impact our grower compensation program, the way we compensate growers for producing seed. And we also had lower seed field yields in Europe. It was a tough seed production year. So just as background, we go out and we contract with independent growers to produce our commercial seed and they have the opportunity to lock in a commodity price rate during a window. And especially with soybeans, as we saw that run-up late in the season, they locked in at higher rates. 
We go into every year with our best foot forward. So as we put seed in the ground in '21 for '22 production, clearly, we will lap those higher commodity prices. And if we see some tail-off there, we'll benefit from that. And we'll expect to always have good solid yield production in our fields. We work with a lot of irrigated fields, so we try to take the weather out of that as much as possible. So we're -- we've seen good trends, and I think we've got a lot in play that should help support us as we come out of '21 into '22."

And most notably, we really do see that in corn. 
And we've established a really strong track record, that I mentioned earlier, of extracting that value for our technology. And all you got to do is go back and look at our 2020 performance, where we delivered 2% pricing in corn and soybeans, and that's globally. So this is always a market-specific phenomenon. But when you step back and look at our performance last year, we did that everywhere.

Due to the merger, we did inherit a number of U.S. manufacturing locations that have been more expensive than what I had personally experienced in the past around a more outsourced or a more localized approach to the business. So we didn't wait to take any actions to start optimizing the supply chain. Since merge, since the close of the merger, we've shut down 9 manufacturing assets and we are starting to see the benefits of those lower-cost supply chains. 
So I do believe that 2021 is really an inflection point for us. You really haven't seen much of the benefits of those actions yet. And that's kind of related to the amount of time that it takes to clear the regulatory hurdles. Every time you make a change in your supply chain, you have to go back and resubmit dossiers to regulatory authorities in every country around the world. So you saw some restructuring. The 8-K that we filed, that had restructuring in it. That's just part of those programs that we've talked about, and we'll just kind of continue to roll forward.

It's one of the tools that we have and one of the ways that we get there and have confidence that they're achievable. And then we're always looking for opportunities and new ideas. We take every one of our active ingredients that we produce and we ask ourselves the question, can we be the lowest-cost producer of that product? And when that answer is no, the teams begin looking for alternate sources. 
And when that answer is yes but we need project work to get there, we begin to put those initiatives in place to drive that. So the best example I can point to is if you look at 2021's EBITDA improvement, 2/3 of that improvement is going to be coming from those initiatives in our Crop Protection business. So I got a lot of confidence, a lot of great visibility of those initiatives that are in-flight and exactly where we are in each one of those manufacturing units and those cost-of-sales points to be able to point to that."

So let's call it, I don't know, $1.7 billion a year. This year, your operating cash flow was $2 billion. If you subtract out your working capital benefits, maybe it's $1.7 billion. So you're sort of saying that your operating cash flow is not really going to change very much from that base. And there'll be a little bit more working capital, but your EBITDA you think will go from like $2 billion to $3 billion over -- to 2022. And so I don't understand why you would be generating so much EBITDA and so little operating cash flow. 
And then secondly, your pension liability really went down in the fourth quarter from, I think, sequentially from something like $5.8 billion to $5.1 billion. But interest rates really fell year-over-year and I would have thought that there would have been an adjustment in the opposite direction. So can you explain what happened to pension? And can you explain why there's so little growth in operating cash flow?"

So specifically on cash flow, we had a very strong cash-generation year, as you commented, this year. A lot of that was driven by real specific actions that we took to manage our working capital and also manage our capital spending, particularly during the pandemic. What also happened towards the end of the year is we saw some very good cash generation by our customers through the government programs that they received some benefit from. And in addition to that, the rise in commodity prices towards the end of the year also generated some incremental income for our customers. And we got the benefit of that with some cash generation at the end of the year. 
As we go into 2021 and beyond, we are looking at increasing our capital spending. We were at $475 million in 2020. And you'll see in our guide that we've included CapEx at about $550 million in 2021. So we put some of our CapEx on hold, and we plan to reinvest in our growth projects in 2021 and beyond. In addition to that, we do expect to return to a more normal cash credit mix with our customers. So there will be some changes in working capital as we move through 2021 and assuming a more normalized cash credit mix."

So it's -- we'll kind of have that final call on North America in mid-March. But look, I'm confident that we held share, at least, for sure, in corn in North America while delivering above-market share -- above-market pricing gains. So our story in North America was really all about value. 
And in soybeans, from a global perspective, we saw some slight declines in volumes. But for us, it's the U.S. that really matters. And our U.S. Seed volumes in soybeans were up. So I'm pretty confident in soy as well. We held. If not, we were up slightly. And one more time in soybeans, that 2% pricing on a look-back basis shows that we not only -- we held, if not gained slightly, and drove much higher value. So those are the big markets.

We've been ahead of the market really throughout the year and had strong finishes there. 
In North America, we've sort of been hanging with the market for most of the year in Crop Protection. And we even -- we had a really strong finish to the year as well. And so we'll see where that puts us. Maybe a little optimistic that we will end up above the market for North America. We've had strong finish. And in Latin America, we -- fair to say that we started off the year behind the market in the first half. We felt like we were catching as we went through the third quarter and a really strong finish in the fourth quarter.
And as we anticipated and again, I think much like North America, we have some reason to believe that once everything's tallied up, that we're going to be certainly with the market and maybe just ahead of it on the Crop Protection side.

Clearly, the improving commodity price markets helps the psychology of everybody involved. And as what they think, farmers always think about their decisions as investments in their future to drive productivity and yield. And so higher commodity prices means that they will continue to push for yield and be able to take advantage of that yield. 
And what I like about what we're seeing right now is we feel like the demand side of this equation that's driving those commodity prices is pretty durable for the 1- to 2-year term as we look out. China's demand curve seems to be strong as they're rebuilding their pork industry. And we know we've got demand for exports in other markets and strong demand for animal feed that we're seeing come back in North America and with the carryover stocks where we're seeing them. So I, like you, believe that we have support for those commodity prices here for the next 2 or 3 years. And that's driving our acreage assumptions as well. 
I would expect 180 million, 182 million corn and soybean acres when you combine them, a little hard to call the split there, but probably the best news we're hearing right now is what we don't seem to be -- it's going to favor soybeans. We know that any increases will go into soybean acreage, but it's not coming out of corn. So it's really setting up for both a strong corn and bean. When you look at our revenue guide for next year, as you mentioned, just remember that in that guide that there's -- that is a net top line revenue number and it's net of about $300 million of revenue that we phased out of from 2020 going into '21. 
The first of those strategic decisions around Chlorpyrifos. And then several other low-margin products, very, very generic and just probably not the right kind of products for our portfolio going forward. So we're certainly in a mix enrichment and a refreshment of that portfolio and basically have the majority of those big strategic decisions now behind us. So back to my comment earlier, I think this guide, it's a strong and a realistic guide with all of those elements really baked into it. And we still have a full season ahead. We're sitting here early in '21, a lot to go but we're confident we've set this at the right spot. Thanks, Steve."

Starting on Slide 4. As I step back and reflect on how the organization closed out 2020 with strong sales and earnings growth in the fourth quarter, it is impressive how our teams executed in a very complex and dynamic market environment with the overlay of the COVID pandemic. It displays the focus and execution of our strategy and the commitment to delivering value. 
That momentum was sustained through the first quarter. And through focused heads down execution, we delivered a strong start to the year, with margin increases in both segments. I am really pleased with these results. 
Our technology leadership remains strong, evidenced by ongoing demand for our new and differentiated products. We continue to launch and rapidly scale these technologies while taking focused actions on our cost and productivity priorities. Collectively, this focus on our commitments is helping to drive meaningful margin expansion today and looking forward. 
Importantly, our team around the world delivering these results is resilient. They continue to prove their agility in the face of ongoing market volatility, including the pandemic, and remain intent on prioritizing the safety of colleagues, while serving our customers and stakeholders at every turn. 
And lastly, I'm pleased to also share that we welcomed 4 new directors to our Board during the quarter. The addition of these directors and their background and experience will complement an already strong and diverse board and will serve as a catalyst for the ongoing advancement of our strategy, reinforcing our commitment to deliver on our value creation priorities. 
So let's look at Slide 5, which is our financial results for the quarter. We delivered strong organic sales growth across both seed and crop protection, leading to 6% organic growth for the company as a whole. Importantly, we realized better operating leverage on our sales growth this quarter as operating EBITDA grew 14% and margins expanded more than 150 basis points, a strong execution on our growth targets coupled with improved SG&A more than offset the market-driven cost headwinds we faced in the quarter. 
The phenomena of the market-driven cost inflation is a common theme we are seeing across industries, including raw materials and logistics. Dave is going to take us through the key market dynamics and other critical drivers for the remainder of 2021. On capital allocation, we returned approximately $450 million to shareholders in the quarter via share buybacks and dividends.  We remain on track to complete the majority of our remaining repurchases under the $1 billion program by the first half of 2021. Returning cash to shareholders continues to be a high priority for Corteva and a critical part of our balanced approach to capital allocation. 
This first quarter performance is another important proof point that our value creation strategy is working, reinforcing our confidence that we will meet our commitments for 2021. 
Shifting to the market backdrop on Slide 6, we remain encouraged by the strengthening global ag fundamentals, while also navigating macroeconomic uncertainties around the world. The ag outlook turned positive in the fourth quarter of 2020 as a result of rising farm income levels and constructive demand out of China. Today, farm incomes remain elevated on strong commodity prices and we continue to see record global demand for ag commodities. As a result, we are seeing ending stocks drawn down and expectations that grower income levels will be at all-time highs, even with the easing government payments this year. 
In March, the USDA issued the prospective planting survey results, which indicated flattish corn acres, an approximate 5 million-acre increase in soybeans for the U.S. As you recall, our original estimates were between 5 million and 8 million additional acres coming into corn and bean production for 2021, mostly going into soybeans. Given how we position our products with our customers, we are in a good position to take advantage of any potential upside in acres as market conditions continue to evolve. 
Commodity prices in Brazil remain strong as concerns of dry weather or lowering expectations on safrinha yields. We also expect to see planted area expansion in Brazil, with the potential for low to mid single-digit increases in corn planted area for the late 2021, early 2022 season. Although exchange rates have recently trended favorably, the market remains volatile, and we continue to monitor for any further fluctuations. 
More importantly, based on how we are seeing the futures markets shape up, we believe these fundamentals will continue into at least 2022 as strong grain demand and supply challenges keep ending stocks low. This constructive backdrop provides Corteva further momentum for value creation as growers turn to best-in-class technology to maximize productivity and value. 
So let's turn to Slide 7, and I'll provide some more detail on the strength of our global sales diversity and where we are capitalizing on momentum across the globe. In North America, organic sales were down 2% for the quarter against a difficult 2020 seed comparison. While 2020 first quarter seed volumes benefited from early demand amidst favorable weather conditions, we experienced a more normalized delivery pattern this year. We expect corn volumes to increase in the second quarter as our seed deliveries in the U.S. Pioneer brand have caught up to the prior year as of today. 
On seed pricing, first quarter was negatively impacted, mostly due to brand mix. Our second quarter deliveries to date reflect improvement in corn pricing despite aggressive market competitiveness. We remain excited about the demand and traction we are seeing in the Enlist soybean launch and still expect Enlist to represent about 30% of the U.S. soybean market in 2021, an important milestone towards our goal of 50% market penetration. 
North America Crop Protection had a strong start to the year with 11% organic growth on strong demand for new technologies, including Enlist herbicide and solid pricing execution in response to rising raw material freight and logistics costs. In Europe, Middle East and Africa, organic sales grew 6% on record corn and sunflower seed volumes as supply concerns and commodity cost pressures drove an early start to the spring sales season. 
Our portfolio of new and differentiated products, such as Arylex and Rinskor herbicides, remain in high demand, which enabled us to drive price and volume in crop protection. During the quarter, we also obtained key regulatory approvals, including the registration of [indiscernible] fungicide with Inatreq active for sale and use in the U.K., a major milestone for serial growers needing innovative and sustainable chemistry solutions to protect their crops. 
In Latin America, we delivered 38% organic sales growth on strong volumes and execution of our price for value strategy. And seed volumes grew 39% on strong Brazil safrinha sales and early demand in other countries. In Crop Protection, volume grew 10% on significant demand for new and differentiated technologies such as Isoclast and Jemvelva insecticides and Enlist herbicides. Pricing actions reflect strong product demand and partially offset unfavorable currency impacts in the Brazilian real. 
In Asia Pacific, we realized 9% organic sales growth compared to the prior year on both volume and price improvements. While seed volumes were down on the shift of some corn sales to the second half, crop protection growth was led by further penetration of Jemvelva and Pyraxalt insecticides. Now Dave will provide more detail on our results and our expectations for the rest of the year. But let me first say, we are very excited to have Dave join the Corteva team and I look forward to the contributions he will make in bolstering our momentum and execution looking ahead. 
So Dave, over to you."

Let's go to Slide 8 for a more detailed review of our strong first quarter operating EBITDA performance. You can see that operating EBITDA grew from $794 million last year to $904 mil",1578,"Thanks, Jim, very much, and welcome, everybody, to this morning's call. Let's go to Slide 8 for a more detailed review of our strong first quarter operating EBITDA performance. You can see that operating EBITDA grew from $794 million last year to $904 million in the first quarter of 2021, representing a $110 million improvement. It's a clear testament to the momentum that Jim mentioned. Driving this increase were price benefits of $125 million and volume benefits of $50 million from strong commercial execution and penetration of our new and differentiated products across all regions. It represents important progress on our targets and really reflects the strength of our portfolio and pipeline. 
On new Crop Protection products, we recognized sales growth of over $120 million. At the same time, we delivered record corn and sunflower volumes in Europe and strong safrinha sales in Brazil, which helped to offset the seasonal timing of seed deliveries in North America. Finally, we continue to extract value for our yield advantage technology in corn, with global corn pricing up 2% for the quarter. 
Now costs were a $70 million net headwind to operating EBITDA for the quarter. This reflects approximately $50 million in productivity and other cost actions positively, which were more than offset by higher input in freight costs, which are primarily market-driven. Let me give you some color on that. 
As economies across the globe start to emerge from the pandemic-related shutdowns, global trade markets are experiencing higher shipping demand leading to higher freight costs. Additionally, prices of certain active ingredients and intermediates have risen compared to the same period last year. As a result, we incurred approximately $120 million of cost headwinds in the quarter due to increased freight and logistics, higher raw material costs and unfavorable seed yields in Europe. Now we're taking action where possible to mitigate these impacts, including delivering on our productivity initiatives and passing through certain inflationary costs for our seed and crop protection products. 
For example, late in the first quarter, we initiated, on average, mid single-digit price increases in the U.S. on our Crop Protection products. Taken together, we delivered over 150 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter as a result of the discipline and focused execution despite the cost increases that we encountered. 
Let's go now to Slide 9, focused on crop protection for the quarter, I'll cover a few highlights. As you can see, Crop Protection organic sales grew 12% in the quarter, driven by a 6% increase in volume and a 6% increase in price. Now keep in mind, including with this volume, growth is a 5% headwind from our strategic decision to phase out certain products, primarily in the insecticides portfolio, including Chlorpyrifos as well as telone. Now strong global demand for our new technology led to an increase of more than $120 million in new product sales when compared to the same period last year. Herbicides were up 20% compared to the first quarter of 2020, led by continued penetration of Arylex and Enlist. Fungicides grew 14%, driven by strong demand for Zorvec and also Inatreq, primarily in Europe, Middle East and Africa. And lastly, insecticides grew 2% in the quarter, largely driven by our differentiated spinosins technology, notably Jemvelva as well as [indiscernible]. These were up 29% in the quarter. 
Now this growth was again muted by our decision to phase out select insecticides, as mentioned earlier. Favorable product mix in Crop Protection and strategic price increases drove pricing gains in the quarter, including an 18% price improvement in Latin America and a 6% price improvement in North America. Operating EBITDA for Crop Protection improved 35% for the quarter, driven by robust demand for new products and pricing execution. Now we experienced cost headwinds of approximately $70 million for this segment. And again, these included increased raw material costs, such as precious metals used as catalysts, as well as increased freight and logistics. Taken on a whole, these headwinds more than offset our productivity actions. 
As we go forward, we're aggressively managing controllable factors and at the same time, proactively mitigating this cost through delivering against our productivity programs, passing through certain costs for our products wherever possible. Very impressively, despite these challenges I mentioned, we drove over 300 basis points of improvement of operating EBITDA margin in the segment in the quarter. 
Let's go now to the seed segment on Slide 10. You can see organic sales per seed were up 3%, driven by strong Brazil Safrinha sales and record corn and sunflower volumes in Europe on an early start to the spring. These gains were partially offset by the seasonal timing of deliveries in North America, where seed volumes in the quarter were down 6%, driven by the U.S. where we had a very early start in the prior year. 
Overall, global corn volumes were flat, reflecting these seasonal shifts. On pricing, we maintained our track record in extracting value for our yield advantage technology with corn prices up 2% for the quarter. Soybean volumes were also flat for the quarter, with price down 4%. Now keep in mind, the first quarter is a meaningful quarter for soybeans, as the large majority of the deliveries occur in the second quarter. And as Jim mentioned, our expectations for Enlist E3, the ramp there is on track. 
Other oil seeds were up 19% versus the first quarter of 2020 reflecting record sunflower volumes in Europe and higher canola volumes in Canada. Operating EBITDA for this segment improved 6% on strong price execution globally, ongoing cost and productivity actions and a gain on the remeasurement of an R&D technology-based equity investment, which is included in the other column. These improvements were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of currency and higher input costs, which were primarily market related. These cost increases included, again, higher freight and logistics costs, coupled with the impact of unfavorable seed yields on European corn. The teams continue to manage through these headwinds and still delivered operating EBITDA margin improvement of over 100 basis points per seed for the quarter. 
So now let's go to Slide 11, talk about our first half 2021 updated expectations and full year 2021 guidance. With the backdrop of the segments, you can see we expect top line growth of about 3% for the half, led by continued strong demand for our new Crop Protection products globally. This growth includes an approximately $130 million sales headwind from strategic decisions to phase out certain Crop Protection products. 
On the seed side, we're monitoring what ultimately gets planted this season in North America given recent strengthening in commodity price levels. Globally, we expect first half seed volumes to be about flat with the prior year. We're confident that we'll maintain our momentum and we continue to extract value for our yield advantage technology in corn globally. 
Turning to costs. We remain committed to the execution and realization of our productivity programs, which we believe will be more than offset by anticipated headwinds from increasing freight and logistics, higher raw materials and unfavorable seed deals in Europe, resulting in a net headwind of $50 million for the half. 
Taken together, this translates to operating EBITDA of $2.15 billion to $2.25 billion for the half, an increase of 8% over 2020 at the midpoint and an approximate 120 basis point increase to operating EBITDA margins. 
Turning to the full year. We're raising our revenue guidance. We now expect reported net sales to be between $14.6 billion and $14.8 billion, up 3% to 4% over 2020. This increase reflects continued demand for new products globally in both our Crop Protection and seed segments, coupled with strong price execution in key regions on technology and pricing for higher costs where possible. 
On cost, we expect a net headwind for the year of $50 million as the higher input costs and freight logistics are more than offsetting productivity savings. Specific to G&A spend, we're maintaining our post-COVID spending levels with anticipation that G&A will be essentially flat for the year, with the organization driving inflation impacts to a net 0 for G&A. 
Reflecting the strength of what we're seeing in the market and focused execution, we remain on track to deliver operating EBITDA between $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion for the year, an improvement of [ 17% ] over 2020 at the midpoint and approximately 200 basis points of margin improvement. 
Standing back, here are the key takeaways for the quarter: First, we delivered an impressive start to the year in both top and bottom line, driven by penetration of technology-advantaged products despite some headwinds; and second, we remain on track to deliver strong double-digit earnings improvement for the year. 
So before turning the call back to Jim, I just want to take a second to provide a few initial observations since joining Corteva last month. Coming into the company, I've been impressed with the tremendous franchise that Corteva represents. It's backed by a strong culture and high-value assets, which I believe in combination are capable of delivering on the significant growth potential. 
Leveraging what I referred to as the CFO skill set, it provides a great opportunity to help deliver the operating leverage we see for the business. Those are early thoughts. I look forward to sharing more with you in the future and working with the team on executing Corteva's strategy. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Jim."

As you can see in our results, this organization is executing. We're off to a strong start to the year. And despite some of the unplanned headwinds from market-related factors, we're on track with our expectations. 
And as we look ahead, we remain focused on driving progress against those fundamental elements of our strategy, advancing our industry-leading innovation pipeline, including the ramp-up of our proprietary Enlist system, and delivering on our productivity and cost savings initiatives and maintaining our disciplined approach to capital allocation. 
Now we have considerable momentum right now, and we expect focused execution in our plan will enable us to continue to generate value and deliver on our commitments to our shareholders. The market backdrop is clearly strengthening. And despite macro uncertainties, we expect favorable market dynamics to continue through the midterm. Our current pace is aligned with our midterm earnings targets, and we are well positioned to create significant durable value for shareholders in 2021 and beyond. 
And finally, at the foundation of this is a fully focused team and a strong legacy of technology leadership, which can be traced all the way back to the founding of the Pioneer brand, which, by the way, just celebrated its 95th anniversary. This legacy and a shared sense of accountability for our commitments and our purpose demonstrates that the culture we have built at Corteva is solid. 
The events of this past year have left an undeniable impact on all of us. Our Corteva teams rose to this challenge, prioritizing the safety [Technical Difficulty] of the world continue to do that today. 2021 has proven that the pandemic recovery remains uneven and an ongoing focus on our values, including safety, are just going to remain critical as this global health crisis intensifies in parts of the world, such as India. 
As a global citizen, with operations in 140 countries, we remain as committed as ever to taking actions locally in the communities in which we operate. Harnessing the power of our scale provides to deliver value for all of our stakeholders.

And I would start by saying we had a lot coming at us, but had really great start by the team, and it's always kind of tough to call that first quarter, kind of second quarter split. But we're, I think, executing pretty well. 
There are some things, some areas that we're still watching some trends that are moving up on us, that may be a little bit greater than we started the year. And a lot of that starts with commodity prices. Those are going to continue to affect our seed production costs. And a little of that is for full year, kind of back-end loaded as we watch production costs in Brazil and harvest seed and get ready for that commercial season. 
There are some market-driven cost headwinds. And maybe I'll hand it over to Dave to share a little more detail on a few of those. But at the high level, it's things like freight and some of the key raw materials, and many of those are COVID-related, transportation-related, and some of those are just kind of global demand, really creating some shortages here and there. 
And I'd say some of the other areas that are affecting costs are also COVID-related. The recovery that we're seeing globally is a little bit uneven. We're seeing some flare-ups in parts of the world, like India and Brazil that are affecting transportation and logistics routes, but also affecting our customers and, in some cases, demand and supply. 
So as I step back and I think about some of the opportunities that we're driving, this team is executing really well, and we're covering -- essentially covering those costs with our outlook. We're as, we've said earlier, we're essentially on track with our full year guidance that we gave you. So even though there are some new headwinds that I've mentioned, we've got those covered.  And I think what we've done with this outlook is taken a really balanced approach here and continue to monitor and watch these. 
But Dave, do you want to share any more detail for Dave on that?"

So I think a couple of things, just to add a little bit to what Jim said and kind of back to your question. Number one, as you would suspect, we spent a lot of time on the subject. I mean, this is something that has really been a focus and attention of this leadership team, with this management team. And it's a headline item, obviously, not just for Corteva. It's industry-wide phenomena that you're seeing in a number of the releases. 
Some of the things that I think stand out, just to add a little bit to what Jim said. Number one, we're on track in terms of our annual productivity. That's the key message. The $250 million guide that we gave you at the beginning of the year, we're on track for that. So what we're really talking about is what is the incremental impact relative to that. 
So seed yields and commodity costs, that's -- that's the biggest item. For the quarter, we're impacted about -- estimate of about $30 million and about $150 million for the full year. Sea freight and logistics would be second, followed by glysophate, precious metals, the catalyst in terms of use in our crop protection processes. And then the core protection supply and freight. These makeup, in total, the delta that we're talking about in terms of impact for the year. 
So whereas previously, we had net of productivity positive for the year. Now what we're looking at is negative $50 million impact for the year as a result of all of this. So that's a big impact for us. The delta, previously, if you looked at, again, productivity of $250 million, our previous guide would have been that we would have had positive, about $150 million net. Now we're looking at net $50 million negative. So that's the $200 million swing that we talked about for the year. 
Hopefully, that helps. And then, just to reinforce what Jim said, the best judgments we have right now we'll continue to refine this and also taking a step back just to reinforce that we're on track for the full year in terms of that EBITDA growth and that EBITDA margin improvement."

Let me just give you a little more detail. I'm going to talk about full year numbers now. 
So in terms of seed deals and modeling costs, we're now looking at around $150 million. Headwinds, seed freight and logistics, that's about 30 -- lyphosate where -- will actually affect pricing, obviously, in terms of pass through, that's about 50. And then rhodium, where that we saw, I think it was a 4x, Rajan, it increased in that spot price. That's now going to impact us for first and second quarter. 
But what the teams have done, and Rajan can talk a little more about that, but we're substituting now palladium for rhodium, but that's still a $50 million estimated impact for the full year. And then finally, on corn products, supply and freight, that's estimated to be about $20 million. And most of that, by the way, occurred in the first quarter. 
The first quarter number, by the way, those should -- some -- what I just gave you should sum to about $300 million. That $300 million compares significantly -- negatively to what we had built into our previous forecast. And as I mentioned previously, net of productivity, we're now looking at a $50 million hit versus previous guide was $150 million positive. So in other words, productivity more than offsetting cost, improve cost increases. Jim or Rajan, anything you guys would want to add in terms of those insights?"

And we -- obviously, you're right. We talked a lot about pricing in the past. And if you recall, on our fourth quarter call, we stated that we expected to continue to maintain the pricing for value strategies that we've had out there for a number of years. And that led to a 2% pricing in corn looking forward and looking back. And all of that mechanism that we had in place coming out of fourth quarter is still there. 
And so if I just look at our first quarter global seed pricing, we were up 2% and corn is also up 2%. So that technology lift that you're mentioning is out there. Now also remember that in North America, we've essentially priced all of the seeds that we're delivering right now back in September of last year, and that was ahead of the big commodity run-up that we're starting to see. 
So it's always a really competitive market out there. But our pricing for value strategy says that we're going to get paid for the yield advantage to technologies that we bring to our customers and most notably in corn. Tim, do you want to kind of maybe mention what you're seeing out there in the market, both from a corn and soybean perspective around what's going on in price?"

The thing",493,"Yes, absolutely, Jim. And good morning P.J., I'd say, as you said, corn pricing has been consistent with our expectations through the course of the season and good strong execution and  I think we are getting paid for our advantaged portfolio. 
The thing we don't see is farmers switching their seed purchases based off of necessarily the price of grain corn. And they purchase technology package based off of the pest pressure that they deal with, and that really doesn't vary that much. And through good times and bad, they're very consistent with their purchases. So that's there. 
We did have a slight phenomenon here in the first quarter where we had a different brand mix in the U.S., as Jim said, a little bit less Pioneer with the revenue recognition kind of that last mile to the hands of the farmer. So that impacted pricing a little arbitrarily there. But I think we're consistent with where we are. 
And obviously, as we look into 2022, we got that lever, and we're clearly going to be looking at all factors around the value of our offer, what the market conditions are. And clearly, product cost considerations have to be part of that. 
Just to touch on soybeans a little bit. As we said earlier, we're very happy with where we're positioned in the marketplace in terms of the acceptance of Enlist E3, very widely available today and well accepted in the marketplace. But what we are in a situation right now in the U.S. market for soybeans, where we're in a period of technology transition. And that transition is, we've got Enlist E3 being rapidly adopted. We've had around a [indiscernible] expand, kind of transition around a [indiscernible] extend flex quickly. And I would say that there is a battle for growers attention in that marketplace. 
Clearly, there's an attempt to ensure that there's penetration of those technologies and gaining rapid adoption. And the other thing we dealt with, both on corn and soybeans this year, is that prices were set and released to farmers in advance of when we had the significant run-up in commodity prices. So I think prices were set fairly from where we sat in terms of that period point in time when we released prices. But clearly, we had this dramatic run-up in the fourth quarter and here into the first quarter as well. 
So as you think on a more global basis, we're looking aggressively at our situation in the second half of the year, where we're currently pricing and repricing some of our products. And we're going to factor in those points that I made around market conditions, our cost considerations, and clearly, that product value is at the foundation of it. 
So -- but it's been, I think, consistent with our expectations, but obviously, it's a little confusing because of the near-term run-up we've had in commodity prices, that's different from when we release pricing."

Does that have to do with the competition in the market you are seeing? 
And I was wondering whether you can talk about the planting estimates and whether you think that those are relatively conservative. Some of the ag retailers have already thought that, probably like corn acres should be 2 million acres higher versus those initial estimates, and soybean acres might be higher by another 2 million acres. So I was wondering if you can comment on that. 
And my second question is about the negative mix in seeds that you alluded to. Is the negative mix a function of you're selling more a Brevant seed versus Pioneer? Or is it a function of your technologies being offered on somebody else's germplasm, like for Enlist for example rather than your own?"

So on the half, what you're seeing overall, you can see strong start in first quarter, and that was led off by the finish to Latin America and an early start to Europe. As we put that on a first half basis, really, what's happening there is you're right, we're going to grow in North America where we're seeing acres return in soybeans and strong, kind of, flattish acres in corn. But we're going to be down overall in Europe on some -- mostly supply constraints in corn. So on balance, it's about flat. 
Now you [indiscernible] on volumes. Now you've mentioned the USDA outlook, and we're watching that very, very carefully. And with our route-to-market approach and kind of that real tight connection right to the acre, we feel like we've put ourselves in a really good spot, that if we do see some acres come back into this market, we're well positioned to capitalize on that. 
In terms of price and mix, it's just the flow-through of the different products. In first quarter, the heavy flow-through of the Pioneer brand is really ahead of us in 2Q. So in first quarter, you're kind of seeing some of that other route to market, other channel brands that are flowing through, as well as the effect of both the European and Latin America flow through.

You look at the corn progress report this week, and we're roughly 10 percentage points above the 5-year average for planet corn area. And that opens the door for farmers to plant more corn. 
Now at the end of the day, it's an individual decision, and farmers are going to make that on a field-by-field basis. And so I think it's fair to say your point around more total corn and soybean acres being planted. I think we would agree with that and probably more consistent with what our original guide was for the year, somewhere in the 180 million to 182 million combined acres on corn and soybeans. 
It's hard to make the call specifically on how much it's going to go to corn or soybeans because it is such an individual decision. But the window is open. And as farmers make great progress planning this crop, then it clearly creates an opportunity for a little bit more corn to be planted in places.

Thanks, Steve, for the question.

And there is no doubt that as we come into this season here in 2021, the investments that growers are making in, we control, is really showing up. And it's maybe not as much in the corn herbicide market, but we're really just feeling in the [indiscernible] in herbicide. And we're leading that charge with Enlist. 
Our business in North America for herbicides organically growth-wise revenue price volume was up 32% in the first quarter over last year. So you can really see that momentum. And we're feeling that in other places around the world. So as we start to shape up for 2022, we're going to be there with a strong lineup of crop protection products. And the overall market backdrop will give us that opportunity to, as Tim said, consider all of those factors as we think through our pricing strategy for this next year. 
In terms of the supply perspective, we really only had one small issue globally, and that's been in Europe. And it's just been related to some production constraints that we felt this past year. There were parts of Europe that had some real weather-related issues. It's not just a Corteva thing. There are other folks in the industry that are feeling that similar pressure. And by and large, I think we've kind of worked our way through it now, and we've put ourselves in a position going into '22 to have the supplies that it's going to take. 
So -- anyway, finishing off on pricing for a moment. I think the best answer to that is you just got to look back at our track record and what we've accomplished over the years. And we've done -- we've accomplished that track record in some pretty tough markets. And as markets start to improve, we're going to continue to drive that, going forward."

And you're right, I've had a fair amount of experience in that. It's just something you do over the course of your career. So it's one of the things that I'll be working to with the team around in terms of options that we have there. Thanks for the question."

Starting on Slide 4. As I step back and reflect on how the organization closed out 2020 with strong sales and earnings growth in the fourth quarter, it is impressive how our teams executed in a very complex and dynamic market environment with the overlay of the COVID pandemic. It displays the focus and execution of our strategy and the commitment to delivering value.
That momentum was sustained through the first quarter. And through focused heads down execution, we delivered a strong start to the year, with margin increases in both segments. I am really pleased with these results.
Our technology leadership remains strong, evidenced by ongoing demand for our new and differentiated products. We continue to launch and rapidly scale these technologies while taking focused actions on our cost and productivity priorities. Collectively, this focus on our commitments is helping to drive meaningful margin expansion today and looking forward.
Importantly, our team around the world delivering these results is resilient. They continue to prove their agility in the face of ongoing market volatility, including the pandemic, and remain intent on prioritizing the safety of colleagues while serving our customers and stakeholders at every turn.
And lastly, I'm pleased to also share that we welcomed 4 new directors to our Board during the quarter. The addition of these directors and their background and experience will complement an already strong and diverse Board and will serve as a catalyst for the ongoing advancement of our strategy, reinforcing our commitment to deliver on our value creation priorities.
So let's look at Slide 5, which is our financial results for the quarter. We delivered strong organic sales growth across both Seed and Crop Protection, leading to 6% organic growth for the company as a whole. Importantly, we realized better operating leverage on our sales growth this quarter as operating EBITDA grew 14% and margins expanded more than 150 basis points, a strong execution on our growth targets coupled with improved SG&A more than offset the market-driven cost headwinds we faced in the quarter. The phenomena of the market-driven cost inflation is a common theme we are seeing across industries, including raw materials and logistics. Dave is going to take us through the key market dynamics and other critical drivers for the remainder of 2021.
On capital allocation, we returned approximately $450 million to shareholders in the quarter via share buybacks and dividends. And we remain on track to complete the majority of our remaining repurchases under the $1 billion program by the first half of 2021. Returning cash to shareholders continues to be a high priority for Corteva and a critical part of our balanced approach to capital allocation. This first quarter performance is another important proof point that our value creation strategy is working, reinforcing our confidence that we will meet our commitments for 2021.
Shifting to the market backdrop on Slide 6. We remain encouraged by the strengthening global ag fundamentals while also navigating macroeconomic uncertainties around the world. The ag outlook turned positive in the fourth quarter of 2020 as a result of rising farm income levels and constructive demand out of China. Today, farm incomes remain elevated on strong commodity prices, and we continue to see record global demand for ag commodities. As a result, we are seeing ending stocks drawn down and expectations that grow our income levels will be at all-time highs, even with the easing government payments this year.
In March, the USDA issued the Prospective Plantings survey results, which indicated flattish corn acres and approximate 5 million-acre increase in soybeans for the U.S. As you recall, our original estimates were between 5 million and 8 million additional acres coming into corn and bean production for 2021, mostly going into soybeans. Given how we position our products with our customers, we are in a good position to take advantage of any potential upside in acres as market conditions continue to evolve.
Commodity prices in Brazil remain strong as concerns of dry weather or lowering expectations on safrinha yields. We also expect to see planted area expansion in Brazil, with the potential for low- to mid-single-digit increases in corn planted area for the late 2021, early 2022 season. Although exchange rates have recently trended favorably, the market remains volatile, and we continue to monitor for any further fluctuations.
More importantly, based on how we are seeing the futures market shape up, we believe these fundamentals will continue into at least 2022 as strong grain demand and supply challenges keep ending stocks low. This constructive backdrop provides Corteva further momentum for value creation as growers turn to best-in-class technology to maximize productivity and value.
So let's turn to Slide 7, and I'll provide some more detail on the strength of our global sales diversity and where we are capitalizing on momentum across the globe. In North America, organic sales were down 2% for the quarter against a difficult 2020 Seed comparison. While 2020 first quarter Seed volumes benefited from early demand amidst favorable weather conditions, we experienced a more normalized delivery pattern this year. We expect corn volumes to increase in the second quarter as our seed deliveries in the U.S. Pioneer brand have caught up to the prior year as of today.
On seed pricing, first quarter was negatively impacted, mostly due to brand mix. Our second quarter deliveries to date reflect improvement in corn pricing despite aggressive market competitiveness. We remain excited about the demand and traction we are seeing in the Enlist soybean launch and still expect Enlist to represent about 30% of the U.S. soybean market in 2021, an important milestone towards our goal of 50% market penetration.
North America Crop Protection had a strong start to the year, with 11% organic growth on strong demand for new technologies, including Enlist herbicide, and solid pricing execution in response to rising raw material, freight and logistics costs. In Europe, Middle East and Africa, organic sales grew 6% on record corn and sunflower seed volumes as supply concerns and commodity cost pressures drove an early start to the spring sales season.
Our portfolio of new and differentiated products, such as Arylex and Rinskor herbicides, remain in high demand, which enabled us to drive price and volume in Crop Protection. During the quarter, we also obtained key regulatory approvals, including the registration of Univoq fungicide with Inatreq active for sale and use in the U.K., a major milestone for cereal growers needing innovative and sustainable chemistry solutions to protect their crops.
In Latin America, we delivered 38% organic sales growth on strong volumes and execution of our price for value strategy. And Seed volumes grew 39% on strong Brazil safrinha sales and early demand in other countries. In Crop Protection, volume grew 10% on significant demand for new and differentiated technologies such as Isoclast and Jemvelva insecticides and Enlist herbicides. Pricing actions reflect strong product demand and partially offset unfavorable currency impacts in the Brazilian real.
In Asia Pacific, we realized 9% organic sales growth compared to the prior year on both volume and price improvements. While Seed volumes were down on the shift of some corn sales to the second half, Crop Protection growth was led by further penetration of Jemvelva and Pyraxalt insecticides.
Now Dave will provide more detail on our results and our expectations for the rest of the year. But let me first say, we are very excited to have Dave join the Corteva team, and I look forward to the contributions he will make in bolstering our momentum and execution looking ahead. So Dave, over to you."
319130234,709683937,2270586,"Corteva, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 05, 2021",2021-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Corteva, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jim, very much, and welcome, everybody, to this morning's call. Let's go to Slide 8 for a more detailed review of our strong first quarter operating EBITDA performance. You can see that operating EBITDA grew from $794 million last year to $904 mil",1572,"Thanks, Jim, very much, and welcome, everybody, to this morning's call. Let's go to Slide 8 for a more detailed review of our strong first quarter operating EBITDA performance. You can see that operating EBITDA grew from $794 million last year to $904 million in the first quarter of 2021, representing a $110 million improvement. It's a clear testament to the momentum that Jim mentioned. Driving this increase were price benefits of $125 million and volume benefits of $50 million from strong commercial execution and penetration of our new and differentiated products across all regions. It represents important progress on our targets and really reflects the strength of our portfolio and pipeline.
On new crop protection products, we recognized sales growth of over $120 million. At the same time, we delivered record corn and sunflower volumes in Europe and strong safrinha sales in Brazil, which helped to offset the seasonal timing of seed deliveries in North America. Finally, we continue to extract value for our yield advantage technology in corn, with global corn pricing up 2% for the quarter.
Now costs were a $70 million net headwind to operating EBITDA for the quarter. This reflects approximately $50 million in productivity and other cost actions positively, which were more than offset by higher input and freight costs, which are primarily market-driven. Let me give you some color on that.
As economies across the globe start to emerge from the pandemic-related shutdowns, global trade markets are experiencing higher shipping demand, leading to higher freight costs. Additionally, prices of certain active ingredients and intermediates have risen compared to the same period last year. As a result, we incurred approximately $120 million of cost headwinds in the quarter due to increased freight and logistics, higher raw material costs and unfavorable seed yields in Europe. Now we're taking action where possible to mitigate these impacts, including delivering on our productivity initiatives and passing through certain inflationary costs for our seed and crop protection products.
For example, late in the first quarter, we initiated, on average, mid-single-digit price increases in the U.S. on our crop protection products. Taken together, we delivered over 150 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter as a result of the discipline and focused execution despite the cost increases that we encountered.
Let's go now to Slide 9, focused on Crop Protection for the quarter, I'll cover a few highlights. As you can see, Crop Protection organic sales grew 12% in the quarter, driven by a 6% increase in volume and a 6% increase in price. Now keep in mind, included with this volume, growth is a 5% headwind from our strategic decision to phase out certain products, primarily in the insecticides portfolio, including Chlorpyrifos as well as telone.
Now strong global demand for our new technology led to an increase of more than $120 million in new product sales when compared to the same period last year. Herbicides were up 20% compared to the first quarter of 2020, led by continued penetration of Arylex and Enlist. Fungicides grew 14%, driven by strong demand for Zorvec and also Inatreq, primarily in Europe, Middle East and Africa. And lastly, insecticides grew 2% in the quarter, largely driven by our differentiated Spinosyns technology, notably Jemvelva as well as Qalcova. These were up 29% in the quarter. Now this growth was again muted by our decision to phase out select insecticides as mentioned earlier.
Favorable product mix in Crop Protection and strategic price increases drove pricing gains in the quarter, including an 18% price improvement in Latin America and a 6% price improvement in North America. Operating EBITDA for Crop Protection improved 35% for the quarter driven by robust demand for new products and pricing execution. Now we experienced cost headwinds of approximately $70 million for this segment. And again, these included increased raw material costs, such as precious metals used as catalysts, as well as increased freight and logistics. Taken on a whole, these headwinds more than offset our productivity actions.
As we go forward, we're aggressively managing controllable factors and at the same time, proactively mitigating this cost through delivering against our productivity programs, passing through certain costs for our products wherever possible. Very impressively, despite these challenges I mentioned, we drove over 300 basis points of improvement of operating EBITDA margin in the segment in the quarter.
Let's go now to the Seed segment on Slide 10. You can see organic sales for Seed were up 3% driven by strong Brazil safrinha sales and record corn and sunflower volumes in Europe on an early start to the spring. These gains were partially offset by the seasonal timing of deliveries in North America, where Seed volumes in the quarter were down 6%, driven by the U.S. where we had a very early start in the prior year. Overall, global corn volumes were flat, reflecting these seasonal shifts.
On pricing, we maintained our track record in extracting value for our yield-advantaged technology, with corn prices up 2% for the quarter. Soybean volumes were also flat for the quarter, with price down 4%. Now keep in mind, the first quarter is a meaningful quarter for soybeans since the large majority of the deliveries occur in the second quarter. And as Jim mentioned, our expectations for Enlist E3, the ramp there is on track. Other oilseeds were up 19% versus the first quarter of 2020, reflecting record sunflower volumes in Europe and higher canola volumes in Canada.
Operating EBITDA for this segment improved 6% on strong price execution globally, ongoing cost and productivity actions and a gain on the remeasurement of an R&D technology-based equity investment, which is included in the Other column. These improvements were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of currency and higher input costs, which were primarily market related. These cost increases included, again, higher freight and logistics costs, coupled with the impact of unfavorable seed yields on European corn. The teams continue to manage through these headwinds and still delivered operating EBITDA margin improvement of over 100 basis points for Seed for the quarter.
So now let's go to Slide 11, talk about our first half 2021 updated expectations and full year 2021 guidance. With the backdrop of the segments, you can see we expect top line growth of about 3% for the half, led by continued strong demand for our new crop protection products globally. This growth includes an approximately $130 million sales headwind from strategic decisions to phase out certain crop protection products.
On the Seed side, we're monitoring what ultimately gets planted this season in North America given recent strengthening in commodity price levels. Globally, we expect first half Seed volumes to be about flat with the prior year. We're confident that we'll maintain our momentum, and we continue to extract value for our yield-advantaged technology in corn globally.
Turning to costs. We remain committed to the execution and realization of our productivity programs, which we believe will be more than offset by anticipated headwinds from increasing freight and logistics, higher raw materials and unfavorable seed yields in Europe, resulting in a net headwind of $50 million for the half. Taken together, this translates to operating EBITDA of $2.15 billion to $2.25 billion for the half, an increase of 8% over 2020 at the midpoint and an approximate 120 basis point increase to operating EBITDA margins.
Turning to the full year. We're raising our revenue guidance. We now expect reported net sales to be between $14.6 billion and $14.8 billion, up 3% to 4% over 2020. This increase reflects continued demand for new products globally in both our Crop Protection and Seed segments, coupled with strong price execution in key regions on technology and pricing for higher costs where possible.
On cost, we expect a net headwind for the year of $50 million as the higher input costs and freight logistics are more than offsetting productivity savings. Specific to G&A spend, we're maintaining our post-COVID spending levels with anticipation that G&A will be essentially flat for the year, with the organization driving inflation impacts to a net 0 for G&A. Reflecting the strength of what we're seeing in the market and focused execution, we remain on track to deliver operating EBITDA between $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion for the year, an improvement of 17% over 2020 at the midpoint and approximately 200 basis points of margin improvement.
Standing back, here are the key takeaways for the quarter: first, we delivered an impressive start to the year in both top and bottom line, driven by penetration of technology-advantaged products despite some headwinds; and second, we remain on track to deliver strong double-digit earnings improvement for the year.
So before turning the call back to Jim, I just want to take a second to provide a few initial observations since joining Corteva last month. Coming into the company, I've been impressed with the tremendous franchise that Corteva represents. It's backed by a strong culture and high-value assets, which I believe, in combination, are capable of delivering on the significant growth potential.  
Leveraging what I refer to as the CFO skill set, it provides a great opportunity to help deliver the operating leverage we see for the business. Those are early thoughts. I look forward to sharing more with you in the future and working with the team on executing Corteva's strategy.
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Jim."

As you can see in our results, this organization is executing. We're off to a strong start to the year. And despite some of the unplanned headwinds from market-related factors, we're on track with our expectations.
And as we look ahead, we remain focused on driving progress against those fundamental elements of our strategy: advancing our industry-leading innovation pipeline, including the ramp-up of our proprietary Enlist system, and delivering on our productivity and cost savings initiatives; and maintaining our disciplined approach to capital allocation. Now we have considerable momentum right now, and we expect focused execution in our plan will enable us to continue to generate value and deliver on our commitments to our shareholders.
The market backdrop is clearly strengthening. And despite macro uncertainties, we expect favorable market dynamics to continue through the midterm. Our current pace is aligned with our midterm earnings targets, and we are well positioned to create significant durable value for shareholders in 2021 and beyond.
And finally, at the foundation of this is a fully focused team and a strong legacy of technology leadership, which can be traced all the way back to the founding of the Pioneer brand, which, by the way, just celebrated its 95th anniversary. This legacy and a shared sense of accountability for our commitments and our purpose demonstrates that the culture we have built at Corteva is solid.
The events of this past year have left an undeniable impact on all of us. The Corteva teams rose to this challenge, prioritizing the safety of our colleagues, our customers and our communities, and our teams around the world continue to do that today. 2021 has proven that the pandemic recovery remains uneven, and an ongoing focus on our values, including safety, are just going to remain critical as this global health crisis intensifies in parts of the world, such as India. As a global citizen, with operations in 140 countries, we remain as committed as ever to taking actions locally in the communities in which we operate. Harnessing the power of our scale provides to deliver value for all of our stakeholders.

And I would start by saying we had a lot coming at us, but a really great start by the team, and it's always kind of tough to call that first quarter, kind of second quarter split. But we're, I think, executing pretty well.
There are some things, some areas that we're still watching, some trends that are moving up on us that may be a little bit greater than we started the year. And a lot of that starts with commodity prices. Those are going to continue to affect our seed production costs. And a little of that is for full year, kind of back-end loaded as we watch production costs in Brazil and harvest seed and get ready for that commercial season.
There are some market-driven cost headwinds. And maybe I'll hand it over to Dave to share a little more detail on a few of those. But at the high level, it's things like freight and some of the key raw materials, and many of those are COVID-related, transportation-related, and some of those are just kind of global demand, really creating some shortages here and there.
And I'd say some of the other areas that are affecting costs are also COVID-related. The recovery that we're seeing globally is a little bit uneven. We're seeing some flare-ups in parts of the world, like India and Brazil that are affecting transportation and logistics routes, but also affecting our customers and, in some cases, demand and supply.
So as I step back and I think about some of the opportunities that we're driving, this team is executing really well, and we're covering -- essentially covering those costs with our outlook. We're -- as we've said earlier, we're essentially on track with our full year guidance that we gave you. So even though there are some new headwinds that I've mentioned, we've got those covered. And I think what we've done with this outlook is taken a really balanced approach here and continue to monitor and watch these.
But Dave, do you want to share any more detail for Dave on that?"

So I think a couple of things, just to add a little bit to what Jim said and kind of back to your question. Number one, as you would suspect, we spend a lot of time on this subject.

Number one, as you would suspect, we spend a lot of time on this subject. I mean this is something that has really been a focus and attention of this leadership team, with this management team. And it's a headline item, obviously, not just for Corteva. It's industry-wide phenomena that you're seeing in a number of the releases.
Some of the things that I think stand out, just to add a little bit to what Jim said, number one, we're on track in terms of our annual productivity. That's the key message. The $250 million guide that we gave you at the beginning of the year, we're on track for that. So what we're really talking about is what is the incremental impact relative to that.
So seed yields and commodity costs, that's the biggest item. For the quarter, we're impacted about -- we estimate about $30 million and about $150 million for the full year. Seed freight and logistics would be second, followed by glyphosate, precious metals, the catalysts in terms of use in our crop protection processes. And then the core protection supply and freight. These make up, in total, the delta that we're talking about in terms of impact for the year.
So whereas previously, we had, net of productivity, a positive for the year, now what we're looking at is negative $50 million impact for the year as a result of all of this. So that's a big impact for us. The delta -- previously, if you looked at, again, productivity of $250 million, our previous guide would have been -- we would have had positive, about $150 million net, now we're looking at net $50 million negative. So that's the $200 million swing that we talked about for the year.
Hopefully, that -- and just to reinforce what Jim said, this is the best judgments we have right now. We'll continue to refine this and also taking a step back just to reinforce that we're on track for the full year in terms of that EBITDA growth and that EBITDA margin improvement."

I want to reinforce one point that Dave made earlier, that our productivity programs that we launched at the beginning of the year are still on track.

Let me -- because I named the major categories earlier, Joel, let me just give you a little more detail. I'm going to talk about full year numbers now.
So in terms of seed yields and commodity costs, we're now looking at around $150 million headwind. Seed freight and logistics, that's about $30 million. Glyphosate will actually affect pricing, obviously, in terms of pass-through, that's about $50 million. And then rhodium where -- that we saw, I think it was a 4x, Rajan, increase in that spot price, that's now going to impact us for first and second quarter. But what the teams have done, and Rajan can spend -- can talk a little more about that, but we're substituting now palladium for rhodium, but that's still a $50 million estimated impact for the full year. And then finally, on corn products, supply and freight, that's estimated to be about $20 million. And most of that, by the way, occurred in the first quarter.
The first quarter number, by the way, those should sum -- what I just gave you, should sum to about $300 million. That $300 million compares significantly -- negatively to what we had built into our previous forecast. And as I mentioned previously, net of productivity, we're now looking at a $50 million hit versus previous guide was $150 million positive. I mean in other words, productivity more than offsetting cost improve cost increases. Jim or Rajan, anything you guys would want to add in terms of those insights?"

So just the overall market environment is positive.
But if you take those together, that represents in the neighborhood of about $30 million to $35 million for the quarter. In total for the year, it's part of our walk -- when we do our bridge from where we were to where we are now in terms of, as Jim said, our balanced outlook, that is included in that.

And we -- obviously, you're right. We talked a lot about pricing in the past. And if you recall, on our fourth quarter call, we stated that we expected to continue to maintain the pricing for value strategies that we've had out there for a number of years. And that led to a 2% pricing in corn looking forward and -- or looking back. And all of that mechanism that we had in place coming out of fourth quarter is still there.
And so if I just look at our first quarter global seed pricing, we were up 2%, and corn is also up 2%. So that technology lift that you're mentioning is out there. Now also remember that in North America, we've essentially priced all of the seeds that we're delivering right now back in September of last year, and that was ahead of the big commodity run-up that we're starting to see.
So it's always a really competitive market out there. But our pricing for value strategy says that we're going to get paid for the yield-advantaged technologies that we bring to our customers and most notably in corn. Tim, do you want to kind of maybe mention what you're seeing out there in the market, both from a corn and soybean perspective around what's going on in price?"

I'd say, as you said, corn pricing has been consistent with our expectations through the course of the season and good strong execution.

I'd say, as you said, corn pricing has been consistent with our expectations through the course of the season and good strong execution. And I think we are getting paid for our advantaged portfolio.
The thing we don't see is farmers switching their seed purchases based off of necessarily the price of grain corn. And they purchase a technology package based off of the pest pressure that they deal with, and that really doesn't vary that much. And through good times and bad, they're very consistent with their purchases. So that's there.
We did have a slight phenomenon here in the first quarter where we had a different brand mix in the U.S., as Jim said, a little bit less Pioneer, with the revenue recognition kind of that last mile to the hands of the farmer. So that impacted pricing a little arbitrarily there. But I think we're consistent with where we are. And obviously, as we look into 2022, we've got that lever, and we're clearly going to be looking at all factors around the value of our offer, what the market conditions are. And clearly, product cost considerations have to be part of that.
Just to touch on soybeans a little bit. As we said earlier, we're very happy with where we're positioned in the marketplace in terms of the acceptance of Enlist E3, very widely available today and well accepted in the marketplace. But we are in a situation right now in the U.S. market for soybeans where we're in a period of technology transition. And that transition is, we've got Enlist E3 being rapidly adopted. We've had Roundup Ready 2 Xtend kind of transition to Roundup Ready 2 Xtend Flex quickly. And I would say that there is a battle for growers' attention in that marketplace. Clearly, there's an attempt to ensure that there's penetration of those technologies and gaining rapid adoption.
And the other thing we dealt with, both on corn and soybeans this year, is that prices were set and released to farmers in advance of when we had the significant run-up in commodity prices. So I think prices were set fairly from where we sat in terms of that point in time when we released prices. But clearly, we had this dramatic run-up in the fourth quarter and here into the first quarter as well.
So as you think on a more global basis, we're looking aggressively at our situation in the second half of the year, where we're currently pricing and repricing some of our products. And we're going to factor in those points that I made around market conditions, our cost considerations, and clearly, that product value is at the foundation of it. So -- but it's been, I think, consistent with our expectations, but obviously, it's a little confusing because of the near-term run-up we've had in commodity prices that's different from when we release pricing."

And I was wondering whether you can talk about the planting estimates and whether you think that those are relatively conservative. Some of the ag retailers have already thought that, probably like corn acres should be 2 million acres higher versus those initial estimates, and soybean acres might be higher by another 2 million acres. So I was wondering if you can comment on that.
And my second question is about the negative mix in Seed that you alluded to. Is the negative mix a function of you're selling more Brevant seed versus Pioneer? Or is it a function of your technologies being offered on somebody else's germplasm, like for Enlist, for example, rather than your own?"

So on the half, what you're seeing, you can see strong start in the first quarter, and that was led off by the finish to Latin America and an early start to Europe. As we put that on a first half basis, really, what's happening there is you're right, we're going to grow in North America. We're seeing acres return in soybeans and strong, kind of, flattish acres in corn. But we're going to be down overall in Europe on some -- mostly supply constraints in corn. So on balance, it's about flat. Now you -- on volumes.
Now you've mentioned the USDA outlook, and we're watching that very, very carefully. And with our route-to-market approach and kind of that real tight connection right to the acre, we feel like we've put ourselves in a really good spot, that if we do see some acres come back into this market, we're well positioned to capitalize on that.
In terms of price and mix, it's just the flow-through of the different products. In first quarter, the heavy flow-through of the Pioneer brand is really ahead of us in 2Q. So in first quarter, you're kind of seeing some of that other route to market, other channel brands that are flowing through as well as the effect of both the European and Latin America flow-through.

We're in a, I'd say, a fairly favorable planting environment right now. You look in -- at the corn progress report this week, and we're roughly 10 percentage points above the 5-year average for planted corn area. And that opens the door for farmers to plant more corn.
Now at the end of the day, it's an individual decision, and farmers are going to make that on a field-by-field basis. And so I think it's fair to say your point around more total corn and soybean acres being planted, I think we would agree with that and probably more consistent with what our original guide was for the year, somewhere in the 180 million to 182 million combined acres on corn and soybeans.
It's hard to make the call specifically on how much it's going to go to corn or soybeans because it is such an individual decision. But the window is open. And as farmers make great progress planting this crop, then it clearly creates an opportunity for a little bit more corn to be planted in places.

Thanks, Steve, for the question. Clearly, a strong market backdrop, good commodity prices, net farm income levels, where they are, provides opportunities for a grower to make an investment in their crop, whether it's continue to purchase really, really strong high-performance seed, but also to make that investment in a strong crop protection program.
And there is no doubt that as we come into this season here in 2021, the investments that growers are making in weed control is really showing up. And it's maybe not as much in the corn herbicide market, but we're really just feeling it in the soybean herbicide. And we're leading that charge with Enlist. Our business in North America for herbicides organically -- growth-wise, revenue price volume was up 32% in the first quarter over last year. So you can really see that momentum. And we're feeling that in other places around the world.
So as we start to shape up for 2022, we're going to be there with a strong lineup of crop protection products. And the overall market backdrop will give us that opportunity to, as Tim said, consider all of those factors as we think through our pricing strategy for this next year.
In terms of the supply perspective, we really only had one small issue globally, and that's been in Europe. And it's just been related to some production constraints that we felt this past year. There were parts of Europe that had some real weather-related issues. It's not just a Corteva thing. There are other folks in the industry that are feeling that similar pressure. And by and large, I think we've kind of worked our way through it now, and we've put ourselves in a position going into '22 to have the supplies that it's going to take.
So -- anyway, finishing off on pricing for a moment. I think the best answer to that is you just got to look back at our track record and what we've accomplished over the years. And we've done -- we've accomplished that track record in some pretty tough markets. And as markets start to improve, we're going to continue to drive that going forward."

And so you're right, this year, we've talked about $250 million of productivity programs, a lot of those aimed in our manufacturing and cost of manufacturing organization. But we will continue to have productivity focus in other areas of the business.
One of the areas where our costs have trended down nicely has been related to this whole pandemic and COVID and the fact that we have areas of the business where we're being just really efficient with the investments that we're making. And we would expect a little of that cost to come back this year. Our stance, we're pretty much trying to maintain that very kind of tight-focused stance.
And it's a little early, but as we start to think about 2022 in North America, we'll start to return to a more normal, kind of, stance in terms of people and work and a little bit more travel maybe and a little bit more from a focus on investments there. But I'm committed, and Dave and I have talked a lot about this, about finding additional productivity programs so we don't let those costs creep back in. So Dave, what else would you share?"

The key thing is, in addition to productivity, we've also, as you know, invested behind some restructuring. And a lot of that benefit is going to flow through in future periods. So we've got some things that are in the stream, if you will, that are active, that are also going to benefit us going forward.
But as Jim said, this isn't just -- this isn't a static process, a very, very dynamic process. We're going to continue to look at how do we continue to replenish this portfolio of programs and projects. And that's a big part of delivering in terms of our forward plan."

I think it's a really, really timely question given that. And it's one that Jim and I have talked about. We'll have, obviously, the opportunity to do deeper analysis, working with not only the finance team, but others in the organization, sharing some thoughts with the Board, coming back and, later in the year, probably sharing more thoughts also with investors.
So that's something I would say is very much on our minds. I would say right now, the thing that we're really focused on is just continuing to execute operationally, deliver the margin expansion and deliver, obviously, the cash flow for the year and continue to reward shareholders, not only through our operating performance, but also through our ongoing dividend and our share buyback program. And then that gives us optionality. And I think that's a plus. I would say we look forward to giving you updates on that as we go forward.

Starting on Slide 4. 
We launched Corteva with a strategy grounded in building and delivering value for shareholders through new product innovation that drives organic growth and margin improvement, organizational efficiency and rigor and disciplined capital allocation. As I speak to you today, I'm happy to say this strategy is working. Now that's a testament to the extraordinary efforts by our more than 20,000 colleagues worldwide over the last 5 years, beginning with the announcement of the intent to create Corteva. At its core, this team is focused on one thing, delivering. Time after time, they have demonstrated tremendous resilience and adaptability by pushing forward to bring our purpose to life advance our strategy and deliver our near-term business results no matter the circumstances. So to them, I say thank you, as I could not be prouder of their relentless focus. 
Our first half performance is yet another solid proof point of our progress, with 6% organic growth and 17% operating EBITDA improvement compared to the prior year. 
In Crop Protection, we continue to build on our new product momentum. And now expect we will deliver $400 million in sales growth for this part of the portfolio for the year, up from our prior estimate of $300 million, a direct result of successfully advancing our pipeline. In fact, through June of this year, we've received nearly 90 additional new product registrations for our Crop Protection portfolio. 
Market fundamentals remain positive as growers look to best-in-class solutions to drive productivity. This helped drive pricing in Seed, specifically, 3% increases in corn globally as well as further [Audio Gap] now estimated to be on approximately 35% of U.S. soybean acres, and that's up from prior estimates of 30%. 
Execution is sound, and we are carrying substantial momentum. As a result, we are raising our guidance for full year. We now expect to deliver between $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion in operating EBITDA for the full year 2021, representing a 22% growth over the prior year at the midpoint. Importantly, we also expect to maintain the operating leverage we delivered through the first half, with an impressive 200 basis point increase in margins for the full year on the organization's continued agility in the face of ongoing supply chain volatility and cost inflation, which brings us back to value creation. In addition to strong earnings growth, we are also advancing our commitments on returning cash to shareholders. Specifically, Corteva returned approximately $750 million in cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases through the first half. And we recently announced a dividend increase of 7.7% and a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program. In total, we expect to return more than $1.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases by the end of 2021. 
The bottom line, we are executing on what we said we would do. We are delivering operating leverage. And we are intently focused on advancing our strategy to deliver value for all of our shareholders. 
So looking at Slide 5, which has our financial results for the quarter and the first half. 
So quickly touching on the quarter. We delivered 6% organic growth on gains in both segments, led by North America and Latin America. This translated into earnings growth of 18% and margin improvement of more than 200 basis points, another solid quarter of continued growth and margin improvement. 
Now focusing on the half. Sales gains were led by execution of our new product pipeline, where new Crop Protection products delivered $260 million in sales growth over the prior year. Additionally, seed sales improved on increased planted area in U.S. soybeans and strong demand for corn in Latin America. We continued to deliver on our price for value strategy as global corn prices improved 3% for the half. 
Now Dave is going to provide you much more detail on the earnings growth drivers for the half, but it's important to note the impressive level of margin improvement that we have delivered so far this year. 
Through the half, we drove nearly 200 basis points of margin improvement compared to the prior year on price and volume gains across the portfolio, despite continued challenges on cost inflation that we and many others across various industries continue to face. Again, this first half performance is yet another important proof point that our value creation strategy is working, further reinforcing our updated guidance for the full year. 
So shifting to the market backdrop on Slide 6. 
Fundamentals remain strong despite volatility in the commodity markets. We believe global demand will ultimately drive growth into 2022 and beyond as local economies recover from the pandemic-related shutdowns. We're monitoring the impacts of the pandemic globally. And we'll remain agile to ensure we continue to support our employees, our customers and our local communities. 
Now while the U.S. market remains attractive as we look to the near-term outlook, we see strong demand for best-in-class technologies in markets outside of the U.S. Take Brazil, for example, where demand for grain is leading to increased planted area and rising commodity prices. With our market-leading position for corn and one of the best new crop protection lineups, we are in a strong position to capitalize on above-market growth. 
While commodity prices will continue to react to short-term events in the industry, it's important to remember that the global diversity of our business is what provides an attractive outlook for growth. Together with sustained growth in global ag markets, led by robust global demand, we are pleased with the acceleration and opportunities to deliver value to our customers in these local markets through our best-in-class products and advantaged routes to market. 
Turning to Slide 7. I'll provide more detail on the balance and the diversity of our sales growth across the globe and provide further proof points for the half. 
In North America, organic sales were up 4% for the half. Seed sales benefited from increased planted area for both corn and soybeans, coupled with continued penetration of the Enlist E3 soybeans. As I mentioned, we now expect Enlist to represent about [ 35% ] of the U.S. soybean market in 2021, and that's up from our previous expectation of 30%. 
On seed pricing for the first half, competitive pressures in the soybean market was aligned with our prior expectations, with pricing down 2%. Corn price in the Pioneer brand was up about 1 point compared to the prior year. 
North America Crop Protection had a strong first half with 10% organic growth, on continued demand for new technologies, including Enlist herbicide and solid pricing execution in response to rising raw material, freight and logistics costs. Fungicide growth was also a highlight, up double-digits, as growers look to take preventative measures to maximize yields. 
In Europe, Middle East and Africa, organic sales grew 5% on strong pricing execution and record sunflower seed volumes. This growth was muted by an approximate $80 million to $100 million sales impact from corn supply shortages. 
In Crop Protection, our portfolio of new and differentiated products remain in high demand, including technologies such as Arylex herbicide and Zorvec fungicide, which enabled us to drive price and volume gains and gain market share in Europe despite the impact of product phaseouts. 
In Latin America, we delivered 23% organic sales growth on strong volumes and execution on our price for value strategy. In seed, volumes grew 20% on share gains in the Brazil safrinha and earlier shipments for the Brazil summer season. In Crop Protection, volumes grew 9% on significant demand for new and differentiated technologies such as Isoclast and Genelba insecticides. Pricing actions reflected strong product demand and helped to more than offset unfavorable currency impacts from the Brazilian real. 
In Asia Pacific, we realized 3% organic sales growth compared to the prior year on both volume and price improvements. Seed volumes were down, largely due to COVID-related demand impacts, primarily in Southeast Asia and India. Crop Protection organic growth [ of ] 11% was led by further penetration of our new products, including RINs core herbicide and Pyraxalt insecticide. 
So Dave will now provide more detail on our first half performance and our upgraded expectations for the rest of the year. Dave?"

Let's move to Slide 8 for a detailed review of our operating EBITDA performance for the year -- or for the first half. 
You'll see that for the first half 2021, operating EBITDA grew $335 million versus the prior year to nearly $2.4 billion, a clear indication of how well we've executed in the first half and a reflection of our ability to capitalize on robust demand for our products. Driving the increased operating EBITDA were strong price and volume, with combined benefits of approximately $340 million. This came from focused commercial execution and penetration of new and differentiated products across all regions. To illustrate this, sales of new crop protection products grew over $260 million versus the prior year. And at the same time, we delivered nearly 30% of organic seed growth in Latin America, driven by strong corn sales in Brazil. And finally, we continue to extract value for our yield advantage technology. And as Jim said, global corn pricing up 3% during the half. 
Costs were about a $60 million net headwind to operating EBITDA for the half. This includes delivery of approximately $175 million from productivity initiatives, including the ongoing benefit from asset footprint rationalization and other cost improvements. This helped to partially offset $240 million of cost headwinds in the half, which are primarily market-driven. And we continue to operate in an environment marked with challenged supply chains and cost inflation. In the first half, we experienced higher freight and logistics costs as global trade markets saw shipping demand outpace supply. Additionally, prices of certain active ingredients and intermediates continue to rise compared to the same period last year, including glyphosate. 
Now we continue to take action to mitigate these impacts where possible, including passing through certain inflationary costs for our seed and Crop Protection products and delivering against our productivity initiatives. As evidence of our disciplined focused execution, we delivered more than 190 basis points of margin expansion in the half. It's notable in terms of the agile operations team delivering strong performance. 
Let's go now to Slide 9 to cover a few highlights from the Crop Protection segment [ for ] the half, where organic sales grew 10%, which included a 4% headwind from the strategic decision to phase out certain low-margin products, primarily in insecticides. Again, strong demand for our new technology led to sales gains, including an increase of more than $260 million in new product sales when compared to the same period last year. 
Herbicides were up 13% compared to the first half of 2020, led by continued penetration of Arylex and Enlist. Fungicides grew 26%, driven by strong demand for Zorvec and Inotek, primarily in Europe, Middle East and Africa. And lastly, insecticides grew 3%, which included a 16% negative impact from discontinued products. Growth was largely driven by our differentiated Spinosyn technology, including Jim Vela and Calcova actives, which were up 14% in the half. Favorable product mix and strategic price increases drove pricing gains in all regions for the half, led by a 9% improvement in Latin America and a 3% price improvement in North America. 
Operating EBITDA for Crop Protection grew 26% from the prior year, driven by strong demand for new products and pricing execution. We did experience cost headwinds of approximately $130 million for this segment during the period. Overall, the headwinds more than offset our productivity actions. In most cases, we see these higher costs representing a new baseline, which we'll continue to work to mitigate by taking pricing actions where possible and delivering ongoing productivity. Now despite these challenges, we drove over 220 basis points of operating EBITDA margin improvement in Crop Protection in the half. Very impressive performance. 
Let's go to then Slide 10 and talk about the Seed highlights. 
You can see on Slide 10, organic sales for Seed were up 4%, driven by solid pricing, coupled with market share gains in Brazil safrina, [ given ] earlier shipments for Brazil summer season and also volume growth in North America on increased planted area aligned with USDA estimates. On pricing, we maintained our track record in extracting value for our yield advantage technology, with corn prices up 3% compared to prior year, led by double-digit price improvement in Latin America. Soybean volumes were up 7% for the half, led by an approximately 5% increase in U.S. planted area. Soybean pricing was down 2%, consistent with our expectations, as we continue to see competitive pressure in the U.S. market. Other oilseeds were up 21% versus the first half of 2020, reflecting record SunPower volumes in Europe and also higher canola volumes in Canada. Operating EBITDA for this segment improved 13% on strong price execution globally, ongoing cost and productivity actions, lower royalties and bad debt and a favorable impact from currency. And while we experienced higher input costs, the teams continue to manage through these headwinds, and we're able to deliver operating EBITDA margin improvement of over 200 basis points for the segment for the half. 
So now let's go to Slide 11 and talk about our full year 2021 guidance. 
You can see there that for the remainder of the year and our updated expectations for the full year, and with the backdrop of the strong performance for the first half, we're raising our reported net sales guidance to be in the range of $15.2 billion to $15.4 billion, representing 8% growth at the midpoint, which includes an approximately 2% tailwind from currency. We're also raising our operating EBITDA guide, and now expect to be in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion, representing 22% growth at the midpoint. This increase reflects continued strong demand for our new products globally in both Crop Protection and Seed, coupled with strong price execution in key regions on technology and also improved currency. 
Specific to the second half, we expect price to largely offset cost headwinds, which are notably Seed-driven. And as a result, volume, primarily in Latin America Crop Protection, is driving second half earnings growth. Now the volatility of exchange rates will continue to be a key variable we're watching, notably the Brazilian real, where we assumed a rate of 5.25 for the back half of the year. 
In Crop Protection, we anticipate $400 million of year-over-year improvement in sales from our new products, $100 million more than we originally estimated. The additional growth is a testament to strong demand that we're seeing globally for our best-in-class technology. 
As we think about costs, the current inflationary environment is expected to continue through at least the end of the year. As a result, we now expect a net cost headwind of approximately $125 million for the full year 2021. This represents about $75 million in additional cost inflation from our previous estimate. It's driven by higher input costs as well as freight and logistics. Now we're actively monitoring supply chain pressures in the market, and the operational teams remain agile in meeting customer demand. 
As it relates to SG&A, the organization continues to maintain disciplined spending. And we anticipate that as a percent of revenue, SG&A is expected to improve by approximately 50 basis points for the year despite higher commissions and also variable compensation. Taken together, it's an impressive improvement and impressive outlook and really highlights the strong focus by the full organization to execute on our strategy. 
Turn now to Slide 12 with a few comments on cash flow. I'll give you a view on our 2021 cash flow expectations. 
We now believe cash from operations will be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion for the year. It reflects both increased earnings, but also the investment we're making in working capital to support growth. The organization continues to focus on cash cycle time. It's working. As a result, we're targeting improvement in net working capital turns for the full year. 
We're increasing our CapEx spending target from $550 million to between $600 million and $650 million for 2021. The increase allows us to fund projects with high return on investment to support growth. And it follows a complete midyear review that we completed of all of our capital programs. 
We've experienced an improvement in the funded status of the U.S. pension plan year-to-date, driven by both asset returns and discount rate. The improvement provides increased probability, there will be no required contributions to the plan in '21 or 2022. 
Finally, as Jim stated, we're committed to the return of cash to shareholders as evidenced by more than $1.2 billion we expect to return via dividends and share repurchases by the end of the year, which includes expected progress on the new $1.5 billion program that we recently announced. 
Now if you move to Slide 13, I just want to give you some early insights on our planning process and thinking as we start to frame out 2022. 
Importantly, carrying forward our momentum from 2021, we expect to see organic growth globally. This will largely be driven by execution and further penetration of new and differentiated products across all regions, reflecting the strength of our portfolio and our pipeline, which are expected to drive increases in both volume and price in 2022. For example, we continue to remain excited about the growth opportunities for spinosyns, which we believe will approach sales of $1 billion in 2022. We expect seed pricing to be additive to earnings when netted with the impact of higher cost of goods sold as a result of higher commodity costs. 
And with our transition to Enlist, we expect royalty improvement for 2022 as part of our journey towards royalty neutrality by the end of the decade. Royalty reduction is anticipated to be more significant in '23 and '24, but next year will be an important next step on continuing a royalty improvement. 
And lastly, we remain focused on delivering against productivity as input costs continue to evolve with the current market environment. So to manage this pressure, we're going to continue to drive execution on productivity initiatives, which are expected to partially offset any increase in [indiscernible] the setup for next year. 
We're going to share more details later this year. But certainly, we view 2022 as a solid opportunity for earnings and margin growth as we execute our strategy and we leverage our global footprint and our diversified portfolio. 
So before turning it back to Jim, let me just do a quick summary, focus on both our 2021 delivery and the set-up for 2022. 
This year is characterized by first half operating EBITDA margin improvement of nearly 200 basis points and full year margin expectations also improved by approximately 200 basis points.

Before we get to your questions, I'd like to share a few final comments. 
Through our heads-down focused execution by an incredible global team, we've gotten through one of the toughest periods in the history of our industry. We emerged on the other side even better positioned to serve farmers and ensure the security of the global food supply and to deliver value for our shareholders. 
With our distinct competitive advantages, Corteva is positioned for long-term sustainable growth in a rapidly changing global agriculture marketplace. 
Now when I say sustainable, I refer to both Corteva's long-term growth and the way we will deliver it. As consumer preferences and environmental challenges change, farmers will need to adapt. And Corteva will be at the center of that relationship, deploying our knowledge, market presence and industry-leading capabilities to assure the sustainable future of global agriculture by helping growers deliver more while using fewer resources. 
Our knowledge of farmers' needs comes from the relationship that we have built over decades through our advantaged route to market, which helps drive our growth, our focused innovation. 
Now this is clearly showing up in our new product sales quarter after quarter and will continue to be one of our top priorities moving forward. And importantly, we have a number of exciting products that continue to progress through our pipeline in both segments. 
So finally, our first half performance and updated guidance for the year clearly demonstrates that all of the elements of our strategy that we built are working. Our team is advancing our purpose, driving a culture focused on our customers, delivering on our commitments through focused execution, building momentum on long-term value creation, and most importantly, growing progress for all of our stakeholders for years to come. 
So with that, I'll turn it back to Jeff."

Our initial views on 2022 are it's going to just be another great opportunity to continue to drive some really solid both top line and bottom line growth. We think against what will be a really constructive market backdrop, the market could grow next year somewhere between 3% and 3.5%. And so we're carrying some fantastic momentum. And when you look at first half results, you look at the setup and the revised guide for the second half of the year, and we just believe we'll be carrying some really good momentum. 
That growth also, just to highlight, if you think about it, is very broad-based, right? We're leveraging a diverse footprint globally from a geographic perspective. But we're also leveraging a very diverse portfolio. And that's coming from the new product pipeline, but it's also coming from just great execution out there. 
So as we continue to not only drive productivity that will be constructive to margin expansion and also taking a really solid look at pricing going into 2022, I think when I step back, it's going to be very solid. And I believe it will be an opportunity for us to deliver above that market growth. That will be an opportunity for us to continue to deliver that margin expansion that you've seen. 
And then that entire framework then, Joel, if you step back from it, it really doesn't line very nicely with those midterm target expectations that you and I have talked about before. So without going to a specific number, I believe we're well lined up here and that framework is right on track with those midterm expectations."

As we've talked about this a number of times before, there are a bunch of variables that go into how we think about seed cost as we go into the season, obviously, into our pricing model. First is yield. How we do in seed production around our yield factor, the quality of what comes out of our seed production fields and how much discard that we have as we spread that cost over a fewer units. Growers lock in at the market quote that they lock in at on all of those seed production fields, and they have a 12-month window to do that. So that factor adjusts and change as we kind of go through all of that. 
So we're sitting here today with some assumptions around average commodity prices and yield and quality. So if I put all of our current assumptions today into our model, we would estimate that our seed cost of goods in North America could increase in a range of somewhere between $15 million to $225 million. Now this can change. It's still early. We still got a seed crop that's maturing out there and it's based on our assumptions today. 
So we have -- we feel like we now have a pretty good estimate of what to expect the flow-through in cost of goods will be. So with that said, then as you've asked, pricing is obviously our biggest lever to really help manage and cover that increase in costs. And so I won't comment specifically on what our price cards are going to be. We're still finalizing those details. Our plans, as you suggested, are to release those cards later this summer, consistent with our normal timing approach there. But the way I think about it, rather than specifically talking about cards, I think about it overall in terms of earnings. And so at this point, I'd anticipate that by -- for 2022, that our seed pricing approach, net of all of those cost of goods increases that I just mentioned, would be incremental to EBITDA for that market. 
So at the end of the day, Vincent, what you have to do is look at our track record, right? The track record that we've delivered in 2020, the track record you're seeing now through this year. And we're building momentum. So just pricing this year through the first half of 3% global seed shows you that we've got the team focused on that and we're going to continue to drive that momentum."

It's hard to predict where we'll be going into 2022. I would -- I go into the attitude that every year is competitive, but you're competing more on value versus price. And as we think about the soybean market, clearly, we're going to focus on the value that we're delivering, our position relative to the competition and work closely with our customers for them to understand the value of our product as well as the value of the service that we're providing. 
We've been able to position the Enlist system very well with our customers. And they are driving tremendous value, not just from the Seed, but also the Crop Protection system that goes along with it.

Through the first half of 2021, royalty expense decreased somewhere between $40 million and $50 million compared to last year. 
And I'll just point to a couple of messages there. First, this was broad based. It's across our whole portfolio of corn and soybeans. And that's a really good step. It represents really good progress against that royalty reduction commitment that we've talked about before. 
As you start to think about how that begins then to roll off over the decade, we've talked before about the effect of the Enlist roll-off. And that will really get you about half of that reduction towards that royalty neutrality that we've shared many times before. So by the middle of the decade, and that's just directly tied to the ramp-up of the Enlist for expenses that we're still going to continue to have. We'll still have a few traits that we'll be licensing in. So we offset that. And it takes a little while, right? When you license a trade to a third-party, it takes them a while to do their own breeding and integrates the trait into their germ plasm. Then it takes them a little while to again ramping those units. And so those royalty income, they come in based on units sold, not units breed or units licensed. So it just takes a little while for that to spool up. And then that just becomes a continued long-term margin opportunity kind of through the remainder of the decade as we get through that ramp-up on the first phase of that as Enlist."

And those are really helping us offset many of those market-driven cost headwinds that we've been talking about. And our productivity strategy is to continue that momentum as we go into 2022, and we do have a fairly robust pipeline of initiatives. 
In Crop Protection, we're going to continue the focus on footprint rationalizations that we've had out there. We're down some 9 manufacturing assets globally. And these are large units that take some time to work through supply chain implications and reset those. So we have a few more of those still to go. Those will begin -- those will continue to show up in '22. We're working much more deeply now into the procurement space. As Dave has come in, he's brought some real great insights around our buy and working through understanding how we source intermediates, how we source our direct and our indirect spends. 
We've got some work we can do next year on SKU rationalization as we can continue to focus now our portfolio and our pipeline on these new products. We've probably got some older SKUs out there that will just help us from an overall cost. And then we're beginning to deploy some advanced analytics around understanding our freight and logistics costs. And especially in the year that we've kind of come through this year, those costs are meaningful. And our ability to use some of these advanced tools to improve our efficiency around that are going to be a really important source of productivity. 
On the seed side, we've been really focused on field productivity. How do we get more seed out of a given acre? And there are some things that we can continue to do to help educate our seed producers to be more productive and effective and spread our fixed costs out over more units. And on top of that, we still have some seed conditioning facilities around the world that, as we look at where our growth is occurring and where we need those assets, probably have some additional reductions. I think we're down 34% in seed assets to date since we've merged. That's a big number, but there are still a few more. 
And then finally, I've always been a person focused on inventory and write-downs, around making sure that we produce the seed that we need for a season, but don't produce too much when you wind up writing off some of that. So I really like the list that we have. And I think you'll continue to see really good flow-through into '22.

Why is it so low relative to your EBITDA of $2.55 billion? So it's like 50% or 60% of EBITDA. 
On your cash flow statement, it looks like there's about $800 million that went out for pension and OPEB benefits, but your pension line just went down by about $400 million. So can you explain the cash flow constellation? What normally should be your ratio of operating cash flow to EBITDA?"

And it gets a bit confusing, because you may recall, we did a fairly significant change in our OPEB provision at the end of 2020, basically moving much closer, if you will, to market in terms of OPEB. And as a result",434,"Yes. No. It's a really good question. And it gets a bit confusing, because you may recall, we did a fairly significant change in our OPEB provision at the end of 2020, basically moving much closer, if you will, to market in terms of OPEB. And as a result of that, there's a flow-through of an accounting entry that we made at the end of 2020 that really affects the cash from operations presentation in the financials. So that's #1. And we can explain more of that offline if you'd like to go through it now in more detail. 
I think the important thing you talked about which is really a key one it's just the range estimate that we're giving in the level of that range estimate in terms of cash from operations for 2021. It's reflective of a couple of things. #1, 2020 was really, in many respects, anomalous in terms of both cash collections and prepaying that we got from customers. And as a result of that, it's probably on a year-over-year basis somewhere in the neighborhood of about $600 million, if you will pull forward of cash or an increase in cash that benefited 2020. Now we're getting the benefit of that in 2021 because that's really helping us. One of the things we talked about is returning cash to shareholders. And if you look at our net debt, if you will, on a year-over-year basis, cash on hand minus debt balance, the numbers are actually quite attractive in terms of what we have there. And that's where the reflective of that very positive cash that we got at the end of the year. 
But the big difference, when you look at our guide this year versus last year, you look at the guide in terms of what you think of, is really that year-over-year change in working capital, mostly related to the timing of prepay as well as collections. 
And then the other part is we're building working capital right now. We're building working capital as part of the investment for growth. We're doing that in advance of what we see as a strong continued seasonal growth, Lat Am, Europe, elsewhere. And the other thing that I would just add there, and I stated this, I think, in the prepared remarks, is the improvement we're seeing in operating working capital turns. So we've got the improvement of DSO, improvement in days sales inventory. And we're really tracking that very closely. So we're on top of this. Feel good about this, to understand the year-over-year difference that you're looking at."

With the new herbicides, like Jim mentioned, Arylex and Vince come, 2 examples, their margin would be as high as what a differentiated insecticide would be. But just the fact that there is a lot more besides which would be more commodity base, it might feel like the margins are lower in herbicides. So typically, across the industry, you would say that insecticides and fungicides have higher margins than herbicides, but that changes when you launch new products."

We updated that today, that it's going to look like more like $400 million in 2021. We'll keep carrying that momentum forward. 
And then I think you characterized it right. Market will be a supporter of growth going forward. We'd expect the overall market to be up 3% to 3.5%. And you mentioned acres, and we're watching that very, very closely. We would expect to see, especially Brazil, planted area could be up in that 4% to 5% range. The demand for Brazil beans and also corn is really strong. And growers have a lot of good resources today, a lot of good cash. They're investing in their operations, especially in that safrinha market where we're really strong from a technology perspective. So acres in Brazil will be one of those drivers. 
And then I think in the United States, we could see another modest increase in total, both U.S. corn and soybean acreage possible, going into '22. Now I'm not talking about 5 million or anything like that. It could be 1 million here or 1 million there. But I think the U.S. market for '22 is set up to also be pretty strong acre wise."

Starting on Slide 4.  We launched Corteva with a strategy grounded in building and delivering value to shareholders through new product innovation that drives organic growth and margin improvement, organizational efficiency and rigor and disciplined capital allocation. As I speak to you today, I'm happy to say this strategy is working. Now that's a testament to the extraordinary efforts by our more than 20,000 colleagues worldwide over the last 5 years, beginning with the announcement of the intent to create Corteva. 
At its core, this team is focused on one thing, delivery. Time after time, they have demonstrated tremendous resilience and adaptability by pushing forward to bring our purpose to life, advance our strategy, and deliver our near-term business results no matter the circumstances. So to them, I say thank you, as I could not be prouder of their relentless focus.  
Our first half performance is yet another solid proof point of our progress, with 6% organic growth and 17% operating EBITDA improvement compared to the prior year. In Crop Protection, we continue to build on our new product momentum and now expect we will deliver $400 million in sales growth for this part of the portfolio for the year, up from our prior estimate of $300 million. A direct result of successfully advancing our pipeline. In fact, through June of this year, we've received nearly 90 additional new product registrations for our Crop protection portfolio. 
Market fundamentals remain positive as growers look to best-in-class solutions to drive productivity and capitalize on what likely will be a record year for income levels in key markets such as the U.S. and Brazil. This helped to drive pricing in Seed, specifically 3% increases in corn globally as well as further penetration of the Enlist soybean system for 2021, now estimated to be on approximately 35% of U.S. soybean acres, and that's up from prior estimates of 30%. Execution is sound, and we are carrying substantial momentum. 
As a result, we are raising our guidance for full year. We now expect to deliver between $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion in operating EBITDA for the full year 2021, representing a 22% growth over the prior year at the midpoint. 
Importantly, we also expect to maintain the operating leverage we delivered through the first half, with an impressive 200 basis point increase in margins for the full year on the organization's continued agility in the face of ongoing supply chain volatility and cost inflation, which brings us back to value creation. 
In addition to strong earnings growth, we are also advancing our commitments on returning cash to shareholders. Specifically, Corteva returned approximately $750 million in cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases through the first half. And we recently announced a dividend increase of 7.7% and a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program. In total, we expect to return more than $1.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases by the end of 2021.  
The bottom line, we are executing on what we said we would do. We are delivering operating leverage. And we are intently focused on advancing our strategy to deliver value for all of our shareholders.  
So looking at Slide 5, which has our financial results for the quarter and the first half. So quickly touching on the quarter. We delivered 6% organic growth on gains in both segments, led by North America and Latin America. This translated into earnings growth of 18% and margin improvement of more than 200 basis points, another solid quarter of continued growth and margin improvement.  
Now focusing on the half. Sales gains were led by execution of our new product pipeline, where new Crop Protection products delivered $260 million in sales growth over the prior year. Additionally, seed sales improved on increased planted area in U.S. soybeans and strong demand for corn in Latin America. We continued to deliver on our price-for-value strategy as global corn prices improved 3% for the half.  
Now Dave is going to provide you much more detail on the earnings growth drivers for the half, but it's important to note the impressive level of margin improvement that we have delivered so far this year.  
Through the half, we drove nearly 200 basis points of margin improvement compared to the prior year on price and volume gains across the portfolio, despite continued challenges on cost inflation that we and many others across various industries continue to face. Again, this first half performance is yet another important proof point that our value creation strategy is working, further reinforcing our updated guidance for the full year.  
So shifting to the market backdrop on Slide 6. Fundamentals remain strong despite volatility in the commodity markets. We believe global demand will ultimately drive growth into 2022 and beyond as local economies recover from the pandemic-related shutdowns. We're monitoring the impacts of the pandemic globally. And we'll remain agile to ensure we continue to support our employees, our customers and our local communities.  
Now while the U.S. market remains attractive as we look to the near-term outlook, we see strong demand for best-in-class technologies in markets outside of the U.S. Take Brazil, for example, where demand for grain is leading to increased planted area and rising commodity prices. With our market-leading position for corn and one of the best new crop protection lineups, we are in a strong position to capitalize on above-market growth.  
While commodity prices will continue to react to short-term events in the industry, it's important to remember that the global diversity of our business is what provides an attractive outlook for growth. Together with sustained growth in global ag markets, led by robust global demand, we are pleased with the acceleration and opportunities to deliver value to our customers in these local markets through our best-in-class products and advantaged routes to market.  
Turning to Slide 7. I'll provide more detail on the balance and the diversity of our sales growth across the globe and provide further proof points for the half.  
In North America, organic sales were up 4% for the half. Seed sales benefited from increased planted area for both corn and soybeans, coupled with continued penetration of the Enlist E3 soybeans. As I mentioned, we now expect Enlist to represent about 35% of the U.S. soybean market in 2021, and that's up from our previous expectation of 30%.  
On seed pricing for the first half, competitive pressures in the soybean market was aligned with our prior expectations, with pricing down 2%.  Corn price in the Pioneer brand was up about 1 point compared to the prior year.  
North America Crop Protection had a strong first half with 10% organic growth, on continued demand for new technologies, including Enlist herbicide and solid pricing execution in response to rising raw material, freight and logistics costs. 
Fungicide growth was also a highlight, up double-digits, as growers look to take preventative measures to maximize yields.  
In Europe, Middle East and Africa, organic sales grew 5% on strong pricing execution and record sunflower seed volumes. This growth was muted by an approximate $80 million to $100 million sales impact from corn supply shortages. 
In Crop Protection, our portfolio of new and differentiated products remain in high demand, including technologies such as Arylex herbicide and Zorvec fungicide, which enabled us to drive price and volume gains and gain market share in Europe despite the impact of product phaseouts.  
In Latin America, we delivered 23% organic sales growth on strong volumes and execution on our price-for-value strategy. In seed, volumes grew 20% on share gains in the Brazil safrinha and earlier shipments for the Brazil summer season. 
In Crop Protection, volumes grew 9% on significant demand for new and differentiated technologies such as Isoclast and Jemvelva insecticides. Pricing actions reflected strong product demand and helped to more than offset unfavorable currency impacts from Brazilian real.  
In Asia Pacific, we realized 3% organic sales growth compared to the prior year on both volume and price improvements. Seed volumes were down, largely due to COVID-related demand impacts, primarily in Southeast Asia and India. Crop Protection organic growth of 11% was led by further penetration of our new products, including Rinskor herbicide and Pyraxalt insecticide.

Let's move to Slide 8 for a detailed review of our operating EBITDA performance for the year -- or for the first half.

Let's move to Slide 8 for a detailed review of our operating EBITDA performance for the year -- or for the first half.  
You'll see that for the first half 2021, operating EBITDA grew $335 million versus the prior year, nearly $2.4 billion, a clear indication of how well we've executed in the first half and a reflection of our ability to capitalize on robust demand for our products. 
Driving the increased operating EBITDA were strong price and volume, with combined benefits of approximately $340 million. This came from focused commercial execution and penetration of new and differentiated products across all regions. To illustrate this, sales of new Crop Protection products grew over $260 million versus the prior year. And at the same time, we delivered nearly 30% of organic seed growth in Latin America, driven by strong corn sales in Brazil. And finally, we continue to extract value for our yield-advantaged technology. And as Jim said, global corn pricing up 3% during the half.  
Costs were about a $60 million net headwind to operating EBITDA for the half. This includes delivery of approximately $175 million from productivity initiatives, including the ongoing benefit from asset footprint rationalization and other cost improvements. This helped to partially offset $240 million of cost headwinds in the half, which are primarily market-driven. And we continue to operate in an environment marked with challenged supply chains and cost inflation. 
In the first half, we experienced higher freight and logistics cost as global trade markets saw shipping demand outpace supply. Additionally, prices of certain active ingredients and intermediates continue to rise compared to the same period last year, including glyphosate.  
Now we continue to take action to mitigate these impacts where possible, including passing through certain inflationary costs for our seed and Crop Protection products and delivering against our productivity initiatives. As evidence of our disciplined focused execution, we delivered more than 190 basis points of margin expansion in the half. It's notable in terms of the agile operations team delivering strong performance.  
Let's go now to Slide 9 to cover a few highlights from the Crop Protection segment for the half, where organic sales grew 10%, which included a 4% headwind from the strategic decision to phase out certain low-margin products, primarily in insecticides. Again, strong demand for our new technology led to sales gains, including an increase of more than $260 million in new product sales when compared to the same period last year.  
Herbicides were up 13% compared to the first half of 2020, led by continued penetration of Arylex and Enlist. Fungicides grew 26%, driven by strong demand for Zorvec and Inatreq, primarily in Europe, Middle East and Africa. And lastly, insecticides grew 3% in the half, which included a 16% negative impact from discontinued products. Growth was largely driven by our differentiated Spinosyns technology, including Jemvelva and Qalcova actives, which were up 14% in the half. Favorable product mix and strategic price increases drove pricing gains in all regions for the half, led by a 9% improvement in Latin America and a 3% price improvement in North America.  
Operating EBITDA for Crop Protection grew 26% from the prior year, driven by strong demand for new products and pricing execution. We did experience cost headwinds of approximately $130 million for this segment during the period. Overall, the headwinds more than offset our productivity actions. In most cases, we see these higher costs representing a new baseline, which will continue to work to mitigate by taking pricing actions where possible and delivering ongoing productivity.  
Now despite these challenges, we drove over 220 basis points of operating EBITDA margin improvement in Crop Protection in the half. Very impressive performance.  
Let's go to then Slide 10 and talk about the Seed highlights. You can see on Slide 10, organic sales for Seed were up 4%, driven by solid pricing, coupled with market share gains in Brazil safrinha, demand-driven earlier shipments for Brazil summer season and also volume growth in North America on increased planted area aligned with USDA estimates. 
On pricing, we maintained our track record in extracting value for our yield-advantaged technology, with corn prices up 3% compared to prior year, led by double-digit price improvement in Latin America. 
Soybean volumes were up 7% for the half, led by an approximately 5% increase in U.S. planted area. Soybean pricing was down 2%, consistent with our expectations, as we continue to see competitive pressure in the U.S. market. Other oilseeds were up 21% versus the first half of 2020, reflecting record sunflower volumes in Europe and also higher canola volumes in Canada. 
Operating EBITDA for this segment improved 13% on strong price execution globally, ongoing cost and productivity actions, lower royalties and bad debt and a favorable impact from currency. And while we experienced higher input costs, the teams continue to manage through these headwinds, and we're able to deliver operating EBITDA margin improvement of over 200 basis points for the segment for the half.  
So now let's go to Slide 11 and talk about our full year 2021 guidance. You can see there that for the remainder of the year and our updated expectations for the full year, and with the backdrop of the strong performance for the first half, we're raising our reported net sales guidance to be in the range of $15.2 billion to $15.4 billion, representing 8% growth at the midpoint, which includes an approximately 2% tailwind from currency. We're also raising our operating EBITDA guide, and now expect to be in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion, representing 22% growth at the midpoint. This increase reflects continued strong demand for our new products globally in both Crop Protection and Seed, coupled with strong price execution in key regions on technology and also improved currency.  
Specific to the second half, we expect price to largely offset cost headwinds, which are notably Seed-driven. And as a result, volume, primarily in Latin America Crop Protection, is driving second half earnings growth. 
Now the volatility of exchange rates will continue to be a key variable we're watching, notably the Brazilian real, where we assumed a rate of 5.25 for the back half of the year. 
In Crop Protection, we anticipate $400 million of year-over-year improvement in sales from our new products, $100 million more than we originally estimated. The additional growth is a testament to strong demand that we're seeing globally for our best-in-class technology. 
As we think about costs, the current inflationary environment is expected to continue through at least the end of the year. As a result, we now expect a net cost headwind of approximately $125 million for the full year 2021. This represents about $75 million in additional cost inflation from our previous estimate. It's driven by higher input costs as well as freight and logistics. Now we're actively monitoring supply chain pressures in the market, and the operational teams remain agile in meeting customer demand.  
As it relates to SG&A, the organization continues to maintain disciplined spending. And we anticipate that as a percent of revenue, SG&A is expected to improve by approximately 50 basis points for the year despite higher commissions and also variable compensation. Taken together, it's an impressive improvement and impressive outlook and really highlights the strong focus by the full organization to execute on our strategy.  
Let's go now to Slide 12 with a few comments on cash flow. I'll give you a view on our 2021 cash flow expectations. We now believe cash from operations will be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion for the year. It reflects both increased earnings, but also the investment we're making in working capital to support growth. The organization continues to focus on cash cycle time. It's working. As a result, we're targeting improvement in net working capital turns for the full year. 
We're increasing our CapEx spending target from $550 million to between $600 million and $650 million for 2021. The increase allows us to fund projects with high return on investment to support growth. And it follows a complete midyear review that we completed of all of our capital programs. 
We've experienced an improvement in the funded status of the U.S. pension plan year-to-date, driven by both asset returns and discount rate. The improvement provides increased probability, there will be no required contributions to the plan in '21 or 2022.  
Finally, as Jim stated, we're committed to the return of cash to shareholders as evidenced by more than $1.2 billion we expect to return via dividends and share repurchases by the end of the year, which includes expected progress on the new $1.5 billion program that we recently announced.  
Now if you move to Slide 13, I just want to give you some early insights on our planning process and thinking as we start to frame out 2022. Importantly, carrying forward our momentum from 2021, we expect to see organic growth globally. This will largely be driven by execution and further penetration of new and differentiated products across all regions, reflecting the strength of our portfolio and our pipeline, which are expected to drive increases in both volume and price in 2022. 
For example, we continue to remain excited about the growth opportunities for Spinosyns, which we believe will approach sales of $1 billion in 2022. We expect Seed pricing to be additive to earnings when netted with the impact of higher cost of goods sold as a result of higher commodity costs. 
And with our transition to Enlist, we expect royalty improvement for 2022 as part of our journey towards royalty neutrality by the end of the decade. Royalty reduction is anticipated to be more significant in '23 and '24, but next year will be an important next step on continuing net royalty improvement.  
And lastly, we remain focused on delivering against productivity as input costs continue to evolve with the current market environment. So to manage this pressure, we're going to continue to drive execution on productivity initiatives, which are expected to partially offset any increase costs. And this is just our preliminary take on the setup for next year. We're going to share more details later this year. But certainly, we view 2022 as a solid opportunity for earnings and margin growth as we execute our strategy and we leverage our global footprint and our diversified portfolio.  
So before turning it back to Jim, let me just do a quick summary, focus on both our 2021 delivery and the set-up for 2022. This year is characterized by first half operating EBITDA margin improvement of nearly 200 basis points and full year margin expectations also improved by approximately 200 basis points. And that setup for 2022 is positive. We're driving growth in all regions, across a strengthening portfolio and delivering solid operating leverage.  
And with that, let me turn it back to Jim."

Before we get to your questions, I'd like to share a few final comments.  
Through our heads down focused execution by an incredible global team, we've gotten through one of the toughest periods in the history of our industry. We emerged on the other side even better positioned to serve farmers and ensure the security of the global food supply and to deliver value for our shareholders. 
With our distinct competitive advantages, Corteva is positioned for long-term sustainable growth in a rapidly changing global agriculture marketplace. Now when I say sustainable, I refer to both Corteva's long-term growth and the way we will deliver it. As consumer preferences and environmental challenges change, farmers will need to adapt. And Corteva will be at the center of that relationship, deploying our knowledge, market presence and industry-leading capabilities to assure the sustainable future of global agriculture by helping growers deliver more while using fewer resources. 
Our knowledge of farmers' needs comes from the relationship that we have built over decades through our advantaged route to market, which helps drive our grower focused innovation. 
Now this is clearly showing up in our new product sales quarter after quarter and will continue to be one of our top priorities moving forward. And importantly, we have a number of exciting products that continue to progress through our pipeline in both segments.  
So finally, our first half performance and updated guidance for the year clearly demonstrates that all of the elements of our strategy that we built are working. Our team is advancing our purpose, driving a culture focused on our customers, delivering on our commitments through focused execution, building momentum on long-term value creation, and most importantly, growing progress for all of our stakeholders for years to come.  
So with that, I'll turn it back to Jeff."

Our initial views on 2022 are -- it is going to just be another great opportunity to continue to drive some really solid both top and bottom line growth. We think against what will be a really constructive market backdrop. The market could grow next year somewhere between 3% and 3.5%. And so we're carrying some fantastic momentum. And when you look at first half results, you look at the setup and the revised guide for the second half of the year, and we just believe we'll be carrying some really good momentum. 
That growth also, just to highlight, if you think about it, is very broad-based, right? We're leveraging a diverse footprint globally from a geographic perspective. But we're also leveraging a very diverse portfolio. And that's coming from the new product pipeline, but it's also coming from just great execution out there. 
So as we continue to not only drive productivity and that will be constructive to margin expansion and also taking a really solid look at pricing going into 2022, I think when I step back, it's going to be very solid. And I believe it will be an opportunity for us to deliver above that market growth. That will be an opportunity for us to continue to deliver that margin expansion that you've seen. 
And then that entire framework then, Joel, if you step back from it, it really doesn't line very nicely with those midterm target expectations that you and I have talked about before. So without going to a specific number, I believe we're well lined up here and that framework is right on track with those midterm expectations."

As we've talked about this a number of times before, there are a bunch of variables that go into how we think about seed cost as we go into the season, obviously, into our pricing model. First is yield. How we",436,"Yes. Great. Vincent, thanks for the question. As we've talked about this a number of times before, there are a bunch of variables that go into how we think about seed cost as we go into the season, obviously, into our pricing model. First is yield. How we do in seed production around our yield factor, the quality of what comes out of our seed production fields and how much discard that we have as we spread that cost over a fewer units. 
Clearly commodity prices and the prices that our growers lock in at, the market quote that they lock in at on all of those seed production fields, and they have a 12-month window to do that. So that factor adjusts and change as we kind of go through all of that. 
So we're sitting here today with some assumptions around average commodity prices and yield and quality. So if I put all of our current assumptions today into our model, we would estimate that our seed cost of goods in North America could increase in a range of somewhere between $175 million to $225 million. And now this can change. It's still early. We still got a seed crop that's maturing out there and it's based on our assumptions today. 
So we have -- we feel like we now have a pretty good estimate of what to expect the flow-through in cost of goods will be. So with that said, then as you've asked, pricing is obviously our biggest lever to really help manage and cover that increase in costs. And so I won't comment specifically on what our price cards are going to be. We're still finalizing those details. Our plans, as you suggested, are to release those cards later this summer, consistent with our normal timing approach there. 
But the way I think about it, rather than specifically talking about cards, I think about it overall in terms of earnings. And so at this point, I'd anticipate that by -- for 2022, that our seed pricing approach, net of all of those cost of goods increases that I just mentioned, would be incremental to EBITDA for that market. 
So at the end of the day, Vincent, what you have to do is look at our track record, right? The track record that we've delivered in 2020, the track record you're seeing now through this year. And we're building momentum. So just pricing this year through the first half of 3% global seed shows you that we've got the team focused on that and we're going to continue to drive that momentum."

It's hard to predict where we'll be going into 2022. I would -- I go into the attitude that every year is competitive, but you're competing more on value versus price. And as we think about the soybean market, clearly, we're going to focus on the value that we're delivering, our position relative to the competition and work closely with our customers for them to understand the value of our product as well as the value of the service that we're providing.

And specifically, I think one of the things you asked was in terms of the increment of $75 million, where are we seeing that?

And then you get into the seed yield and commodity cost mix, glyphosate and actually a little bit of a break in the updated numbers in terms of precious metals, just because of the actions we've taken operationally with precious metals and the use of palladium.

So when we look at our portfolio, the more we shift towards new and differentiated products, we've got around $400 million of growth this year, as Jim mentioned. We continue to see the momentum. That gives us commercial organization an opportunity to make sure that those products can get the value back. And that is consistent with our philosophy across both Seeds and Crop Protection. So have confidence on the productivity that was referred to by Dave. But I would say that our pricing philosophy continues to be strong. And we are delivering strong results in the first half, and we see that continuing next year, too."

You're really -- we're starting to see now that flow-through of royalty expense reduction. Through the first half of 2021, royalty expense decreased somewhere between $40 million and $50 million compared to last year. 
And I'll just point to a couple of messages there. First, this was broad based. It's across our whole portfolio of corn and soybeans. And that's a really good step. It represents really good progress against that royalty reduction commitment that we've talked about before. 
As you start to think about how that begins then to roll off over the decade, we've talked before about the effect of the Enlist roll-off. And that will really get you about half of that reduction towards that royalty neutrality that we've shared many times before. So by the middle of the decade, and that's just directly tied to the ramp-up of the Enlist system as we backed down on Roundup Ready to extend and really start to drive not only the ramp-up units of Enlist but also the ramp of the proprietary nature of those units as well. 
The second half of the decade that we talked about before where you really get that second tranche is really more related to royalty income that is offsetting a residual number of expenses that we're still continue to have. We'll still have a few traits that we'll be licensing in. 
So we offset that. And it takes a little while, right? When you license a trait to a third-party, takes them a while to do their own breeding and integrates the trade into their germplasm. Then it takes them a little while to begin ramping those units. And so those royalty incomes, they come in based on units sold, not units bred or units licensed. So it just takes a little while for that to spool up. And then that just becomes a continued long-term margin opportunity kind of through the remainder of the decade as we get through that ramp-up on the first phase of that as Enlist."

If you look at this year first, we're on track to deliver the $250 million in productivity savings. And those are really helping us offset many of those market-driven cost headwinds that we've been talking about. And our productivity strategy is to continue that momentum as we go into 2022, and we do have a fairly robust pipeline of initiatives. 
In Crop Protection, we're going to continue the focus on footprint rationalizations that we've had out there. We're down some 9 manufacturing assets globally. And these are large units that take some time to work through supply chain implications and reset those. So we have a few more of those still to go. Those will begin -- those will continue to show up in '22. We're working much more deeply now into the procurement space. As Dave has come in, he's brought some real great insights around our buy and working through understanding how we source intermediates, how we source our direct and our indirect spends. 
We've got some work we can do next year on SKU rationalization as we can continue to focus now our portfolio and our pipeline on these new products. And we've probably got some older SKUs out there that will just help us from an overall cost. 
And then we're beginning to deploy some advanced analytics around understanding our freight and logistics costs. And especially in the year that we've kind of come through this year, those costs are meaningful. And our ability to use some of these advanced tools to improve our efficiency around that are going to be a really important source of productivity. 
On the seed side, we've been really focused on field productivity. How do we get more seed out of a given acre? And there are some things that we can continue to do to help educate our seed producers to be more productive and effective and spread our fixed costs out over more units. 
And on top of that, we still have some seed conditioning facilities around the world that, as we look at where our growth is occurring and where we need those assets, probably have some additional reductions. I think we're down 34% in seed assets to date since we've merged. That's a big number, but there are still a few more. 
And then finally, I've always been a person focused on inventory and write-downs, around making sure that we produce the seed that we need for a season, but don't produce too much when you wind up writing off some of that. So I really like the list that we have. And I think you'll continue to see really good flow-through into '22. 
What else would you add, Dave?"

And it gets a bit confusing, because you may recall, we did a fairly significant change in our OPEB provision at the end of 2020, basically moving much closer, if you will, to market in terms of OPEB. And as a result of that, there's a flow-through of an accounting entry that we made at the end of 2020 that really affects the cash from operations presentation in the financials. So that's #1. And we can explain more of that offline, if you'd like to go through it now in more detail. 
I think the important thing you talked about which is really a key one is just the range estimate that we're giving in the level of that range estimate in terms of cash from operations for 2021. It's reflective of a couple of things. #1, 2020 was really, in many respects, anomalous in terms of both cash collections and prepaying that we got from customers. 
And as a result of that, it's probably on a year-over-year basis somewhere in the neighborhood of about $600 million, if you will pull forward of cash or an increase in cash that benefited 2020. Now we're getting the benefit of that in 2021 because that's really helping us. One of the things we talked about is returning cash to shareholders. And if you look at our net debt, if you will, on a year-over-year basis, cash on hand minus debt balance, the numbers are actually quite attractive in terms of what we have there. And that's where the reflective of that very positive cash that we got at the end of the year. 
But the big difference, when you look at our guide this year versus last year, if you look at the guide in terms of what you think of, is really that year-over-year change in working capital, mostly to a bit related to the timing and prepay as well as collections. 
And then the other part is we're building working capital right now. We're building working capital as part of the investment for growth. We're doing that in advance of what we see as a strong continued seasonal growth, Lat Am, Europe, elsewhere. 
And the other thing that I would just add there, and I stated this, I think, in the prepared remarks, is the improvement we're seeing in operating working capital churn. So we've got the improvement of DSO, improvement in days sales inventory. And we're really tracking that very closely. So we're on top of this. Feel good about this, to understand the year-over-year difference that you're looking at."

We updated that today, that it's going to look like more like $400 million in 2021. We'll keep carrying that momentum forward. 
And then I think you characterized it right. Market will be a supporter of growth going forward. We'd expect the overall market to be up 3% to 3.5%. And you mentioned acres, and we're watching that very, very closely. We would expect to see, especially Brazil, planted area could be up in that 4% to 5% range. The demand for Brazil beans and also corn is really strong. And growers have a lot of good resources today, a lot of good cash. They're investing in their operations, especially in that safrinha market where we're really strong from a technology perspective. So acres in Brazil will be one of those drivers. 
And then I think in the United States, we could see another modest increase in total, both U.S. corn and soybean acreage possible, going into '22. Now I'm not talking about 5 million or anything like that. It could be 1 million here or 1 million there. But I think the U.S. market for '22 is set up to also be pretty strong acre wise."

I'm honored to be speaking with you after having spent the last several days getting to know the team.Before I provide some early perspective, let me first say thank you",531,"Thanks, Jeff, and thank you to all those joining us on the call and webcast today. I'm honored to be speaking with you after having spent the last several days getting to know the team.
Before I provide some early perspective, let me first say thank you to Jim Collins, who is guiding me through the transition over the next several weeks. I have known Jim for a very long time, and it is a privilege to build on the strong foundation he laid for long-term growth at Corteva with culture and innovation at its core. Now I recognize it's only day 4, so Dave will walk you through the quarterly results and the full year outlook, but it's important for me to first share some thoughts on why I believe that this is an unparalleled opportunity to lead at Corteva.
Starting first with the strengths of the franchise which I believe is an industry leader in terms of balance and differentiation. In my experience in this industry, I always admired and respected how Corteva worked so closely with farmers to consistently provide best-in-class technology to drive value. And further, the breadth and depth of Corteva's portfolio is impressive, as it scale reaches all parts of the globe in a competitively advantaged way. This is why I believe, when combined with strong execution, Corteva can be the industry leader for years to come, which brings me to my second point, operational performance.
This quarter's results attest to what this team has built at Corteva: a commitment to operational excellence and efficiency has kept the company's supply chains open in the midst of ongoing disruptions; and a culture focused on delivering for customers and keeping each other safe has kept the organization on track meeting its commitments.
This is another quarter of revenue and earnings growth, which are a direct result of the strong foundation this team has built over the past 2.5 years. Over the past few days, I've spent a lot of time listening to and learning from my team. And I can already say this team is fully equipped to deliver on what we all know this company is capable of.
From the expertise of our commercial and operations teams to the deep capabilities of our R&D organization, it is abundantly clear to me that through the combination of the company's strong culture and organizational strengths, we are well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities that lie ahead.
So to summarize, tremendous assets, operational performance and an excellent team are only a few things I am really excited about and what attracted me to this opportunity. I understand your expectations, and I am confident we will deliver. We have the IP, the commitment to operational excellence and the customer relationships necessary to deliver long-term solutions to global issues, while serving the best interest of our shareholders.
We will always continue to deliver innovative and productive solutions for farmers, expand opportunities for our employees and build long-term value for our shareholders, all with sustainability as a priority.
And with that, let me now turn it over to Dave to take you through the results and the updates to our guidance."

In behalf of the Corteva team, I'm going to say we're all very excited to have Chuck join us at this time. It's a terrific position for the company, and we've got tremendous value that we can deliver. I want to welcome everybody also to the call.
Let's start on Slide 5, which shows our financial results for the quarter and also year-to-date. Starting on the left side of the chart, you can see it was another solid 3 months of continued growth and margin improvement. Compared to the prior year, we delivered 24% organic growth, gains in both seed and crop protection, led by Latin America and North America. In the quarter, we saw accelerated demand from customers, particularly in Latin America, which translated into an estimated $100 million in sales in the quarter that was previously forecasted in the fourth quarter.
Looking at earnings, we delivered seasonal loss of $51 million of operating EBITDA in the quarter, which is an improvement of greater than $120 million compared to the prior year.
Turning to the year-to-date results. Organic sales were up 9% to just over $12 billion. The growth was led by continued demand for new products, driving more than $330 million in growth from new crop protection products. Seed sales improved on increased planted area in U.S. soybeans and also strong demand for corn in Latin America. 
EBITDA of $2.31 billion year-to-date, up 25% compared to the same period last year. And year-to-date pricing coupled with volume gains more than offset cost headwinds, driving nearly 220 basis points of margin improvement compared to prior year. And this is particularly impressive given the challenges we're seeing in global supply chains and the cost inflation we continue to face. And we believe it's a clear differentiator for Corteva.
Let's go then to Slide 6 with more detail on our global sales growth. Here, you can see the balance and diversity of the global business in the results. In North America, organic sales were up 5% through the first 3 quarters. Seed sales benefited from increased planted area for both corn and soybeans as well as the continued penetration of Enlist E3 soybeans. Consistent with last quarter, Enlist E3 represents about 35% of the U.S. soybean market in 2021. Feedback from growers and performance to this point is quite positive.
Corn price was up 2% while soybean prices were down 3% as we continue to  see competitive pressure in that market. North America crop [Audio Gap] demand for new technologies, including Enlist, herbicide double digits. Price increased 3% through the third quarter on price execution in response to rising input costs, including raw materials, freight and logistics.
In Europe, Middle East and Africa, we had strong organic sales growth of 7%, resulting from price execution and record sunflower seed volumes. This growth was muted by an approximate $80 million to $100 million sales impact from corn supply shortages in '21. In Crop Protection, the portfolio of new and differentiated products remain in high demand, including technologies, such as Arylex herbicide and Zorvec fungicide, which enabled us to drive price, volume and gain market share in Europe despite the impact of discontinued products.
In Latin America, we realized 27% organic sales growth on strong volumes and price gains, driven by execution on our price for value strategy, coupled with increases to offset rising input costs.
In Seed, volumes grew 16%, driven by market share gains in Brazil safrinha and earlier shipments for the Brazil summer season. In Crop Protection, volumes grew 18% on significant demand for new and differentiated technologies, such as Isoclast and Gimvelva insecticides. In Asia Pacific, we delivered 7% organic sales growth compared to prior year with both volume and pricing gains. Seed volumes were down largely due to COVID-related demand impacts, particularly in Southeast Asia and India. Crop Protection organic growth of 11% was led by continued demand for new products, including Rinskor herbicide and also Pyraxalt insecticide. 
Let's move now to Slide 7 for a detailed review of our operating EBITDA performance through the third quarter. Through the first 9 months, operating EBITDA grew more than $460 million to approximately $2.3 billion. This was driven by strong organic growth with combined price and volume benefits of more than $600 million as we continue to benefit from new and differentiated products against a strong market backdrop. We recognized pricing gains in both segments in all regions during the period. Global corn price was up 4% year-to-date, demonstrating the value that we bring to customers.
Sales of new crop protection products grew more than $330 million versus the prior year and price increased 4% for the segment, which helped offset higher raw material and logistics costs. 
With respect to increased costs, we recognized roughly $350 million of market-driven cost headwinds year-to-date as well as $70 million of increased compensation costs and investment spend to support growth. This was partially offset by approximately $200 million in productivity initiatives, resulting in a net cost headwind of $220 million through the first 3 quarters. 
Very importantly, disciplined execution while managing through complex supply chain dynamics translated into more than 200 basis points improvement in operating EBITDA margin through the first 9 months of the year, again, a clear differentiator. 
Let's go now to Slide 8 where I'd like to discuss the current state of the global supply chain. Like other companies and, obviously, various industries, we continue to face supply chain challenges and cost inflation and to reiterate the theme we discussed at the end of the second quarter, we believe these challenges will continue through 2022. We've seen the cost of some of our key raw materials and co-formulates increased more than 20% in the past year, driving expected overall cost inflation to low to mid-single digits as a percent of our cost of sales. 
In addition to longer shipping times, we've also experienced additional downtime from supply constraints, in part due to the more than 60 force majeures declared directly from suppliers or indirectly from other raw material suppliers.
Now to help offset the impact of inflated input costs, we're utilizing operational levers, such as pricing and very focused productivity initiatives. As an example, on October 1, we announced on average mid-single-digit price increases in the U.S. on the majority of our Crop Protection products. This includes externally sourced glyphosate, where we expect our pricing will be up approximately $90 million for the full year. Now just for context, glyphosate sales represent less than 5% of our total annual Crop Protection Sales, but the inflation impact has been significant. 
With this backdrop, it's impressive that we're achieving attractive performance measured by on-time delivery to customer requests. The agility and flexibility that our teams are demonstrating has enabled us to capitalize on evolving market conditions, including increased demand for both Seed and Crop Protection products. 
With that, let's go to Slide 9. I'd like to provide the update on our full year 2021 outlook. We're raising our full year revenue guidance. We now expect reported net sales in the range of $15.5 billion to $15.7 billion, up 10% at the midpoint over 2020. We feel confident in this growth based on strong market fundamentals, continued demand for new and differentiated products globally in both Crop Protection and Seed segments and price execution in all regions, coupled with pricing for higher input costs. 
Mostly as a result of market-driven factors mentioned earlier, we're raising our estimate for full year costs by $100 million for the year, predominantly in Crop Protection. We're now expecting a total increase of $475 million versus prior year. In addition to these headwinds, we also expect increased SG&A and R&D costs of about $50 million, which includes spend for increased compensation as well as investment spend to support growth. 
Importantly, we're reaffirming and affirming the full year expectation to deliver operating EBITDA in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion for the year, an improvement of 22% over 2020 at the midpoint. This translates to approximately 150 basis points of margin expansion for the full year. 
And lastly, we're now forecasting a base tax rate in the range of 18% to 20%, coupled with a lower average share price count due to our share repurchase activity. We have increased our operating EPS guidance to a range of $2.05 to $2.15 per share for the year. 
Let's now let's go to Slide 10 and focus on 2022. As you can see on Slide 10, we've given you our initial planning framework. And you recall that we shared this with you last quarter. It's intended as a reminder of the key assumptions as we frame out the '22 plan, including organic revenue growth, seed pricing versus commodity costs, strong penetration of new products, royalty cost improvement and continued cost inflation, partially offset by productivity initiatives. Importantly, this is all with a backdrop of continued strong market outlook and solid grower economics, which will drive customer demand in 2022. 
Turning to Slide 11, aligning with our midterm EBITDA target range for 2022. On the left of Slide 11, we've shown you at a high level, the bridge from our 2021 operating EBITDA guide to the EBITDA range implied by our midterm targets. 
Now let's go to the right side and cover a few of these key points. Market fundamentals remain positive, and our early views are that U.S. corn and soy acres will be approximately 180 million in total with a slight shift to soy based on relative economics at this time. Outside of the U.S., market growth looks strong in markets like Brazil where planted area is expected to increase 4% to 5%. 
In terms of organic growth, we expect that the global seed portfolio will continue to deliver on our price for value strategy where we expect 2022 pricing to be in excess of estimated seed cost headwinds from higher commodity prices. 
Crop Protection new and differentiated products, including Arylex and Enlist herbicides and Isoclast insecticide will be a primary driver in delivering above market in that segment. 
Turning to our early assumptions on costs. We've increased our estimate of seed commodity price impacts and expect to see Seed cost increases in the range of $250 million to $300 million, largely driven by North America and Latin America. As I mentioned earlier, we expect Seed pricing to outpace these costs in 2022. 
In Crop Protection, market-driven inflation will continue through 2022. And we expect cost headwinds of at least $150 million. This includes the impact of the sell-through of inventory and continued cost inflation as a result of the supply chain conditions we've already discussed. It's too early to comment on when we think costs will level off. However, we will be using operational levers, such as pricing and productivity initiatives, to mitigate cost headwinds. This provides additional transparency into our preliminary planning for '22 and how that bridges to our midterm target EBITDA range. Put simply, price and volume will be critical to earnings and margin growth against the backdrop of strong customer demand and also continued cost and supply chain challenges. 
We will be providing more specifics during our fourth quarter earnings call in early February and communicating the full '22 guidance at that time. 
And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Jeff."

And what I'd say to you, though, is in the last couple of days, I've spent time with the Board of Directors, a lot of time with my team. And I've seen some of the operations already in just a short period of time. And certainly, everything that I've seen, it's exceeding my expectations. So my early impressions are extremely positive. 
I've had a good look at some of the elements of our technology pipeline. Obviously, I'm able to see it from a unique vantage point now. So I had a peek under the hood. And I will say that there is a growth engine here, a very impressive growth engine. The manufacturing footprint, when I look at it, probably the last 2 quarters have been the hardest in our industry in many, many years, and our supply chain is holding up. There's quite a bit of resiliency and that's because of the diversity that I've certainly seen. 
There will be focus areas, of course, that I will start to talk to the team about. But it is only day 4 for me. So I just want to say that I'm excited to be here. And some of the areas that I'm going to work with the team on just to give you sort of a flavor, of course, our customers are -- we're going to put them first. This company has already done that, but we have a unique set of advantages and core competencies with our technology and our supply chain and everything we do, we're going to put our customers first. 
Second is sustainability, climate change, reduction of acreage, things that really drive yields and improve performance for farmers. These are some are things that I think Corteva is uniquely positioned to is to really drive the sustainability agenda for agricultural farming around the world. And then finally, we have some commitments out there. We're going to deliver on those commitments. So the execution of the strategic plan will become a very top priority. And if you've heard me talk before, I'm a very big believer in controlling what we can control and that we really want to be known as the best operator in the industry. Because I think that that really complements our technology platform. 
So hopefully, that gives you a bit of color of some of the initial impressions and some of the things that the Corteva team was already talking about but will be of interest to me as well as I integrate myself with this wonderful team."

There is a lot of potential in this company. There are a lot of catalysts and levers that are within the management team's control and that they are highly focused on, which will drive long-term value creation for shareholders. 
The other thing is, look, we believe that the agricultural backdrop is still going to be quite positive as we enter 2022. We've got good planted acreage we expect in corn and soybeans next year. We're going to see increased acreage in Brazil. I think that when we look at farmer economics, they're still very constructive. Your potash question, I'm going to keep to the side. 
But overall, we think that the backdrop for the ag markets are quite positive. And then if you look at what Corteva can do within it and control in terms of price, new products extension of its channel strategy, these are all things that the management team is highly focused on. And when you add it all up, that's why we felt it was important to at least put the outlook numbers out there.

So I think that's -- the strength of our Crop Protection franchise, coupled with where we are headed with biologics, is the reason for our optimism. 
Our strategy, I would say, I will explain 3 prongs to it. The first part is in-licensing very unique technology, and our team has worked to get more than 10 of these signed up in the last 12 months where a lot of our optimism is coming from. And these are global companies, companies from Israel, France, Brazil, Spain, to name a few. So very strong in-licensing. 
The second thing we are working on is we've got a very strong commercial organization which I know you're familiar with. We are working to build capabilities within our commercial organization, supply chain, formulation and packaging and, last but not the least, R&D to continue to supplement the in-licensing technologies that we get. 
And with Chuck on board now, we will continue to explore opportunities to have bolt-on acquisitions with the support from the Board to see how we can further accelerate. So really, a very exciting space for us. We do have a very strong franchise in the natural products, like you're familiar with the Spinosyns franchise is already more than $800 million. So we are familiar with this space and really looking forward to seeing how further launches will help us continue to accelerate the growth."

You increased your free cash flow guidance by $300 million on the low end to $550 million. Can you talk through the drivers of that, presumably working capital played a role? And I'd be interested to know how much you view as structural versus transitory? 
And then secondly, on the fundamental side, one of your competitors has been quite vocal about short-stature corn. I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on that subject and whether that might play a role for Corteva in the future?"

So on the cash flow, you recall, you may have referenced the previous cash from operations slide that we had or guide rather that we had of 1.2 to 1.6. We're now at 1.7 to 1.9. So it reflects a couple of things. I think, number one, as you know, we have focused a lot on basic operational disciplines around cash and particularly on working capital. So there's a portion of this back to your structural that's really related to that in both receivables and also in our payables area. 
Those are 2 areas we've really been working on and deploying talent and the right disciplines and systems to support that. So those are important contributors. We've also increased the amount of prepaid assumption just in terms of the liquidity that our customers have and just what we're seeing already in terms of cash coming in related to that. So you could say that as more more, call it, temporary as opposed to structural. 
We've also got some improvement in terms of net income with the lower tax rate that we've guided to, and that's part of, as you know, our EPS guide increase also reflects a little bit more on the EPS front, as you know, reflects some -- a little bit lower share count compared to what we had in there previously, given the strength of our share buyback program. So that's really it in a nutshell. 
And so it's a distribution, to your point, in terms of structural and more temporary. But the structural part is very, very important in terms of what we're going to be able to deliver. We feel confident in that updated guide, and that's obviously very supportive of our shareholder value objectives. 
And then the second part of that?"

So on the soybean market, we've been talking about this for a number of years. The markets have been competitive, and they remain very competitive. But I think when you look at where we're at, we've had very good moment",470,"Yes. Thanks, David. Good questions. So on the soybean market, we've been talking about this for a number of years. The markets have been competitive, and they remain very competitive. But I think when you look at where we're at, we've had very good momentum, and I'll speak on a global standpoint, from a seed standpoint, we've been able to capture about 3% year-to-date globally on seeds and in some segments, even more like corn, where we're at about 4% globally year-to-date. 
We have launched our pricing in most of the Northern Hemisphere, including soybeans. And consistent with the past, we're taking a leadership position in terms of capturing value for our strong product performance. And as always, it's a strong -- it's a very competitive marketplace. No doubt about it. And we're going to continue to execute against our strong value proposition. 
We have a strong, disciplined organization in terms of managing our pricing process and the feedback on our products. We're in the middle of harvest still, but feedback on product performance has been very good from a genetic standpoint. And the demand for our E3 platform is extremely strong. So we're feeling good about where we sit. And as always, we'll deal with the competition. 
When you think about CP pricing and where we're at there, we've been working hard to build a strong execution capability on pricing there as well. And throughout the year, we've been very proactive to ensure that we're capturing value for our technology and also helping to mitigate the inflationary pressures that are out there. And I would say that we've been, I think, on the leading edge from an industry standpoint, probably first mover as soon as the first quarter of this year in terms of repricing to try to manage to those escalating prices. 
For commodity products like glyphosate, it's very dynamic. And we're going to continue to price that on an ongoing basis and really focus on ensuring that we offset all the inflationary cost pressures that we're seeing there. Excluding glyphosate, we've been able to capture about 3% year-to-date across our Crop Protection portfolio. In some categories on our most differentiated products like the Spinosyns, we're up about 8% year-to-date, which is really outstanding. And we're going to be proactive. We're going to be strategic as we wrap up 2021. 
And then as we set the stage for 2022, we've already implemented pricing for most of the Northern Hemisphere in 2022. And again, our expectation, as Dave said earlier that we've implemented mid-single-digit pricing across most of our portfolio in North America. And we're going to continue to focus on that, continue to remain very disciplined. And obviously, as we work through and deal with more pressures, we're going to continue to offset those as they come forward."

And our teams are focused on ensuring that we are as locally competitive understanding that we've got these global headwinds that we're constantly dealing with. So we are going to be dynamic. 
In most of the world, like I say, isn't such a driver of price. So it is our differentiated products that our teams are focused on. And when we talk about that 3% year-to-date price increase and when we talk about the mid-single-digit price increase that we've already implemented in the Northern Hemisphere for next year, that is across our new and differentiated products as well. So it's something that we're going to continue to focus on. We will execute that locally, knowing that we've got these global headwinds that we're dealing with. 
And in terms of the contribution from new products going forward, it's been a huge part of what's helped us continue to perform above market on the Crop Protection side in most parts of the world and will be again in 2022. So we've got a robust pipeline. We've got great new products like Isoclast insecticide and Arylex and Zorvec, which are continuing to accelerate their growth pattern. We continue to get new registrations. Literally every month, we're getting new registrations and some new products will be a very important part of our 2022 plan."

And secondly, I was wondering that kind of also like one more time ask the cost price issue for 2022. So in general, like the outlook that you have for 2022, that to me doesn't look that strenuous. Like if you can have, whether it's a 3% or 4% or 5% price increases on sales of $15.5 billion, like that should offset more or all of your costs.

So obviously, we were very excited in August when we were able to announce that we received authorization from the European Union that enabled from Conkesta E3 to be exported for food and seed use. So as a result, we have a limited launch of Conkesta E3 right now in Brazil. Farmers are able to plant product for the 2021-'22 season. So it's an important step forward. 
What I would reinforce, though, is that it's really not a meaningful financial impact as we look at '21 or '22 as we're working on ramping up production, building out our lineup and ultimately, we've got to go out there and gain customer support and drive adoption of the technology. So over time, no doubt this technology is going to drive incremental growth for us. It's going to greatly enhance our competitive position in the Latin American soybean market, which is important for us. And we're excited to bring new choice to the marketplace, and the marketplace is excited to have a new choice in terms of technology as well. 
So -- and then over time, we're also going to introduce this in other markets, such as Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. So it is something very important. We have not sized what we see the adoption rate as at this point in time, but I understand it's a limited launch, and it really is about establishing that technology and gaining support from our customers."

As you said, and Chuck really, I think, articulated it well, it's a really constructive setup when you look at 2022 with the backdrop of our markets and the strength of what we're bringing -- continue to bring to the market. And as you said, on price, we continue to execute against our strategy of pricing. Both Rajan and Tim have spoken about that and spoken to some of the specifics. And again, specifically for 2022 related to seed, we expect global pricing to be accretive to earnings after the impact of higher cost of goods sold. And by the way, again, just to emphasize, we've increased that seed cost of goods sold in the range of $250 million to $300 million now. So that's very important. 
And on crop, we expect to continue the momentum we've seen in 2021. And -- but very importantly, there's 2 really important things here. Number one is the market-driven inflation and logistics costs. Again, I'm going to just underscore that that we anticipate to be at least $150 million. And we've seen this progression over the course of 2021, obviously. And we expect supply chain challenges to continue just to underscore that through 2022. So these are -- some of what we see is sort of the balance against that constructive backdrop and the strength of what we're bringing to the marketplace and our ability to continue to drive, if you will, value value pricing in the marketplace. So we're going to get into those details. 
As I said, when we release our fourth quarter earnings, 2021, we'll provide more specific guide, but it's really, call it down the middle there in terms of the set of positives and constructive setup, what we're bringing to the table and then this, if you will, inflation impacts that we're seeing in the very dynamic nature of that.

And where we're sitting right now is -- I would characterize this as kind of the middle part of our booking season in North America. We go out and see customers, call it, September 1, more or less, is when we begin to move in the marketplace. And that booking period really extends through the end of the calendar year. And so we will expect by that time to have the majority, nearly all of our order position in place by the end of the year. So we're sort of in that middle position right now. And I'd say that orders are tracking well with where we would expect to be right now for both corn and soybeans in terms of technology shifts. If anything, I would say that in Enlist E3 demand on the Pioneer side is running a little bit stronger than maybe what we had originally planned as we came into the year. 
In terms of the acre mix between corn and soy, I think it's very preliminary and way too early to make a call based off of our orders right now. Customers are going to go through the next several months and really have to figure out on an individual basis what their crop mix will be. And Dave made the comments about where we see the market going into next year, roughly that 180 million planted acres between corn and soy in the U.S. that's there. And right now, when you look at the corn soy ratio, it's about 2:7, which isn't so -- which is actually pretty neutral, I'd say, on a year-over-year basis, but it feels like the economics are saying that we could trend a little bit more towards soybeans in terms of that 180 million mix than last year. Can't call it off the order position. I'd say the corn technology mix is consistent with what we would expect it to be. 
Farmers have been planting high-technology seeds and continue to want to do that. And really, I'd say where we sit today really supports what Chuck and Dave have already talked about in terms of a setup for '22 in terms of good, healthy markets, and also very strong demand for our technologies."

So I would say it's the markets themselves, it's the timing of when we would have executed the sale. And of course, that is very dynamic. Latin America is certainly more weighted towards the second half of the year, and we would have taken more pricing actions, I would say, to help mitigate some of the inflationary pressures that we've seen as the year developed and been able to realize that from a LatAm standpoint.

Most of them are going to start hitting in '23, '24, but we are going to start making an impact in 2022. So the germplasm is going to continue to grow within the Corteva germplasm as the trade gets integrated into our own portfolio. 
That said, I think the overall adoption is going to be higher than what we had said in 2021. As you know, we had expected about 30%, and we grew to more than 35%. And looking at the 2022 setup, we continue to see that continuing to grow. 
Some of the challenges that we have had in the South with Dicamba continues to be a challenge. But when we look at the Enlist herbicide performance, I think we continue to get encouraged there. The South is lagging in terms of adoption. But as we continue to work on the different varieties, how they are available, and we talk about the Dicamba challenges, I'm very optimistic that we'll be able to make some progress there, too. 
The bigger issue in the South, as I'm sure you're familiar, Michael, is more about the entrenched Dicamba capabilities that are there. And as we work through some of those things, I think we will get to where we need to relate it to the listed option."

I'm honored to be speaking with you after having spent the last several days getting to know the team.
Before I provide some early perspective, let me first say thank you to Jim Collins, who is guiding me through the transition over the next several weeks. I have known Jim for a very long time, and it is a privilege to build on the strong foundation he laid for long-term growth at Corteva with culture and innovation at its core. Now I recognize it's only day 4, so Dave will walk you through the quarterly results and the full year outlook, but it's important for me to first share some thoughts on why I believe that this is an unparalleled opportunity to lead at Corteva.
Starting first with the strengths of the franchise, which I believe is an industry leader in terms of balance and differentiation. In my experience in this industry, I always admired and respected how Corteva worked so closely with farmers to consistently provide best-in-class technology to drive value. And further, the breadth and depth of Corteva's portfolio is impressive, as it scale reaches all parts of the globe in a competitively advantaged way. This is why I believe, when combined with strong execution, Corteva can be the industry leader for years to come, which brings me to my second point, operational performance.
This quarter's results attest to what this team has built at Corteva: a commitment to operational excellence and efficiency has kept the company's supply chains open in the midst of ongoing disruptions; and a culture focused on delivering for customers and keeping each other safe has kept the organization on track meeting its commitments.
This is another quarter of revenue and earnings growth, which are a direct result of the strong foundation this team has built over the past 2.5 years. Over the past few days, I've spent a lot of time listening to and learning from my team. And I can already say this team is fully equipped to deliver on what we all know this company is capable of.
From the expertise of our commercial and operations teams to the deep capabilities of our R&D organization, it is abundantly clear to me that through the combination of the company's strong culture and organizational strengths, we are well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities that lie ahead.
So to summarize, tremendous assets, operational performance and an excellent team are only a few things I am really excited about and what attracted me to this opportunity. I understand your expectations, and I am confident we will deliver. We have the IP, the commitment to operational excellence and the customer relationships necessary to deliver long-term solutions to global issues, while serving the best interest of our shareholders.
We will always continue to deliver innovative and productive solutions for farmers, expand opportunities for our employees and build long-term value for our shareholders, all with sustainability as a priority.
And with that, let me now turn it over to Dave to take you through the results and the updates to our guidance."

In behalf of the Corteva team, I'm going to say we're all very excited to have Chuck join us at this time. It's a terrific position for the company, and we've got tremendous value that we can deliver. I want to welcome everybody also to the call.
Let's start on Slide 5, which shows our financial results for the quarter and also year-to-date. Starting on the left side of the chart, you can see it was another solid 3 months of continued growth and margin improvement. Compared to the prior year, we delivered 24% organic growth, gains in both seed and crop protection, led by Latin America and North America. In the quarter, we saw accelerated demand from customers, particularly in Latin America, which translated into an estimated $100 million in sales in the quarter that was previously forecasted in the fourth quarter.
Looking at earnings, we delivered seasonal loss of $51 million of operating EBITDA in the quarter, which is an improvement of greater than $120 million compared to the prior year.
Turning to the year-to-date results. Organic sales were up 9% to just over $12 billion. The growth was led by continued demand for new products, driving more than $330 million in growth from new crop protection products. Seed sales improved on increased planted area in U.S. soybeans and also strong demand for corn in Latin America. 
EBITDA of $2.31 billion year-to-date, up 25% compared to the same period last year. And year-to-date pricing coupled with volume gains more than offset cost headwinds, driving nearly 220 basis points of margin improvement compared to prior year. And this is particularly impressive given the challenges we're seeing in global supply chains and the cost inflation we continue to face. And we believe it's a clear differentiator for Corteva.
Let's go then to Slide 6 with more detail on our global sales growth. Here, you can see the balance and diversity of the global business in the results. In North America, organic sales were up 5% through the first 3 quarters. Seed sales benefited from increased planted area for both corn and soybeans as well as the continued penetration of Enlist E3 soybeans. Consistent with last quarter, Enlist E3 represents about 35% of the U.S. soybean market in 2021. Feedback from growers and performance to this point is quite positive.
Corn price was up 2% while soybean prices were down 3% as we continue to  see competitive pressure in that market. North America Crop Protection delivered year-to-date organic sales of 10%. Demand for new technologies, including Enlist, herbicide double digits. Price increased 3% through the third quarter on price execution in response to rising input costs, including raw materials, freight and logistics.
In Europe, Middle East and Africa, we had strong organic sales growth of 7%, resulting from price execution and record sunflower seed volumes. This growth was muted by an approximate $80 million to $100 million sales impact from corn supply shortages in '21. In Crop Protection, the portfolio of new and differentiated products remain in high demand, including technologies, such as Arylex herbicide and Zorvec fungicide, which enabled us to drive price, volume and gain market share in Europe despite the impact of discontinued products.
In Latin America, we realized 27% organic sales growth on strong volumes and price gains, driven by execution on our price for value strategy, coupled with increases to offset rising input costs.
In Seed, volumes grew 16%, driven by market share gains in Brazil safrinha and earlier shipments for the Brazil summer season. In Crop Protection, volumes grew 18% on significant demand for new and differentiated technologies, such as Isoclast and Jemvelva insecticides. In Asia Pacific, we delivered 7% organic sales growth compared to prior year with both volume and pricing gains. Seed volumes were down largely due to COVID-related demand impacts, particularly in Southeast Asia and India. Crop Protection organic growth of 11% was led by continued demand for new products, including Rinskor herbicide and also Pyraxalt insecticide. 
Let's move now to Slide 7 for a detailed review of our operating EBITDA performance through the third quarter. Through the first 9 months, operating EBITDA grew more than $460 million to approximately $2.3 billion. This was driven by strong organic growth with combined price and volume benefits of more than $600 million as we continue to benefit from new and differentiated products against a strong market backdrop. We recognized pricing gains in both segments in all regions during the period. Global corn price was up 4% year-to-date, demonstrating the value that we bring to customers.
Sales of new Crop Protection products grew more than $330 million versus the prior year and price increased 4% for the segment, which helped offset higher raw material and logistics costs. 
With respect to increased costs, we recognized roughly $350 million of market-driven cost headwinds year-to-date as well as $70 million of increased compensation costs and investment spend to support growth. This was partially offset by approximately $200 million in productivity initiatives, resulting in a net cost headwind of $220 million through the first 3 quarters. 
Very importantly, disciplined execution while managing through complex supply chain dynamics translated into more than 200 basis points improvement in operating EBITDA margin through the first 9 months of the year, again, a clear differentiator. 
Let's go now to Slide 8 where I'd like to discuss the current state of the global supply chain. Like other companies and, obviously, various industries, we continue to face supply chain challenges and cost inflation and to reiterate the theme we discussed at the end of the second quarter, we believe these challenges will continue through 2022. We've seen the cost of some of our key raw materials and co-formulates increased more than 20% in the past year, driving expected overall cost inflation to low to mid-single digits as a percent of our cost of sales. 
In addition to longer shipping times, we've also experienced additional downtime from supply constraints, in part due to the more than 60 force majeures declared directly from suppliers or indirectly from other raw material suppliers.
Now to help offset the impact of inflated input costs, we're utilizing operational levers, such as pricing and very focused productivity initiatives. As an example, on October 1, we announced on average mid-single-digit price increases in the U.S. on the majority of our Crop Protection products. This includes externally sourced glyphosate, where we expect our pricing will be up approximately $90 million for the full year. Now just for context, glyphosate sales represent less than 5% of our total annual Crop Protection Sales, but the inflation impact has been significant. 
With this backdrop, it's impressive that we're achieving attractive performance measured by on-time delivery to customer requests. The agility and flexibility that our teams are demonstrating has enabled us to capitalize on evolving market conditions, including increased demand for both Seed and Crop Protection products. 
With that, let's go to Slide 9. I'd like to provide the update on our full year 2021 outlook. We're raising our full year revenue guidance. We now expect reported net sales in the range of $15.5 billion to $15.7 billion, up 10% at the midpoint over 2020. We feel confident in this growth based on strong market fundamentals, continued demand for new and differentiated products globally in both Crop Protection and Seed segments and price execution in all regions, coupled with pricing for higher input costs. 
Mostly as a result of market-driven factors mentioned earlier, we're raising our estimate for full year costs by $100 million for the year, predominantly in Crop Protection. We're now expecting a total increase of $475 million versus prior year. In addition to these headwinds, we also expect increased SG&A and R&D costs of about $50 million, which includes spend for increased compensation as well as investment spend to support growth. 
Importantly, we're reaffirming and affirming the full year expectation to deliver operating EBITDA in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion for the year, an improvement of 22% over 2020 at the midpoint. This translates to approximately 150 basis points of margin expansion for the full year. 
And lastly, we're now forecasting a base tax rate in the range of 18% to 20%, coupled with a lower average share price count due to our share repurchase activity. We have increased our operating EPS guidance to a range of $2.05 to $2.15 per share for the year. 
Let's now let's go to Slide 10 and focus on 2022. As you can see on Slide 10, we've given you our initial planning framework. And you recall that we shared this with you last quarter. It's intended as a reminder of the key assumptions as we frame out the '22 plan, including organic revenue growth, Seed pricing versus commodity costs, strong penetration of new products, royalty cost improvement and continued cost inflation, partially offset by productivity initiatives. Importantly, this is all with a backdrop of continued strong market outlook and solid grower economics, which will drive customer demand in 2022. 
Turning to Slide 11, aligning with our midterm EBITDA target range for 2022. On the left of Slide 11, we've shown you at a high level, the bridge from our 2021 operating EBITDA guide to the EBITDA range implied by our midterm targets. 
Now let's go to the right side and cover a few of these key points. Market fundamentals remain positive, and our early views are that U.S. corn and soy acres will be approximately 180 million in total with a slight shift to soy based on relative economics at this time. Outside of the U.S., market growth looks strong in markets like Brazil where planted area is expected to increase 4% to 5%. 
In terms of organic growth, we expect that the global seed portfolio will continue to deliver on our price for value strategy where we expect 2022 pricing to be in excess of estimated seed cost headwinds from higher commodity prices. 
Crop Protection new and differentiated products, including Arylex and Enlist herbicides and Isoclast insecticide will be a primary driver in delivering above market in that segment. 
Turning to our early assumptions on costs. We've increased our estimate of Seed commodity price impacts and expect to see Seed cost increases in the range of $250 million to $300 million, largely driven by North America and Latin America. As I mentioned earlier, we expect Seed pricing to outpace these costs in 2022. 
In Crop Protection, market-driven inflation will continue through 2022. And we expect cost headwinds of at least $150 million. This includes the impact of the sell-through of inventory and continued cost inflation as a result of the supply chain conditions we've already discussed. It's too early to comment on when we think costs will level off. However, we will be using operational levers, such as pricing and productivity initiatives, to mitigate cost headwinds. 
This provides additional transparency into our preliminary planning for '22 and how that bridges to our midterm target EBITDA range. Put simply, price and volume will be critical to earnings and margin growth against the backdrop of strong customer demand and also continued cost and supply chain challenges. 
We will be providing more specifics during our fourth quarter earnings call in early February and communicating the full '22 guidance at that time. 
And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Jeff."

And what I'd say to you, though, is in the last couple of days, I've spent time with the Board of Directors, a lot of time with my team. And I've seen some of the operations already in just a short period of time. And certainly, everything that I've seen, it's exceeding my expectations. So my early impressions are extremely positive. 
I've had a good look at some of the elements of our technology pipeline. Obviously, I'm able to see it from a unique vantage point now. So I had a peek under the hood. And I will say that there is a growth engine here, a very impressive growth engine. The manufacturing footprint, when I look at it, probably the last 2 quarters have been the hardest in our industry in many, many years, and our supply chain is holding up. There's quite a bit of resiliency and that's because of the diversity that I've certainly seen. 
There will be focus areas, of course, that I will start to talk to the team about. But it is only day 4 for me. So I just want to say that I'm excited to be here. And some of the areas that I'm going to work with the team on just to give you sort of a flavor, of course, our customers are -- we're going to put them first. This company has already done that, but we have a unique set of advantages and core competencies with our technology and our supply chain and everything we do, we're going to put our customers first. 
Second is sustainability, climate change, reduction of acreage, things that really drive yields and improve performance for farmers. These are some are things that I think Corteva is uniquely positioned to, is to really drive the sustainability agenda for agricultural farming around the world. And then finally, we have some commitments out there. We're going to deliver on those commitments. So the execution of the strategic plan will become a very top priority. And if you've heard me talk before, I'm a very big believer in controlling what we can control and that we really want to be known as the best operator in the industry. Because I think that really complements our technology platform. 
So hopefully, that gives you a bit of color of some of the initial impressions and some of the things that the Corteva team was already talking about but will be of interest to me as well as I integrate myself with this wonderful team."

There is a lot of potential in this company. There are a lot of catalysts and levers that are within the management team's control and that they are highly focused on, which will drive long-term value creation for shareholders. 
The other thing is, look, we believe that the agricultural backdrop is still going to be quite positive as we enter 2022. We've got good planted acreage we expect in corn and soybeans next year. We're going to see increased acreage in Brazil. I think that when we look at farmer economics, they're still very constructive. Your potash question, I'm going to keep to the side. 
But overall, we think that the backdrop for the ag markets are quite positive. And then if you look at what Corteva can do within its control in terms of price, new products extension of its channel strategy, these are all things that the management team is highly focused on. And when you add it all up, that's why we felt it was important to at least put the outlook numbers out there. And just to reiterate, I will look into it in a lot more detail, but I have confidence in this management team."

When we think about the opportunities in the biologics business, the first message I want to leave with you is, we see this as an integrated play with the rest of our Crop Protection business. So I think that's -- the strength of our Crop Protection franchise, coupled with where we are headed with biologics, is the reason for our optimism. 
Our strategy, I would say, I will explain 3 prongs to it. The first part is in-licensing very unique technology, and our team has worked to get more than 10 of these signed up in the last 12 months where a lot of our optimism is coming from. And these are global companies, companies from Israel, France, Brazil, Spain, to name a few. So very strong in-licensing. 
The second thing we are working on is we've got a very strong commercial organization which I know you're familiar with. We are working to build capabilities within our commercial organization, supply chain, formulation and packaging and, last but not the least, R&D to continue to supplement the in-licensing technologies that we get. 
And with Chuck on board now, we will continue to explore opportunities to have bolt-on acquisitions with the support from the Board to see how we can further accelerate. So really, a very exciting space for us. We do have a very strong franchise in the natural products, like you're familiar with the Spinosyns franchise is already more than $800 million. So we are familiar with this space and really looking forward to seeing how further launches will help us continue to accelerate the growth."

So on the cash flow, you recall, you may have referenced the previous cash from operations slide that we had or guide rather that we had of 1.2 to 1.6. We're now at 1.7 to 1.9. So it reflects a couple of things. I think, number one, as you know, we have focused a lot on basic operational disciplines around cash and particularly on working capital. So there's a portion of this back to your structural that's really related to that in both receivables and also in our payables area. 
Those are 2 areas we've really been working on and deploying talent and the right disciplines and systems to support that. So those are important contributors. We've also increased the amount of prepaid assumption just in terms of the liquidity that our customers have and just what we're seeing already, in terms of cash coming in, related to that. So you could say that as more, call it, temporary as opposed to structural. 
We've also got some improvement in terms of net income with the lower tax rate that we've guided to, and that's part of, as you know, our EPS guide increase also reflects a little bit more on the EPS front, as you know, reflects some -- a little bit lower share count compared to what we had in there previously, given the strength of our share buyback program. So that's really it in a nutshell. 
And so it's a distribution, to your point, in terms of structural and more temporary. But the structural part is very, very important in terms of what we're going to be able to deliver. We feel confident in that updated guide, and that's obviously very supportive of our shareholder value objectives. 
And then the second part of that?"

The markets have been competitive, and they remain very competitive. But I think when you look at where we're at, we've had very good momentum, and I'll speak on a global standpoint, from a Seed standpoint, we've been able to capture about 3% year-to-date globally on seeds and in some segments, even more like corn, where we're at about 4% globally year-to-date. 
We have launched our pricing in most of the Northern Hemisphere, including soybeans. And consistent with the past, we're taking a leadership position in terms of capturing value for our strong product performance. And as always, it's a strong -- it's a very competitive marketplace. No doubt about it. And we will -- we're going to continue to execute against our strong value proposition. 
We have a strong, disciplined organization in terms of managing our pricing process and the feedback on our products. We're in the middle of harvest still, but feedback on product performance has been very good from a genetic standpoint. And the demand for our E3 platform is extremely strong. So we're feeling good about where we sit. And as always, we'll deal with the competition. 
When you think about CP pricing and where we're at there, we've been working hard to build a strong execution capability on pricing there as well. And throughout the year, we've been very proactive to ensure that we're capturing value for our technology and also helping to mitigate the inflationary pressures that are out there. And I would say that we've been, I think, on the leading edge from an industry standpoint, probably first mover as soon as the first quarter of this year in terms of repricing to try to manage to those escalating prices. 
For commodity products like glyphosate, it's very dynamic. And we're going to continue to price that on an ongoing basis and really focus on ensuring that we offset all the inflationary cost pressures that we're seeing there. Excluding glyphosate, we've been able to capture about 3% year-to-date across our Crop Protection portfolio. In some categories on our most differentiated products like the Spinosyns, we're up about 8% year-to-date, which is really outstanding. And we're going to be proactive. We're going to be strategic as we wrap up 2021. 
And then as we set the stage for 2022, we've already implemented pricing for most of the Northern Hemisphere in 2022. And again, our expectation, as Dave said earlier that we've implemented roughly mid-single-digit pricing across most of our portfolio in North America. And we're going to continue to focus on that, continue to remain very disciplined. And obviously, as we work through and deal with more pressures, we're going to continue to offset those as they come forward."

And our teams are focused on ensuring that we are as locally competitive understanding that we've got these global headwinds that we're constantly dealing with. So we are going to be dynamic. 
In most of the world, like I say, isn't such a driver of price. So it is our differentiated products that our teams are focused on. And when we talk about that 3% year-to-date price increase and when we talk about the mid-single-digit price increase that we've already implemented in the Northern Hemisphere for next year, that is across our new and differentiated products as well. So it's something that we're going to continue to focus on. We will execute that locally, knowing that we've got these global headwinds that we're dealing with. 
And in terms of the contribution from new products going forward, it's been a huge part of what's helped us continue to perform above market on the Crop Protection side in most parts of the world and will be again in 2022. So we've got a robust pipeline. We've got great new products like Isoclast and Arylex and Zorvec, which are continuing to accelerate their growth pattern. We continue to get new registrations. Literally every month, we're getting new registrations and some new products will be a very important part of our 2022 plan."

And secondly, I was wondering that kind of also like one more time, ask you the cost price issue for 2022.

Like if you can have, whether it's a 3% or 4% or 5% price increases on sales of $15.5 billion, like that should offset more or all of your costs.

So as a result, we have a limited launch of Conkesta E3 right now in Brazil. Farmers are able to plant product for the 2021-'22 season. So it's an important step forward. 
What I would reinforce, though, is that it's really not a meaningful financial impact as we look at '21 or '22 as we're working on ramping up production, building out our lineup and ultimately, we've got to go out there and gain customer support and drive adoption of the technology. So over time, no doubt this technology is going to drive incremental growth for us. It's going to greatly enhance our competitive position in the Latin American soybean market, which is important for us. And we're excited to bring new choice to the marketplace, and the marketplace is excited to have a new choice in terms of technology as well. 
So -- and then over time, we're also going to introduce this in other markets, such as Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. So it is something very important. We have not sized what we see the adoption rate as at this point in time, but I understand it's a limited launch, and it really is about establishing that technology and gaining support from our customers."

And as you said, on price, we continue to execute against our strategy of pricing. Both Rajan and Tim have spoken about that and spoken to some of the specifics. And again, specifically for 2022 related to Seed, we expect global pricing to be accretive to earnings after the impact of higher cost of goods sold. And by the way, again, just to emphasize, we've increased that seed cost of goods sold in the range of $250 million to $300 million now. So that's very important. 
And on crop, we expect to continue the momentum we've seen in 2021. And -- but very importantly, there's 2 really important things here. Number one is the market-driven inflation and logistics costs. Again, I'm going to just underscore that we anticipate to be at least $150 million. And we've seen this progression over the course of 2021, obviously. And we expect supply chain challenges to continue just to underscore that through 2022. So these are -- some of what we see is sort of the balance against that constructive backdrop and the strength of what we're bringing to the marketplace and our ability to continue to drive, if you will, value pricing in the marketplace. So we're going to get into those details. 
As I said, when we release our fourth quarter earnings, 2021, we'll provide more specific guide, but it's really, call it down the middle there in terms of the set of positives and constructive setup, what we're bringing to the table and then this, if you will, inflation impacts that we're seeing in the very dynamic nature of that.

And where we're sitting right now is -- I would characterize this as kind of the middle part of our booking season in North America. We go out and see customers, call it, September 1, more or less, is when we begin to move in the marketplace. And that booking period really extends through the end of the calendar year. And so we will expect by that time to have the majority, nearly all of our order position in place by the end of the year. So we're sort of in that middle position right now. And I'd say that orders are tracking well with where we would expect to be right now for both corn and soybeans. 
In terms of technology shifts, if anything, I would say that in Enlist E3 demand on the Pioneer side is running a little bit stronger than maybe what we had originally planned as we came into the year. 
In terms of the acre mix between corn and soy, I think it's very preliminary and way too early to make a call based off of our orders right now. Customers are going to go through the next several months and really have to figure out on an individual basis what their crop mix will be. And Dave made the comments about where we see the market going into next year, roughly that 180 million planted acres between corn and soy in the U.S. that's there. 
And right now, when you look at the corn soy ratio, it's about 2:7, which isn't so -- which is actually pretty neutral, I'd say, on a year-over-year basis, but it feels like the economics are saying that we could trend a little bit more towards soybeans in terms of that 180 million mix than last year. Can't call it off the order position. I'd say the corn technology mix is consistent with what we would expect it to be. 
Farmers have been planting high-technology seeds and continue to want to do that. And really, I'd say where we sit today really supports what Chuck and Dave have already talked about in terms of a setup for '22 in terms of good, healthy markets, and also very strong demand for our technologies."

In terms of the -- that element, I would say Latin America clearly has helped -- has been benefiting from good strong healthy economy as well as that impact from new product technology. I don't think you can lay it only on that because actually, we've got -- We've had some good technology adoption in Asia Pacific as well. So good strong product introductions. It really comes down to where we sit in those local markets. And again, we are dealing in very competitive markets. And actually, on a year-to-date basis, APAC is not flat. They're more like 2% year-to-date. So we do have some growth there as well. 
So I would say it's the markets themselves, it's the timing of when we would have executed the sale. And of course, that is very dynamic. Latin America is certainly more weighted towards the second half of the year, and we would have taken more pricing actions, I would say, to help mitigate some of the inflationary pressures that we've seen as the year developed and been able to realize that from a LATAM standpoint. But I wouldn't say it's only because of the product mix or anything like that. I think it could be timing and then that local competitive situation that you're facing in those markets."

And as we think about our own germplasm, we've got a very strong pipeline of new products coming through. Most of them are going to start hitting in '23, '24, but we are going to start making an impact in 2022. So the germplasm is going to continue to grow within the Corteva germplasm as the trade gets integrated into our own portfolio. 
That said, I think the overall adoption is going to be higher than what we had said in 2021. As you know, we had expected about 30%, and we grew to more than 35%. And looking at the 2022 setup, we continue to see that continuing to grow. 
Some of the challenges that we have had in the South with Dicamba continues to be a challenge. But when we look at the Enlist herbicide performance, I think we continue to get encouraged there. The South is lagging in terms of adoption. But as we continue to work on the different varieties, how they are available, and we talk about the Dicamba challenges, I'm very optimistic that we'll be able to make some progress there, too. 
The bigger issue in the South, as I'm sure you're familiar, Michael, is more about the entrenched Dicamba capabilities that are there. And as we work through some of those things, I think we will get to where we need to relate it to the listed option."

I'm honored to be speaking with you after having spent the last several days getting to know the team.
Before I provide some early perspective, let me first say thank you to Jim Collins, who is guiding me through the transition over the next several weeks. I have known Jim for a very long time, and it is a privilege to build on the strong foundation he laid for long-term growth at Corteva with culture and innovation at its core. Now I recognize it's only day 4, so Dave will walk you through the quarterly results and the full year outlook, but it's important for me to first share some thoughts on why I believe that this is an unparalleled opportunity to lead at Corteva.
Starting first with the strengths of the franchise, which I believe is an industry leader in terms of balance and differentiation. In my experience in this industry, I always admired and respected how Corteva worked so closely with farmers to consistently provide best-in-class technology to drive value. And further, the breadth and depth of Corteva's portfolio is impressive, as its scale reaches all parts of the globe in a competitively advantaged way. This is why I believe, when combined with strong execution, Corteva can be the industry leader for years to come, which brings me to my second point, operational performance.
This quarter's results attest to what this team has built at Corteva: a commitment to operational excellence and efficiency has kept the company's supply chains open in the midst of ongoing disruptions; and a culture focused on delivering for customers and keeping each other safe has kept the organization on track meeting its commitments.
This is another quarter of revenue and earnings growth, which are a direct result of the strong foundation this team has built over the past 2.5 years. Over the past few days, I've spent a lot of time listening to and learning from my team. And I can already say this team is fully equipped to deliver on what we all know this company is capable of.
From the expertise of our commercial and operations teams to the deep capabilities of our R&D organization, it is abundantly clear to me that through the combination of the company's strong culture and organizational strengths, we are well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities that lie ahead.
So to summarize, tremendous assets, operational performance and an excellent team are only a few things I am really excited about and what attracted me to this opportunity. I understand your expectations, and I am confident we will deliver. We have the IP, the commitment to operational excellence and the customer relationships necessary to deliver long-term solutions to global issues, while serving the best interest of our shareholders.
We will always continue to deliver innovative and productive solutions for farmers, expand opportunities for our employees and build long-term value for our shareholders, all with sustainability as a priority.
And with that, let me now turn it over to Dave to take you through the results and the updates to our guidance."

In behalf of the Corteva team, I'm going to say we're all very excited to have Chuck join us at this time. It's a terrific position for the company, and we've got tremendous value that we can deliver. I want to welcome everybody also to the call.
Let's start on Slide 5, which shows our financial results for the quarter and also year-to-date. Starting on the left side of the chart, you can see it was another solid 3 months of continued growth and margin improvement. Compared to the prior year, we delivered 24% organic growth gains in both seed and crop protection, led by Latin America and North America. In the quarter, we saw accelerated demand from customers, particularly in Latin America, which translated into an estimated $100 million in sales in the quarter that was previously forecasted in the fourth quarter.
Looking at earnings, we delivered seasonal loss of $51 million of operating EBITDA in the quarter, which is an improvement of greater than $120 million compared to the prior year.
Turning to the year-to-date results. Organic sales were up 9% to just over $12 billion. The growth was led by continued demand for new products, driving more than $330 million in growth from new crop protection products. Seed sales improved on increased planted area in U.S. soybeans and also strong demand for corn in Latin America. 
EBITDA of $2.31 billion year-to-date, up 25% compared to the same period last year. And year-to-date pricing coupled with volume gains more than offset cost headwinds, driving nearly 220 basis points of margin improvement compared to prior year. And this is particularly impressive given the challenges we're seeing in global supply chains and the cost inflation we continue to face. And we believe it's a clear differentiator for Corteva.
Let's go then to Slide 6 with more detail on our global sales growth. Here, you can see the balance and diversity of the global business in the results. In North America, organic sales were up 5% through the first 3 quarters. Seed sales benefited from increased planted area for both corn and soybeans as well as the continued penetration of Enlist E3 soybeans. Consistent with last quarter, Enlist E3 represents about 35% of the U.S. soybean market in 2021. Feedback from growers on performance to this point is quite positive.
Corn price was up 2% while soybean prices were down 3% as we continue to see competitive pressure in that market. North America Crop Protection delivered year-to-date organic sales of 10%. Demand for new technologies, including Enlist, herbicide remained strong.  Herbicide and fungicide growth were both up double digits. Price increased 3% through the third quarter on price execution in response to rising input costs, including raw materials, freight and logistics.
In Europe, Middle East and Africa, we had strong organic sales growth of 7%, resulting from price execution and record sunflower seed volumes. This growth was muted by an approximate $80 million to $100 million sales impact from corn supply shortages in '21. In Crop Protection, the portfolio of new and differentiated products remain in high demand, including technologies, such as Arylex herbicide and Zorvec fungicide, which enabled us to drive price, volume and gain market share in Europe despite the impact of discontinued products.
In Latin America, we realized 27% organic sales growth on strong volumes and price gains, driven by execution on our price for value strategy, coupled with increases to offset rising input costs.
In Seed, volumes grew 16%, driven by market share gains in Brazil safrinha and earlier shipments for the Brazil summer season. In Crop Protection, volumes grew 18% on significant demand for new and differentiated technologies, such as Isoclast and Jemvelva insecticides. In Asia Pacific, we delivered 7% organic sales growth compared to prior year with both volume and pricing gains. Seed volumes were down largely due to COVID-related demand impacts, particularly in Southeast Asia and India. Crop Protection organic growth of 11% was led by continued demand for new products, including Rinskor herbicide and also Pyraxalt insecticide. 
Let's move now to Slide 7 for a detailed review of our operating EBITDA performance through the third quarter. Through the first 9 months, operating EBITDA grew more than $460 million to approximately $2.3 billion. This was driven by strong organic growth with combined price and volume benefits of more than $600 million as we continue to benefit from new and differentiated products against a strong market backdrop. We recognized pricing gains in both segments in all regions during the period. Global corn price was up 4% year-to-date, demonstrating the value that we bring to customers.
Sales of new Crop Protection products grew more than $330 million versus the prior year and price increased 4% for the segment, which helped offset higher raw material and logistics costs. 
With respect to increased costs, we recognized roughly $350 million of market-driven cost headwinds year-to-date as well as $70 million of increased compensation costs and investment spend to support growth. This was partially offset by approximately $200 million in productivity initiatives, resulting in a net cost headwind of $220 million through the first 3 quarters. 
Very importantly, disciplined execution while managing through complex supply chain dynamics translated into more than 200 basis points improvement in operating EBITDA margin through the first 9 months of the year, again, a clear differentiator. 
Let's go now to Slide 8 where I'd like to discuss the current state of the global supply chain. Like other companies and, obviously, various industries, we continue to face supply chain challenges and cost inflation and to reiterate the theme we discussed at the end of the second quarter, we believe these challenges will continue through 2022. We've seen the cost of some of our key raw materials and co-formulates increased more than 20% in the past year, driving expected overall cost inflation to low to mid-single digits as a percent of our cost of sales. 
In addition to longer shipping times, we've also experienced additional downtime from supply constraints, in part due to the more than 60 force majeures declared directly from suppliers or indirectly from other raw material suppliers.
Now to help offset the impact of inflated input costs, we're utilizing operational levers, such as pricing and very focused productivity initiatives. As an example, on October 1, we announced on average mid-single-digit price increases in the U.S. on the majority of our Crop Protection products. This includes externally sourced glyphosate, where we expect our pricing will be up approximately $90 million for the full year. Now just for context, glyphosate sales represent less than 5% of our total annual Crop Protection Sales, but the inflation impact has been significant. 
With this backdrop, it's impressive that we're achieving attractive performance measured by on-time delivery to customer requests. The agility and flexibility that our teams are demonstrating has enabled us to capitalize on evolving market conditions, including increased demand for both Seed and Crop Protection products. 
With that, let's go to Slide 9. I'd like to provide the update on our full year 2021 outlook. We're raising our full year revenue guidance. We now expect reported net sales in the range of $15.5 billion to $15.7 billion, up 10% at the midpoint over 2020. We feel confident in this growth based on strong market fundamentals, continued demand for new and differentiated products globally in both Crop Protection and Seed segments and price execution in all regions, coupled with pricing for higher input costs. 
Mostly as a result of market-driven factors mentioned earlier, we're raising our estimate for full year costs by $100 million for the year, predominantly in Crop Protection. We're now expecting a total increase of $475 million versus prior year. In addition to these headwinds, we also expect increased SG&A and R&D costs of about $50 million, which includes spend for increased compensation as well as investment spend to support growth. 
Importantly, we're reaffirming and firming the full year expectation to deliver operating EBITDA in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion for the year, an improvement of 22% over 2020 at the midpoint. This translates to approximately 150 basis points of margin expansion for the full year. 
And lastly, we're now forecasting a base tax rate in the range of 18% to 20%, coupled with a lower average share price count due to our share repurchase activity. We have increased our operating EPS guidance to a range of $2.05 to $2.15 per share for the year. 
Let's now let's go to Slide 10 and focus on 2022. As you can see on Slide 10, we've given you our initial planning framework. And you recall that we shared this with you last quarter. It's intended as a reminder of the key assumptions as we frame out the '22 plan, including organic revenue growth, Seed pricing versus commodity costs, strong penetration of new products, royalty cost improvement and continued cost inflation, partially offset by productivity initiatives. Importantly, this is all with a backdrop of continued strong market outlook and solid grower economics, which will drive customer demand in 2022. 
Turning to Slide 11, aligning with our midterm EBITDA target range for 2022. On the left of Slide 11, we've shown you at a high level, the bridge from our 2021 operating EBITDA guide to the EBITDA range implied by our midterm targets. 
Now let's go to the right side and cover a few of these key points. Market fundamentals remain positive, and our early views are that U.S. corn and soy acres will be approximately 180 million in total with a slight shift to soy based on relative economics at this time. Outside of the U.S., market growth looks strong in markets like Brazil where planted area is expected to increase 4% to 5%. 
In terms of organic growth, we expect that the global seed portfolio will continue to deliver on our price for value strategy where we expect 2022 pricing to be in excess of estimated seed cost headwinds from higher commodity prices. 
Crop Protection new and differentiated products, including Arylex and Enlist herbicides and Isoclast insecticide will be a primary driver in delivering above market in that segment. 
Turning to our early assumptions on costs. We've increased our estimate of Seed commodity price impacts and expect to see Seed cost increases in the range of $250 million to $300 million, largely driven by North America and Latin America. As I mentioned earlier, we expect Seed pricing to outpace these costs in 2022. 
In Crop Protection, market-driven inflation will continue through 2022. And we expect cost headwinds of at least $150 million. This includes the impact of the sell-through of inventory and continued cost inflation as a result of the supply chain conditions we've already discussed. It's too early to comment on when we think costs will level off. However, we will be using operational levers, such as pricing and productivity initiatives, to mitigate cost headwinds. 
This provides additional transparency into our preliminary planning for '22 and how that bridges to our midterm target EBITDA range. Put simply, price and volume will be critical to earnings and margin growth against a backdrop of strong customer demand and also continued cost and supply chain challenges. 
We will be providing more specifics during our fourth quarter earnings call in early February and communicating the full '22 guidance at that time. 
And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Jeff."

So you highlighted everything that you thought was the strengths of the company, but what do you come into this with from the outside as a prior competitor, thinking that there are some things that you need to firm up or some things that could be done a bit better or a bit differently or where some blind spots are that you have that unique vantage point on that you can come into the organization and really hit the ground running with?"

So first of all, what I'd say is I'm really excited to be joining such a great company and an awesome management team. You're right. So I know Corteva. I know Corteva because they were a top-tier supplier to Nutrien. And what I'd say to you, though, is in the last couple of days, I've spent time with the Board of Directors, a lot of time with my team. And I've seen some of the operations already in just a short period of time. And certainly, everything that I've seen, it's exceeding my expectations. So my early impressions are extremely positive. 
I've had a good look at some of the elements of our technology pipeline. Obviously, I'm able to see it from a unique vantage point now. So I had a peek under the hood. And I will say that there is a growth engine here, a very impressive growth engine. The manufacturing footprint, when I look at it, probably the last 2 quarters have been the hardest in our industry in many, many years, and our supply chain is holding up. There's quite a bit of resiliency and that's because of the diversity that I've certainly seen. 
There will be focus areas, of course, that I will start to talk to the team about. But it is only day 4 for me. So I just want to say that I'm excited to be here. And some of the areas that I'm going to work with the team on just to give you sort of a flavor, of course, our customers are -- we're going to put them first. This company has already done that, but we have a unique set of advantages and core competencies with our technology and our supply chain and everything we do, we're going to put our customers first. 
Second is sustainability, climate change, reduction of acreage, things that really drive yields and improve performance for farmers. These are some -- are things that I think Corteva is uniquely positioned to, is to really drive the sustainability agenda for agricultural farming around the world. And then finally, we have some commitments out there. We're going to deliver on those commitments. So the execution of the strategic plan will become a very top priority. And if you've heard me talk before, I'm a very big believer in controlling what we can control and that we really want to be known as the best operator in the industry. Because I think that really complements our technology platform. 
So hopefully, that gives you a bit of color of some of the initial impressions and some of the things that the Corteva team was already talking about but will be of interest to me as well as I integrate myself with this wonderful team."

But Chuck, you're probably going to be judged on whether you hit these numbers next year. And so I have to believe you must have had a lot of comfort level that you can hit at least the midpoint of this guidance range with maybe some cushion above it to want to own these numbers.

And it is only day 4, As I'll just remind you, I will plan to dig in on the fundamental assumptions from the ground up. Obviously, I haven't had time to do that, but I will say a couple of things. 
There is a lot of potential in this company. There are a lot of catalysts and levers that are within the management team's control and that they are highly focused on, which will drive long-term value creation for shareholders. 
The other thing is, look, we believe that the agricultural backdrop is still going to be quite positive as we enter 2022. We've got good planted acreage we expect in corn and soybeans next year. We're going to see increased acreage in Brazil. I think that when we look at farmer economics, they're still very constructive. Your potash question, I'm going to keep to the side. 
But overall, we think that the backdrop for the ag markets are quite positive. And then if you look at what Corteva can do within its control in terms of price, new products extension of its channel strategy, these are all things that the management team is highly focused on. And when you add it all up, that's why we felt it was important to at least put the outlook numbers out there. And just to reiterate, I will look into it in a lot more detail, but I have confidence in this management team."

When we think about the opportunities in the biologics business, the first message I want to leave with you is, we see this as an integrated play with the rest of our Crop Protection business. So I think that's -- the strength of our Crop Protection franchise, coupled with where we are headed with biologics, is the reason for our optimism. 
Our strategy, I would say, I will explain 3 prongs to it. The first part is in-licensing very unique technology, and our team has worked to get more than 10 of these signed up in the last 12 months where a lot of our optimism is coming from. And these are global companies, companies from Israel, France, Brazil, Spain, to name a few. So very strong in-licensing. 
The second thing we are working on is we've got a very strong commercial organization which I know you're familiar with. We are working to build capabilities within our commercial organization, supply chain, formulation and packaging and, last but not the least, R&D to continue to supplement the in-licensing technologies that we get. 
And with Chuck on board now, we will continue to explore opportunities to have bolt-on acquisitions with the support from the Board to see how we can further accelerate. So really, a very exciting space for us. We do have a very strong franchise in the natural products, like you're familiar with the Spinosyns franchise is already more than $800 million. So we are familiar with this space and really looking forward to seeing how further launches will help us continue to accelerate the growth."

So on the cash flow, you recall, you may have referenced the previous cash from operations slide that we had or guide rather that we had of 1.2 to 1.6. We're now at 1.7 to 1.9. So it reflects a couple of things. I think, number one, as you know, we have focused a lot on basic operational disciplines around cash and particularly on working capital. So there's a portion of this back to your structural that's really related to that in both receivables and also in our payables area. 
Those are 2 areas we've really been working on and deploying talent and the right disciplines and systems to support that. So those are important contributors. We've also increased the amount of prepaid assumption just in terms of the liquidity that our customers have and just what we're seeing already, in terms of cash coming in, related to that. So you could say that as more, call it, temporary as opposed to structural. 
We've also got some improvement in terms of net income with the lower tax rate that we've guided to, and that's part of, as you know, our EPS guide increase also reflects a little bit more on the EPS front, as you know, it reflects some -- a little bit lower share count compared to what we had in there previously, given the strength of our share buyback program. So that's really it in a nutshell. 
And so it's a distribution, to your point, in terms of structural and more temporary. But the structural part is very, very important in terms of what we're going to be able to deliver. We feel confident in that updated guide, and that's obviously very supportive of our shareholder value objectives. 
And then the second part of that?"

The markets have been competitive, and they remain very competitive. But I think when you look at where we're at, we've had very good momentum, and I'll speak on a global standpoint, from a Seed standpoint, we've been able to capture about 3% year-to-date globally on seeds and in some segments, even more like corn, where we're at about 4% globally year-to-date. 
We have launched our pricing in most of the Northern Hemisphere, including soybeans. And consistent with the past, we're taking a leadership position in terms of capturing value for our strong product performance. And as always, it's a strong -- it's a very competitive marketplace. No doubt about it. And we will -- we're going to continue to execute against our strong value proposition. 
We have a strong, disciplined organization in terms of managing our pricing process and the feedback on our products. We're in the middle of harvest still, but feedback on product performance has been very good from a genetic standpoint. And the demand for our E3 platform is extremely strong. So we're feeling good about where we sit. And as always, we'll deal with the competition. 
When you think about CP pricing and where we're at there, we've been working hard to build a strong execution capability on pricing there as well. And throughout the year, we've been very proactive to ensure that we're capturing value for our technology and also helping to mitigate the inflationary pressures that are out there. And I would say that we've been, I think, on the leading edge from an industry standpoint, probably first mover as soon as the first quarter of this year in terms of repricing to try to manage to those escalating prices. 
For commodity products like glyphosate, it's very dynamic. And we're going to continue to price that on an ongoing basis and really focus on ensuring that we offset all the inflationary cost pressures that we're seeing there. Excluding glyphosate, we've been able to capture about 3% year-to-date across our Crop Protection portfolio. In some categories on our most differentiated products like the Spinosyns, we're up about 8% year-to-date, which is really outstanding. And we're going to be proactive. We're going to be strategic as we wrap up 2021. 
And then as we set the stage for 2022, we've already implemented pricing for most of the Northern Hemisphere in 2022. And again, our expectation, as Dave said earlier that we've implemented roughly mid-single-digit pricing across most of our portfolio in North America. And we're going to continue to focus on that, continue to remain very disciplined. And obviously, as we work through and deal with more pressures, we're going to continue to offset those as they come forward."

And our teams are focused on ensuring that we are as locally competitive understanding that we've got these global headwinds that we're constantly dealing with. So we are going to be dynamic. 
In most of the world, glyphosate isn't such a driver of price. So it is our differentiated products that our teams are focused on. And when we talk about that 3% year-to-date price increase and when we talk about the mid-single-digit price increase that we've already implemented in the Northern Hemisphere for next year, that is across our new and differentiated products as well. So it's something that we're going to continue to focus on. We will execute that locally, knowing that we've got these global headwinds that we're dealing with. 
And in terms of the contribution from new products going forward, it's been a huge part of what's helped us continue to perform above market on the Crop Protection side in most parts of the world and will be again in 2022. So we've got a robust pipeline. We've got great new products like Isoclast and Arylex and Zorvec, which are continuing to accelerate their growth pattern. We continue to get new registrations.

So as a result, we have a limited launch of Conkesta E3 right now in Brazil. Farmers are able to plant product for the 2021-'22 season. So it's an important step forward. 
What I would reinforce, though, is that it's really not a meaningful financial impact as we look at '21 or '22 as we're working on ramping up production, building out our lineup and ultimately, we've got to go out there and gain customer support and drive adoption of the technology. So over time, no doubt this technology is going to drive incremental growth for us. It's going to greatly enhance our competitive position in the Latin American soybean market, which is important for us. And we're excited to bring new choice to the marketplace, and the marketplace is excited to have a new choice in terms of technology as well. 
So -- and then over time, we're also going to introduce this in other markets, such as Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. So it is something very important. We have not sized what we see the adoption rate as at this point in time, but I understand it's a limited launch, and it really is about establishing that technology and gaining support from our customers."

So this is Dave. I'll take the second part of that related to 2022. As you said, and Chuck really, I think, articulated it well, it's a really constructive setup when you look at 2022 with the backdrop of our markets and the strength of what we're bringing -- continue to bring to the market. And as you said, on price, we continue to execute against our strategy of pricing. Both Rajan and Tim have spoken about that and spoken to some of the specifics. And again, specifically for 2022 related to Seed, we expect global pricing to be accretive to earnings after the impact of higher cost of goods sold. And by the way, again, just to emphasize, we've increased that seed cost of goods sold in the range of $250 million to $300 million now. So that's very important. 
And on crop, we expect to continue the momentum we've seen in 2021. But very importantly, there's 2 really important things here. Number one is the market-driven inflation and logistics costs. Again, I'm going to just underscore that that we anticipate to be at least $150 million. And we've seen this progression over the course of 2021, obviously. And we expect supply chain challenges to continue just to underscore that through 2022. So these are -- some of what we see is sort of the balance against that constructive backdrop and the strength of what we're bringing to the marketplace and our ability to continue to drive, if you will, value pricing in the marketplace. So we're going to get into those details.  
As I said, when we release our fourth quarter earnings, 2021, we'll provide more specific guide, but it's really, call it down the middle there in terms of the set of positives and constructive setup, what we're bringing to the table and then this, if you will, inflation impacts that we're seeing in the very dynamic nature of that. So we appreciate your question and look forward to that update when we can provide more details."

And where we're sitting right now is -- I would characterize this as kind of the middle part of our booking season in North America. We go out and see customers, call it, September 1, more or less, is when we begin to move in the marketplace. And that booking period really extends through the end of the calendar year. And so we will expect by that time to have the majority, nearly all of our order position in place by the end of the year. So we're sort of in that middle position right now. And I'd say that orders are tracking well with where we would expect to be right now for both corn and soybeans. 
In terms of technology shifts, if anything, I would say that Enlist E3 demand on the Pioneer side is running a little bit stronger than maybe what we had originally planned as we came into the year. 
In terms of the acre mix between corn and soy, I think it's very preliminary and way too early to make a call based off of our orders right now. Customers are going to go through the next several months and really have to figure out on an individual basis what their crop mix will be. And Dave made the comments about where we see the market going into next year, roughly that 180 million planted acres between corn and soy in the U.S. that's there. 
And right now, when you look at the corn/soy ratio, it's about 2:7, which isn't so -- which is actually pretty neutral, I'd say, on a year-over-year basis, but it feels like the economics are saying that we could trend a little bit more towards soybeans in terms of that 180 mix in last year. Can't call it off the order position. I'd say the corn technology mix is consistent with what we would expect it to be. 
Farmers have been planting high-technology seeds and continue to want to do that. And really, I'd say where we sit today really supports what Chuck and Dave have already talked about in terms of our setup for '22 in terms of good, healthy markets, and also very strong demand for our technologies."

I don't think you can lay it only on that because actually, we've got -- we've had some good technology adoption in Asia Pacific as well. So good strong product introductions. It really comes down to where we sit in those local markets. And again, we are dealing in very competitive markets. And actually, on a year-to-date basis, APAC is not flat. They're more like 2% year-to-date. So we do have some growth there as well. 
So I would say it's the markets themselves, it's the timing of when we would have executed the sale. And of course, that is very dynamic. Latin America is certainly more weighted towards the second half of the year, and we would have taken more pricing actions, I would say, to help mitigate some of the inflationary pressures that we've seen as the year developed and been able to realize that from a LATAM standpoint. But I wouldn't say it's only because of the product mix or anything like that. I think it could be timing and then that local competitive situation that you're facing in those markets."

The overall adoption of the Enlist system really continues to meet our expectations. The demand at the grower level across the U.S. is really very strong. And as we think about our own germplasm, we've got a very strong pipeline of new products coming through. Most of them are going to start hitting in '23, '24, but we are going to start making an impact in 2022. So the germplasm is going to continue to grow within the Corteva germplasm as the trade gets integrated into our own portfolio. 
That said, I think the overall adoption is going to be higher than what we had said in 2021. As you know, we had expected about 30%, and we grew to more than 35%. And looking at the 2022 setup, we continue to see that continuing to grow. 
Some of the challenges that we have had in the South with Dicamba continues to be a challenge. But when we look at the Enlist herbicide performance, I think we continue to get encouraged there. The South is lagging in terms of adoption. But as we continue to work on the different varieties, how they are available, and we talk about the Dicamba challenges, I'm very optimistic that we'll be able to make some progress there, too. 
The bigger issue in the South, as I'm sure you're familiar, Michael, is more about the entrenched Dicamba capabilities that are there. And as we work through some of those things, I think we will get to where we need to relate it to the listed option."

I'm honored to be speaking with you after having spent the last several days getting to know the team.
Before I provide some early perspective, let me first say thank you to Jim Collins, who is guiding me through the transition over the next several weeks. I have known Jim for a very long time, and it is a privilege to build on the strong foundation he laid for long-term growth at Corteva with culture and innovation at its core. Now I recognize it's only day 4, so Dave will walk you through the quarterly results and the full year outlook, but it's important for me to first share some thoughts on why I believe that this is an unparalleled opportunity to lead at Corteva.
Starting first with the strengths of the franchise, which I believe is an industry leader in terms of balance and differentiation. In my experience in this industry, I always admired and respected how Corteva worked so closely with farmers to consistently provide best-in-class technology to drive value. And further, the breadth and depth of Corteva's portfolio is impressive, as its scale reaches all parts of the globe in a competitively advantaged way. This is why I believe, when combined with strong execution, Corteva can be the industry leader for years to come, which brings me to my second point, operational performance.
This quarter's results attest to what this team has built at Corteva: a commitment to operational excellence and efficiency has kept the company's supply chains open in the midst of ongoing disruptions; and a culture focused on delivering for customers and keeping each other safe has kept the organization on track meeting its commitments.
This is another quarter of revenue and earnings growth, which are a direct result of the strong foundation this team has built over the past 2.5 years. Over the past few days, I've spent a lot of time listening to and learning from my team. And I can already say this team is fully equipped to deliver on what we all know this company is capable of.
From the expertise of our commercial and operations teams to the deep capabilities of our R&D organization, it is abundantly clear to me that through the combination of the company's strong culture and organizational strengths, we are well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities that lie ahead.
So to summarize, tremendous assets, operational performance and an excellent team are only a few things I am really excited about and what attracted me to this opportunity. I understand your expectations, and I am confident we will deliver. We have the IP, the commitment to operational excellence and the customer relationships necessary to deliver long-term solutions to global issues, while serving the best interest of our shareholders.
We will always continue to deliver innovative and productive solutions for farmers, expand opportunities for our employees and build long-term value for our shareholders, all with sustainability as a priority.
And with that, let me now turn it over to Dave to take you through the results and the updates to our guidance."

In behalf of the Corteva team, I'm going to say we're all very excited to have Chuck join us at this time. It's a terrific position for the company, and we've got tremendous value that we can deliver. I want to welcome everybody also to the call.
Let's start on Slide 5, which shows our financial results for the quarter and also year-to-date. Starting on the left side of the chart, you can see it was another solid 3 months of continued growth and margin improvement. Compared to the prior year, we delivered 24% organic growth gains in both seed and crop protection, led by Latin America and North America. In the quarter, we saw accelerated demand from customers, particularly in Latin America, which translated into an estimated $100 million in sales in the quarter that was previously forecasted in the fourth quarter.
Looking at earnings, we delivered seasonal loss of $51 million of operating EBITDA in the quarter, which is an improvement of greater than $120 million compared to the prior year.
Turning to the year-to-date results. Organic sales were up 9% to just over $12 billion. The growth was led by continued demand for new products, driving more than $330 million in growth from new crop protection products. Seed sales improved on increased planted area in U.S. soybeans and also strong demand for corn in Latin America. 
EBITDA of $2.31 billion year-to-date, up 25% compared to the same period last year. And year-to-date pricing coupled with volume gains more than offset cost headwinds, driving nearly 220 basis points of margin improvement compared to prior year. And this is particularly impressive given the challenges we're seeing in global supply chains and the cost inflation we continue to face. And we believe it's a clear differentiator for Corteva.
Let's go then to Slide 6 with more detail on our global sales growth. Here, you can see the balance and diversity of the global business in the results. In North America, organic sales were up 5% through the first 3 quarters. Seed sales benefited from increased planted area for both corn and soybeans as well as the continued penetration of Enlist E3 soybeans. Consistent with last quarter, Enlist E3 represents about 35% of the U.S. soybean market in 2021. Feedback from growers on performance to this point is quite positive.
Corn price was up 2% while soybean prices were down 3% as we continue to see competitive pressure in that market. North America Crop Protection delivered year-to-date organic sales of 10%. Demand for new technologies, including Enlist, herbicide remained strong.  Herbicide and fungicide growth were both up double digits. Price increased 3% through the third quarter on price execution in response to rising input costs, including raw materials, freight and logistics.
In Europe, Middle East and Africa, we had strong organic sales growth of 7%, resulting from price execution and record sunflower seed volumes. This growth was muted by an approximate $80 million to $100 million sales impact from corn supply shortages in '21. In Crop Protection, the portfolio of new and differentiated products remain in high demand, including technologies, such as Arylex herbicide and Zorvec fungicide, which enabled us to drive price, volume and gain market share in Europe despite the impact of discontinued products.
In Latin America, we realized 27% organic sales growth on strong volumes and price gains, driven by execution on our price for value strategy, coupled with increases to offset rising input costs.
In Seed, volumes grew 16%, driven by market share gains in Brazil safrinha and earlier shipments for the Brazil summer season. In Crop Protection, volumes grew 18% on significant demand for new and differentiated technologies, such as Isoclast and Jemvelva insecticides. In Asia Pacific, we delivered 7% organic sales growth compared to prior year with both volume and pricing gains. Seed volumes were down largely due to COVID-related demand impacts, particularly in Southeast Asia and India. Crop Protection organic growth of 11% was led by continued demand for new products, including Rinskor herbicide and also Pyraxalt insecticide. 
Let's move now to Slide 7 for a detailed review of our operating EBITDA performance through the third quarter. Through the first 9 months, operating EBITDA grew more than $460 million to approximately $2.3 billion. This was driven by strong organic growth with combined price and volume benefits of more than $600 million as we continue to benefit from new and differentiated products against a strong market backdrop. We recognized pricing gains in both segments in all regions during the period. Global corn price was up 4% year-to-date, demonstrating the value that we bring to customers.
Sales of new Crop Protection products grew more than $330 million versus the prior year and price increased 4% for the segment, which helped offset higher raw material and logistics costs. 
With respect to increased costs, we recognized roughly $350 million of market-driven cost headwinds year-to-date as well as $70 million of increased compensation costs and investment spend to support growth. This was partially offset by approximately $200 million in productivity initiatives, resulting in a net cost headwind of $220 million through the first 3 quarters. 
Very importantly, disciplined execution while managing through complex supply chain dynamics translated into more than 200 basis points improvement in operating EBITDA margin through the first 9 months of the year, again, a clear differentiator. 
Let's go now to Slide 8 where I'd like to discuss the current state of the global supply chain. Like other companies and, obviously, various industries, we continue to face supply chain challenges and cost inflation and to reiterate the theme we discussed at the end of the second quarter, we believe these challenges will continue through 2022. We've seen the cost of some of our key raw materials and co-formulates increased more than 20% in the past year, driving expected overall cost inflation to low to mid-single digits as a percent of our cost of sales. 
In addition to longer shipping times, we've also experienced additional downtime from supply constraints, in part due to the more than 60 force majeures declared directly from suppliers or indirectly from other raw material suppliers.
Now to help offset the impact of inflated input costs, we're utilizing operational levers, such as pricing and very focused productivity initiatives. As an example, on October 1, we announced on average mid-single-digit price increases in the U.S. on the majority of our Crop Protection products. This includes externally sourced glyphosate, where we expect our pricing will be up approximately $90 million for the full year. Now just for context, glyphosate sales represent less than 5% of our total annual Crop Protection Sales, but the inflation impact has been significant. 
With this backdrop, it's impressive that we're achieving attractive performance measured by on-time delivery to customer requests. The agility and flexibility that our teams are demonstrating has enabled us to capitalize on evolving market conditions, including increased demand for both Seed and Crop Protection products. 
With that, let's go to Slide 9. I'd like to provide the update on our full year 2021 outlook. We're raising our full year revenue guidance. We now expect reported net sales in the range of $15.5 billion to $15.7 billion, up 10% at the midpoint over 2020. We feel confident in this growth based on strong market fundamentals, continued demand for new and differentiated products globally in both Crop Protection and Seed segments and price execution in all regions, coupled with pricing for higher input costs. 
Mostly as a result of market-driven factors mentioned earlier, we're raising our estimate for full year costs by $100 million for the year, predominantly in Crop Protection. We're now expecting a total increase of $475 million versus prior year. In addition to these headwinds, we also expect increased SG&A and R&D costs of about $50 million, which includes spend for increased compensation as well as investment spend to support growth. 
Importantly, we're reaffirming and firming the full year expectation to deliver operating EBITDA in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion for the year, an improvement of 22% over 2020 at the midpoint. This translates to approximately 150 basis points of margin expansion for the full year. 
And lastly, we're now forecasting a base tax rate in the range of 18% to 20%, coupled with a lower average share price count due to our share repurchase activity. We have increased our operating EPS guidance to a range of $2.05 to $2.15 per share for the year. 
Let's now let's go to Slide 10 and focus on 2022. As you can see on Slide 10, we've given you our initial planning framework. And you recall that we shared this with you last quarter. It's intended as a reminder of the key assumptions as we frame out the '22 plan, including organic revenue growth, Seed pricing versus commodity costs, strong penetration of new products, royalty cost improvement and continued cost inflation, partially offset by productivity initiatives. Importantly, this is all with a backdrop of continued strong market outlook and solid grower economics, which will drive customer demand in 2022. 
Turning to Slide 11, aligning with our midterm EBITDA target range for 2022. On the left of Slide 11, we've shown you at a high level, the bridge from our 2021 operating EBITDA guide to the EBITDA range implied by our midterm targets. 
Now let's go to the right side and cover a few of these key points. Market fundamentals remain positive, and our early views are that U.S. corn and soy acres will be approximately 180 million in total with a slight shift to soy based on relative economics at this time. Outside of the U.S., market growth looks strong in markets like Brazil where planted area is expected to increase 4% to 5%. 
In terms of organic growth, we expect that the global seed portfolio will continue to deliver on our price for value strategy where we expect 2022 pricing to be in excess of estimated seed cost headwinds from higher commodity prices. 
Crop Protection new and differentiated products, including Arylex and Enlist herbicides and Isoclast insecticide will be a primary driver in delivering above market in that segment. 
Turning to our early assumptions on costs. We've increased our estimate of Seed commodity price impacts and expect to see Seed cost increases in the range of $250 million to $300 million, largely driven by North America and Latin America. As I mentioned earlier, we expect Seed pricing to outpace these costs in 2022. 
In Crop Protection, market-driven inflation will continue through 2022. And we expect cost headwinds of at least $150 million. This includes the impact of the sell-through of inventory and continued cost inflation as a result of the supply chain conditions we've already discussed. It's too early to comment on when we think costs will level off. However, we will be using operational levers, such as pricing and productivity initiatives, to mitigate cost headwinds. 
This provides additional transparency into our preliminary planning for '22 and how that bridges to our midterm target EBITDA range. Put simply, price and volume will be critical to earnings and margin growth against a backdrop of strong customer demand and also continued cost and supply chain challenges. 
We will be providing more specifics during our fourth quarter earnings call in early February and communicating the full '22 guidance at that time. 
And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Jeff."

I know Corteva because they were a top-tier supplier to Nutrien. And what I'd say to you, though, is in the last couple of days, I've spent time with the Board of Directors, a lot of time with my team. And I've seen some of the operations already in just a short period of time. And certainly, everything that I've seen, it's exceeding my expectations. So my early impressions are extremely positive. 
I've had a good look at some of the elements of our technology pipeline. Obviously, I'm able to see it from a unique vantage point now. So I had a peek under the hood. And I will say that there is a growth engine here, a very impressive growth engine. The manufacturing footprint, when I look at it, probably the last 2 quarters have been the hardest in our industry in many, many years, and our supply chain is holding up. There's quite a bit of resiliency and that's because of the diversity that I've certainly seen. 
There will be focus areas, of course, that I will start to talk to the team about. But it is only day 4 for me. So I just want to say that I'm excited to be here. And some of the areas that I'm going to work with the team on just to give you sort of a flavor, of course, our customers are -- we're going to put them first. This company has already done that, but we have a unique set of advantages and core competencies with our technology and our supply chain and everything we do, we're going to put our customers first. 
Second is sustainability, climate change, reduction of acreage, things that really drive yields and improve performance for farmers. These are some -- are things that I think Corteva is uniquely positioned to, is to really drive the sustainability agenda for agricultural farming around the world. And then finally, we have some commitments out there. We're going to deliver on those commitments. So the execution of the strategic plan will become a very top priority. And if you've heard me talk before, I'm a very big believer in controlling what we can control and that we really want to be known as the best operator in the industry. Because I think that really complements our technology platform. 
So hopefully, that gives you a bit of color of some of the initial impressions and some of the things that the Corteva team was already talking about but will be of interest to me as well as I integrate myself with this wonderful team."

There is a lot of potential in this company. There are a lot of catalysts and levers that are within the management team's control and that they are highly focused on, which will drive long-term value creation for shareholders. 
The other thing is, look, we believe that the agricultural backdrop is still going to be quite positive as we enter 2022. We've got good planted acreage we expect in corn and soybeans next year. We're going to see increased acreage in Brazil. I think that when we look at farmer economics, they're still very constructive. Your potash question, I'm going to keep to the side. 
But overall, we think that the backdrop for the ag markets are quite positive. And then if you look at what Corteva can do within its control in terms of price, new products extension of its channel strategy, these are all things that the management team is highly focused on. And when you add it all up, that's why we felt it was important to at least put the outlook numbers out there. And just to reiterate, I will look into it in a lot more detail, but I have confidence in this management team."

When we think about the opportunities in the biologics business, the first message I want to leave with you is, we see this as an integrated play with the rest of our Crop Protection business. So I think that's -- the strength of our Crop Protection franchise, coupled with where we are headed with biologics, is the reason for our optimism. 
Our strategy, I would say, I will explain 3 prongs to it. The first part is in-licensing very unique technology, and our team has worked to get more than 10 of these signed up in the last 12 months where a lot of our optimism is coming from. And these are global companies, companies from Israel, France, Brazil, Spain, to name a few. So very strong in-licensing. 
The second thing we are working on is we've got a very strong commercial organization which I know you're familiar with. We are working to build capabilities within our commercial organization, supply chain, formulation and packaging and, last but not the least, R&D to continue to supplement the in-licensing technologies that we get. 
And with Chuck on board now, we will continue to explore opportunities to have bolt-on acquisitions with the support from the Board to see how we can further accelerate. So really, a very exciting space for us. We do have a very strong franchise in the natural products, like you're familiar with the Spinosyns franchise is already more than $800 million. So we are familiar with this space and really looking forward to seeing how further launches will help us continue to accelerate the growth."

So on the cash flow, you recall, you may have referenced the previous cash from operations slide that we had or guide rather that we had of 1.2 to 1.6. We're now at 1.7 to 1.9. So it reflects a couple of things. I think, number one, as you know, we have focused a lot on basic operational disciplines around cash and particularly on working capital. So there's a portion of this back to your structural that's really related to that in both receivables and also in our payables area. 
Those are 2 areas we've really been working on and deploying talent and the right disciplines and systems to support that. So those are important contributors. We've also increased the amount of prepaid assumption just in terms of the liquidity that our customers have and just what we're seeing already, in terms of cash coming in, related to that. So you could say that as more, call it, temporary as opposed to structural. 
We've also got some improvement in terms of net income with the lower tax rate that we've guided to, and that's part of, as you know, our EPS guide increase also reflects a little bit more on the EPS front, as you know, it reflects some -- a little bit lower share count compared to what we had in there previously, given the strength of our share buyback program. So that's really it in a nutshell. 
And so it's a distribution, to your point, in terms of structural and more temporary. But the structural part is very, very important in terms of what we're going to be able to deliver. We feel confident in that updated guide, and that's obviously very supportive of our shareholder value objectives. 
And then the second part of that?"

The markets have been competitive, and they remain very competitive. But I think when you look at where we're at, we've had very good momentum, and I'll speak on a global standpoint, from a Seed standpoint, we've been able to capture about 3% year-to-date globally on seeds and in some segments, even more like corn, where we're at about 4% globally year-to-date. 
We have launched our pricing in most of the Northern Hemisphere, including soybeans. And consistent with the past, we're taking a leadership position in terms of capturing value for our strong product performance. And as always, it's a strong -- it's a very competitive marketplace. No doubt about it. And we will -- we're going to continue to execute against our strong value proposition. 
We have a strong, disciplined organization in terms of managing our pricing process and the feedback on our products. We're in the middle of harvest still, but feedback on product performance has been very good from a genetic standpoint. And the demand for our E3 platform is extremely strong. So we're feeling good about where we sit. And as always, we'll deal with the competition. 
When you think about CP pricing and where we're at there, we've been working hard to build a strong execution capability on pricing there as well. And throughout the year, we've been very proactive to ensure that we're capturing value for our technology and also helping to mitigate the inflationary pressures that are out there. And I would say that we've been, I think, on the leading edge from an industry standpoint, probably first mover as soon as the first quarter of this year in terms of repricing to try to manage to those escalating prices. 
For commodity products like glyphosate, it's very dynamic. And we're going to continue to price that on an ongoing basis and really focus on ensuring that we offset all the inflationary cost pressures that we're seeing there. Excluding glyphosate, we've been able to capture about 3% year-to-date across our Crop Protection portfolio. In some categories on our most differentiated products like the Spinosyns, we're up about 8% year-to-date, which is really outstanding. And we're going to be proactive. We're going to be strategic as we wrap up 2021. 
And then as we set the stage for 2022, we've already implemented pricing for most of the Northern Hemisphere in 2022. And again, our expectation, as Dave said earlier that we've implemented roughly mid-single-digit pricing across most of our portfolio in North America. And we're going to continue to focus on that, continue to remain very disciplined. And obviously, as we work through and deal with more pressures, we're going to continue to offset those as they come forward."

So when we talk about CP pricing, I'll talk about it on an aggregate basis, and we report it on an aggregate basis, but we are pricing locally. It's based off individual product formulations and what their fit is in the marketplace. And our teams are focused on ensuring that we are as locally competitive understanding that we've got these global headwinds that we're constantly dealing with. So we are going to be dynamic. 
In most of the world, glyphosate isn't such a driver of price. So it is our differentiated products that our teams are focused on. And when we talk about that 3% year-to-date price increase and when we talk about the mid-single-digit price increase that we've already implemented in the Northern Hemisphere for next year, that is across our new and differentiated products as well. So it's something that we're going to continue to focus on. We will execute that locally, knowing that we've got these global headwinds that we're dealing with. 
And in terms of the contribution from new products going forward, it's been a huge part of what's helped us continue to perform above market on the Crop Protection side in most parts of the world and will be again in 2022. So we've got a robust pipeline. We've got great new products like Isoclast and Arylex and Zorvec, which are continuing to accelerate their growth pattern. We continue to get new registrations. Literally every month, we're getting new registrations and so new products will be a very important part of our 2022 plan."

Like it's probably very small for the initial growing season. But I was wondering if you look 2 or 3 years out, how many acres do you think you might achieve? 
And secondly, I was wondering that kind of also like one more time, ask you the cost price issue for 2022. So in general, like the outlook that you have for 2022, that to me doesn't look that strenuous. Like if you can have, whether it's a 3% or 4% or 5% price increases on sales of $15.5 billion, like that should offset more or all of your costs. And so having EBITDA growth in 2022 shouldn't be that difficult despite all of the cost headwinds. Or do you see it different than that? Because I feel much more optimistic than I hear in your voice."

So obviously, we were very excited in August when we were able to announce that we received authorization from the European Union that enabled grain from Conkesta E3 to be exported for food and seed use. So as a result, we have a limited launch of Conkesta E3 right now in Brazil. Farmers are able to plant product for the 2021-'22 season. So it's an important step forward. 
What I would reinforce, though, is that it's really not a meaningful financial impact as we look at '21 or '22 as we're working on ramping up production, building out our lineup and ultimately, we've got to go out there and gain customer support and drive adoption of the technology. So over time, no doubt this technology is going to drive incremental growth for us. It's going to greatly enhance our competitive position in the Latin American soybean market, which is important for us. And we're excited to bring new choice to the marketplace, and the marketplace is excited to have a new choice in terms of technology as well. 
So -- and then over time, we're also going to introduce this in other markets, such as Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. So it is something very important. We have not sized what we see the adoption rate as at this point in time, but I understand it's a limited launch, and it really is about establishing that technology and gaining support from our customers."

So this is Dave. I'll take the second part of that related to 2022. As you said, and Chuck really, I think, articulated it well, it's a really constructive setup when you look at 2022 with the backdrop of our markets and the strength of what we're bringing -- continue to bring to the market. And as you said, on price, we continue to execute against our strategy of pricing. Both Rajan and Tim have spoken about that and spoken to some of the specifics. And again, specifically for 2022 related to Seed, we expect global pricing to be accretive to earnings after the impact of higher cost of goods sold. And by the way, again, just to emphasize, we've increased that seed cost of goods sold in the range of $250 million to $300 million now. So that's very important. 
And on crop, we expect to continue the momentum we've seen in 2021. But very importantly, there's 2 really important things here. Number one is the market-driven inflation and logistics costs. Again, I'm going to just underscore that that we anticipate to be at least $150 million. And we've seen this progression over the course of 2021, obviously. And we expect supply chain challenges to continue just to underscore that through 2022. So these are -- some of what we see is sort of the balance against that constructive backdrop and the strength of what we're bringing to the marketplace and our ability to continue to drive, if you will, value pricing in the marketplace. So we're going to get into those details.  
As I said, when we release our fourth quarter earnings, 2021, we'll provide more specific guide, but it's really, call it down the middle there in terms of the set of positives and constructive setup, what we're bringing to the table and then this, if you will, inflation impacts that we're seeing in the very dynamic nature of that. So we appreciate your question and look forward to that update when we can provide more details."

And where we're sitting right now is -- I would characterize this as kind of the middle part of our booking season in North America. We go out and see customers, call it, September 1, more or less, is when we begin to move in the marketplace. And that booking period really extends through the end of the calendar year. And so we will expect by that time to have the majority, nearly all of our order position in place by the end of the year. So we're sort of in that middle position right now. And I'd say that orders are tracking well with where we would expect to be right now for both corn and soybeans. 
In terms of technology shifts, if anything, I would say that Enlist E3 demand on the Pioneer side is running a little bit stronger than maybe what we had originally planned as we came into the year. 
In terms of the acre mix between corn and soy, I think it's very preliminary and way too early to make a call based off of our orders right now. Customers are going to go through the next several months and really have to figure out on an individual basis what their crop mix will be. And Dave made the comments about where we see the market going into next year, roughly that 180 million planted acres between corn and soy in the U.S. that's there. 
And right now, when you look at the corn/soy ratio, it's about 2:7, which isn't so -- which is actually pretty neutral, I'd say, on a year-over-year basis, but it feels like the economics are saying that we could trend a little bit more towards soybeans in terms of that 180 mix in last year. Can't call it off the order position. I'd say the corn technology mix is consistent with what we would expect it to be. 
Farmers have been planting high-technology seeds and continue to want to do that. And really, I'd say where we sit today really supports what Chuck and Dave have already talked about in terms of our setup for '22 in terms of good, healthy markets, and also very strong demand for our technologies."

It really comes down to where we sit in those local markets. And again, we are dealing in very competitive markets. And actually, on a year-to-date basis, APAC is not flat. They're more like 2% year-to-date. So we do have some growth there as well. 
So I would say it's the markets themselves, it's the timing of when we would have executed the sale. And of course, that is very dynamic. Latin America is certainly more weighted towards the second half of the year, and we would have taken more pricing actions, I would say, to help mitigate some of the inflationary pressures that we've seen as the year developed and been able to realize that from a LATAM standpoint. But I wouldn't say it's only because of the product mix or anything like that. I think it could be timing and then that local competitive situation that you're facing in those markets."

And as we think about our own germplasm, we've got a very strong pipeline of new products coming through. Most of them are going to start hitting in '23, '24, but we are going to start making an impact in 2022. So the germplasm is going to continue to grow within the Corteva germplasm as the trade gets integrated into our own portfolio. 
That said, I think the overall adoption is going to be higher than what we had said in 2021. As you know, we had expected about 30%, and we grew to more than 35%. And looking at the 2022 setup, we continue to see that continuing to grow. 
Some of the challenges that we have had in the South with Dicamba continues to be a challenge. But when we look at the Enlist herbicide performance, I think we continue to get encouraged there. The South is lagging in terms of adoption. But as we continue to work on the different varieties, how they are available, and we talk about the Dicamba challenges, I'm very optimistic that we'll be able to make some progress there, too. 
The bigger issue in the South, as I'm sure you're familiar, Michael, is more about the entrenched Dicamba capabilities that are there. And as we work through some of those things, I think we will get to where we need to relate it to the listed option."
