I'd like to welcome everyone to our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. Most importantly, I hope you and your loved ones are remaining safe and healthy.

Most importantly, I hope you and your loved ones are remaining safe and healthy. 
Now let me provide some comments to supplement the detailed financial results we released last evening. For the fourth quarter, our net sales were about $3.8 billion and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.59. Driven by strong year-over-year sales growth in our Industrial Coatings reporting segment, we delivered record adjusted earnings per diluted share for a second consecutive quarter, increasing by more than 20% from prior year. 
In addition, our Global Architectural Coatings businesses continue to perform exceptionally well, eclipsing prior fourth quarter sales and earnings records in most countries. We also delivered the second consecutive quarter of double-digit organic growth for our European Architectural business. Our Global Architectural sales were also supported by ongoing advancement of our digital capabilities. 
In 2020, our global digital sales in the Architectural business were up by more than 60%, and we will continue to invest in prioritizing these digital initiatives. We coupled these organic growth improvements with strong cost management and delivered PPG aggregate segment margins that were about 160 basis points higher than the prior year fourth quarter. The higher margins were achieved with about 30% of our businesses continued to face significant demand headwinds, most notably the automotive refinish and aerospace coatings businesses as the pandemic continues to impact areas of travel and mobility. 
During the fourth quarter, sales in our China automotive OEM and general industrial businesses well outpaced industry demand with both businesses growing nearly 20% on a year-over-year basis. In auto OEM, we were significantly above industry production rates. Our strong footprint, advantaged technology and service capabilities continued to serve us well in China, where economic growth is the most robust. In addition, sales in our European and Latin American regions returned to year-over-year growth during the quarter. And in the U.S. region, while still lower than the prior year due to the Aerospace Coatings business, overall sales improved throughout the quarter. 
We delivered more cost savings during the quarter with about $40 million of interim cost savings and we also delivered an additional $40 million of structural cost savings. Our interim cost savings were lower than the $90 million we achieved in the third quarter as we incurred certain costs to support the sales improvement in several of our end-use markets. We will maintain about $25 million of these interim cost savings in the first quarter and expect to make at least $80 million of permanent cost savings for the full year 2021. 
Our teams did an excellent job managing working capital and cash uses in 2020, which allowed us to achieve a record $2.1 billion of operating cash flow for the year. Our businesses reduced operating working capital as a percent of sales by about 100 basis points in 2020. This outstanding performance was 1 key factor in allowing us to fund the Ennis-Flint acquisition entirely with cash on hand during the month of December. In addition to completing the Ennis-Flint acquisition, we recently announced some other strategic acquisitions. Each of these companies brings incremental benefits to PPG that will lead to further shareholder value creation. 
Looking ahead to the first quarter, there are a few challenges, including more restrictive shutdowns in certain countries and supply chain issues in certain end-use markets that will likely cause some short-term coatings demand disruptions. We're also experiencing elevation of costs, particularly raw materials and logistics costs. While these issues create some uncertainties in the first quarter, we continue to be optimistic about the first half of 2021 as underlying coatings demand and economic activity in several of our end-use markets is expected to remain robust, including the automotive OEM, general industrial, packaging and architectural businesses. 
We also remain confident of achieving further selling price increases in the first quarter in the Performance Coatings reporting segment and have started to pursue selling price increases in the Industrial Coatings reporting segment, which will be realized as the year progresses. For the company, aggregate sales volumes are projected to be flat to up a low single-digit percentage in the first quarter with differences by business and region. As we progress through 2021, we anticipate multiple catalysts that will help drive further sales and earnings growth, including an eventual restock benefit as low inventory levels remain in several of our end-use markets. 
Second, we are well positioned to benefit from the ultimate recovery in the automotive refinish and aerospace coatings end-use markets as congestion and air travel increases with our world-class product and customer service capabilities. In addition, our acquisitions will start to provide accretive benefit as the year progresses. These incremental benefits will supplement the organic growth that we anticipate in our other core businesses as we continue to support our customers with excellent services and technology advantaged products. 
For the quarter, we project adjusted earnings per diluted share to increase by more than 20% on a year-over-year basis, continuing our strong earnings momentum. Our near-term cash deployment priority will be to complete the acquisitions we have announced, which we anticipate to be funded by a combination of cash on hand and debt by the end of the second quarter. We then intend to primarily use our free cash flow generation to pay down debt from these acquisitions and reposition our balance sheet for future industry consolidation. 
As it relates to our recently announced acquisition agreements, let me make a few comments about Tikkurila. From a strategic perspective, this remains an extremely complementary business to PPG. We don't expect any significant Antitrust issues and are confident that we will be able to keep the entire business intact. And equally important, we will not need to disrupt PPG's legacy businesses or our customers in the region. Keeping the Tikkurila team together as 1 unit is not only the best stakeholder outcome but will ensure a fast start on synergy capture. 
From a strict acquisition integration execution perspective, we believe that our offer is compelling for all stakeholders and it has the benefit of the due diligence we've already conducted. We conducted the due diligence efficiently and work closely and cooperatively with Tikkurila to resolve to the satisfaction of both parties some commercial issues that arose in a due diligence process. We believe that these commercial issues, in addition to the regulatory landscape, place PPG in the most favorable situation to acquire Tikkurila from a business continuity and return -- project return perspective. 
Additionally, we are expecting substantial cost synergies supplemented by incremental sales synergies, which we're able to fully vet in the due diligence analysis. This includes the fact that our holistic European operations are well established and stable and would result in very little disruption from this transaction. We also have a very well established regional shared service center in Eastern Europe that has been in existence for many years and has integrated many of our prior acquisitions, which will enable us to more seamlessly and more quickly integrate an acquisition of this size. 
Finally, we will continue to analyze this with our traditional thoughtfulness and historical discipline. On a post-synergy basis, this remains an excellent value creation opportunity for our shareholders. Lastly, as we hear from our customers and investors consistently, there is 0 doubt that our sustainability initiatives are far ahead of any coatings company as PPG technology is enabling the conversion from the internal combustion engine to electric and autonomous vehicles in addition to our many other initiatives. [indiscernible] this transaction is from a process perspective, that is we are currently in an open tender offer period, and Tikkurila's Board has received a nonbinding competing bid. We will not be able to answer any questions on this matter during the call. 
In closing, I want to thank and recognize our global PPG team, our company's true character has been showcased during these times of adversity. I am proud of how the PPG team has responded with great resiliency in continuing to serve our customers, our communities and one another and has truly lived The PPG Way. Our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results are a true testimony of our company's capabilities and allow us to enter 2021 as an even stronger company. 
Thank you for your continued confidence in PPG. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now Amy, would you please open the line for questions."

So again, it would be hard to give you a specific number as it relates to 2021. As I think it's well chronicled, most coatings acquisitions have kind of mid-single-digit synergies as a starting target. Some have more, some have less, depending upon their overlap, geographic overlap, product overlap. 
So again, as we close them, be rest assured that we'll provide more detail individually per acquisition."

And if you look at that momentum by each of those segments, every one of them was significantly more positive in 4Q than 3Q. And each one of them are anticipating being more positive in 1Q versus 4Q. So from that standpoint, we're excited. 
Obviously, permitting for new homes construction is not going quite as fast as they wanted challenges on the multifamily side as well. So most of our large painters are feeling very comfortable coming into 2021. And then when we flip over into Europe, without a doubt, we're still having very strong. You saw we had double-digit growth in the fourth quarter through the first 21 days of January. It's a continuation of that trend as well. And then when you flip down into Mexico, we had an exceptionally strong quarter. The economy in Mexico, GDP is minus 7% and 8%. And yet we performed at plus 10%. And we see that same momentum carrying into January. 
The sell-out from our concessionaires is strong. Their liquidity is very good and so I'm very positive about what we're seeing in our global architectural business."

And so raw materials were higher, especially when you think about China, that's a much more spot kind of purchasing environment over there because that's their tradition. So we saw -- we have already announced our price increases in Europe. We've started to announce price increases in other regions in the world. We are well ahead of 2017. 
If you remember, 2017, some of our peers were distracted because of either acquisitions or fears. And so we were we are well ahead of that. And so I'm very comfortable that you're going to continue to see price -- positive price. We've had 15 quarters in a row of positive price. You're going to see the 16th quarter of positive price for the company in Q1. And so I'm not worried about the low single-digit inflation that we're anticipating."

In fact, we got an emergency call a couple of days ago from 1 of our large automotive customers that their whole paint shop was shut down because of COVID and could we bring our people in to run it in the interim. So we, of course, supported them all on that. 
There is the semiconductor issue that's out there in the automotive space. They all want to run. Many of our customers ran over Christmas, which was quite unusual. So demand is there. And inventories in many of these spaces are quite low, whether you're thinking about appliances or coil or automotive. There's low inventories. So we feel very comfortable.

Their weighting in -- traditional Q4 is much higher. So in 2019, it would have been much higher, 2018 would have been much higher as a percent of the total segment. So even though we had good architectural demand in sales in Q4, the fact that, that weighting of aerospace and refinish is a heavier in Q4 had a bigger impact on the Q4 margins."

Just to give you a point of reference, David. You typically see about 1 million car drop-off in global auto production from Q4 to Q1. We're expecting 2 main cars globally, excluding Japan. 2 million cars globally drop off from Q4 to Q1. And that same type of pattern exists in some industrial businesses.

I think we had a dozen or so recent examples. I think it was May of 2019 we put that out 2018. What you'll find is the return on capital for not only PPG, but the coatings industry and the IRR for these transactions is typically well in excess of our cost of capital and certainly in excess of a share repurchase, and it's really driven by the fact that these are typically very highly synergistic transactions. A lot of those synergies come with no cash out the door on behalf of the buyer. So you get a very good return, and these are typically low-risk because we're typically not acquiring a lot of assets. 
As you're well aware, Arun, the coatings industry is asset light. So we're typically acquiring very few assets with a lot of synergy potential. And we at PPG have been very good at extracting those synergies very early. And we've done 50 or 60 acquisitions in the past 10 years. And those acquisition time lines are typically less than 24 months where we're able to extract all of those synergies, again, very, very -- with very few cash out the door.

Now this company from Europe apparently also wants to stop buybacks and do some acquisitions or they're planning to, at least. So do you feel that in the next sort of coming quarter and year, as more coatings companies are looking for inorganic growth, multiple of -- the average multiple in the industry is going to sort of peak up and, therefore, return profile on the acquisition pipeline may actually go down? Or do you think this is on a case-by-case basis and therefore, it doesn't concern you? 
And then the second question really is around your Performance Coatings business. From my point of view, it was a phenomenal year, 2020, given aero and refinish was down that you guys almost ended year flat. So just curious, has structural profitability in DIY Europe, U.S. and Mexico improved, and you can keep it there? Or was it a bit inflated because of these interim cost savings that you had, and therefore, I shouldn't get carried away?"

The returns in acquisitions are really unique to that acquisition and who you compete with is really unique in that space as well. So there's no right or wrong answer. The general theme is that for -- the higher the risk, the higher the return needs to be. And so -- and the more unknowns, the higher the returns need to be to cover that. So I would say it just varies considerably, and there's no right or wrong answer, except we know that discipline is always the right answer. 
From a performance standpoint, I do think we have lower structural costs going forward. And I do think, like Vince mentioned earlier, the ability to this additional volume when it comes in, it really leverages itself to a nice return on the bottom line. And I think that's going to continue."

Most importantly, I hope you and your loved ones are remaining safe and healthy.  
Now let me provide some comments to supplement the detailed financial results we released last evening. For the fourth quarter, our net sales were about $3.8 billion and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.59. Driven by strong year-over-year sales growth in our Industrial Coatings reporting segment, we delivered record adjusted earnings per diluted share for a second consecutive quarter, increasing by more than 20% from prior year.  
In addition, our global architectural coatings businesses continue to perform exceptionally well, eclipsing prior fourth quarter sales and earnings records in most countries. We also delivered the second consecutive quarter of double-digit organic growth for our European architectural business. Our Global architectural sales were also supported by ongoing advancement of our digital capabilities.  
In 2020, our global digital sales in the architectural business were up by more than 60%, and we will continue to invest in prioritizing these digital initiatives. We couple these organic growth improvements with strong cost management and delivered PPG aggregate segment margins that were about 160 basis points higher than the prior year fourth quarter. The higher margins were achieved with about 30% of our businesses continued to face significant demand headwinds, most notably the automotive refinish and aerospace coatings businesses, as the pandemic continues to impact areas of travel and mobility.  
During the fourth quarter, sales in our China automotive OEM and general industrial businesses well outpaced industry demand with both businesses growing nearly 20% on a year-over-year basis. In auto OEM, we were significantly above industry production rates. Our strong footprint, advantaged technology and service capabilities continued to serve us well in China, where economic growth is the most robust. In addition, sales in our European and Latin American regions returned to year-over-year growth during the quarter. And in the U.S. region, while still lower than the prior year due to the aerospace coatings business, overall sales improved throughout the quarter.  
We delivered more cost savings during the quarter with about $40 million of interim cost savings, and we also delivered an additional $40 million of structural cost savings. Our interim cost savings were lower than the $90 million we achieved in the third quarter as we incurred certain costs to support the sales improvement in several of our end-use markets. We will maintain about $25 million of these interim cost savings in the first quarter and expect to make at least $80 million of permanent cost savings for the full year 2021.  
Our teams did an excellent job managing working capital and cash uses in 2020, which allowed us to achieve a record $2.1 billion of operating cash flow for the year. Our businesses reduced operating working capital as a percent of sales by about 100 basis points in 2020. This outstanding performance was 1 key factor in allowing us to fund the Ennis-Flint acquisition entirely with cash on hand during the month of December. In addition to completing the Ennis-Flint acquisition, we recently announced some other strategic acquisitions. Each of these companies brings incremental benefits to PPG that will lead to further shareholder value creation.  
Looking ahead to the first quarter, there are a few challenges, including more restrictive shutdowns in certain countries and supply chain issues in certain end-use markets that will likely cause some short-term coatings demand disruptions. We're also experiencing elevation of costs, particularly raw materials and logistics costs. While these issues create some uncertainties in the first quarter, we continue to be optimistic about the first half of 2021 as underlying coatings demand and economic activity in several of our end-use markets is expected to remain robust, including the automotive OEM, general industrial, packaging and architectural businesses.  
We also remain confident of achieving further selling price increases in the first quarter in the Performance Coatings reporting segment and have started to pursue selling price increases in the Industrial Coatings reporting segment, which will be realized as the year progresses. For the company, aggregate sales volumes are projected to be flat to up a low single-digit percentage in the first quarter with differences by business and region. 
As we progress through 2021, we anticipate multiple catalysts that will help drive further sales and earnings growth, including an eventual restock benefit as low inventory levels remain in several of our end-use markets. Second, we are well positioned to benefit from the ultimate recovery in the automotive refinish and aerospace coatings end-use markets as congestion and air travel increases with our world-class product and customer service capabilities. In addition, our acquisitions will start to provide accretive benefit as the year progresses. These incremental benefits will supplement the organic growth that we anticipate in our other core businesses as we continue to support our customers with excellent services and technology-advantaged products.  
For the quarter, we project adjusted earnings per diluted share to increase by more than 20% on a year-over-year basis, continuing our strong earnings momentum. Our near-term cash deployment priority will be to complete the acquisitions we have announced, which we anticipate to be funded by a combination of cash on hand and debt by the end of the second quarter. We then intend to primarily use our free cash flow generation to pay down debt from these acquisitions and reposition our balance sheet for future industry consolidation.  
As it relates to our recently announced acquisition agreements, let me make a few comments about Tikkurila. From a strategic perspective, this remains an extremely complementary business to PPG. We don't expect any significant antitrust issues and are confident that we will be able to keep the entire business intact. And equally important, we will not need to disrupt PPG's legacy businesses or our customers in the region. Keeping the Tikkurila team together as one unit is not only the best stakeholder outcome, but will ensure a fast start on synergy capture.  
From a strict acquisition integration execution perspective, we believe that our offer is compelling for all stakeholders and it has the benefit of the due diligence we've already conducted. We conducted the due diligence efficiently and worked closely and cooperatively with Tikkurila to resolve to the satisfaction of both parties some commercial issues that arose in the due diligence process. We believe that these commercial issues, in addition to the regulatory landscape, place PPG in the most favorable situation to acquire Tikkurila from a business continuity and return -- project return perspective.  
Additionally, we are expecting substantial cost synergies supplemented by incremental sales synergies which we were able to fully vet in the due diligence analysis. This includes the fact that our holistic European operations are well established and stable and would result in very little disruption from this transaction. We also have a very well established regional shared service center in Eastern Europe that has been in existence for many years and has integrated many of our prior acquisitions, which will enable us to more seamlessly and more quickly integrate an acquisition of this size.  
Finally, we will continue to analyze this with our traditional thoughtfulness and historical discipline. On a post-synergy basis, this remains an excellent value creation opportunity for our shareholders. 
Lastly, as we hear from our customers and investors consistently, there is 0 doubt that our sustainability initiatives are far ahead of any coatings company as PPG technology is enabling the conversion from the internal combustion engine to electric and autonomous vehicles in addition to our many other initiatives. Due to where this transaction is from a process perspective, that is, we are currently in an open tender offer period and Tikkurila's Board has received a nonbinding competing bid, we will not be able to answer any questions on this matter during the call.  
In closing, I want to thank and recognize our global PPG team. Our company's true character has been showcased during these times of adversity. I am proud of how the PPG team has responded with great resiliency in continuing to serve our customers, our communities and one another and has truly lived the PPG way. Our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results are a true testimony of our company's capabilities and allow us to enter 2021 as an even stronger company.  
Thank you for your continued confidence in PPG. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now Amy, would you please open the line for questions."

And if you look at that momentum by each of those segments, every one of them was significantly more positive in 4Q than 3Q. And each one of them are anticipating being more positive in 1Q versus 4Q. So from that standpoint, we're excited. 
Obviously, permitting for new homes construction is not going quite as fast as they wanted, challenges on the multifamily side as well. So most of our large painters are feeling very comfortable coming into 2021. And then when we flip over into Europe, without a doubt, we're still having -- very strong. You saw we had double-digit growth in the fourth quarter. Through the first 21 days of January, it's a continuation of that trend as well. And then when you flip down into Mexico, we had an exceptionally strong quarter. The economy in Mexico, GDP is minus 7% and 8%. And yet we performed at plus 10%. And we see that same momentum carrying into January. The sell-out from our concessionaires is strong. Their liquidity is very good.

And so raw materials were higher, especially when you think about China, that's a much more spot kind of purchasing environment over there because that's their tradition. So we saw -- we have already announced our price increases in Europe. 
We've started to announce price increases in other regions in the world. We are well ahead of 2017. If you remember, 2017, some of our peers were distracted because of either acquisitions or fears. And so we are well ahead of that. And so I'm very comfortable that you're going to continue to see price -- positive price. We've had 15 quarters in a row of positive price. You're going to see the 16th quarter of positive price for the company in Q1. And so I'm not worried about the low single-digit inflation that we're anticipating."

A number of our customers are having significant issues with labor because of the COVID pandemic. In fact, we got an emergency call a couple of days ago from 1 of our large automotive customers that their whole paint shop was shut down because of COVID, and could we bring our people in to run it in the interim. So we of course supported them all on that. 
There is the semiconductor issue that's out there in the automotive space. They all want to run. Many of our customers ran over Christmas, which was quite unusual. So demand is there, and inventories in many of these spaces are quite low. Whether you're thinking about appliances, of coil or automotive there's low inventories. So we feel very comfortable.

It really relates to the weightings of the businesses that are in there. The 2 most impacted businesses, as Michael referenced in the opening comments, that we're seeing from a volume perspective, are aerospace and refinish. Those are typically our most stable businesses throughout the year, quarter-to-quarter. Their demand trends don't significantly change by quarter. The other businesses in Performance Coatings, such as architecture, were very seasonal. 
So while we were down 30% in aerospace in Q3 and a similar amount in Q4, same with refinish, their weighting in -- traditional Q4 is much higher. So in 2019, it would have been much higher, 2018 would have been much higher as a percent of the total segment. So even though we had good architectural demand in sales in Q4, the fact that, that weighting of aerospace and refinish is a heavier in Q4 had a bigger impact on the Q4 margins."

So the car park is continuing to grow. 
And as you know, any kind of autonomous, a lot of these safety features, they're mostly in the developed countries. Those things are too expensive to put on cars in a lot of these other countries. So we don't have to worry about that as much. 
The other thing I would tell you is that in the fourth quarter, we -- every time we saw the economy loosen up and the work from home restrictions loosen, we saw, especially in Europe, congestion come up rather quickly because as you know, the houses are much smaller in Europe and people -- it's much more difficult to work from home there. So congestion rebounded very quickly. Our refinish in the fourth quarter was minus, let's call it minus 10-ish, but claims were down minus 20%. So we've made some significant improvements in that business because of the pandemic. And so I think you should feel -- your clients should feel comfortable that we have this well in hand."

But more importantly, aerospace. We see our orders dropping. I mean, I won't get into the various subsegments, how much we break it down into subsegments. But I had one in the fourth quarter that we only got 6% of our normal orders in the fourth quarter. Now clearly, the industry is running much higher than that. So they continue to destock at a significant rate. That's going to have to build up. 
So we're thinking about how do we ensure that we're ready for that restock that will be coming in aerospace, and that will be significant. And I'm thinking that people are going to start doing that, probably starting in the back half of Q2 and then it will start to accelerate. 
You probably saw the announcement from Airbus today that they are increasing their build rate for the A320. That's the first sign. And there will be other signs, I think, you should anticipate.

I think we had a dozen or so recent examples. I think it was May of 2019 we put that out or 2018. What you'll find is the return on capital for not only PPG, but the coatings industry and the IRR for these transactions is typically well in excess of our cost of capital and certainly in excess of a share repurchase. 
And it's really driven by the fact that these are typically very highly synergistic transactions. A lot of those synergies come with no cash out the door on behalf of the buyer. So you get a very good return, and these are typically low-risk because we're typically not acquiring a lot of assets. As you're well aware, Arun, the coatings industry is asset-light. So we're typically acquiring very few assets with a lot of synergy potential. And we at PPG have been very good at extracting those synergies very early. 
And we've done 50 or 60 acquisitions in the past 10 years. And those acquisition time lines are typically less than 24 months where we're able to extract all of those synergies, again, very, very -- with very few cash out the door.

And then the second question really is around your Performance Coatings business. From my point of view, it was a phenomenal year, 2020, given aero and refinish was down, that you guys almost ended year flat.

But most importantly, I hope you and your loved ones are remaining safe and healthy. 
Now let me provide some comments to supplement the detailed financial results we released last evening. For the first quarter, our net sales were a record and were about $3.9 billion. And our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were also a record at $1.88. 
Our adjusted EPS was significantly higher than the first quarter of 2020 partially due to last year's first quarter was impacted by various pandemic-related impacts. We will also be comparing various financial metrics versus prepandemic results, and this comparison was nearly equally impressive with adjusted EPS 27% higher than the pre-COVID first quarter results of 2019. This excellent operating performance was driven by strong year-over-year sales growth in our Industrial Coatings reporting segment with the automotive OEM, general industrial and packaging coatings businesses all delivering double-digit percentage year-over-year sales growth. 
Our global architectural coatings business continued their strong sales growth trends. And automotive refinish had a strong quarter as activity in that end-use market is beginning to recover, and we were partially aided by some customer restocking in the U.S. 
First quarter segment margins were at a multiyear high as we benefited from strong operating margin leverage on higher year-over-year net sales growth. The significant amount of cost savings we have achieved in the past 2 years from our restructuring programs is a primary factor contributing to us realizing this increased leverage. We delivered these outstanding results despite sales volumes not fully returning to prepandemic levels, including in several key PPG businesses such as aerospace. 
In addition, we experienced a significant acceleration of raw material and logistics cost inflation during the quarter. Coming into the year, we were expecting an inflationary environment and had prioritized selling price increases across all of our businesses. This has helped us achieve solid price increases year-to-date. With a higher inflation backdrop, we have already secured further selling price increases and are in the process of executing additional ones during the second quarter. 
As a reminder, first quarter of 2021 was our 16th consecutive quarter of higher selling prices. We also continue to execute on our cost-savings programs, realizing an incremental $35 million of structural savings and maintain our target of $125 million of total savings for the full year 2021. 
In addition, we retained about $30 million of interim cost savings during the quarter and remain confident that we'll be able to make at least $80 million of these interim cost savings permanent for the full year 2021. 
We ended the first quarter with about $1.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents. This is a gross-up cash balance as we are preparing for the closing of the Tikkurila and WÃ¶rwag acquisitions. Contributing to this strong cash balance is a 200 basis point year-over-year improvement in our operating working capital in the first quarter, which drove better operating cash generation than a typical first quarter. 
Our new Traffic Solutions business, which is the Ennis-Flint acquisition, performed to our expectations in the quarter despite significant challenges with weather and raw material availability. The business has a strong order book heading into the second quarter. In the first quarter, we also completed the VersaFlex acquisition. And the Tikkurila and WÃ¶rwag acquisitions are expected to be completed in the second quarter. 
In the accompanying presentation to our earnings material, we included several slides to provide further information and perspective on our 4 recent acquisitions and our performance for a number of acquisitions. Some items that I'd like to highlight. Each of the 4 acquisitions bring incremental strategic benefits to PPG, such as product line extensions and geographic expansions. We've continued to deliver strong synergy capture from our past acquisitions and believe our global breadth, regional participation in all coating verticals, best-in-class procurement and mature back-office centers of excellence in low-cost areas allow us to deliver higher synergy capabilities than our competitors. 
For our recently announced acquisitions, we expect to realize synergies of high single digit of sales, higher than historical industry synergy capture. We also provided an update to our acquisition performance we last shared in May 2019. We included our 10 most recent acquisitions that have been closed for at least 24 months. In most acquisitions and in aggregate, we have achieved higher synergy capture than our initial estimates, average about 50 basis points higher. All of these acquisitions will help drive shareholder value creation. The post-synergy multiples for each of these acquisitions is below PPG's 5-year average multiple. And for 8 of the acquisitions, the post-synergy multiple is below 10. 
All 4 of the recently announced acquisitions provide earnings accretion from their historical base business and synergy realization. By the end of 2022, we expect cumulative synergies to total about $75 million and will be at an annual run rate of $135 million once they were all fully integrated. 
As with many of our initial synergy projections, these initial targets only include a modest benefit from sales synergies, although these acquisitions are well suited for us to drive further top line growth. We expect the Tikkurila acquisition to be completed in the second quarter. We recently extended the tender offer period until May 11 to finalize customary regulatory approvals. Tikkurila is a highly strategic acquisition with leading architecture coatings positions across various countries. As I said in January, I see many similar characteristics to our previous Comex acquisition. We'll have significant opportunities to cross-sell complementary products through our legacy channels to further grow sales and earnings. Our Comex acquisition has well exceeded our initial acquisition economics. 
Moving to our current outlook. We are continuing to see very robust and broad-based demand globally, including in many industrial and OEM end-use markets and continued architectural coatings activity. Many of our customers have indicated they have strong order books, and we anticipate this global -- strong global demand pattern to continue well into the second half of 2021 at a minimum. 
In addition, we expect an eventual restocking of inventory to occur in many of our selling channels as the year progresses. One important item to note is some of our customers are experiencing input or component shortages, so their production capabilities and schedules remain choppy, and we are experiencing a few spot outages of direct coatings raw materials. As a result, we expect some unfavorable sales impacts from both our direct supply chain disruptions and these production curtailments at some of our customers. Our best current estimate is that sales are expected to be impacted by about $70 million to $90 million in the second quarter due to these issues. We expect these sales to be deferred in the second half of 2021, and thus, this impact is already included in our second quarter 2021 financial guidance. 
Also, as I mentioned previously, we're experiencing commodity inflation that occurred quickly due to the weather event named Uri. As a result of this rapid inflation increase in both raw materials and logistics, we have fully mobilized our commercial teams and are successfully securing additional selling price increases. We have a very good head start on this inflation cycle, and we expect to fully offset raw material cost inflation in the second half of 2021. 
Finally, as you've come to expect from PPG, we remain committed to strong and realtime cost management, which will provide continued strong operating leverage on sales growth. These current disruptions are temporary. And we maintain a positive view on the overall global coatings demand growth, which continues to be robust and broad-based across most of the end-use markets that we supply. This is expected to continue throughout 2021. The strong demand conditions, along with our leading technology advantaged products, provides us with many organic growth opportunities in 2021 and beyond. 
For the company, aggregate sales volumes are projected to be up by low teen percentage in the second quarter on a sequential basis compared to the first quarter of 2021 with differences by business and region. Adjusted earnings, excluding amortization expense, is expected to be between $2.15 to $2.20, continuing a strong earnings momentum. As a reminder, this guidance does not include any EPS impact from either the Tikkurila or WÃ¶rwag acquisitions. Our near-term cash deployment priority will be to complete the acquisitions we have announced, which we anticipate to be funded by a combination of cash on hand and debt by the end of the second quarter. 
In closing, I want to thank and recognize our global PPG team. The character of our employees has never shone brighter than it has during these times of adversity. Our people have shown great resiliency, continuing to serve our customers, our communities and drive a common purpose to protect and beautify the world.

And we had 1.7% positive price in Q1, and we expect to have more positive price in Q2. So it's probably a little bit early to say how much we need to get, but we're working hard at it. And what I'm most encouraged by is that every coatings business in PPG had positive price, including our automotive business, and we're on track for every coatings business to have positive price in Q2."

And related to that, I read a new paradigm for the coatings industry, whereby pricing will more quickly align with raw material cost volatility, including when costs start to decline at some point? I guess I'm asking because historically, the industry has been very good about maintaining pricing even as rate costs have moderated post previous peaks."

And so we had put our teams on high alert to get pricing early in the year. 
And the second thing is we're trying to do a better job of surgical price increases as well as value selling, so as we roll out new products to capture that additional value. And we're doing a better job, I think, on services. During the pandemic, it was clear how much our customers valued our ability to help them get their lines up and running. And I think we're doing a better job of capturing value for those services. 
So I think each of those things is important. Clearly, as the freeze happened, it wasn't any shock to anybody at PPG that this was going to lead to additional raw material inflation. And so we immediately, as we saw Texas going into a deep freeze, all our sales teams on high alert that they need to start talking to their customers immediately about raw material inflation. 
I think one of the things that's different, if you remember 2017 and '18, there are -- some of our competitors were distracted. You had the Valspar acquisition being completed. Valspar wasn't raising price. And Akso is under a lot of pressure. They were not doing anything that were going after value. This is so clear and obvious that I think everybody is more on top of this. Hopefully, This will be a trend to be on top of raw material inflation as a regular ongoing business practice. So I would just tell you, I'm confident that our teams are proactively addressing this."

There are a few in the ones completed. Michael mentioned Comex where we do have further top line synergies than traditional.

So from that standpoint, I would say the volumes that we're projecting for 2Q are still at or slightly below the 2Q of 2019, and that's primarily driven by aerospace. So what I'm encouraged about, Frank, to be honest, is that January and February for aerospace was still pretty mediocre. But March was pretty encouraging. And we know that the aerospace guys have completely depleted inventory. I mean they have virtually nothing in the chain. So at some point, as things get better, they're going to start ordering and that will start to be a positive. We haven't seen that yet. We do track it on a very regular basis, as you can imagine. But I was encouraged by March, and the MRO sales have continued to tick up in April here. Now we expect OEM aerospace to be flat because that's not going to change anytime soon. But the MRO side will be better. So we have military still doing well. MRO is starting to improve. So you should regard that as a real positive."

They do have the chip shortages. The automotive guys also have plastic shortages. They had seat shortages. So they are really struggling right now. But we expect it to loosen up and get better.

Our industrial segment, so you think whether that's coil or heavy-duty equipment or any of these other segments in there, they continue to do very well as also. Packaging, we see no slowdown in the packaging momentum. In fact, if you look at the number of new packaging plants, 10 plants that come in, in the second half of the year, that should be all good as well. Again, I talked about it earlier, architectural, we've seen no slowdown in the DIY.

We have more share on the transparency. We have more share on the winglet transparencies. So we feel good about that. 
From the commercial side, to be quite honest, our visibility is quite limited because we've never had planes sit on the ground for a year. And so the MRO, how they were put into storage and how they come out of storage is still somewhat of an unknown. What checks they're going to do before they put them into storage is still somewhat of an unknown. So what we do see is that the MRO activity for our aerospace business is picking up. We are getting -- what's interesting is when they put -- when some of the planes are giving back to the lease source, they have to paint them white. So we have been getting some of those white paint sales. And of course, when they come back out of the lease source, they're going to be rebranded again, so they'll be repainted again. So as that happens, that will be a positive for us. 
Your question on infrastructure. I would tell you that we touch a lot of things in the infrastructure, whether that's the road markings that will be needed, whether that's the bridges that will need to be painted. If they support the building and trades industry, that will require protective coatings. So I would say for PPG, any infrastructure will be regarded as a positive."

I would like to welcome everyone to our first quarter 2021 earnings call. But most importantly, I hope you and your loved ones are remaining safe and healthy.

But most importantly, I hope you and your loved ones are remaining safe and healthy. 
Now let me provide some comments to supplement the detailed financial results we released last evening. For the first quarter, our net sales were a record and were about $3.9 billion. And our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were also a record at $1.88. 
Our adjusted EPS was significantly higher than the first quarter of 2020, partially due to last year's first quarter being impacted by various pandemic-related impacts. We will also be comparing various financial metrics versus pre-pandemic results, and this comparison was nearly equally impressive with adjusted EPS 27% higher than the pre-COVID first quarter results of 2019. 
This excellent operating performance was driven by strong year-over-year sales growth in our Industrial Coatings reporting segment with the automotive OEM, general industrial and packaging coatings businesses all delivering double-digit percentage year-over-year sales growth. Our global architectural coatings business continued their strong sales growth trends. And automotive refinish had a strong quarter as activity in that end-use market is beginning to recover, and we were partially aided by some customer restocking in the U.S. 
First quarter segment margins were at a multiyear high as we benefited from strong operating margin leverage on higher year-over-year net sales growth. The significant amount of cost savings we have achieved in the past 2 years from our restructuring programs is a primary factor contributing to us realizing this increased leverage. We delivered these outstanding results despite sales volumes not fully returning to pre-pandemic levels, including in several key PPG businesses such as aerospace. In addition, we experienced a significant acceleration of raw material and logistics cost inflation during the quarter. 
Coming into the year, we were expecting an inflationary environment and had prioritized selling price increases across all of our businesses. This has helped us achieve solid price increases year-to-date. With a higher inflation backdrop, we have already secured further selling price increases and are in the process of executing additional ones during the second quarter. 
As a reminder, first quarter of 2021 was our 16th consecutive quarter of higher selling prices. We also continue to execute on our cost-savings programs, realizing an incremental $35 million of structural savings and maintain our target of $125 million of total savings for the full year 2021. In addition, we retained about $30 million of interim cost savings during the quarter and remain confident that we'll be able to make at least $80 million of these interim cost savings permanent for the full year 2021. 
We ended the first quarter with about $1.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents. This is a gross-up cash balance as we are preparing for the closing of the Tikkurila and Wörwag acquisitions. Contributing to this strong cash balance is a 200 basis point year-over-year improvement in our operating working capital in the first quarter, which drove better operating cash generation than a typical first quarter. 
Our new Traffic Solutions business, which is the Ennis-Flint acquisition, performed to our expectations in the quarter despite significant challenges with weather and raw material availability. The business has a strong order book heading into the second quarter. In the first quarter, we also completed the VersaFlex acquisition. And the Tikkurila and Wörwag acquisitions are expected to be completed in the second quarter. 
In the accompanying presentation to our earnings material, we included several slides to provide further information and perspective on our 4 recent acquisitions and our performance for a number of acquisitions. Some items that I'd like to highlight: Each of the 4 acquisitions bring incremental strategic benefits to PPG, such as product line extensions and geographic expansions. We've continued to deliver strong synergy capture from our past acquisitions and believe our global breadth, regional participation in all coatings verticals, best-in-class procurement and mature back-office centers of excellence in low-cost areas allow us to deliver higher synergy capabilities than our competitors. 
For our recently announced acquisitions, we expect to realize synergies of high single digit of sales, higher than historical industry synergy capture. We also provided an update to our acquisition performance we last shared in May 2019. We included our 10 most recent acquisitions that have been closed for at least 24 months. In most acquisitions and in aggregate, we have achieved higher synergy capture than our initial estimates, averaging about 50 basis points higher. 
All of these acquisitions will help drive shareholder value creation. The post-synergy multiples for each of these acquisitions is below PPG's 5-year average multiple. And for 8 of the acquisitions, the post-synergy multiple is below 10. All 4 of the recently announced acquisitions provide earnings accretion from their historical base business and synergy realization. By the end of 2022, we expect cumulative synergies to total about $75 million and will be at an annual run rate of $135 million once they were all fully integrated. 
As with many of our initial synergy projections, these initial targets only include a modest benefit from sales synergies, although these acquisitions are well suited for us to drive further topline growth. We expect the Tikkurila acquisition to be completed in the second quarter. We recently extended the tender offer period until May 11 to finalize customary regulatory approvals. Tikkurila is a highly strategic acquisition with leading architecture coatings positions across various countries. As I said in January, I see many similar characteristics to our previous Comex acquisition. We'll have significant opportunities to cross-sell complementary products through our legacy channels to further grow sales and earnings. Our Comex acquisition has well exceeded our initial acquisition economics. 
Moving to our current outlook. We are continuing to see very robust and broad-based demand globally, including in many industrial and OEM end-use markets and continued architectural coatings activity. Many of our customers have indicated they have strong order books, and we anticipate this global -- strong global demand pattern to continue well into the second half of 2021 at a minimum. In addition, we expect an eventual restocking of inventory to occur in many of our selling channels as the year progresses. 
One important item of note is some of our customers are experiencing input or component shortages, so their production capabilities and schedules remain choppy, and we are experiencing a few spot outages of direct coatings raw materials. As a result, we expect some unfavorable sales impacts from both our direct supply chain disruptions and these production curtailments at some of our customers. 
Our best current estimate is that sales are expected to be impacted by about $70 million to $90 million in the second quarter due to these issues. We expect these sales to be deferred in the second half of 2021, and thus, this impact is already included in our second quarter 2021 financial guidance. 
Also, as I mentioned previously, we're experiencing commodity inflation that occurred quickly due to the weather event named Uri. As a result of this rapid inflation increase in both raw materials and logistics, we have fully mobilized our commercial teams and are successfully securing additional selling price increases. We have a very good head start on this inflation cycle, and we expect to fully offset raw material cost inflation in the second half of 2021. 
Finally, as you've come to expect from PPG, we remain committed to strong and real-time cost management, which will provide continued strong operating leverage on sales growth. These current disruptions are temporary. And we maintain a positive view on the overall global coatings demand growth, which continues to be robust and broad-based across most of the end-use markets that we supply. This is expected to continue throughout 2021. The strong demand conditions, along with our leading technology-advantaged products, provides us with many organic growth opportunities in 2021 and beyond. 
For the company, aggregate sales volumes are projected to be up by low teen percentage in the second quarter on a sequential basis compared to the first quarter of 2021 with differences by business and region. Adjusted earnings, excluding amortization expense, is expected to be between $2.15 to $2.20, continuing a strong earnings momentum. 
As a reminder, this guidance does not include any EPS impact from either the Tikkurila or Wörwag acquisitions. Our near-term cash deployment priority will be to complete the acquisitions we have announced, which we anticipate to be funded by a combination of cash on hand and debt by the end of the second quarter. 
In closing, I want to thank and recognize our global PPG team. The character of our employees has never shone brighter than it has during these times of adversity. Our people have shown great resiliency, continuing to serve our customers, our communities and drive a common purpose to protect and beautify the world. Thank you for your continued confidence in PPG. This concludes our prepared remarks.

And related to that, are we in a new paradigm for the coatings industry, whereby pricing will more quickly align with raw material cost volatility, including when costs start to decline at some point? I guess I'm asking because historically, the industry has been very good about maintaining pricing even as raw material costs have moderated post previous peaks."

And so we had put our teams on high alert to get pricing early in the year. 
And the second thing is we're trying to do a better job of surgical price increases as well as value selling. So as we roll out new products to capture that additional value. And we're doing a better job, I think, on services. During the pandemic, it was clear how much our customers valued our ability to help them get their lines up and running. And I think we're doing a better job of capturing value for those services. 
So I think each of those things is important. Clearly, as the freeze happened, it wasn't any shock to anybody at PPG that this was going to lead to additional raw material inflation. And so we immediately -- as we saw Texas going into a deep freeze, put all our sales teams on high alert that they needed to start talking to their customers immediately about raw material inflation. 
I think one of the things that's different, if you remember 2017 and '18, there are -- some of our competitors were distracted. You had the Valspar acquisition being completed. Valspar wasn't raising price. And Akzo is under a lot of pressure. They were not doing anything, they were going after value. This is so clear and obvious that I think everybody is more on top of this. Hopefully, This will be a trend to be on top of raw material inflation as a regular ongoing business practice. So I would just tell you, I'm confident that our teams are proactively addressing this."

And so the guys didn't want to get caught if we had a return-to-work situation. So they've done, I think, whatever restocking they're going to do. 
So from that standpoint, I would say the volumes that we're projecting for 2Q are still at or slightly below the 2Q of 2019, and that's primarily driven by aerospace. So what I'm encouraged about, Frank, to be honest, is that January and February for aerospace was still pretty mediocre. 
But March was pretty encouraging. And we know that the aerospace guys have completely depleted inventory. I mean they have virtually nothing in the chain. So at some point, as things get better, they're going to start ordering and that will start to be a positive. 
We haven't seen that yet. We do track it on a very regular basis, as you can imagine. But I was encouraged by March, and the MRO sales have continued to tick up in April here. Now we expect OEM aerospace to be flat because that's not going to change anytime soon. But the MRO side will be better. So we have military still doing well. MRO is starting to improve.

Military, we see no slowdown in the military side. That's, let's call it, 35% of our aerospace business. Our most important program is the F-35. The builds continue along. We're gaining more share. We have more share on the transparency. We have more share on the winglet transparencies. So we feel good about that. 
From the commercial side, to be quite honest, our visibility is quite limited because we've never had planes sit on the ground for a year. And so the MRO, how they were put into storage and how they come out of storage is still somewhat of an unknown. What checks they're going to do before they put them into storage is still somewhat of an unknown. 
So what we do see is that the MRO activity for our aerospace business is picking up. We are getting -- what's interesting is when they put -- when some of the planes are giving back to the lease source, they have to paint them white. So we have been getting some of those white paint sales. And of course, when they come back out of the lease source, they're going to be rebranded again, so they'll be repainted again. So as that happens, that will be a positive for us. 
Your question on infrastructure. I would tell you that we touch a lot of things in the infrastructure, whether that's the road markings that will be needed, whether that's the bridges that will need to be painted. If they support the building and trades industry, that will require protective coatings. So I would say for PPG, any infrastructure will be regarded as a positive."

So the more takeoff and landings in the U.S. and in other countries, internal takeoff and landings is very important to us. The second wave we see is a return of business travel. And then the third wave, which we don't expect until later this year at the earliest, would be international travel. So we do feel there's a couple of opportunities for step-ups in the aerospace industry on the MRO side."

I do want to go back to Laurence. You wanted to ask 2 questions, we didn't get to the second one, which was thrifting. Right now, we're not seeing, in our architectural business anywhere in the world, any significant impacts from thrifting. We're really -- again, we're really light inventory.

Most importantly, I hope you and your loved ones are remaining safe and healthy. 
Now let me provide some comments to supplement the detailed financial results we released last evening. 
For the second quarter, our net sales were a record and nearly $4.4 billion and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.94. Our adjusted EPS was significantly higher than the second quarter of 2020, partially due to last year's second quarter, including various pandemic-related impacts. Looking back to prepandemic results, our adjusted EPS was similar to the second quarter of 2019 despite sales volumes being 6% lower than that period and we are dealing with historical high levels of raw material inflation in the current period. 
Our strong year-over-year sales reflect a partial recovery from the unfavorable pandemic effects of last year but also include a better-than-market performance across many of our businesses for this quarter. We achieved these higher sales levels despite significant supply and component disruptions, including ones that reduced the overall manufacturing capability of our customers. Coming in the quarter, we expect that these disruptions would have an estimated impact of $70 million to $90 million. However, the actual impact was much more severe and closer to $200 million. 
Our adjusted EPS in the second quarter, while near all-time record levels, was below our April forecast. Three main factors impacted the difference. Due to supply disruptions, we experienced unprecedented levels of raw material and transportation costs that continually elevated as the quarter progressed. This drove raw material inflation to be up a mid- to high-teen percentage on a year-over-year basis versus our original estimate of a high single-digit percentage increase. Our automotive OEM business was impacted most significantly from supply disruptions as we estimate that more than 2 million less cars were built than initially expected during the quarter. This impacted our sales by about $100 million or higher than $40 million more than we expected in April. Finally, as we expected, the supply disruptions led to shortages of certain raw materials. We anticipated an impact of $30 million to $50 million, but the actual impact was closer to $100 million. We are highly confident that the sales related to these production disruptions will be deferred to later quarters and this will elongate the global automotive OEM recovery. 
As I mentioned in April, coming into the year, we were expecting an inflationary environment and had prioritized selling price increases across all our businesses. This helped us achieve solid price increases year-to-date and our pace of price realization is well ahead of the most recent raw material inflation cycle in 2017 and 2018. Clearly, this inflation cycle is much higher than anyone anticipated, and we are continuing on a business-by-business basis working to secure further selling price increases. This includes executing additional pricing actions during the third quarter. As a reminder, the second quarter of 2021 was our 17th consecutive quarter of higher selling prices. 
We're also continuing our strong cost management, evidenced by our SG&A as a percentage of sales being 130 basis points lower than the second quarter 2019. This is being supported by our ongoing execution on our structural cost savings programs, realizing an incremental $40 million of savings in the second quarter. We've increased our targeted full year 2021 savings by about 10% to $135 million. 
In the second quarter, we finalized 3 acquisitions: Tikkurila, Wörwag and Cetelon. We funded the acquisition through a combination of cash and external financing, which came in at a very attractive borrowing rate. 
We had yet another strong operating cash performance during the quarter and ended the quarter with about $1.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents, giving us continued flexibility to do additional accretive cash deployment in the upcoming quarters. 
In regards to our other 2 recently completed acquisitions, our new Traffic Solutions business, which is comprised of the Ennis-Flint acquisition, performed to our expectations in the quarter despite significant challenges with raw material availability and its order book is at historical highs entering the third quarter. Our VersaFlex acquisition was smaller. It's performing well, and it's already helped us win significant protected coatings project in Central America due to the advantaged technologies that we acquired. 
Another notable accomplishment during the second quarter was the appointment of our company's first ever Vice President of Global Sustainability. PPG has been a clear ESG leader in the coatings industry through our market-leading sustainable products and we have plans to further improve our overall ESG program. We will provide updates on these initiatives in subsequent quarters. 
Moving to our current outlook. Most important is that we are continuing to see very robust and broad-based demand globally, including in many industrial and OEM end-use markets, and strong architectural coatings trade activity in the U.S. Many of our customers have indicated that their order books were at high levels exiting the second quarter. We anticipate this strong global demand pattern to continue. In addition, we expect an eventual restocking of inventory to occur in many of our selling channels, either later this year or in 2022. In the near term, we expect some of our customers will continue to be challenged with input or component shortages, so their production capabilities and schedules likely to remain choppy throughout the third quarter. PPG is also experiencing the continuation of spot outages of direct coatings raw materials. As a result, we expect some unfavorable sales impact from both our direct supply chain disruptions and the production curtailments of some of our customers in the third quarter. Our current best estimate is that our sales are expected to be unfavorably impacted by about $150 million in the third quarter due to these issues. We expect these sales will be largely deferred to subsequent quarters. 
We also expect raw material costs to remain at elevated levels in the third quarter. Our current best estimate is that they will be inflated by as much as 20% compared to the third quarter of 2020, with businesses in our Industrial Coatings segment experiencing the largest increases due to the raw material mix of those types of coatings. 
As a result, all our businesses are securing additional selling price increases. Due to the significant increases we experienced in the second quarter and anticipate in the third quarter, we now fully expect to offset raw material cost inflation in the fourth quarter on 2021 on a run rate basis. As I've said previously, these current disruptions are temporary and we strongly believe there is sufficient capacity available in our supply chain once operating conditions normalize. 
I'm very pleased that we have completed 5 recent acquisitions since December 2020. In the third quarter, these acquisitions will add about $500 million of incremental sales to our company as we continue to integrate these acquisitions to realize meaningful synergies that will be a strong earnings catalyst. 
We're also witnessing domestic flight activity picking up all over the world. This will begin to benefit our commercial aftermarket business in aerospace in the second half of 2021.  
In the information we posted on our website yesterday evening, we were projecting aggregate sales volumes to be up a low single-digit percentage in the third quarter compared to the prior year quarter, with differences by business and region. Including our acquisitions, we expect overall sales growth to be over 20% compared to the third quarter of 2020. In addition, full year 2021 adjusted earnings, excluding amortization expense and other nonrecurring items, is expected to be $7.40 to $7.60, which, at the midpoint, would be about 13% higher than the adjusted EPS we realized in 2019 despite the significant raw material inflationary pressures we are dealing with this year and the fact that sales volumes are still not fully recovered from the pandemic when compared to 2019. 
Finally, I'm very pleased that our Board recently approved a dividend increase of about 10%. Our September payment, coupled with the anticipated payment of a similar quarterly dividend in December, will mark 50 consecutive years annual per share increases in the company's dividend. This is another testament of our company's legacy of consistently rewarding our shareholders and the confidence that the Board and I have in our ability to continue to generate and grow our operating cash flow. 
In closing, I could not be more proud of our now 50,000 employees around the world who serve our customers, our communities and our many stakeholders. Their dedication and commitment to doing better today than yesterday every day helps assure that PPG continues to protect and beautify the world. 
Thank you for your continued confidence in PPG. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now, Jason, would you please open the line for questions."

And we do anticipate Europe recovery but probably at a little bit slower rate because of the pace of vaccines over there. But I would tell you, overall, we're anticipating that there's going to be about 1 million cars less built in the third quarter than we had originally anticipated because of the chip shortage. And right now, if you look at the overall pace of car builds, they're still below peak levels, but demand is recovering. So I anticipate that we're going to have a very strong back half of 2021 and a very good 2022. So from that standpoint, inventories across lots, whether they're in the U.S. or China, are still at quite low levels. And so I still remain very optimistic. 
From a China standpoint, specifically, inventories are probably in that 40- to 45-day range, which is below average slightly. Demand remains strong. And what's most encouraging to me is that the pace of EVs continues to pick up. And as you know, our positioning on EVs are very strong. And so we anticipate continuing to be above industry build rates in content."

Just to dovetail Michael's comments, if you look at the automotive OEM, particularly in the U.S., one other benefit we expect to occur later this year or early next year as chips become available is the rental car fleet. The rental car fleets, there's a sparse inventory in those fleets. And so we know those typically account for 10% to 15% of auto builds annually, and we know that 10% to 15% will be higher going forward until they replenish those fleets. 
More broadly in China, while we're seeing a lower growth rate, we're still seeing good growth across many of our end markets. So I think the anecdotal information you referenced is accurate. The growth has come off what was very high rates. But it's still a solid growth rate going forward."

We've actually been very surprised at the recovery rate in this period. Typically, even if you go back and look at the most severe hurricanes, our suppliers have been able to get online and get back up to full rates pretty quickly this time. They've been significantly challenged. And it's been compounded by the lack of transportation equipment. Not just equipment, but more importantly, drivers. So we've had a number of situations where we had to go out and buy spot material and it was challenging to get trucks to be able to deliver that because of the inability of some of our suppliers. So if you ask me if there's any change we might do, there could be some additional suppliers brought into the mix to provide us some additional flexibility. But other than that, I don't think there will be any major changes. 
But overall, I would say raw materials, the only one that we're currently forecasting to be moderating is oil. And as you saw, oil in the past week has started to decline. So solvents would parallel the oil price changes. So that's the only one we have right now in our model."

Those views will be somewhere between 4% and 5% in terms of our price capture. That's still well short of what we need. We typically need 40% to 50% of the inflation to recover fully. So we're still looking at additional pricing actions throughout 3Q across all of our businesses, all of our regions. 
In 4Q, to John Bruno's comment a minute ago, what we expect inflation to remain high. We do expect to remove some of the spot buys that we're doing currently. Those are typically coming at a large premium to traditional pricing or list pricing. And we're still looking at additional price capture or a full realization of the 3Q price capture in 4Q.

But I am very pleased to announce that we have gotten positive price in every automotive region in the world. So we are making good progress there and well ahead of where we were in 2017, 2018. 
I would say the next inflationary would be in our Industrial Coatings business. They also buy a lot of epoxies, isocyanate. So they would have been hit second most difficult. 
The business that's impacted the least is aerospace due to the raw material mix we have there. 
The place that we probably have closed the gap the most is architectural. We're working also hard on Traffic Solutions. This is a business that historically price was a secondary thought. We've elevated that in this business, and we've been very pleased at the pace of recovery in our Traffic Solutions business.

At that point in time, we were hearing from our suppliers, and as Michael alluded to earlier, that this would be a multi-week startup or restart-up. As we progressed through the quarter and especially in June, we continued to see outages and escalation of raw materials, specifically in the June time period, which is why we're seeing Q3 higher than Q2 in terms of our raw material estimates. We continue to see outages, particularly around transportation. Those outages continue to worsen especially in June. And our customers continue to have spot production curtailments on their -- from their perspective. So as we were in June, we continued to see the automotive market be heavily impacted by chip shortages. And a lot of customers in that particular industry who had earmarked Q3 for some downtime actually took it in Q2. So as we went through the quarter, we saw the difficulties continued to grow. So that really was the time line.

So inventories have gone backwards for us. We see very low inventories in the chain, in many of our customers as well. So if you look at our architectural guys, they typically don't carry a lot, but they have even less. If you look at our industrial customers, I've had more calls from customers directly to me in the past quarter than I've had in the past probably 3 or 4 years. So customers have low inventories as well. I do think there will be a restocking. Of course, as you know, in aerospace, inventories, I would say, are at rock bottom because they couldn't afford to buy anything previously.

If you go into any of our stores or go in any of the big boxes or asking the DOT what I'll tell you that all the suppliers are struggling to put paint on the shelves. So I think that was the most material things. 
But it is interesting, we didn't track it because I didn't think it would become a material number, but the number of other places that chips show up, whether it's appliances or other heavy-duty equipment, so everybody is being impacted somewhat, but it didn't -- it really didn't turn out to be enough of a number to call out.

Also, what we historically find is after events like this you will see some rebranding being done. So we're anticipating that will also happen maybe in 2023, 2024. 
But overall, right now, when you take a plane out of storage, if it was properly stored, there is some maintenance they need to do on it before it goes back into service. But then they don't have to do the big heavy checks that they do at the big maintenance cycles. 
But overall, inventories are exceptionally low. Our order book in -- or I should say our book-to-bill ratio has improved significantly in aerospace. Our backlog has increased. And so right now, the biggest challenge we have in our aerospace business is labor, making sure we get enough qualified labor to work in the plants to be able to get the product out the door. So we're feeling very, very good about aerospace on the MRO side. 
We're not there yet, obviously, on the OEM side. Builds are picking up slightly on the 737. They're picking up slightly on the A321.

Most importantly, I hope you and your loved ones are remaining safe and healthy. 
Now let me provide some comments to supplement the detailed financial results we released last evening. For the second quarter, our net sales were a record and nearly $4.4 billion, and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.94. Our adjusted EPS was significantly higher than the second quarter of 2020, partially due to last year's second quarter, including various pandemic-related impacts. Looking back to pre-pandemic results, our adjusted EPS was similar to the second quarter of 2019 despite sales volumes being 6% lower than that period, and we are dealing with historical high levels of raw material inflation in the current period. 
Our strong year-over-year sales reflect a partial recovery from the unfavorable pandemic effects of last year but also include a better-than-market performance across many of our businesses for this quarter. We achieved these higher sales levels despite significant supply and component disruptions, including ones that reduced the overall manufacturing capability of our customers. Coming into the quarter, we expect that these disruptions would have an estimated impact of $70 million to $90 million. However, the actual impact was much more severe and closer to $200 million. 
Our adjusted EPS in the second quarter, while near all-time record levels, was below our April forecast. Three main factors impacted the difference. Due to supply disruptions, we experienced unprecedented levels of raw material and transportation costs that continually elevated as the quarter progressed. This drove raw material inflation to be up a mid- to high-teen percentage on a year-over-year basis versus our original estimate of a high single-digit percentage increase. 
Our automotive OEM business was impacted most significantly from supply disruptions as we estimate that more than 2 million less cars were built than initially expected during the quarter. This impacted our sales by about $100 million or higher than -- $40 million more than we expected in April. 
Finally, as we expected, the supply disruptions led to shortages of certain raw materials. We anticipated an impact of $30 million to $50 million, but the actual impact was closer to $100 million. We are highly confident that the sales related to these production disruptions will be deferred to later quarters and this will elongate the global automotive OEM recovery. 
As I mentioned in April, coming into the year, we were expecting an inflationary environment and had prioritized selling price increases across all our businesses. This helped us achieve solid price increases year-to-date, and our pace of price realization is well ahead of the most recent raw material inflation cycle in 2017 and 2018. 
Clearly, this inflation cycle is much higher than anyone anticipated, and we are continuing on a business-by-business basis, working to secure further selling price increases. This includes executing additional pricing actions during the third quarter. As a reminder, the second quarter of 2021 was our 17th consecutive quarter of higher selling prices. 
We're also continuing our strong cost management, evidenced by our SG&A as a percentage of sales being 130 basis points lower than the second quarter 2019. This is being supported by our ongoing execution on our structural cost savings programs, realizing an incremental $40 million of savings in the second quarter. We've increased our targeted full year 2021 savings by about 10% to $135 million. 
In the second quarter, we finalized 3 acquisitions: Tikkurila, Wörwag and Cetelon. We funded the acquisition through a combination of cash and external financing, which came in at a very attractive borrowing rate. We had yet another strong operating cash performance during the quarter and ended the quarter with about $1.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents, giving us continued flexibility to do additional accretive cash deployment in the upcoming quarters.  
In regards to our other 2 recently completed acquisitions, our new Traffic Solutions business, which is comprised of the Ennis-Flint acquisition, performed to our expectations in the quarter despite significant challenges with raw material availability and its order book is at historical highs entering the third quarter. Our VersaFlex acquisition was smaller. It's performing well, and it's already helped us win significant protected coatings project in Central America due to the advantaged technologies that we acquired. 
Another notable accomplishment during the second quarter was the appointment of our company's first ever Vice President of Global Sustainability. PPG has been a clear ESG leader in the coatings industry through our market-leading sustainable products and we have plans to further improve our overall ESG program. We will provide updates on these initiatives in subsequent quarters. 
Moving to our current outlook. Most important is that we are continuing to see very robust and broad-based demand globally, including in many industrial and OEM end-use markets, and strong architectural coatings trade activity in the U.S. Many of our customers have indicated that their order books were at high levels exiting the second quarter. We anticipate this strong global demand pattern to continue. 
In addition, we expect an eventual restocking of inventory to occur in many of our selling channels, either later this year or in 2022. In the near term, we expect some of our customers will continue to be challenged with input or component shortages, so their production capabilities and schedules likely to remain choppy throughout the third quarter. 
PPG is also experiencing the continuation of spot outages of direct coatings raw materials. As a result, we expect some unfavorable sales impact from both our direct supply chain disruptions and the production curtailments of some of our customers in the third quarter. Our current best estimate is that our sales are expected to be unfavorably impacted by about $150 million in the third quarter due to these issues. We expect these sales will be largely deferred to subsequent quarters. 
We also expect raw material costs to remain at elevated levels in the third quarter. Our current best estimate is that they will be inflated by as much as 20% compared to the third quarter of 2020, with businesses in our Industrial Coatings segment experiencing the largest increases due to the raw material mix of those types of coatings. 
As a result, all our businesses are securing additional selling price increases. Due to the significant increases we experienced in the second quarter and anticipate in the third quarter, we now fully expect to offset raw material cost inflation in the fourth quarter on 2021 on a run rate basis. As I've said previously, these current disruptions are temporary and we strongly believe there is sufficient capacity available in our supply chain once operating conditions normalize. 
I'm very pleased that we have completed 5 recent acquisitions since December 2020. In the third quarter, these acquisitions will add about $500 million of incremental sales to our company. As we continue to integrate these acquisitions to realize meaningful synergies that will be a strong earnings catalyst. We're also witnessing domestic flight activity picking up all over the world. This will begin to benefit our commercial aftermarket business in aerospace in the second half of 2021.   
In the information we posted on our website yesterday evening, we were projecting aggregate sales volumes to be up a low single-digit percentage in the third quarter compared to the prior year quarter, with differences by business and region. Including our acquisitions, we expect overall sales growth to be over 20% compared to the third quarter of 2020. In addition, full year 2021 adjusted earnings, excluding amortization expense and other nonrecurring items, is expected to be $7.40 to $7.60, which at the midpoint, would be about 13% higher than the adjusted EPS we realized in 2019 despite the significant raw material inflationary pressures we are dealing with this year and the fact that sales volumes are still not fully recovered from the pandemic when compared to 2019. 
Finally, I'm very pleased that our Board recently approved a dividend increase of about 10%. Our September payment, coupled with the anticipated payment of a similar quarterly dividend in December, will mark 50 consecutive years annual per share increases in the company's dividend. This is another testament of our company's legacy of consistently rewarding our shareholders and the confidence that the Board and I have in our ability to continue to generate and grow our operating cash flow. 
In closing, I could not be more proud of our now 50,000 employees around the world who serve our customers, our communities and our many stakeholders. Their dedication and commitment to doing better today than yesterday, every day, helps assure that PPG continues to protect and beautify the world. 
Thank you for your continued confidence in PPG. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now, Jason, would you please open the line for questions."

And we do anticipate Europe recovery but probably at a little bit slower rate because of the pace of vaccines over there. 
But I would tell you, overall, we're anticipating that there's going to be about 1 million cars less built in the third quarter than we had originally anticipated because of the chip shortage. And right now, if you look at the overall pace of car builds, they're still below peak levels, but demand is recovering. So I anticipate that we're going to have a very strong back half of 2021 and a very good 2022. So from that standpoint, inventories across the lots, whether they're in the U.S. or China, are still at quite low levels. And so I still remain very optimistic. 
From a China standpoint, specifically, inventories are probably in that 40- to 45-day range, which is below average slightly. Demand remains strong. And what's most encouraging to me is that the pace of EVs continues to pick up. And as you know, our positioning on EVs are very strong. And so we anticipate continuing to be above industry build rates in content."

The rental car fleets, there's a sparse inventory in those fleets.

We've actually been very surprised at the recovery rate in this period. Typically, even if you go back and look at the most severe hurricanes, our suppliers have been able to get online and get back up to full rates pretty quickly this time. They've been significantly challenged. And it's been compounded by the lack of transportation equipment. Not just equipment, but more importantly, drivers. 
So we've had a number of situations where we had to go out and buy spot material and it was challenging to get trucks to be able to deliver that because of the inability of some of our suppliers. So if you ask me if there's any change we might do, there could be some additional suppliers brought into the mix to provide us some additional flexibility. But other than that, I don't think there will be any major changes. 
But overall, I would say raw materials, the only one that we're currently forecasting to be moderating is oil. And as you saw, oil in the past week has started to decline. So solvents would parallel the oil price changes. So that's the only one we have right now in our model."

So we're still looking at additional pricing actions throughout 3Q across all of our businesses, all of our regions. 
In 4Q, to John Bruno's comment a minute ago, well, we expect inflation to remain high. We do expect to remove some of the spot buys that we're doing currently. Those are typically coming at a large premium to traditional pricing or list pricing. And we're still looking at additional price capture or a full realization of the 3Q price capture in 4Q.

Inventory levels in all our businesses are at exceptionally low levels. You saw that in our working capital numbers. I've actually asked our businesses to share with me the amount of product they made in April, May, June and versus how much of that went out the door, and virtually everything we made went out the door. So inventories have gone backwards for us. 
We see very low inventories in the chain, in many of our customers as well. So if you look at our architectural guys, they typically don't carry a lot, but they have even less. If you look at our industrial customers, I've had more calls from customers directly to me in the past quarter than I've had in the past probably 3 or 4 years. So customers have low inventories as well. I do think there will be a restocking. Of course, as you know, in aerospace, inventories, I would say, are at rock bottom because they couldn't afford to buy anything previously. And so they're trying to stock up now ahead of what they anticipate as increased demand. 
So I can't really think of a single one of our businesses that have any kind of material inventory either on the shelf or at our customers."

There have been a number of the top 30 coatings company have been taken off the board in the last couple of, let's call it the last 3 or 4 quarters. So the availability of targets is probably not as good as it was 6 months ago. So right now, we're going to keep an open mind for that.

Also, what we historically find is after events like this you will see some rebranding being done. So we're anticipating that will also happen maybe in 2023, 2024. 
But overall, right now, when you take a plane out of storage, if it was properly stored, there is some maintenance they need to do on it before it goes back into service. But then they don't have to do the big heavy checks that they do at the big maintenance cycles. 
But overall, inventories are exceptionally low. Our order book in -- or I should say our book-to-bill ratio has improved significantly in aerospace. Our backlog has increased. And so right now, the biggest challenge we have in our aerospace business is labor, making sure we get enough qualified labor to work in the plants to be able to get the product out the door. So we're feeling very, very good about aerospace on the MRO side. 
We're not there yet, obviously, on the OEM side. Builds are picking up slightly on the 737, they're picking up slightly on the A321. But for the bigger birds, they're not picking up at all and we don't anticipate seeing that range pick up until 2023 time period because of a lack of international flights."

So obviously, there's a significant increase in container rates out of China. So as and when the container rate or rather logistics situation sort of normalizes, do you expect a sharp reversal in some of your raw material basket? 
Because if I think about oil, it has only gone up, let's say, call it, circa 20% in the last quarter, but some of your raw materials have more than doubled. And literally volumes that are coming out of China into Europe and U.S. have gone down a lot in all the raw materials. So once the container rate situation normalizes, do you see a sharp reversal of raw material dynamics?"

The bigger challenge overall has been the supply-demand issue for the base raw materials. Certainly, we're not happy with the container prices. It has escalated significantly. 
But if we could get the overall base supply/demand balance back in balance, if you will, in our supply chain, I think prices would start to normalize somewhat. We don't see that happening in 2021. So right now, we're still anticipating significant inflation when we said it's 20% in Q3, and we'll have a significant inflation in Q4. So for as far as we can currently look out, we're still looking at a pretty inflationary cycle."

As they get the vaccines out, that we anticipate the back half of 2021 will recover significantly. And by hopefully all of 2022, Europe will be back to normal. 
We see in the U.S. already, we're at 90-plus percent recovered in refinish. And actually, what you're seeing is a little shift from traffic from the cities into the suburbs. So collisions are actually improving every month here in the U.S. And of course, in China, it's all the way back to normal. And we see a snapback in India whenever we see the folks get allowed to travel again. 
So most places, it is vaccine-related. And so we're pretty confident. And if you go through the rest of our businesses, we're already back in industrial. Were mostly back in automotive. Our packaging business is well ahead. The demand in aluminum packaging is very strong. So our packaging business is going to have another record year this year and next year. 
If you look at our PMC business, protective, now that oil prices have recovered, I expect protective to continue to recover as well as they start to protect these high-value assets in the oilfields. 
So I'm very comfortable that we're going to have a strong back half of the demand for 2021 and a continued demand recovery in 2022."

I will provide some comments to supplement the detailed financial results we released last evening. 
For the third quarter, we achieved record net sales of nearly $4.4 billion and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.69. As we communicated in early September, our sales and adjusted EPS were significantly impacted by worsening supply chain disruptions and increasing raw material cost inflation. Our raw material costs in the quarter inflated by about 25% year-over-year. For context, this is about 3x higher than any previous coatings raw material inflation peak in recent history. 
We're also experiencing elevated logistics costs and are incurring increased manufacturing costs due to the sporadic nature of these outages. Commercially, we have taken significant mitigation efforts due to the high level inflation through rapid implementation of structural selling price increases. In aggregate, our selling price realization is about 6%, with more than 6% price realization in our Industrial reporting segment. Our price capture pace is much faster than previous inflationary cycles and we have further pricing initiatives underway. 
Coming into the quarter, we expect that the supply chain and customer production disruptions would impact our sales by about $150 million. However, this actual impact was more than $350 million. Additionally, this prevented us from completely fulfilling our strong order books and further depleted retail inventory in many of our end-use markets. We expect much of this demand will be deferred into 2022. And in particular, these current conditions will elongate the global automotive OEM recovery. 
To put the automotive OEM situation in perspective, U.S. dealer inventories had a record historic lows in the mid-20-day range. And in 2021, global production in this industry is expected to be about 20% below prior peak levels. Despite the current challenges, several of our businesses, including our Automotive Refinish, Protective & Marine, and Packaging Coatings delivered strong above-market performance, driven by our strong service capabilities and advantaged technology. 
Our PPG-Comex business achieved record third quarter sales with year-over-year organic sales growth of more than 10%. In addition, our U.S. Architectural Coatings business delivered about 10% same-store sales growth as we continue to expand our customer base with many new wins and increase our digital sales as a percentage of our total sales base. 
More generally, we continue to experience improving trade painter demand globally and architectural DIY coatings sales returned closer to 2019 levels after notable growth last year was driven by the state home impacts. We remain focused on cost management, which is evidenced by our SG&A as a percent of sales being 100 basis points lower than the third quarter 2020. This is being supported by our ongoing execution on our structural cost savings programs as we delivered an incremental $35 million of savings in the third quarter. We continue to target and on track for our full year 2021 savings of about $135 million. 
In the quarter, we also continued to make good progress integrating our 5 recent acquisitions contributing to our overall earnings for the quarter. Our 2 larger acquisitions, Tikkurila and Ennis-Flint delivered good top line results despite the challenging supply constraints. We continue to expect them to deliver an aggregate of $25 million of synergies for the full year of 2021. 
We once again delivered strong operating cash flow during the quarter and had about $1.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents at the quarter end, including sequential reduction of our net debt by about $400 million. This was supported by our continuing strong working capital management as we maintain our positive step change improvement achieved last year and are at multiyear lows on a percentage of sales basis. While we will continue to evaluate accretive deals in our M&A pipeline, we are initiating stock repurchases in the fourth quarter, and we'll continue to focus on debt reduction. As a reminder, based on the seasonality of our businesses, the fourth quarter is typically our strongest cash generation quarter of the year. 
Also during the quarter, in support of further enhancing our ESG program, we were happy to announce an agreement with Constellation Energy to power our Carrollton, Texas manufacturing facility with 100% renewable solar energy. We are also working on our very first ever diversity report and developing science-based climate targets, both of which we will communicate in 2022. Equally important is PPG's market-leading sustainable products continue to enable our customers to meet their respective sustainability goals. We will continue to provide updates on these initiatives on subsequent quarters. 
In addition, I'm extremely pleased to announce that yesterday, PPG earned 3 R&D 100 awards for 2021. The R&D World Magazine honors the 100 most innovative technologies and services over the past year with the R&D 100 awards. Even more importantly, 2 of the 3 innovations that we were recognized are growth initiatives in electric vehicles, including BFP SC battery fire protection coating, which protects the vehicle occupants from fire and mitigate thermal runaway events plus [ Envirocron ] Extreme Protection thermally conductive dielectric powder for battery packs, providing dielectric protection and thermal conductivity. Our dielectric powder has already been commercialized by a leading EV maker and our battery fire protection product will launch in 2022 by one of the world's largest car makers. 
Moving to our outlook. We are continuing to evidence solid demand in aggregate. Many of our customers continue to indicate that their order books are at high levels and have lower than normal inventory levels. In the near term, we anticipate only modest improvements to the supply disruptions that we've been experiencing. Our estimate is that our sales are expected to be unfavorably impacted by about $250 million to $300 million in the fourth quarter, both for the semiconductor chip shortage issue and chronic supplier operational capabilities. 
Recent production curtailments in China may add incremental pressures to availability and inflation, and we expect our inflation to approach 30% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. As a result, all our businesses are securing additional selling price increases, and now we expect to fully offset raw material cost inflation in the early part of 2022. 
We continue to strongly believe there is sufficient capacity available in our supply chain as operating conditions continue to normalize. Absent any further disruption, we expect supply chains to operate more normally by year's end, supported by normal seasonality trends. To provide further assistance and assurance a more consistent supply going forward, we are rapidly qualifying additional regional and global commodity suppliers across a variety of our key raw material procurement groupings. We expect these increases in product availability, coupled with continued improvement in the existing supply chain, will provide ample supply beginning early in 2022. 
While the current environment remains difficult to predict, I remain very optimistic about our specific growth catalyst for 2022. Specifically, we expect continued recovery in automotive refinish, OEM and aerospace coatings, which collectively account for about 40% of our pre-pandemic sales where we have broad global businesses supported by Advantage Technologies. We expect a measurable rebuild of inventories in many of our end-use markets. 
Specific to PPG is year-over-year earnings growth in 2022 due to further synergy capture from our recent acquisitions. In closing, these continue to be dynamic times, but thanks to our more than 50,000 employees around the world, we are well positioned today and in the future. Their dedication and commitment to make it happen are reasons why our customers, our communities and our many stakeholders who can count on us and protect and beautify the world. 
Thank you for your continued confidence in PPG. This concludes our prepared remarks. Now Jason, would you please open the line for questions."

So those were the businesses most impacted. What I see though is, obviously, it's in our suppliers' best interest to continue to sort out their supply chains. And seasonally weak fourth quarter should give them adequate time to do that. 
Now the flip side is we have an extremely large backlog of demand right now. So anything that they can make in the fourth quarter, we're going to ship. So we feel very good about that. As you know, we've been a little bit more pessimistic and probably right about the supply chain issues.

Clearly, if you look at the inventory in the U.S., we're down about 1.5 million cars from where typical is. Inventories in China are less than 1 month as well. They're probably in the 25-day range. So that's 15 days less than they typically have. Europe has not been able to supplement what they need. And when you think about fleets, not just rental fleets, but fleets in general, they're short as well. So there's significant OEM demand out there. 
I would also tell you, from the refinish side, we can always tell when the lockdown's in, in every country because driving comes up and collisions come up and demand comes up. And there's very little inventory in the chain from that standpoint. And so we see that also being a strong positive. And then I guess, finally, I would tell you from aerospace, we see strong order books on the small plane. So A320s and 737 builds are going to come up. Once you start to see some international travel, then I expect Airbus and Boeing will get back to building the bigger planes. 
MRO is improving monthly. And now that Europe is getting a little bit more open, we expect MRO to improve better. So our catalyst for 2022 are strong. And if you then start building 787s on top of that, then our catalysts for 2023 get even better."

Our plants typically in China are running 2 shifts today, most of them, not all them run 3. And so the dual control issue that's happening in China where they're trying to reduce the amount of energy consumed as well as the energy per unit. We're in a very good position to be able to run off hours and consume the cheaper energy off hours. So that helps us from that standpoint. 
Industrial demand is down in China right now, but it's as much from lack of raw materials as it is from demand. As you know, we're not very big. In fact, I would say, almost negligible in the project market for architectural. So the challenges in that market are really not going to hurt us from that standpoint. But our kitchen and industrial bakeware business, our electronic materials business, our automotive business are all in good shape over there. Our Packaging business, double-digit kind of demand. So I feel good about China, both short-term and long term. And I think we have the team that can help us manage through the challenges that are over there. 
When I think about the higher prices today, I start first with, let's say, oil is $80. Well, $80 historically is not a high number. It would be -- what I would say is, if you say $70 has been the average, it's only marginally higher. So from a structural cost perspective, I think our consumers are going to be able to continue to have strong demand. So I'm not worried about that."

And at these commodity levels, I know our suppliers, and I've talked to a number of them, are focused on smoothing out the supply chain. 
And what I would tell you is they know we can sell, they know we're going to continue to consolidate the industry, they know we're going to win. And so they've been out there protecting PPG as much as they can within the limits of the force majeures. So I see these force majeures starting to decline in the fourth quarter.

We're expecting that to largely rectify in the beginning part of 2022.

They're also facing logistics challenges. They're also facing raw material challenges, and they buy a number of the things that we buy, maybe not to the level that we do, but they understand it.

But again, given the tightness of the supply chain right now, it's not coming through in absolute percentages, but we are starting to see, in certain raw materials, some abating. 
For us, though, I think what's most important is we've gone after structural price increases. The vast majority of the pricing that Michael alluded to, the 6% in Q3. Almost all of that is structural in nature. So we're changing unit pricing as opposed to surcharges.

We were much further ahead in the price increase. We've already done our second price increase in architectural Europe prior to us acquiring Tikkurila. They were on their first increase. They are now catching up. They have put in place new processes that will allow them to better process not just raw material inflation, but also the value creation that we bring to the market with our new technology.

When you think about the European business in deco and compare it to some of the other periphery businesses like the adhesives industry or construction sort of building materials, light building materials industry, and think in the context of the green wave and the renovation wave that will kick into Europe as we speak for the next few years. Do you think that paint and sort of adhesive building materials volume growth is sort of similar in trajectory? Or do you think that paint actually will slightly undergrow because of the higher penetration for a lot of these materials in the sort of increased insulation demand? That's my first question. 
And the second question is really around raw materials. So if you take a step back, I guess, you guys have lost probably 15% to 20% of supply because of Ida and Uri and all the other issues across your basket this year. Fundamentally speaking, do you think your suppliers have invested enough in things like epoxy, acrylic acid to support the growth that your industry is seeing?

So starting about mid-September, there was a lot of pressure to get the dual control initiatives underway and on target.

I will provide some comments to supplement the detailed financial results we released last evening.  
For the third quarter, we achieved record net sales of nearly $4.4 billion and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.69. As we communicated in early September, our sales and adjusted EPS were significantly impacted by worsening supply chain disruptions and increasing raw material cost inflation. Our raw material costs in the quarter inflated by about 25% year-over-year. For context, this is about 3x higher than any previous coatings raw material inflation peak in recent history.  
We're also experiencing elevated logistics costs and are incurring increased manufacturing costs due to the sporadic nature of these outages. Commercially, we have taken significant mitigation efforts due to the high level inflation through rapid implementation of structural selling price increases. In aggregate, our selling price realization is about 6%, with more than 6% price realization in our industrial reporting segment. Our price capture pace is much faster than previous inflationary cycles and we have further pricing initiatives underway.  
Coming into the quarter, we expect that the supply chain and customer production disruptions would impact our sales by about $150 million. However, this actual impact was more than $350 million. Additionally, this prevented us from completely fulfilling our strong order books and further depleted retail inventory in many of our end-use markets. We expect much of this demand will be deferred into 2022. And in particular, these current conditions will elongate the global automotive OEM recovery.  
To put the automotive OEM situation in perspective, U.S. dealer inventories had a record historic lows in the mid-20-day range. And in 2021, global production in this industry is expected to be about 20% below prior peak levels. Despite the current challenges, several of our businesses, including our Automotive Refinish, Protective and Marine, and Packaging Coatings delivered strong above-market performance, driven by our strong service capabilities and Advantage technology.  
Our PPG-Comex business achieved record third quarter sales with year-over-year organic sales growth of more than 10%. In addition, our U.S. Architectural Coatings business delivered about 10% same-store sales growth as we continue to expand our customer base with many new wins and increase our digital sales as a percentage of our total sales base.  
More generally, we continue to experience improving  trade in paint demand globally and Architectural DIY coatings sales returned closer to 2019 levels after notable growth last year, driven by the state home impacts. We remain focused on cost management, which is evidenced by our SG&A as a percent of sales being 100 basis points lower than the third quarter 2020. This is being supported by our ongoing execution on our structural cost savings programs as we delivered an incremental $35 million of savings in the third quarter.  
We continue to target and on track for our full year 2021 savings of about $135 million. In the quarter, we also continued to make good progress integrating our 5 recent acquisitions contributing to our overall earnings for the quarter. Our 2 larger acquisitions, Tikkurila and Ennis-Flint delivered good top line results despite the challenging supply constraints. We continue to expect them to deliver an aggregate of $25 million of synergies for the full year of 2021. We once again delivered strong operating cash flow during the quarter and had about $1.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents at the quarter end, including sequential reduction of our net debt by about $400 million.  
This was supported by our continuing strong working capital management as we maintain our positive step change improvement achieved last year and are at multiyear lows on a percentage of sales basis. While we will continue to evaluate accretive deals in our M&A pipeline, we are initiating stock repurchases in the fourth quarter, and we'll continue to focus on debt reduction.  
As a reminder, based on the seasonality of our businesses, the fourth quarter is typically our strongest cash generation quarter of the year. Also during the quarter, in support of further enhancing our ESG program, we were happy to announce an agreement with Constellation Energy to power our Carrollton, Texas manufacturing facility with 100% renewable solar energy. We are also working on our very first ever diversity report and developing science-based climate targets, both of which we will communicate in 2022. Equally important is PPG's market-leading sustainable products continue to enable our customers to meet their respective sustainability goals. We will continue to provide updates on these initiatives on subsequent quarters.  
In addition, I'm extremely pleased to announce that yesterday, PPG earned 3 R&D 100 Awards for 2021. The R&D World Magazine honors the 100 most innovative technologies and services over the past year with the R&D 100 Awards. Even more importantly, 2 of the 3 innovations that we were recognized are growth initiatives in electric vehicles, including BFPSE battery fire protection coating, which protects the vehicle occupants from fire and mitigate thermal runaway events plus ENVIROCRON, extreme protection thermally conductive dielectric powder for battery packs, providing dielectric protection and thermal conductivity. Our dielectric powder has already been commercialized by a leading EV maker and our battery fire protection product will launch in 2022 by one of the world's largest car makers.  
Moving to our outlook. We are continuing to evidence solid demand in aggregate. Many of our customers continue to indicate that their order books are at high levels and have lower than normal inventory levels. In the near term, we anticipate only modest improvements to the supply disruptions that we've been experiencing. Our estimate is that our sales are expected to be unfavorably impacted by about $250 million to $300 million in the fourth quarter, both for the semiconductor chip shortage issue and chronic supplier operational capabilities.  
Recent production curtailments in China may add incremental pressures to availability and inflation, and we expect our inflation to approach 30% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. As a result, all our businesses are securing additional selling price increases, and now we expect to fully offset raw material cost inflation in the early part of 2022.  
We continue to strongly believe there is sufficient capacity available in our supply chain as operating conditions continue to normalize.  Absent any further disruption, we expect supply chains to operate more normally by year's end, supported by normal seasonality trends. To provide further assistance and assurance of more consistent supply going forward, we are rapidly qualifying additional regional and global commodity suppliers across a variety of our key raw material procurement groupings. We expect these increases in product availability, coupled with continued improvement in the existing supply chain, will provide ample supply beginning early in 2022.  
While the current environment remains difficult to predict, I remain very optimistic about our specific growth catalyst for 2022. Specifically, we expect continued recovery in Automotive Refinish, OEM and Aerospace coatings, which collectively account for about 40% of our pre-pandemic sales where we have broad global businesses supported by Advantage technologies. We expect a measurable rebuild of inventories in many of our end-use markets.  
Specific to PPG is year-over-year earnings growth in 2022 due to further synergy capture from our recent acquisitions. In closing, these continue to be dynamic times, but thanks to our more than 50,000 employees around the world, we are well positioned today and in the future. Their dedication and commitment to make it happen are reasons why our customers, our communities and our many stakeholders who can count on us and protect and beautify the world.  
Thank you for your continued confidence in PPG. This concludes our prepared remarks. Now Jason, would you please open the line for questions."

So those were the businesses most impacted. What I see though is, obviously, it's in our suppliers' best interest to continue to sort out their supply chains. And seasonally weak fourth quarter should give them adequate time to do that.  
Now the flip side is we have an extremely large backlog of demand right now. So anything that they can make in the fourth quarter, we're going to ship. So we feel very good about that. As you know, we've been a little bit more pessimistic and probably right about the supply chain issues. And so we have put in, like we said on the call, an expectation of further challenges in the fourth quarter."

Clearly, if you look at the inventory in the U.S., we're down about 1.5 million cars from where typical is. Inventories in China are less than 1 month as well. They're probably in the 25-day range. So that's 15 days less than they typically have. Europe has not been able to supplement what they need. And when you think about fleets, not just rental fleets, but fleets in general, they're short as well. So there's significant OEM demand out there.  
I would also tell you, from the refinish side, we can always tell when the lockdown's in, in every country, because driving comes up and collisions come up and demand comes up. And there's very little inventory in the chain from that standpoint. And so we see that also being a strong positive. And then I guess, finally, I would tell you from Aerospace,  we see strong order books on the small planes. So A320s and 737 builds are going to come up. Once you start to see some international travel, then I expect Airbus and Boeing will get back to building the bigger planes.  
MRO is improving monthly. And now that Europe is getting a little bit more open, we expect MRO to improve even better. So our catalyst for 2022 are strong. And if you then start building 787s on top of that, then our catalysts for 2023 get even better."

Our plants typically in China are running 2 shifts today, most of them, not all them run 3. And so the dual control issue that's happening in China where they're trying to reduce the amount of energy consumed as well as the energy per unit, we're in a very good position to be able to run off hours and consume the cheaper energy off hours. So that helps us from that standpoint.  
Industrial demand is down in China right now, but it's as much from lack of raw materials as it is from demand. As you know, we're not very big. In fact, I would say, almost negligible in the project market for Architectural. So the challenges in that market are really not going to hurt us from that standpoint. But our kitchen and industrial bakeware business, our electronic materials business, our automotive business are all in good shape over there. Our Packaging business, double-digit kind of demand. So I feel good about China, both short-term and long term. And I think we have the team that can help us manage through the challenges that are over there.  
When I think about the higher prices today, I start first with, let's say, oil is $80. Well, $80 historically is not a high number. It would be -- what I would say is, if you say $70 has been the average, it's only marginally higher. So from a structural cost perspective, I think our consumers are going to be able to continue to have strong demand. So I'm not worried about that."

So we're stacking increases on top of increases. So one way you might think about this is whether or not somebody might be trying to catch up to where we are. And I think that's probably the most important thing.  
And the other thing I would say is make sure you look at inflation reported as well as margins. And for us, the ultimate end goal is margins. And I think our procurement team is doing a great job.

But again, given the tightness of the supply chain right now, it's not coming through in absolute percentages, but we are starting to see, in certain raw materials, some abating. For us, though, I think what's most important is we've gone after structural price increases. The vast majority of the pricing that Michael alluded to, the 6% in Q3. Almost all of that is structural in nature. So we're changing unit pricing as opposed to surcharges.

They have put in place new processes that will allow them to better process not just raw material inflation, but also the value creation that we bring to the market with our new technology.

October is a very large month for most coatings companies in the fourth quarter just due to seasonality. We've got a good read on October. We've got a good read on the next couple of weeks, at least, of demand and our ability to supply. So just given the size of the first month plus as it waits on the quarter, we have some level of confidence.  
That being said, things that could push it up or down, again, as Michael alluded to earlier, everything we can make today we could sell. So if we do get more raw materials, we are able to manufacture more, that would be a positive for the fourth quarter. As you alluded to, Kevin, there still could be some things out there that could suppress the ability to get raw materials like logistics and that would be a negative. But we think all the other variables, we have a fairly good handle on."

The second thing is we also generated a lot of cash in the fourth quarter. That's our strongest quarter for cash. So we're going to pay down debt as well as buy back stock.

The epoxy, especially in China, I'm anticipating that they will moderate the pricing demand as we get into the fourth quarter with seasonality, and that will provide some relief. And from an isocyanates, we did have some force majeures in that area. That will be coming off, I think, in the very near term. So those are the ones I'm paying attention to."

We would expect additional savings in 2022 as we continue to execute against the actions that we have previously outlined for that. And again, we'll give a number on that in January.  
More importantly and idiosyncratic for PPG, we do have synergy capture next year, typically 12 to 15 months after an acquisition, we start to realize additional structural synergies.

So the momentum in EV continues to build.  
From the beverages, that is going to continue to be strong. We're up double digits in beverage, and there's -- I've actually lost count of the number of plants. I think there's either 13 or 14 new plants that are in the process of being built. And those new plants will need a lot of coatings.

Or do you think that paint actually will slightly under grow because of the higher penetration for a lot of these materials in the sort of increased insulation demand? That's my first question.  
And the second question is really around raw materials. So if you take a step back, I guess, you guys have lost probably 15% to 20% of supply because of Ida and Uri and all the other issues across your basket this year. Fundamentally speaking, do you think your suppliers have invested enough in things like epoxy, acrylic acid to support the growth that your industry is seeing?

And then the one that got impacted last, but somewhat meaningful was the dual control issue in China that started late in September because there were a lot of government edicts, people were supposed to meet their quarterly goals, and they were not on track to meet the quarterly goals. So starting about mid-September, there was a lot of pressure to get the dual control initiatives underway and then on target. And then China, when they set targets, you can almost rest assured they're going to hit those targets. 
So that's the way -- there was no real material challenges in Latin America. They came out of the U.S., but we were able to manage through most of those."

I will provide some comments to supplement the detailed financial results we released last evening.  
For the third quarter, we achieved record net sales of nearly $4.4 billion and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.69. As we communicated in early September, our sales and adjusted EPS were significantly impacted by worsening supply chain disruptions and increasing raw material cost inflation. Our raw material costs in the quarter inflated by about 25% year-over-year. For context, this is about 3x higher than any previous coatings raw material inflation peak in recent history.  
We're also experiencing elevated logistics costs and are incurring increased manufacturing costs due to the sporadic nature of these outages. Commercially, we have taken significant mitigation efforts due to the high level inflation through rapid implementation of structural selling price increases. In aggregate, our selling price realization is about 6%, with more than 6% price realization in our industrial reporting segment. Our price capture pace is much faster than previous inflationary cycles and we have further pricing initiatives underway.  
Coming into the quarter, we expect that the supply chain and customer production disruptions would impact our sales by about $150 million. However, this actual impact was more than $350 million. Additionally, this prevented us from completely fulfilling our strong order books and further depleted retail inventory in many of our end-use markets. We expect much of this demand will be deferred into 2022. And in particular, these current conditions will elongate the global automotive OEM recovery.  
To put the automotive OEM situation in perspective, U.S. dealer inventories had record historic lows in the mid-20-day range. And in 2021, global production in this industry is expected to be about 20% below prior peak levels. Despite the current challenges, several of our businesses, including our Automotive Refinish, Protective and Marine, and Packaging Coatings delivered strong above-market performance, driven by our strong service capabilities and advantaged technology.  
Our PPG-Comex business achieved record third quarter sales with year-over-year organic sales growth of more than 10%. In addition, our U.S. Architectural Coatings business delivered about 10% same-store sales growth as we continue to expand our customer base with many new wins and increase our digital sales as a percentage of our total sales base.  
More generally, we continue to experience improving trade painter demand globally and Architectural DIY coatings sales returned closer to 2019 levels after notable growth last year, driven by the state-at-home impacts. We remain focused on cost management, which is evidenced by our SG&A as a percent of sales being 100 basis points lower than the third quarter 2020. This is being supported by our ongoing execution on our structural cost savings programs as we delivered an incremental $35 million of savings in the third quarter.  
We continue to target and on track for our full year 2021 savings of about $135 million. In the quarter, we also continued to make good progress integrating our 5 recent acquisitions contributing to our overall earnings for the quarter. Our 2 larger acquisitions, Tikkurila and Ennis-Flint delivered good top line results despite the challenging supply constraints. We continue to expect them to deliver an aggregate of $25 million of synergies for the full year of 2021. We once again delivered strong operating cash flow during the quarter and had about $1.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents at the quarter end, including sequential reduction of our net debt by about $400 million.  
This was supported by our continuing strong working capital management as we maintain our positive step change improvement achieved last year and are at multiyear lows on a percentage of sales basis. While we will continue to evaluate accretive deals in our M&A pipeline, we are initiating stock repurchases in the fourth quarter, and we'll continue to focus on debt reduction.  
As a reminder, based on the seasonality of our businesses, the fourth quarter is typically our strongest cash generation quarter of the year. Also during the quarter, in support of further enhancing our ESG program, we were happy to announce an agreement with Constellation Energy to power our Carrollton, Texas manufacturing facility with 100% renewable solar energy. We are also working on our very first ever diversity report and developing science-based climate targets, both of which we will communicate in 2022. Equally important is PPG's market-leading sustainable products continue to enable our customers to meet their respective sustainability goals. We will continue to provide updates on these initiatives on subsequent quarters.  
In addition, I'm extremely pleased to announce that yesterday, PPG earned 3 R&D 100 Awards for 2021. The R&D World Magazine honors the 100 most innovative technologies and services over the past year with the R&D 100 Awards. Even more importantly, 2 of the 3 innovations that we were recognized are growth initiatives in electric vehicles, including BFPSE battery fire protection coating, which protects the vehicle occupants from fire and mitigates thermal runaway events, plus ENVIROCRON, Extreme Protection thermally conductive dielectric powder for battery packs, providing dielectric protection and thermal conductivity. Our dielectric powder has already been commercialized by a leading EV maker and our battery fire protection product will launch in 2022 by one of the world's largest car makers.  
Moving to our outlook. We are continuing to evidence solid demand in aggregate. Many of our customers continue to indicate that their order books are at high levels and have lower than normal inventory levels. In the near term, we anticipate only modest improvements to the supply disruptions that we've been experiencing. Our estimate is that our sales are expected to be unfavorably impacted by about $250 million to $300 million in the fourth quarter, both for the semiconductor chip shortage issue and chronic supplier operational capabilities.  
Recent production curtailments in China may add incremental pressures to availability and inflation, and we expect our inflation to approach 30% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. As a result, all our businesses are securing additional selling price increases, and now we expect to fully offset raw material cost inflation in the early part of 2022.  
We continue to strongly believe there is sufficient capacity available in our supply chain as operating conditions continue to normalize.  Absent any further disruption, we expect supply chains to operate more normally by year's end, supported by normal seasonality trends. To provide further assistance and assurance of more consistent supply going forward, we are rapidly qualifying additional regional and global commodity suppliers across a variety of our key raw material procurement groupings. We expect these increases in product availability, coupled with continued improvement in the existing supply chain, will provide ample supply beginning early in 2022.  
While the current environment remains difficult to predict, I remain very optimistic about our specific growth catalysts for 2022. Specifically, we expect continued recovery in Automotive Refinish, OEM and Aerospace coatings, which collectively account for about 40% of our pre-pandemic sales where we have broad global businesses supported by advantaged technologies. We expect a measurable rebuild of inventories in many of our end-use markets.  
Specific to PPG is year-over-year earnings growth in 2022 due to further synergy capture from our recent acquisitions. In closing, these continue to be dynamic times, but thanks to our more than 50,000 employees around the world, we are well positioned today and in the future. Their dedication and commitment to making it happen are reasons why our customers, our communities and our many stakeholders who can count on us and protect and beautify the world.  
Thank you for your continued confidence in PPG. This concludes our prepared remarks. Now Jason, would you please open the line for questions."

So those were the businesses most impacted. What I see though is, obviously, it's in our suppliers' best interest to continue to sort out their supply chains. And seasonally weak fourth quarter should give them adequate time to do that.  
Now the flip side is we have an extremely large backlog of demand right now. So anything that they can make in the fourth quarter, we're going to ship. So we feel very good about that. As you know, we've been a little bit more pessimistic and probably right about the supply chain issues. And so we have put in, like we said on the call, an expectation of further challenges in the fourth quarter."

Let's start with auto OEM. Clearly, if you look at the inventory in the U.S., we're down about 1.5 million cars from where typical is. Inventories in China are less than 1 month as well. They're probably in the 25-day range.",243,"Okay. Well, that's a mouthful. Let's start with auto OEM. Clearly, if you look at the inventory in the U.S., we're down about 1.5 million cars from where typical is. Inventories in China are less than 1 month as well. They're probably in the 25-day range. So that's 15 days less than they typically have. Europe has not been able to supplement what they need. And when you think about fleets, not just rental fleets, but fleets in general, they're short as well. So there's significant OEM demand out there.  
I would also tell you, from the refinish side, we can always tell when the lockdowns end in every country, because driving comes up and collisions come up and demand comes up. And there's very little inventory in the chain from that standpoint. And so we see that also being a strong positive. And then I guess, finally, I would tell you from Aerospace,  we see strong order books on the small planes. So A320s and 737 builds are going to come up. Once you start to see some international travel, then I expect Airbus and Boeing will get back to building the bigger planes.  
MRO is improving monthly. And now that Europe is getting a little bit more open, we expect MRO to improve even better. So our catalyst for 2022 are strong. And if you then start building 787s on top of that, then our catalysts for 2023 get even better."

Our plants typically in China are running 2 shifts a day, most of them, not all of them run 3. And so the dual control issue that's happening in China where they're trying to reduce the amount of energy consumed as well as the energy per unit, we're in a very good position to be able to run off hours and consume the cheaper energy off hours. So that helps us from that standpoint.  
Industrial demand is down in China right now, but it's as much from lack of raw materials as it is from demand. As you know, we're not very big. In fact, I would say, almost negligible in the project market for Architectural. So the challenges in that market are really not going to hurt us from that standpoint. But our kitchen and industrial bakeware business, our electronic materials business, our automotive business are all in good shape over there. Our Packaging business, double-digit kind of demand. So I feel good about China, both short-term and long term. And I think we have the team that can help us manage through the challenges that are over there.  
When I think about the higher prices today, I start first with, let's say, oil is $80. Well, $80 historically is not a high number. It would be -- what I would say is, if you say $70 has been the average, it's only marginally higher. So from a structural cost perspective, I think our consumers are going to be able to continue to have strong demand. So I'm not worried about that."

The other side of the equation is the supplier -- commodity supplier force majeures that Michael just alluded to.  
We're expecting that to largely rectify in the beginning part of 2022. We will be able to supply our customers and more importantly, rebuild inventories which is a piece of the equation that's missing here. So that -- those shortages we're seeing in 2021, they'll go back into our customer inventories throughout the year of 2022.

So the magnitude of the increases are historic, but so is the amount of inflation. Our teams feel very good about this. Our customers are well aware of what's going on. They also need product. They're also facing logistics challenges. They're also facing raw material challenges, and they buy a number of the things that we buy, maybe not to the level that we do, but they understand it.

But again, given the tightness of the supply chain right now, it's not coming through in absolute percentages, but we are starting to see, in certain raw materials, some abating. For us, though, I think what's most important is we've gone after structural price increases. The vast majority of the pricing that Michael alluded to, the 6% in Q3. Almost all of that is structural in nature. So we're changing unit pricing as opposed to surcharges.

Myself and Tim Knavish were in Europe, like within days when Tikkurila closed. That was the first thing on the agenda, was pricing.  
We were much further ahead in the price increase. We had already done our second price increase in Architectural Europe prior to us acquiring Tikkurila. They were on their first increase. They are now catching up. They have put in place new processes that will allow them to better process not just raw material inflation, but also the value creation that we bring to the market with our new technology.

But what I would tell you is, for us, any time that we might lose some share, get punished for raising price, we get it back very quickly as they roll out new programs because they have to put the finest technology out there on the newest programs to compete in that market because of hypercompetitive from an appearance and performance standpoint. So I'm not worried too much about that. We've been pushing the team to continue to raise price appropriately, and that's what we're doing."

They typically command the value for the technology. We've seen good pricing as evidenced by the segment pricing. Two of these businesses fall in performance. Performance pricing is up 6%. They're very big businesses. So they're going to have an impact on the segment.  
The automotive business is our biggest business in Industrial. So it's going to have, again, an outsized impact on the aggregate pricing. So again, we're capturing pricing collectively across the portfolio, but -- and it's not differential based on the 60-40."

Automotive clearly has not prevented it. The Automotive guys would like every halo coating that we can provide through, they would definitely -- would like to get more. And then from the Aerospace side, as you know, it's a very technology-driven business. And so -- and it's a very spec-driven business. And so our ability to get price on the MRO side is actually pretty good. So that has not been impacted either.  
So when I look at the catalysts for 2022, these businesses are certainly going to be a strong contributor to the increase in earnings for next year."

You would expect and it's accurate that the earnings seasonality is even more pronounced. These are businesses that have a fixed cost base, especially Architectural. So you do get more leverage -- there's more leverage on the peak sales quarters, and there's certainly less leverage on the sales quarters on either end of the peak. So definitely more pronounced earnings impact in Q1 and Q4. And we'll see the reciprocal of that, Duffy, in Q2 next year. We didn't have Tikkurila for the vast portion of Q2 2021.

Firstly, on growth, actually. When you think about the European business in deco and compare it to some of the other periphery businesses like the adhesives industry or construction, sort of building materials, light  building materials industry, and think in the context of the green wave and the renovation wave that will kick into Europe as we speak for the next few years. Do you think that paint and sort of adhesive building materials volume growth is sort of similar in trajectory? Or do you think that paint actually will slightly under grow because of the higher penetration for a lot of these materials in the sort of increased insulation demand? That's my first question.  
And the second question is really around raw materials. So if you take a step back, I guess, you guys have lost probably 15% to 20% of supply because of Ida and Uri and all the other issues across your basket this year. Fundamentally speaking, do you think your suppliers have invested enough in things like epoxy, acrylic acid to support the growth that your industry is seeing? In other words, do you think that even if supply normalizes, utilization in these products will remain high and therefore, you will always remain a bit susceptible to a storm or 2?"

So starting about mid-September, there was a lot of pressure to get the dual control initiatives underway and on target.
