Before turning to our financial results and our future perspective, I'd like to make a few comments about this morning's other announcement. It has been a distinct honor and privilege to serve this great company as its CEO over the past decades. I thank all of my Merck colleagues for their extraordinary support throughout this period. We are making this leadership change to cure in the knowledge that Merck has the elements in place for a strong future of scientific innovation and profitable growth. 
Rob Davis is well prepared and well suited to help capitalize on the many exciting opportunities before it, as well as to take on the challenges that lie ahead. He and the Merck senior team will provide outstanding leadership for our company in the coming years. Given Merck's current position of strength, the Merck Board and I believe it is a good time to begin transitioning the company's day-to-day decision-making as well as a strategic direction to Rob, who will assume the title of President in April. At which point our operating divisions, human health, animal health, manufacturing and research, will begin reporting to him. 
I will retire as CEO at the end of June, but remain for some period of time as Executive Chairman to assist Rob, Dean and the rest of the senior team. I am extremely confident in the capabilities and commitment of Merck's people and Rob's ability to guide the company to an even brighter future. 
Moving on to our results. Despite challenges from the pandemic, Merck achieved solid growth in revenues and earnings in 2020, made meaningful advancements in our pipeline and added important assets through business development. Despite the particular impact to our portfolio, the underlying demand for our innovative medicines and vaccines remain strong. And our initial guidance reflects our expectation for a return to strong growth this year, 2021. 
Looking out to 2024, we continue to believe our revenue potential is underappreciated. Longer term, the work we are doing in advancing our internal pipeline and in adding assets through business development, gives us increasing line of sight to significant potential growth drivers later this decade and into the next. I'm amazed by the dedication of our employees who rallied to keep supply uninterrupted, regulatory filings on track and clinical and commercial execution in line with our goals. And I remain continually inspired by what Merck accomplishes for patients around the world. 
I'm also encouraged by the progress scientific experts across the biopharmaceutical industry have achieved in bringing vaccines to market that will help address the pandemic and start to return the world to normalcy. These successes further underscore the societal value of our industry's ongoing investments in science and innovation. Merck remains committed to developing an effective response to COVID-19 also. We have discontinued development of our COVID-19 vaccine candidate, but our therapeutic research programs continue to move forward. We believe that our oral antiviral candidate molnupiravir could make an important contribution to treating COVID-19 patients, and we look forward to seeing the results of our pivotal trials. 
More recently, we acquired OncoImmune and have accelerated the development of MK-7110, a Phase III candidate with strong potential in the treatment of severe and critical COVID-19 patients. I am encouraged by the innovative research happening in our lab, not just on the COVID front, but across our broad late-stage pipeline of promising medicines and vaccines, including in oncology, HIV and pneumococcal disease. We remain highly focused on business development to enhance our internal pipeline. 
We completed 120 transactions in total in 2020, including important acquisitions, such as OncoImmune, VelosBio and ArQule and collaborations, including CGEN and Ridgeback. Our plan to spin-off Organon remains on track for completion late in the second quarter. As independent, more focused company, I'm confident Merck and Organon will have the ability to more effectively pursue their respective market opportunities and business strategy to bring more value to patients and to shareholders. 
Let me conclude by expressing my confidence in the leaders of this company and how proud I am of the Merck team's success in advancing our pipeline and maintaining business continuity in a challenging environment. Additionally, I'd like to recognize and thank the frontline health care workers, scientists and government officials working together to bring the world back to normalcy. And with that, I'll pass it on to my colleague, Rob, to review the details of our performance and our outlook."
288502,700595323,2191630,"Merck & Co., Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2021",2021-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Merck & Co., Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone.

I look forward to continuing the important work we do to bring our medicines and vaccines to the people who need them. Under my leadership, Merck will remain focused on scientific innovation as the source of sustained long-term value for both patients and shareholders. 
Ken's unrelenting commitment to excellence and scientific innovation with patients at the center of everything we do permeates the culture of the company and its employees. Under Ken's leadership, Merck has achieved improved growth, clinical success, most notably with KEYTRUDA, and a revitalized pipeline and discovery research capability that will benefit both the company and the patients we serve for many years to come. 
Ken has put us in a position of financial and operational strength, from which we will be able to pursue our important mission to save and sustain lives through ongoing scientific innovation. The company has benefited from Ken's leadership. I personally and professionally benefited from his mentorship and guidance and want to thank him for that. Issues won't be easy to fill in so many ways, both within Merck but also including his many principled and valuable contributions to import issues facing society today. The talent and commitment of Merck's employees worldwide, however, make me extremely confident that we will achieve continued success through this transition and long into the future as we build on Ken's legacy. 
Now turning to the business. Our resilience in a year that brought us countless challenges amidst the global pandemic is a true testament to the talent, hard work and dedication of Merck employees worldwide. Our performance in this environment reinforces the confidence we have in our science-led strategy and in our potential for strong growth in 2021 and beyond. Underlying demand for our key growth pillars allowed our business to deliver 2% growth year-over-year or 4% excluding the impact of exchange, while absorbing approximately $2.5 billion of negative pandemic impact to revenues. Were it not for the pandemic impacts, we estimate growth for the year would have been approximately 9% ex exchange. 
Now turning to our fourth quarter results. Total company revenues were $12.5 billion, an increase of 5% year-over-year, both nominally and excluding the impact of foreign currency. Fourth quarter results were negatively impacted by approximately $400 million due to the pandemic. Excluding this impact, fourth quarter revenues would have grown by approximately 9% ex exchange. 
The remainder of my comments will be on an ex exchange basis. Our Human Health revenues increased 6%. In Oncology, KEYTRUDA sales in the quarter grew 27% to $4 billion and for the year by 30% to $14 billion. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA continues to maintain its leadership position in lung cancer and is benefiting from strong usage across all key tumor types. We continue to see strong growth outside of lung cancer, including in renal and endometrial carcinomas, and further uptake in our Q6 weekly dosing regimen. 
Outside the U.S., KEYTRUDA growth continues to be driven by lung cancer indications. Uptake from KEYNOTE-189 in newly imbursed markets for KEYNOTE-407 and remain the key growth drivers in the EU. In Japan, price adjustments in the first half of the year more than offset underlying volume growth. LYNPARZA and LENVIMA continue to demonstrate strong growth and are meaningful contributors to our broader oncology portfolio, growing 53% and 26%, respectively, year-over-year. 
Our vaccines portfolio continues to be impacted by below normal wellness visits, particularly in the United States. [indiscernible] sales grew year-over-year, mostly reflecting the impact from the $120 million CDC stockpile replenishment in the quarter and the initial $120 million borrowing in the fourth quarter of 2019, which had a combined positive impact of $240 million year-over-year. 
Our hospital performance showed continued improvement in the fourth quarter. [ Region ] sales grew 13% year-over-year, driven by continued market share gains, offset in part by lower elective surgery procedures. Our Animal Health business again delivered a strong quarter with sales of $1.2 billion and 6% growth. Companion Animal grew 9%, reflecting demand for companion animal vaccines and parasiticides. Livestock grew 4%, primarily reflecting an extra month of sales from the acquisition of [ Antelliq, ] partially offset by distributor purchasing patterns. 
Turning to the rest of our P&L. My comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 73% in the quarter, an increase of 0.4 percentage points, driven by favorable product mix and manufacturing variances, partially offset by higher inventory write-offs due to a recall of Zerbaxa, pricing pressure and foreign exchange. Operating expenses grew 4% year-over-year to $5.4 billion. COVID had a largely neutral impact as operating savings were offset by incremental spend to advance our COVID-19 research programs. 
Operating expenses in the quarter reflect overall growth in R&D spending, as well as a donation to the Merck Foundation. Other income increased year-over-year driven by income from equity securities. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 15.3%, a decrease of 1.6 percentage points from a year ago due to favorable earnings mix. Taken together, we earned $1.32 per share, an increase of 17%. 
Now before detailing our 2021 outlook, I want to highlight that our press release details reporting changes we will be implementing beginning in the first quarter that are reflected in our guidance ranges. These changes result in a better alignment between our non-GAAP results and the underlying operational performance of our company and improved unpredictable quarter-to-quarter volatility. While these changes will have an impact on our non-GAAP results going forward, there is no impact to cash flow. 
Turning to 2021 guidance. For Merck, we expect revenues of $51.8 billion to $53.8 billion, which represents growth of 8% to 12% versus 2020, and excludes any potential revenue from our COVID therapeutics. This range assumes a positive impact from foreign exchange of roughly 2 percentage points using mid-January rates. We assume full year pandemic impacts to be approximately 2% or roughly $1 billion, largely in the first half of the year. 
Our gross margin will be roughly 77% including a benefit of 1.8 percentage points due to the reporting change. We expect operating expenses to grow at a high single-digit to low double-digit rate. Normalized for the impact of COVID, operating expenses would be expected to grow closer to mid-single digits. We expect other expense of $400 million in our other income and expense line, driven largely by net interest expense. Under our prior reporting, we would have guided to an expected $400 million of income, resulting in an $800 million unfavorable swing. This difference is driven by an expected gain on the amount sale of Preventice, mark-to-market gains on our fund holdings, which include our indirect investment in Moderna, and other expected investment gains that will now be excluded from non GAAP. 
We expect our full year tax rate to be between 15% and 16%. And we anticipate 2.53 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we expect our non-GAAP EPS to be between $6.48 to $6.68, which reflects growth of 12% to 15% versus 2020 recast EPS. This range includes a positive impact from foreign exchange of roughly 3 percentage points. Our EPS growth under the new reporting convention benefits from the removal of the disproportionate mark-to-market equity gains we recorded in 2020. Importantly, however, under either reporting method, we expect strong operating margin leverage of 1 percentage point or more in 2021. The benefit to our 2021 EPS guidance is only $0.08 under new reporting versus previous reporting. 
We will continue to monitor the ongoing impact of the pandemic on wellness visits and delay procedures as we move into and through 2021. We remain confident in our ability to grow both in the near and long term, driven by our portfolio of derisked and innovative assets. 
Now turning to Organon. We are on track to complete the spin-off of Organon, which we expect will take place in the second quarter -- I should say, late in the second quarter. The strategic merits of this transaction are even more clear as we sit here today. In 2020, we brought the products we will spin-off as part of Organon, achieved revenues of $6.5 billion. The high level metrics for organ on that we provided a year ago remain largely unchanged. We expect Organon to achieve 2021 revenues of $6 billion to $6.5 billion. Off of this base and has the negative impact of the loss of exclusivity on key brands diminishes, we expect Organon to achieve longer-term revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits. 
As a stand-alone company post spin, we continue to expect Organon's operating margins to be in the mid-30% range and to increase over time. This compares to a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 45% within Merck, with the difference reflecting additional costs Organon will incur to operate as an independent company. EBITDA margins are now expected to be in the high 30% range initially and are expected to grow over time. This is a slight decrease from our prior guidance due to a lower proportion of capital assets transferred to Organon versus our initial expectations. 
We expect Organon to have initial debt of $9 billion to $9.5 billion. Merck expects to receive a special tax-free dividend of $8.5 billion to $9 billion prior to the spin. We continue to expect Organon to pay a meaningful dividend that will be entirely incremental to that of Merck. For Merck, spinoff of Organon is expected to enable incremental operating efficiencies of approximately $1.5 billion over 3 years, including approximately $500 million in 2021, which is included in our guidance. 
We now expect to deliver operating margins of greater than 42% in 2024, an increase of 2 percentage points versus our prior expectation of greater than 40% as a result of the impact of the reporting change. For modeling purposes, please be aware that Merck will continue to incur overhead costs previously allocated to the Organon products, which we estimate to be approximately $400 million on a full year basis. These stranded costs will be reduced over time and are netted into the overall efficiency target. 
To conclude, the strength and resilience of our business in 2021 -- 2020 reinforces our confidence as we begin the new year. Demand for our key growth drivers remains intact, and we are confident that we will deliver strong growth in 2021 and long into the future. We will continue to use our strong financial position to invest meaningfully in our pipeline, capitalizing both internal and external opportunities, and to make the right strategic decisions like the spin-off of Organon to position our company for continued success. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken."

This is why we planned carefully for Dr. Roger Perlmutter's retirement and the transition of leadership of the Merck Research Laboratories to Dr. Dean Li, who I'm pleased to welcome to today's call. 
Dean is a physician scientist who has a keen understanding of Merck's mission, dedication and science in our early and late-stage assets. He has hands-on experience leading key areas of research, including early discovery in translational medicine, while under Roger's leadership at Merck, as well as in his prior role where he exploited new technologies to found companies and was a leader in an academic health care delivery system. 
We believe he is uniquely positioned to take on this important role and advance Merck's promising pipeline.

I'm delighted to be here for my first earnings call as Head of Merck Research Laboratories. And so for my remarks today, I will provide an update on our COVID research effort, cover key regulatory milestones, clinical updates and recent business development, first in our oncology pipeline and then the broader pipeline. 
Regarding our COVID-19 research programs, Merck has made the decision to discontinue development of its vaccine candidate, V590 and V591. This decision was based on clinical finding from Phase I study showing that, while the vaccines were well tolerated, immune responses were inferior to those observed with natural infection and those reported for other authorized COVID vaccines. We are grateful to our collaborators and the volunteers who participated in this trial. Our COVID-19 efforts now shift, advancing our 2 therapeutic candidates, molnupiravir, often known as MK-4482 and MK-7110. Our orally available antiviral candidate molnupiravir, which we are developing in collaboration with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, continues to progress in our Phase II/III trials studying hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients. The primary completion date is in May 2021, but it is possible that we may have interim efficacy data in the first quarter which, of course, we would share publicly, if meaningful. 
Molnupiravir has the potential to play an important role in the current pandemic as well as other emerging novel coronavirus infections. We have been scaling production capacity and expect to have over 10 million courses of therapy available by the end of 2021. We recently added the second candidate to address COVID-19 through the acquisition of OncoImmune. This agent, MK-7110 is a recombinant fusion protein administered by IV infusion that targets the novel immune checkpoint. Final results are expected in our -- in the clinical trial in the first quarter. 
Turning to oncology. In the fourth quarter, KEYTRUDA received an additional new approval in the U.S. in combination with chemotherapy for first-line treatment of patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, whose tumors express PD-L1 had a combined proportional score of 10 or greater. The approval was based on progression-free survival results from KEYNOTE-355, and this marks the 17th tumor type for which KEYTRUDA has been approved. 
Also in the last quarter, the FDA accepted a supplemental New Drug Application with priority review for KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy in previously untreated patients with esophageal carcinoma regardless of PD-L1 expression based on KEYNOTE-590. These results demonstrated clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival, progression-free survival, and overall response rate. The FDA target action date is April 13. 
Working with our partners at Eisai, we are pleased to note positive results from the KEYNOTE-581 trial for KEYTRUDA plus 1 [ VMA ] versus sunitinib for first-line treatment of renal cell carcinoma. The study demonstrated statistically significant improvements across primary and secondary endpoints, and these data will be presented at ASCO GU next week. 
We also announced at KEYNOTE-775, evaluating KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA for treatment of second-line endometrial carcinoma, which stopped early. The independent data monitoring committee reported that KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA demonstrated a significant improvement across all endpoints versus chemotherapy. The success of KEYNOTE-581 and KEYNOTE-775 reinforces the opportunity presented by the combination of KEYTRUDA in the multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, LENVIMA. We continue to explore this combination in 19 studies spanning multiple tumor types. 
Now looking ahead, we look forward to meeting with the FDA's Oncologic Drug Advisory Committee to discuss data from the third interim analysis from KEYNOTE-522, evaluating neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment of patients with early-stage, triple-negative breast cancer as compared with an alternative regimen. The DLA that includes data from this study is currently under FDA review with a PDUFA date next month. 
Business development remains a priority. In the fourth quarter, we completed the acquisition of VelosBio, whose lead candidate, VLS-101, known as MK-2140, is [ Aror 1 ] targeted antibody drug conjugate currently being evaluated in a Phase II study of patients with solid tumor and in Phase I for patients with hematologic malignancies. This opportunity, along with the [ LIVE 1 ] antibody-drug conjugates that we are developing in partnership with Seagen underscores our commitment to investigating tumor-targeted chemotherapy using next-generation antibody drug conjugate. 
Now as part of our strategy to explore new tumor targeting technology, we recently entered collaborations with A2 Biotherapeutics and Ortiva Biotherapeutics aimed at evaluating opportunities for key and NK cell therapy and a third collaboration with Genic Therapeutics on their T-cell engager technology. These collaborations, along with work already underway with Dragonfly Therapeutics to design targeted NK cell engagers, support our commitment to tumor targeting technologies. 
Now turning to our broader pipeline. We continue to progress our suite of pneumococcal vaccine candidate, V114, V116 and V117. Each one is designed for targeted production against prevalent pneumococcal disease serotypes across different age groups. [indiscernible] V114, our 15 villent pneumococcal vaccine candidate was recently granted priority review by the FDA for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease in adults. The target action date is July 18. 
Adults administered V114 produced comparable levels of antibodies for all serotypes in the currently available conjugate vaccines with higher responses observed for serotype 3, one of the most common causes of invasive pneumococcal diseases in adults and in children. Robust response to unique disease-causing serotypes, 22F and 33F, were also observed. Now in the U.S., serotypes 22F and 33F have been linked, the 13% of invasive pneumococcal disease seen among adults aged 65 and older; and in Europe, 7% to 12% of adult cases. Our V114 Phase III pediatric studies are on track, and we anticipate results from these trials this year. In 
In addition to V114, we are progressing our adult and pediatric next-gen vaccines, V116 and V117. The infectious disease space is [ Logerfo, ] our novel nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor for HIV, continues to progress in both the treatment and in-the-prep setting. In the prep setting, we expect to begin recruitment soon for 2 new Phase III trials, IMPOWER 22 and IMPOWER 24 in different populations at high-risk of acquiring HIV infection. 
Now IMPOWER 22 will evaluate the efficacy and safety of [ Islatravir ] as a once-monthly oral capsule in adult women and adolescent girls. IMPOWER 24 will evaluate the same regimen in men who have sex with men and transgender women who have sex with men. Also, in the prep setting, positive interim results from the Phase II trial evaluating [ islatravir ] as a once-monthly oral prep regimen were recently presented at HIV Research for Prevention 2021. These interim results show that is [indiscernible] achieved the efficacy pharmakinetic threshold at each of the 2 doses study, 60 milligrams and 120 milligrams, and that these doses are well tolerated. These findings offer further evidence for the potential of [ islatravir ] to provide a monthly oral prep option for people at risk of acquiring HIV. 
Now in addition, as we announced previously, we are advancing MKA 507, our non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, in combination with islatravir into a Phase II study as a potential once-weekly oral treatment option. This weekly islatravir MKA 507 combination builds on the once-daily islatravir plus doravirine combination currently in Phase III, a Phase III study, which we expect to start to read out in the second half of 2021. 
Finally, we received FDA approval for [indiscernible] following priority review. This new option for patients who experienced worsening heart failure built on our commitment to develop therapies for patients with cardiovascular disease. We at Merck Research Laboratories are well positioned to continue to take full advantage of our [indiscernible] strength in oncology and vaccine while investing in other therapeutic areas, exploring new modalities and complementing and supplementing our internal pipeline with external opportunities. 
I will now turn the call back to Peter."

Looking at both what we can do to extend the breadth of KEYTRUDA's reach to the number of patients it serves as well as its efficacy through combinations as well as broadening into other oncology fields and broader mechanisms, which we have. So that all will be continue to be where we will focus our efforts. 
As we look at that, we realize, though, we will need to continue to do business development to augment that, and we are committed to that. We've been pretty consistent in talking about the urgency we have around business development. That hasn't changed. That won't change. But what also won't change is we will do it when we see an alignment of strategy and value that is tied with our scientific endeavor and that -- so that is really the way we look. But as we started to highlight even at the JPMorgan conference, I think people under appreciate what we have as growth opportunities as we start to move into that 2028 and beyond time frame. 
Clearly, we have a real opportunity to continue to grow between now and then with KEYTRUDA. But I think actually, we will have an opportunity to grow beyond them through all of the things I mentioned. So more of the same from that regard. And then with regard to Animal Health, we continue to see Animal Health as a strategic part of this business. If you look at the growth that business delivers, it's best-in-class within the animal health space. It's accretive to the overall position for Merck and we are investing in it. And I think it is positioned to continue to show very strong growth, both through the existing products it has, but also through a very good portfolio of pipeline products which is leveraging the synergies we have with the MRL function we have on the human health side. 
So as we sit here, looking forward, I continue to see animal health as a core part of our strategy. And as we've said, we always are looking at our portfolio, but everything I see tells me that this is something we will maintain and grow because we are the most advantaged owner, in my mind."

With a fresh pair of eyes under Dean's leadership, should we assume that the status quo remains intact or whether another look at cabotegravir is the combination may be interesting? And then secondly, perhaps you could comment on whether, in the prep setting, you can bridge -- you can bridge islatravir to explore different delivery formulations, including very long-acting without running separate trials?"

And one way to think about it is with the lens that we believe that this can be a foundational medicine, both in prep and in treatment. And the favorable attribute to recognize is PK dosing schedule, route of administration, resistant profile, tissue levels and combinability. And so the question in relationship to treatment is, I've laid out what we're doing once daily, once weekly, but if this molecule is as foundational as we believe it is, this is something that could combine with many different mechanisms and many different molecules. I can just tell you that integrase inhibitors, which is cabotegravir, that's an important class. It's an important class that's actually very dear to Merck. And so that needs to be looked at carefully. 
And then [indiscernible], which you allude to, that's a new mechanism. And we believe that islatravir is a foundational medicine should -- we should look at the full array of combinations that can be achieved because we believe it's foundational, and we believe that, that foundation can provide a lot of benefit for many different patients and we should look at all combinations possible that would allow us to prove that and to show that."

But what we've also been clear to say is that we're not looking to just grow cash to grow cash, and we're not looking to drive up our credit rating. 
So over time, if we don't find those opportunities to utilize the cash for business development, eventually, we will return it to shareholders. And that's on an ongoing basis.

Science will take us to the areas to look. But likewise, we've been clear to say we're not foreclosed to larger scale deals, always looking at the size, more in terms of its disruption and complexity than in dollar terms. 
We obviously recognize the need to continue to augment the pipeline, to augment our revenue potential. So we're looking at those as well.

If you look back at my career and what I've done, I've spent my whole career dedicated to health care and to the pharmaceutical industry. And the time I began at Eli Lilly, where I spent nearly 15 years before moving on to Baxter and saw a different view of the business, running the diversified med tech side of that company before coming to Merck. So I have a broad base of experience in the industry and a lens that has really seen it from different views. And I think that is always important to challenge our internal thinking, to make sure we have an external focus and that we are looking externally. 
But as we look forward, while scientific innovation will continue to be the core of who we are. And I believe, is our best path to succeed in a world where you're going to face increasing margin pressure, we also have to marry with that, side-by-side, a continued focus on how do we evolve the business to make it more nimble, to make it simplified and really more focused such that we can drive ever greater efficiency and productivity, not in terms of reducing spend, rather the opposite. We're going to invest in this business to grow, but we have to find a way to make every dollar we invest more productive so that we get a greater than the dollar of output, and that is really where our focus is going to be on how do we leverage new technologies, new capabilities to do that. And then how do we think about broadening our view long-term as you think about not only the drug, but we have to focus increasingly on the outcomes from our medicine, the value we demonstrate and how we ensure affordable access. 
So those are the cores of what we're looking at. And my experience broadly in the industry and being a part of the leadership team here at Merck has positioned me to, I believe, to do that."

The first is immuno-oncology has essentially revolutionized all of cancer biology and medicine. And a quick way to point that out is, if one reads the book [indiscernible] one looks at it and say, this is outdated because the whole impact of immuno-oncology is not there. And the driver for this revolution has been pembrolizumab. And just so that we're very clear, we continue to want to expand indications by tumor type and by stage of cancer. We want to deepen responses with combinations that span agents with immunomodulatory mechanisms, which the internal pipeline is focused on and agents with direct tumor-killing mechanisms that we have largely done through BD. 
And we want to extend the value and access of pembrolizumab to patients through route of administration, dosing regimens, combinations, co-formulations and biomarkers. So that's I-O, pembro and cancer. So the question that you ask is, do I have anything in my pipeline that has reshaped a whole field right now that I can see. I do not have one in our pipeline. And this is an important point that we should mention. We should remember that we were not in cancer, and I-O allowed us the chance to make a huge impact on cancer, transformative cancer -- transformative impact. And one of the reasons why Rob and Ken and Roger for that matter have always talked about therapeutic agnostic, it is because we do not know that we have the foresight to know where that next revolution and where that next transformation occurs. 
So could that be in my pipeline? Yes. Could it be in the pipeline of others? Yes. But do we have it right now defined, whether it be in neuro, whether it be in cardiovascular, whether it be metabolism, I would say that, in general, the whole field has not seen. The whole pharmaceutical field has not seen something equivalent to KEYTRUDA or pembro at this point in time throughout the industry."

In the prep space, I think what I would add is that we don't need necessarily a partner with islatravir in the prep space.

So I sort of separated how one might think about the I-O space and related to pembrolizumab and especially related to solid tumors. And so when you look at our internal pipeline, we speak about having over 25 mechanisms in the clinic. And you're aware of 3 immune modulatory mechanisms are advancing into Phase III and they have the opportunity to be co-formulated, [indiscernible] LAG-3, our CTLA-4, we also showed ILP-4. 
The other sort of thing that I would also emphasize is that the word is sometimes overused, but it's caught orthogonal. But I simply say that KEYTRUDA, when mixed with tumor-killing mechanisms or standard of care mechanism like chemo, surgery and potentially radiation, there seems to be enhancement. And because of that, that creates a possibility for us from a business development standpoint. And that business development you saw with Eisai and AZ, but we are excited with Seagen with the LIV One ADC, the Velos with the ROR 1 ADC because essentially, there -- we're confident that pembro plus chemo works really well, right? We're first-in-class, best-in-class and transformative in class in lung. 
And so Seagen, Velos, those are ADCs where you're essentially developing a chemotherapy that's a little bit more precise. But our interest is past that. I would call your attention to Peloton, which is essentially targeting an oncogenic nodal pathway, and we would hope that, that not only can we advance that Peloton with a potential 2021 filing, but we're also interested in looking at that HIF-2 alpha in relationship to pembrolizumab. But I also want to emphasize that that's focusing on KEYTRUDA as a foundational medicine that can combine with many internal and external assets. I would just end by simply saying, we are in an advantaged situation. And the advantage situation is that if you are developing a drug in cancer and you're a biotech company, you must ask what your molecule will do in relationship to I-O. And if you're going to look for a partner, you're going to look for a partner who can give you that quickness, that speed and that rigor to advance that. 
And so when we say that we have 1,400 trials, including more than 950 combinations and more than 90 registrational trials, I would remind myself that most of those combinations are in combinations with other assets from other companies. So it allows us to do BD, not simply by looking at PowerPoint decks, but by actually getting our hands wet with the agents of other companies."

In terms of the other question, let me just make sure. The other question was variance. The variance. We need to do those experiments, but the mechanism by which molnupiravir works would make it very -- we would predict that it would work for all the variant. I would remind everyone that molnupiravir doesn't just work for coronaviruses. It works for many RNA viruses and many respiratory RNA viruses. So the variance difference within a SARS-COV-2 is there's variation, but that variation is much smaller than the variation that you see with whole different classes or RNA viruses. But to answer your question specifically, we need to test that to prove that, but every expectation is that the variance would be taken care of by molnupiravir based on mechanism of action."

Ken, I think 2 of your more significant contributions to Merck were guiding it through the VIOX litigation and buying sharing plow. The industry once again finds itself dealing with CV risk of oral arthritis drugs and you don't prefer big deals. On the former, what observations would you make on VIOX 15 years later, particularly since I believe it's back on the market. And why do you not prefer big deals when it was perhaps your biggest contribution?"

Let me start by saying, I think if there's one lesson that I learned from VIOX, it is that for a company like Merck, you have to stand strong on your heritage. And people see this as a litigation defense. But I think for every one of us inside the company, it was really about articulating to an audience, particularly in that case, jurors, what this company really stood for. And I thought we won repeatedly because we were able to remind people of the importance of what we do for the world and the integrity by which we do it. 
I won't go into any more details about the decision to withdraw the drug, but it was also based largely on this company's sense of what was in the best interest for patients based on what we knew at that time. On the issue around Schering-Plough, this company was in a very different situation at that time relative to its pipeline, relative to its growth prospects. And that deal was done at a time where, frankly, we saw an opportunity in the market based on where the valuations of companies were, we saw that as an opportunity that was appropriate for Merck back in 2009. And the reality of the world is none of us were really smart enough to know that among the assets we were acquiring with pembrolizumab. 
So I would like to take a bow, but that's a classic example of the narrative fallacy when people say, ""Well, look at a great deal you did."" I think the one thing that we learned from that deal is that when we bought that company, we actually had our eye on Organon and the work that was being done in the basic research labs at Organon. And so we knew that we were buying a company that not only gave us an opportunity for cost synergies, but gave us an opportunity for growth based on the quality of the science. And so at the end of the day, the problem with large transactions, and I think if you look at the history of this industry, is that they are really difficult for our research organizations to respond to and [indiscernible]. 
And so that's the main reason I opposed for those mergers. It's because I think they're highly disruptive. And then at the end of the day, when you get through your cost synergies, you still either have a pipeline or you don't. And what we're focusing on right now is developing that pipeline. So thanks for the question."

Thanks for the question, Navin. So as you look at Organon and the assets that will make up that spin, the key growth drivers that sit within that business is, first and foremost, the women's health business, anchored by Nexplanon, which we continue to believe is going to be a blockbuster drug. It has patent protection for several years. It is growing globally. And as you look at the need for contraception, it continues to fill in a very important niche. So that is a core area of growth. And then obviously, surrounding that is the broader women's health business, including our fertility drugs and other drugs. 
So that business is the core growth driver. And if you could dissect within Merck and look at that business, excluding the impact of the loss of exclusivity of some key franchises, that has been growing and will continue to grow. So really, what is accelerating the growth will be further focused on investment in that. And then you layer upon that the biosimilars business, which is really a burgeoning business, very small now, but will grow very fast and will contribute meaningfully to the growth. So between those 2 pieces of Organon, they will comprise, I think as we get out over the next 4 or 5 years, they're going to be 30%, 40-plus percent of the total revenue of the company. 
Why the business has been declining over the last couple of years is really twofold. One, it is mainly loss of exclusivity. Most recently, we're experiencing the loss of [indiscernible]. Before that, we had [ Zetia ] Vytorin. So we've been hit by those LOEs. As we look forward, they really don't have those. Those should start to sunset as we get through 2021. So it is really going to allow those businesses, which have been good businesses to start to shine, and then they will accelerate that growth through focus and investment and more of a core formulation strategy and a business development strategy to augment those assets long term. 
So I do think they will continue to look at the assets and ask how can they extend them, how can they broaden them, but that's really the focal point. There are no real key R&D programs being transferred over. It's more of how they will focus on those strategies moving forward across those growth businesses with the LOEs out of the base."

It's critical that we focus on products, but if you don't have the right platforms, it makes it more difficult for you to move quickly. In terms of platforms that we are building currently, clearly, we're a company that's really well-known for our chemistry. And over the last few years, we've become increasingly a more biologics company with KEYTRUDA. And so our continued evolution to use that from antibodies to bispecific immune engagers to [indiscernible] to protein engineering, those fields are going to be very important. 
And as we build biologics, it will also help us in relationship to the space between chemistry and biologics, especially with target therapy. So that's a very important play. What I would also say is that I kind of group them in the nucleic acids, whether you talk about mRNA or sRNA or gene delivery systems. Those -- that group, we have to take a look at. But one can't willy nilly decide ""I want this platform because I'm really interested in the platform, that it's neat and cool."" One has to say, ""What am I going to do with that platform? What is the product? How am I going to drive it from discovery to development to registration."" So we look at modalities and we look at what is moving throughout the whole landscape, but we don't get enamored specifically on a platform by itself."

It comes",549,"Okay, great. And to the question on animal health. So we obviously -- I would start by saying, we look at this objectively. So you should not assume that there is some form of philosophical opposition to thinking about animal health differently. It comes from an objective analysis of what we think creates the greatest long-term value for the Merck shareholder. And that's our focus, is long-term value creation. As I look at the animal health business and if you really decompose what's happened and why we feel like we're the rightful owner for this asset, you have to start to challenge where is the growth coming from in that business and what would happen outside of Merck. 
I would start with the fact that we do see meaningful synergies coming from the collaboration with Merck Research Labs. As I mentioned, a big portion of the growth we're going to see in animal health long-term is coming from new products. And those new products are, in many instances, coming on the companion animal space through products that they've discovered, working with MRL and looking at the human health catalog. And there are also new products coming in vaccines. And obviously, we are the leader in vaccines on the human health side. We're a leader in vaccines on the animal health side. 
So across the pillars of our excellence, there's a nice alignment from a synergy, and that is driving their growth. It's not by accident that they're one of the fastest-growing businesses in the animal health space. It's because of our ability to focus on innovation and leverage those synergies. And then beyond that, I think you have to look at each company and the facts and take them one at a time. So if just maybe one example, if you look back at when Pfizer spun out Zoetis, Zoetis was a low-margin business that had not been invested in. Pfizer effectively said as much. They made a decision because they weren't focused to spin it out. That allowed that company to bring focus and investment and margin expansion that has allowed that multiple to really take off. 
We already have, in our own in animal health business, a high-margin business where we're focused and invested. So there's not a big margin lift opportunity and there's not frankly a big growth acceleration opportunity because I believe we fully invest to drive both the margin and the growth today. So I think as you think in that regard, also, you have to look at it. And then you have to ask what is the contribution to Merck. It's accretive to our growth, it's accretive to cash flow, it's an annuity-like business that allows diversification away from the human health business, which we know is important. And it's one where, as we look forward, we continue to believe long-term value will be created. So that's just a few of the points that I would make. 
And I would note, we did where we saw a different set of facts, as we did with the consumer, we will make the right decision. But we continue to believe keeping this business as part of Merck is the best long-term value creator for us and for our shareholders, and that's what drives our thinking."

So on the first question, with regard to the next CFO of the company, what I would expect from that person and what I think is an important role that the CFO can play is to, obviously, first and foremost, you have to be a strong fiduciary for the company. You have to focus and make sure that the controls are in place, the compliance is met and that the company is meeting its reporting responsibility. That's kind of table stakes and expected. What differentiates a CFO, in my perspective, is the ability to partner with the business to find solutions on how to grow strategically. And as I mentioned in the earlier comments, we're going to be investing for growth. But we know that there's going to be pressure. There's -- on margins, the world is transforming around us. We're going to have to find ways to drive productivity to get every dollar we invest more from that dollar. 
And I think that's an important area where a CFO can help. The one thing that being CFO allowed me to do, I sat at the crossroads between each of the divisions, and it allowed me to see the whole company and to start to look at Merck as an integrated whole and to start to look to how can we challenge and drive optimization at the scenes that sit between the divisions because, frankly, those are always where, if you will, the corporate tax is paid. And the more you can eliminate those inefficiencies, the more productive and efficient you can go, and I believe that's what a CFO should do. 
On your question around the margin expansion, it does not change our view of the dividend payout ratio. We're still shooting for that 47% to 50% range. And obviously, we're looking at that both now, but even more importantly as we think post spin. And then we'll continue to reassess that as we go. But right now, that is -- continues to be our long-term goal that we would shoot for."

Before turning to our financial results and our future perspective, I'd like to make a few comments about this morning's other announcement. It has been a distinct honor and privilege to serve this great company as its CEO over the past decade. I thank all of my Merck colleagues for their extraordinary support throughout this period. We are making this leadership change to cure in the knowledge that Merck has the elements in place for a strong future of scientific innovation and profitable growth.  
Rob Davis is well prepared and well suited to help Merck capitalize on the many exciting opportunities before it as well as to take on the challenges that lie ahead. He and the Merck senior team will provide outstanding leadership for our company in the coming years. Given Merck's current position of strength, the Merck Board and I believe it is a good time to begin transitioning the company's day-to-day decision-making as well as the strategic direction to Rob, who will assume the title of President in April, at which point, our operating divisions, Human Health, Animal Health, Manufacturing and Research, will begin reporting to him.  
I will retire as CEO at the end of June, but remain for some period of time as Executive Chairman to assist Rob, Dean and the rest of the senior team. I am extremely confident in the capabilities and commitment of Merck's people and Rob's ability to guide the company to an even brighter future.  
Moving on to our results. Despite challenges from the pandemic, Merck achieved solid growth in revenues and earnings in 2020, made meaningful advancements in our pipeline and added important assets through business development. Despite the particular impact to our portfolio, the underlying demand for our innovative medicines and vaccines remains strong. And our initial guidance reflects our expectation for a return to strong growth this year, 2021.  
Looking out to 2024, we continue to believe our revenue potential is underappreciated. Longer term, the work we are doing in advancing our internal pipeline and in adding assets through business development gives us increasing line of sight to significant potential growth drivers later this decade and into the next.
I'm amazed by the dedication of our employees who rallied to keep supply uninterrupted, regulatory filings on track and clinical and commercial execution in line with our goals. And I remain continually inspired by what Merck accomplishes for patients around the world.  
I'm also encouraged by the progress scientific experts across the biopharmaceutical industry have achieved in bringing vaccines to market that will help address the pandemic and start to return the world to normalcy. These successes further underscore the societal value of our industry's ongoing investments in science and innovation. 
Merck remains committed to developing an effective response to COVID-19 also. We have discontinued development of our COVID-19 vaccine candidate, but our therapeutic research programs continue to move forward. We believe that our oral antiviral candidate, molnupiravir, could make an important contribution to treating COVID-19 patients, and we look forward to seeing the results of our pivotal trials.  
More recently, we acquired OncoImmune and have accelerated the development of MK-7110, a Phase III candidate with strong potential in the treatment of severe and critical COVID-19 patients. I am encouraged by the innovative research happening in our lab, not just on the COVID front, but across our broad late-stage pipeline of promising medicines and vaccines, including in oncology, HIV and pneumococcal disease.
We remain highly focused on business development to enhance our internal pipeline. We completed 120 transactions in total in 2020, including important acquisitions, such as OncoImmune, VelosBio and ArQule; and collaborations, including Seagen and Ridgeback. Our plan to spin off Organon remains on track for completion late in the second quarter. As independent, more focused companies, I'm confident Merck and Organon will have the ability to more effectively pursue their respective market opportunities and business strategy to bring more value to patients and to shareholders.  
Let me conclude by expressing my confidence in the leaders of this company and how proud I am of the Merck team's success in advancing our pipeline and maintaining business continuity in a challenging environment. Additionally, I'd like to recognize and thank the frontline health care workers, scientists and government officials working together to bring the world back to normalcy.
And with that, I'll pass it on to my colleague, Rob, to review the details of our performance and our outlook."

I look forward to continuing the important work we do to bring our medicines and vaccines to the people who need them. Under my leadership, Merck will remain focused on scientific innovation as the source of sustained long-term value for both patients and shareholders.  
Ken's unrelenting commitment to excellence and scientific innovation with patients at the center of everything we do permeates the culture of the company and its employees. Under Ken's leadership, Merck has achieved improved growth, clinical success, most notably with KEYTRUDA, and a revitalized pipeline and discovery research capability that will benefit both the company and the patients we serve for many years to come.  
Ken has put us in a position of financial and operational strength, from which we will be able to pursue our important mission to save and sustain lives through ongoing scientific innovation. The company has benefited from Ken's leadership. I personally and professionally benefited from his mentorship and guidance and want to thank him for that. His shoes won't be easy to fill in so many ways, both within Merck, but also including his many principled and valuable contributions to important issues facing society today. The talent and commitment of Merck's employees worldwide, however, make me extremely confident that we will achieve continued success through this transition and long into the future as we build on Ken's legacy.  
Now turning to the business. Our resilience in a year that brought us countless challenges amidst the global pandemic is a true testament to the talent, hard work and dedication of Merck employees worldwide. Our performance in this environment reinforces the confidence we have in our science-led strategy and in our potential for strong growth in 2021 and beyond. Underlying demand for our key growth pillars allowed our business to deliver 2% growth year-over-year or 4% excluding the impact of exchange, while absorbing approximately $2.5 billion of negative pandemic impact to revenues. Were it not for the pandemic impacts, we estimate growth for the year would have been approximately 9% ex exchange.  
Now turning to our fourth quarter results. Total company revenues were $12.5 billion, an increase of 5% year-over-year, both nominally and excluding the impact of foreign currency. Fourth quarter results were negatively impacted by approximately $400 million due to the pandemic. Excluding this impact, fourth quarter revenues would have grown by approximately 9% ex exchange.  
The remainder of my comments will be on an ex exchange basis. Our human health revenues increased 6%. In oncology, KEYTRUDA sales in the quarter grew 27% to $4 billion and for the year by 30% to $14 billion. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA continues to maintain its leadership position in lung cancer and is benefiting from strong usage across all key tumor types. We continue to see strong growth outside of lung cancer, including in renal and endometrial carcinomas, and further uptake in our Q6 weekly dosing regimen.  
Outside the U.S., KEYTRUDA growth continues to be driven by lung cancer indications. Uptake from KEYNOTE-189 and newly imbursed markets for KEYNOTE-407 remain the key growth drivers in the EU. In Japan, price adjustments in the first half of the year more than offset underlying volume growth. Lynparza and Lenvima continue to demonstrate strong growth and are meaningful contributors to our broader oncology portfolio, growing 53% and 26%, respectively, year-over-year.  
Our vaccines portfolio continues to be impacted by below-normal wellness visits, particularly in the United States. GARDASIL sales grew year-over-year, mostly reflecting the impact from the $120 million CDC stockpile replenishment in the quarter and the initial $120 million borrowing in the fourth quarter of 2019, which had a combined positive impact of $240 million year-over-year.  
Our hospital performance showed continued improvement in the fourth quarter. BRIDION sales grew 13% year-over-year, driven by continued market share gains, offset in part by lower elective surgery procedures. Our Animal Health business again delivered a strong quarter with sales of $1.2 billion and 6% growth. Companion Animal grew 9%, reflecting demand for companion animal vaccines and parasiticides. Livestock grew 4%, primarily reflecting an extra month of sales from the acquisition of Antelliq, partially offset by distributor purchasing patterns.  
Turning to the rest of our P&L, my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 73% in the quarter, an increase of 0.4 percentage points, driven by favorable product mix and manufacturing variances, partially offset by higher inventory write-offs due to a recall of ZERBAXA, pricing pressure and foreign exchange. Operating expenses grew 4% year-over-year to $5.4 billion. COVID had a largely neutral impact as operating savings were offset by incremental spend to advance our COVID-19 research programs.  
Operating expenses in the quarter reflect overall growth in R&D spending as well as a donation to the Merck Foundation. Other income increased year-over-year driven by income from equity securities. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 15.3%, a decrease of 1.6 percentage points from a year ago due to favorable earnings mix. Taken together, we earned $1.32 per share, an increase of 17%.  
Now before detailing our 2021 outlook, I want to highlight that our press release details reporting changes we will be implementing beginning in the first quarter that are reflected in our guidance ranges. These changes result in a better alignment between our non-GAAP results and the underlying operational performance of our company and improve unpredictable quarter-to-quarter volatility. While these changes will have an impact on our non-GAAP results going forward, there is no impact to cash flow.  
Turning to 2021 guidance. For Merck, we expect revenues of $51.8 billion to $53.8 billion, which represents growth of 8% to 12% versus 2020, and excludes any potential revenue from our COVID therapeutics. This range assumes a positive impact from foreign exchange of roughly 2 percentage points using mid-January rates. We assume full year pandemic impacts to be approximately 2% or roughly $1 billion, largely in the first half of the year.  
Our gross margin will be roughly 77%, including a benefit of 1.8 percentage points due to the reporting change. We expect operating expenses to grow at a high single-digit to low double-digit rate. Normalized for the impact of COVID, operating expenses would be expected to grow closer to mid-single digits.
We expect other expense of $400 million in our other income and expense line, driven largely by net interest expense. Under our prior reporting, we would have guided to an expected $400 million of income, resulting in an $800 million unfavorable swing. This difference is driven by an expected gain on the announced sale of Preventice, mark-to-market gains on our fund holdings, which include our indirect investment in Moderna, and other expected investment gains that will now be excluded from non-GAAP.  
We expect our full year tax rate to be between 15% and 16%. We anticipate 2.53 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we expect our non-GAAP EPS to be between $6.48 to $6.68, which reflects growth of 12% to 15% versus 2020 recast EPS. This range includes a positive impact from foreign exchange of roughly 3 percentage points.
Our EPS growth under the new reporting convention benefits from the removal of the disproportionate mark-to-market equity gains we recorded in 2020. Importantly, however, under either reporting method, we expect strong operating margin leverage of 1 percentage point or more in 2021. The benefit to our 2021 EPS guidance is only $0.08 under new reporting versus previous reporting.  
We will continue to monitor the ongoing impact of the pandemic on wellness visits and delayed procedures as we move into and through 2021. We remain confident in our ability to grow both in the near and long term, driven by our portfolio of derisked and innovative assets.  
Now turning to Organon. We are on track to complete the spin-off of Organon, which we expect will take place in the second quarter -- I should say, late in the second quarter. The strategic merits of this transaction are even more clear as we sit here today. In 2020, we brought -- the products we will spin-off as part of Organon achieved revenues of $6.5 billion. The high-level metrics for Organon that we provided a year ago remain largely unchanged. We expect Organon to achieve 2021 revenues of $6 billion to $6.5 billion. Off of this base and as the negative impact of the loss of exclusivity on key brands diminishes, we expect Organon to achieve longer-term revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits.  
As a stand-alone company post spin, we continue to expect Organon's operating margins to be in the mid-30% range and to increase over time. This compares to a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 45% within Merck, with the difference reflecting additional costs Organon will incur to operate as an independent company. EBITDA margins are now expected to be in the high 30% range initially and are expected to grow over time. This is a slight decrease from our prior guidance due to a lower proportion of capital assets transferred to Organon versus our initial expectations.  
We expect Organon to have initial debt of $9 billion to $9.5 billion. Merck expects to receive a special tax-free dividend of $8.5 billion to $9 billion prior to the spin. We continue to expect Organon to pay a meaningful dividend that will be entirely incremental to that of Merck. For Merck, the spin-off of Organon is expected to enable incremental operating efficiencies of approximately $1.5 billion over 3 years, including approximately $500 million in 2021, which is included in our guidance.  
We now expect to deliver operating margins of greater than 42% in 2024, an increase of 2 percentage points versus our prior expectation of greater than 40% as a result of the impact of the reporting change. For modeling purposes, please be aware that Merck will continue to incur overhead costs previously allocated to the Organon products, which we estimate to be approximately $400 million on a full year basis. These stranded costs will be reduced over time and are netted into the overall efficiency target. 
To conclude, the strength and resilience of our business in 2021 -- or in 2020 reinforces our confidence as we begin the new year. Demand for our key growth drivers remains intact, and we are confident that we will deliver strong growth in 2021 and long into the future. We will continue to use our strong financial position to invest meaningfully in our pipeline, capitalizing both internal and external opportunities, and to make the right strategic decisions like the spin-off of Organon to position our company for continued success.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken."

As I've underscored many times, innovative research is the cornerstone of Merck. This is why we planned carefully for Dr. Roger Perlmutter's retirement and the transition of leadership of the Merck Research Laboratories to Dr. Dean Li, who I'm pleased to welcome to today's call.  
Dean is a physician scientist who has a keen understanding of Merck's mission, dedication to science in our early- and late-stage assets. He has hands-on experience leading key areas of research, including early discovery in translational medicine while under Roger's leadership at Merck as well as in his prior roles where he exploited new technologies to found companies and was a leader in an academic health care delivery system.  
We believe he is uniquely positioned to take on this important role and advance Merck's promising pipeline. I'm confident that under Dean's leadership, Merck's legacy of innovative R&D will continue, and we will persist in successfully bringing forward breakthrough medicines and vaccines that make a real difference for patients and shareholders alike. Dean?"

I'm delighted to be here for my first earnings call as Head of Merck Research Laboratories. And so for my remarks today, I will provide an update on our COVID research effort, cover key regulatory milestones, clinical updates and recent business development, first in our oncology pipeline and then the broader pipeline.  
Regarding our COVID-19 research programs, Merck has made the decision to discontinue development of its vaccine candidate, V590 and V591. This decision was based on clinical finding from Phase I study showing that, while the vaccines were well tolerated, immune responses were inferior to those observed with natural infection and those reported for other authorized COVID vaccines. We are grateful to our collaborators and the volunteers who participated in this trial.
Our COVID-19 efforts now shift, advancing our 2 therapeutic candidates, molnupiravir, often known as MK-4482 and, MK-7110. Our orally available antiviral candidate, molnupiravir, which we are developing in collaboration with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, continues to progress in our Phase II/III trials studying hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients. The primary completion date is in May 2021, but it is possible that we may have interim efficacy data in the first quarter, which, of course, we would share publicly if meaningful.  
Molnupiravir has the potential to play an important role in the current pandemic as well as other emerging novel coronavirus infections. We have been scaling production capacity and expect to have over 10 million courses of therapy available by the end of 2021. We recently added the second candidate to address COVID-19 through the acquisition of OncoImmune. This agent, MK-7110, is a recombinant fusion protein administered by IV infusion that targets the novel immune checkpoint. Final results are expected in our -- in the clinical trial in the first quarter.  
Turning to oncology. In the fourth quarter, KEYTRUDA received an additional new approval in the U.S. in combination with chemotherapy for first-line treatment of patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer whose tumors express PD-L1 at a combined proportion score of 10 or greater. The approval was based on progression-free survival results from KEYNOTE-355, and this marks the 17th tumor type for which KEYTRUDA has been approved.  
Also in the last quarter, the FDA accepted a supplemental New Drug Application with priority review for KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy in previously untreated patients with esophageal carcinoma regardless of PD-L1 expression based on KEYNOTE-590. These results demonstrated clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival, progression-free survival and overall response rate. The FDA target action date is April 13.  
Working with our partners at Eisai, we are pleased to note positive results from the KEYNOTE-581 trial for KEYTRUDA plus Lenvima versus sunitinib for first-line treatment of renal cell carcinoma. The study demonstrated statistically significant improvements across primary and secondary endpoints, and these data will be presented at ASCO GU next week.  
We also announced that KEYNOTE-775, evaluating KEYTRUDA plus Lenvima for treatment of second-line endometrial carcinoma, was stopped early. The independent data monitoring committee reported that KEYTRUDA plus Lenvima demonstrated a significant improvement across all endpoints versus chemotherapy. The success of KEYNOTE-581 and KEYNOTE-775 reinforces the opportunity presented by the combination of KEYTRUDA and the multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Lenvima. We continue to explore this combination in 19 studies spanning multiple tumor types.  
Now looking ahead, we look forward to meeting with the FDA's Oncologic Drug Advisory Committee to discuss data from the third interim analysis from KEYNOTE-522, evaluating neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment of patients with early-stage, triple-negative breast cancer as compared with an alternative regimen. The BLA that includes data from this study is currently under FDA review with a PDUFA date next month.  
Business development remains a priority. In the fourth quarter, we completed the acquisition of VelosBio, whose lead candidate, VLS-101, known as MK-2140, is a ROR1 targeted antibody drug conjugate currently being evaluated in a Phase II study of patients with solid tumor and in Phase I for patients with hematologic malignancies. This opportunity, along with the LIV-1 antibody-drug conjugates that we are developing in partnership with Seagen, underscores our commitment to investigating tumor-targeted chemotherapy using next-generation antibody-drug conjugates.  
Now as part of our strategy to explore new tumor-targeting technology, we recently entered collaborations with A2 Biotherapeutics and Artiva Biotherapeutics aimed at evaluating opportunities for T and NK cell therapy, and a third collaboration with Janux Therapeutics on their T cell engager technology. These collaborations, along with work already underway with Dragonfly Therapeutics to design targeted NK cell engagers, support our commitment to tumor-targeting technologies.  
Now turning to our broader pipeline. We continue to progress our suite of pneumococcal vaccine candidates, V114, V116 and V117. Each one is designed for targeted production against prevalent pneumococcal disease serotypes across different age groups. The assay for V114, our 15-valent pneumococcal vaccine candidate, was recently granted priority review by the FDA for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease in adults. The target action date is July 18.  
Adults administered V114 produced comparable levels of antibodies for all serotypes in the currently available conjugate vaccines with higher responses observed for serotype 3, one of the most common causes of invasive pneumococcal diseases in adults and in children. Robust response to unique disease-causing serotypes, 22F and 33F, were also observed. Now in the U.S., serotypes 22F and 33F have been linked to 13% of invasive pneumococcal disease seen among adults aged 65 and older; and in Europe, 7% to 12% of adult cases. Our V114 Phase III pediatric studies are on track, and we anticipate results from these trials this year. In addition to V114, we are progressing our adult and pediatric next-gen vaccines, V116 and V117. 
In the infectious disease space, islatravir, our novel nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor for HIV, continues to progress in both the treatment and in the prep setting. In the prep setting, we expect to begin recruitment soon for 2 new Phase III trials, IMPOWER 22 and IMPOWER 24, in different populations at high risk of acquiring HIV infection.  
Now IMPOWER 22 will evaluate the efficacy and safety of islatravir as a once-monthly oral capsule in adult women and adolescent girls. IMPOWER 24 will evaluate the same regimen in men who have sex with men and transgender women who have sex with men. Also, in the prep setting, positive interim results from the Phase II trial evaluating islatravir as a once-monthly oral prep regimen were recently presented at HIV Research for Prevention 2021. These interim results show that islatravir achieved the efficacy pharmacokinetic threshold at each of the 2 doses study, 60 milligrams and 120 milligrams, and that these doses are well tolerated. These findings offer further evidence for the potential of islatravir to provide a monthly oral prep option for people at risk of acquiring HIV.  
Now in addition, as we announced previously, we are advancing MK-8507, our non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, in combination with islatravir into a Phase II study as a potential once-weekly oral treatment option. This weekly islatravir MK-8507 combination builds on the once-daily islatravir plus doravirine combination currently in Phase III, a Phase III study which we expect to start to read out in the second half of 2021. 
Finally, we received FDA approval for VERQUVO, following priority review. This new option for patients who've experienced worsening heart failure built on our commitment to develop therapies for patients with cardiovascular disease. We at Merck Research Laboratories are well positioned to continue to take full advantage of our considerable strength in oncology and vaccine while investing in other therapeutic areas, exploring new modalities and complementing and supplementing our internal pipeline with external opportunities. 
I will now turn the call back to Peter."

Just wanted to get a sense of your thoughts in terms of Merck moving forward. You've talked about the under-appreciation of the upside that you see for the company in 2023 plus relative to consensus expectations.

What do you think the company really needs to do in that regard?

As we look forward, from a strategic perspective, obviously, there'll be a lot more time as we move into the months and quarters to come to continue to have the dialogue. But I think at the highest level, the important point is that the strategy we've been under, which is focused on scientific innovation as the core of who we are, driven first by really the revitalization of what we're doing in the drug discovery and from a clinical development perspective, which I think you're seeing the fruits of, and obviously, what we're achieving with KEYTRUDA and with what we see as a growing earlier-stage pipeline, which we're excited about. 
So as we look at 2025 and beyond and into the 2030 time frame, it really is to continue to focus, first and foremost, on investing behind the best science, whether it comes from inside the company or outside the company, execute on the pipeline we have. We have a lot of great, near-term, late-stage launches coming. We've got islatravir. We've got our V114, the entire pneumococcal franchise that we're building. We have obviously a whole host of opportunities in oncology, which I'm sure Dean and others would be happy to comment on. Looking at both what we can do to extend the breadth of KEYTRUDA's reach to the number of patients it serves as well as its efficacy through combinations as well as broadening into other oncology fields and broader mechanisms, which we have. So that all will be continued to be where we will focus our efforts. 
As we look at that, we realize, though, we will need to continue to do business development to augment that, and we are committed to that. We've been pretty consistent in talking about the urgency we have around business development. That hasn't changed. That won't change. But what also won't change is we will do it when we see an alignment of strategy and value that is tied with our scientific endeavor and that -- so that is really the way we look. But as we started to highlight even at the JPMorgan conference, I think people under-appreciate what we have as growth opportunities as we start to move into that 2028 and beyond time frame. Clearly, we have a real opportunity to continue to grow between now and then with KEYTRUDA. But I think, actually, we will have an opportunity to grow beyond then through all of the things I mentioned. So more of the same from that regard.
And then with regard to Animal Health, we continue to see Animal Health as a strategic part of this business. If you look at the growth that business delivers, it's best-in-class within the animal health space. It's accretive to the overall position for Merck, and we are investing in it. And I think it is positioned to continue to show very strong growth, both through the existing products it has, but also through a very good portfolio of pipeline products which is leveraging the synergies we have with the MRL function we have on the human health side. So as we sit here, looking forward, I continue to see animal health as a core part of our strategy. And as we've said, we always are looking at our portfolio, but everything I see tells me that this is something we will maintain and grow because we are the most advantaged owner, in my mind."

And one way to think about it is with the lens that we believe that this can be a foundational medicine, both in prep and in treatment. And the favorable attribute to recognize is PK dosing schedule, route of administration, resistant profile, tissue levels and combinability.
And so the question in relationship to treatment is, I've laid out what we're doing once-daily, once-weekly. But if this molecule is as foundational as we believe it is, this is something that could combine with many different mechanisms and many different molecules. I can just tell you that integrase inhibitors, which is cabotegravir, that's an important class. It's an important class that's actually very dear to Merck. And so that needs to be looked at carefully. 
And then lenacapavir, which you allude to, that's a new mechanism. And we believe that islatravir as a foundational medicine should -- we should look at the full array of combinations that can be achieved because we believe it's foundational, and we believe that, that foundation can provide a lot of benefit for many different patients. And we should look at all combinations possible that would allow us to prove that and to show that."

But really beyond that, as we've talked, we would like to see business development. And so we have been holding back on share repurchase for that purpose. But what we've also been clear to say is that we're not looking to just grow cash to grow cash, and we're not looking to drive up our credit rating. So over time, if we don't find those opportunities to utilize the cash for business development, eventually, we will return it to shareholders, and that's on an ongoing basis.

It's obviously been a big focus and remains a big focus of the organization. Should we think about any pauses or slowdown in activities, specifically as you think about larger transactions given the leadership transitions that are occurring in the organization?
And then on BD, I guess all else equal, would your bias be towards a series of smaller transactions versus a larger one that brings multiple assets? So we think about issues of ease of execution, integration, et cetera. I know you're probably looking at everything, but if you had a choice, which direction would the organization lean?"

So that focal point continues to be where we will look. As we've said many times in the past, we are agnostic to therapeutic area. We will be driven by science. Science will take us to the areas to look. But likewise, we've been clear to say we're not foreclosed to larger-scale deals, always looking at the size more in terms of its disruption and complexity than in dollar terms. 
We obviously recognize the need to continue to augment the pipeline, to augment our revenue potential. So we're looking at those as well. But one thing that remains completely consistent as we do not prefer and do not see a transformative deal, driven mainly by synergies as a way forward, it will continue to be science-led, science-based and driven by where we see an opportunity to bring differential value."

Louise, thanks for the question. If you look back at my career and what I've done, I've spent my whole career dedicated to health care and to the pharmaceutical industry and the time I began at Eli Lilly, where I spent nearly 15 years before moving on to Baxter and saw a different view of the business, running the diversified medtech side of that company before coming to Merck. So I have a broad base of experience in the industry and a lens that has really seen it from different views. And I think that is always important to challenge our internal thinking, to make sure we have an external focus and that we are looking externally. 
But as we look forward, while scientific innovation will continue to be the core of who we are and, I believe, is our best path to succeed in a world where you're going to face increasing margin pressure, we also have to marry with that side-by-side a continuing focus on how do we evolve the business to make it more nimble, to make it simplified and really more focused such that we can drive ever greater efficiency and productivity, not in terms of reducing spend, rather the opposite. We're going to invest in this business to grow, but we have to find a way to make every dollar we invest more productive so that we get a greater than the dollar of output.
And that is really where our focus is going to be on how do we leverage new technologies, new capabilities to do that, and then how do we think about broadening our view long term as you think about not only the drug, but we have to focus increasingly on the outcomes from our medicine, the value we demonstrate and how we ensure affordable access. So those are the cores of what we're looking at. And my experience broadly in the industry and being a part of the leadership team here at Merck has positioned me to, I believe, to do that."

The first is immuno-oncology has essentially revolutionized all of cancer biology and medicine. And a quick way to point that out is, if one reads the book Emperor of All Maladies, one looks at it and say, this is outdated because the whole impact of immuno-oncology is not there. And the driver for this revolution has been pembrolizumab. And just so that we're very clear, we continue to want to expand indications by tumor type and by stage of cancer. We want to deepen responses with combinations that span agents with immunomodulatory mechanisms, which the internal pipeline is focused on, and agents with direct tumor-killing mechanisms that we have largely done through BD. And we want to extend the value and access of pembrolizumab to patients through route of administration, dosing regimens, combinations, co-formulations and biomarkers. So that's I-O, pembro and cancer.
So the question that you ask is, do I have anything in my pipeline that has reshaped a whole field right now that I can see? I do not have one in our pipeline, and this is an important point that we should mention. We should remember that we were not in cancer, and I-O allowed us the chance to make a huge impact on cancer, transformative cancer -- transformative impact. And one of the reasons why Rob and Ken and Roger for that matter have always talked about therapeutic agnostic, it is because we do not know that we have the foresight to know where that next revolution and where that next transformation occurs. 
So could that be in my pipeline? Yes. Could it be in the pipeline of others? Yes. But do we have it right now defined, whether it be in neuro, whether it be in cardiovascular, whether it be metabolism? I would say that, in general, the whole field has not seen, the whole pharmaceutical field has not seen something equivalent to KEYTRUDA or pembro at this point in time throughout the industry."

And so weekly would be the starting place, and then we look even further out in the treatment space. 
In the prep space, I think what I would add is that we don't need necessarily a partner with islatravir in the prep space. And so we think they're through both in an oral route of administration and other forms of administration. We can go to long-acting format, potentially even longer than a week initially in the prep space. And so that's how we're looking at the market."

So I sort of separated how one might think about the I-O space and related to pembrolizumab and especially related to solid tumors. And so when you look at our internal pipeline, we speak about having over 25 mechanisms in the clinic. And you're aware of 3 immune modulatory mechanisms are advancing into Phase III, and they have the opportunity to be co-formulated, our TIGIT, our LAG-3, our CTLA-4, we also showed ILT4. 
The other sort of thing that I would also emphasize is that the word is sometimes overused, but it's called orthogonal. But I simply say that KEYTRUDA, when mixed with tumor-killing mechanisms or standard-of-care mechanisms, like chemo, surgery and potentially radiation, there seems to be enhancement. And because of that, that creates a possibility for us from a business development standpoint, and that business development you saw with Eisai and AZ. But we are excited with Seagen with the LIV-1 ADC, the Velos with the ROR1 ADC because essentially, there -- we're confident that pembro plus chemo works really well, right? We're first-in-class, best-in-class and transformative in class in lung. And so Seagen, Velos, those are ADCs where you're essentially developing a chemotherapy that's a little bit more precise.
But our interest is past that. I would call your attention to Peloton, which is essentially targeting an oncogenic nodal pathway. And we would hope that, that not only can we advance that Peloton with a potential 2021 filing, but we're also interested in looking at that HIF-2 alpha in relationship to pembrolizumab. But I also want to emphasize that that's focusing on KEYTRUDA as a foundational medicine that can combine with many internal and external assets.
I would just end by simply saying, we are in an advantaged situation. And the advantaged situation is that if you are developing a drug in cancer and you're a biotech company, you must ask what your molecule will do in relationship to I-O. And if you're going to look for a partner, you're going to look for a partner who can give you that quickness, that speed and that rigor to advance that. And so when we say that we have 1,400 trials, including more than 950 combinations and more than 90 registrational trials, I would remind myself that most of those combinations are in combinations with other assets from other companies. So it allows us to do BD, not simply by looking at PowerPoint decks, but by actually getting our hands wet with the agents of other companies."

Let me start by saying, I think if there's one lesson that I learned from Vioxx, it is that for a company like Merck, you have to stand strong on your heritage. And people see this as a litigation defense. But I think for every one of us inside the company, it was really about articulating to an audience, particularly in that case, jurors, what this company really stood for. And I thought we won repeatedly because we were able to remind people of the importance of what we do for the world and the integrity by which we do it. I won't go into any more details about the decision to withdraw the drug, but it was also based largely on this company's sense of what was in the best interest for patients based on what we knew at that time.
On the issue around Schering-Plough, this company was in a very different situation at that time relative to its pipeline, relative to its growth prospects. And that deal was done at a time where, frankly, we saw an opportunity in the market based on where the valuations of companies were. We saw that as an opportunity that was appropriate for Merck back in 2009. And the reality of the world is none of us were really smart enough to know that among the assets we were acquiring was pembrolizumab. So I would like to take a bow, but that's a classic example of the narrative fallacy when people say, wow, look at a great deal you did.
I think the one thing that we learned from that deal is that when we bought that company, we actually had our eye on Organon and the work that was being done in the basic research labs at Organon. And so we knew that we were buying a company that not only gave us an opportunity for cost synergies, but gave us an opportunity for growth based on the quality of the science. And so at the end of the day, the problem with large transactions, and I think if you look at the history of this industry, is that they are really difficult for our research organizations to respond to and recover from. And so that's the main reason I opposed for those mergers, it's because I think they're highly disruptive. And then at the end of the day, when you get through your cost synergies, you still either have a pipeline or you don't. And what we're focusing on right now is developing that pipeline.

Thanks for the question, Navin. So as you look at Organon and the assets that will make up that spin, the key growth drivers that sit within that business is, first and foremost, the Women's Health business, anchored by NEXPLANON, which we continue to believe is going to be a blockbuster drug. It has patent protection for several years. It is growing globally. And as you look at the need for contraception, it continues to fill in a very important niche. So that is a core area of growth. And then, obviously, surrounding that is the broader Women's Health business, including our fertility drugs and other drugs. So that business is the core growth driver.
And if you could dissect within Merck and look at that business, excluding the impact of the loss of exclusivity of some key franchises, that has been growing and will continue to grow. So really, what is accelerating the growth will be further focus and investment in that. And then you layer upon that the Biosimilars business, which is really a burgeoning business, very small now, but will grow very fast and will contribute meaningfully to the growth. So between those 2 pieces of Organon, they will comprise, I think as we get out over the next 4 or 5 years, they're going to be 30%, 40-plus percent of the total revenue of the company. 
Why the business has been declining over the last couple of years is really twofold. One, it is mainly loss of exclusivity. Most recently, we're experiencing the loss of NuvaRing. Before that, we had ZETIA and VYTORIN. So we've been hit by those LOEs. As we look forward, they really don't have those. Those should start to sunset as we get through 2021. So it is really going to allow those businesses, which have been good businesses to start to shine, and then they will accelerate that growth through focus and investment and more of a core formulation strategy and a business development strategy to augment those assets long term.
So I do think they will continue to look at the assets and ask how can they extend them, how can they broaden them, but that's really the focal point. There are no real key R&D programs being transferred over. It's more of how they will focus on those strategies moving forward across those growth businesses with the LOEs out of the base."

Maybe a 2-parter for the newer guys in the newer roles. Dean, what are some modalities you'd like to enhance or add to MRL?
And Rob, I realize this decision has been made on Animal Health, at least for now, your comments are obviously in line with what Ken has been saying for a few years. And I certainly get that Merck is investing in that business and then it's performing well. But how do you bridge the gap between how helpful it is to Merck versus how valuable it would be if it stood alone and traded at 35x earnings or more? I realize that's one moment in time, but it's not like these peers are just all of a sudden trading in a high multiple and are likely to change. So again, understand why it's helpful to Merck, but how do you bridge the gap to why it's not better served and better valued elsewhere?"

The first thing is modalities are important. They're a platform. It's critical that we focus on products. But if you don't have the right platforms, it makes it more difficult for you to move quickly.",254,"I'll take that first question. I'll say 2 or 3 things. The first thing is modalities are important. They're a platform. It's critical that we focus on products. But if you don't have the right platforms, it makes it more difficult for you to move quickly.
In terms of platforms that we are building currently, clearly, we're a company that's really well-known for our chemistry. And over the last few years, we've become increasingly a more biologics company with KEYTRUDA. And so our continued evolution to use that from antibodies to bispecific immune engagers to TriNKET to protein engineering, those fields are going to be very important. And as we build biologics, it will also help us in relationship to the space between chemistry and biologics, especially with targeted therapy. So that's a very important play.
What I would also say is that I kind of group them in the nucleic acids, whether you talk about mRNA or sRNA or gene delivery systems. Those -- that group, we have to take a look at. But one can't willy nilly decide, I want this platform because I'm really interested in the platform, that it's neat and cool. One has to say, what am I going to do with that platform? What is the product? How am I going to drive it from discovery to development to registration? So we look at modalities and we look at what is moving throughout the whole landscape, but we don't get enamored specifically on a platform by itself."

And to the question on animal health, so we obviously -- I would start by saying, we look at this objectively. So you should not assume that there is some form of philosophical opposition to thinking about animal health differently. It comes from an objective analysis of what we think creates the greatest long-term value for the Merck shareholder. And that's our focus is long-term value creation. As I look at the Animal Health business and if you really decompose what's happened and why we feel like we're the rightful owner for this asset, you have to start to challenge where is the growth coming from in that business and what would happen outside of Merck. 
I would start with the fact that we do see meaningful synergies coming from the collaboration with Merck Research Labs. As I mentioned, a big portion of the growth we're going to see in animal health long term is coming from new products. And those new products are, in many instances, coming on the companion animal space through products that they've discovered, working with MRL and looking at the human health catalog. And there are also new products coming in vaccines. And obviously, we are the leader in vaccines on the human health side. We're a leader in vaccines on the animal health side. 
So across the pillars of our excellence, there's a nice alignment from a synergy, and that is driving their growth. It's not by accident that they're one of the fastest-growing businesses in the animal health space. It's because of our ability to focus on innovation and leverage those synergies. And then beyond that, I think you have to look at each company and the facts and take them one at a time. So if just maybe one example, if you look back at when Pfizer spun out Zoetis, Zoetis was a low-margin business that had not been invested in. Pfizer effectively said as much. They made a decision because they weren't focused to spin it out. That allowed that company to bring focus and investment and margin expansion that has allowed that multiple to really take off. 
We already have, in our own Animal Health business, a high-margin business where we're focused and invested. So there's not a big margin lift opportunity and there's not, frankly, a big growth acceleration opportunity because I believe we fully invest to drive both the margin and the growth today. So I think as you think in that regard, also, you have to look at it. And then you have to ask what is the contribution to Merck. It's accretive to our growth. It's accretive to cash flow. It's an annuity-like business that allows diversification away from the Human Health business, which we know is important. And it's one where, as we look forward, we continue to believe long-term value will be created. So that's just a few of the points that I would make. 
And I would note, we did where we saw a different set of facts, as we did with the consumer, we will make the right decision. But we continue to believe keeping this business as part of Merck is the best long-term value creator for us and for our shareholders, and that's what drives our thinking."

So on the first question, with regard to the next CFO of the company, what I would expect from that person and what I think is an important role that the CFO can play is to, obviously, first and foremost, you have to be a strong fiduciary for the company. You have to focus and make sure that the controls are in place, the compliance is met and that the company is meeting its reporting responsibility. That's kind of table stakes and expected. What differentiates a CFO, in my perspective, is the ability to partner with the business to find solutions on how to grow strategically. And as I mentioned in the earlier comments, we're going to be investing for growth, but we know that there's going to be pressure. There's a -- on margins. The world is transforming around us. We're going to have to find ways to drive productivity to get every dollar we invest more from that dollar. And I think that's an important area where a CFO can help.
The one thing that being CFO allowed me to do, I sat at the crossroads between each of the divisions, and it allowed me to see the whole company and to start to look at Merck as an integrated whole and to start to look to how can we challenge and drive optimization at the scenes that sit between the divisions because, frankly, those are always where, if you will, the corporate tax is paid. And the more you can eliminate those inefficiencies, the more productive and efficient you can go. And I believe that's what a CFO should do. 
On your question around the margin expansion, it does not change our view of the dividend payout ratio. We're still shooting for that 47% to 50% range. And obviously, we're looking at that both now but even more importantly as we think post-spin. And then we'll continue to reassess that as we go. But right now, that is -- continues to be our long-term goal that we would shoot for."

Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. 
2021 marks Merck's 130th year, which provides an opportunity to reflect on our company's heritage of bringing forward transformative innovation that changed medical paradigms across many therapeutic areas. Today, we are well positioned to achieve sustained future success given our highly talented employees, our scientific expertise, our promising pipeline and our financial and operational strength. We also are taking the right steps to evolve Merck's operating model to best position the company for the future as the industry landscape continues to evolve. 
The upcoming spin-off of Organon will further enhance our focus on innovation and on our key growth drivers, and this will enable necessary investments in cutting-edge science. Merck's leadership progressions have been thoughtfully planned and seamless succession is well underway. Each of our newly appointed leaders have a proven track record of success and embodies the mission of the company. I am confident that this team, led by Rob, is more than ready to take the helm and lead this company into the future. 
Reflecting on the results of this quarter. While the pandemic continued to impact both patient access and health care provider capacity to treat, we delivered solid performance, especially considering the high proportion of physician-administered products in our portfolio, particularly on that theme. And speaking of the pandemic, Merck remains committed to the development of molnupiravir as an important potential treatment for COVID-19, and we are proud to partner with Johnson & Johnson on the production of the vaccine. 
This will be my final earnings call as CEO before I retire from the role on June 30. I want you to note that I appreciate the helpful and constructive input you all have given me over the year. And I look forward to serving as Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors and acting in an advisory role and importantly, to watching Merck achieve even greater success.

We wish him much success and happiness as he embarks on life after his distinguished career as the CEO of Merck, and we look forward to his continuing counsel as he serves as our Executive Chairman. 
As I transition to the CEO role, one of my immediate priorities is to ensure that our experience and an empowered leadership team continues building on a strong foundation and positive momentum we have across the company. To that end, I'm very pleased to welcome Caroline Litchfield to the Executive Committee as our new Chief Financial Officer. Caroline most recently served as Merck's Treasurer and prior to this, was Head of Finance for our Human Health business. She's had a distinguished 30-year career at Merck, serving in finance roles across different regions and businesses and is exceptionally well positioned to lead our finance organization and provide strategic insight as a member of our senior leadership team. 
I'm also very pleased by the expansion of Frank's role to the President of our Human Health business, including both our commercial and marketing operations. Frank's insight and leadership have been critical drivers of Merck's success over the past decade, particularly as we've built out our oncology business and achieved extraordinary commercial success. 
In addition, I've been working closely with Dean to ensure that the connection between the commercial and research operations remain strong. R&D is the lifeblood of Merck. And Dean and his team are fully committed to driving scientific innovation and in efficiently allocating resources to our most promising pipeline opportunities. 
While our portfolio continues to feel the impacts of the pandemic, we are confident that underlying demand for our products remain strong, and we are optimistic that a more normal environment is beginning to emerge. We've executed important business development transactions this quarter and we made meaningful advancements in our pipeline. Frank, Caroline and Dean will speak to this in a moment, but I'll first give you an update on where I've been focusing during this transition period. 
I've been spending a lot of time with the leadership team and many others across the company to ensure we have open lines of communication and a clear path towards continued success. I'm using my time as President to listen to employees throughout the organization to help me flesh out further my own perspectives on our go-forward strategy and to begin to shape our priorities to deliver it. In the meantime, I'm focused on ensuring that we continue to execute on the significant commercial and development opportunities we have in the short term to realize our meaningful growth potential. We're also taking the necessary steps to transform our operating model to best prepare us for the evolving health care landscape over the long term. To that end, we will continue to focus on delivering our late-stage pipeline and advancing programs out of our robust and growing early-stage pipeline. And we will continue to augment our efforts through internal business development focused on meaningful asset additions. The acquisitions of Pan Yong and its potentially foundational immunology asset and the HIV collaboration with Gilead Sciences are great examples of transactions completed this quarter that each has significant value creation potential. 
Finally, we will continue to take the necessary steps to help shape Merck into a leaner, more focused and agile company such as the upcoming spin-off we're working on. We look forward to hosting an Investor Day on Monday, during which the full Organon leadership team will highlight its strategy and opportunities for growth. We expect to complete the spin-off on June 2, with trading in the new stock commencing on June 3. 
In closing, we remain confident that our business is well positioned for strong long-term growth. Our mission will continue to be the fuel that drives our company forward and gives us purpose. Namely, we will continue to be focused on scientific innovation aimed at addressing significant unmet medical needs that improve the lives of the patients we serve. I firmly believe that by keeping patients at the center of everything we do, we create the most value for all of our stakeholders, including our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn the call to Frank."

I'm excited to expand my role as President of Human Health and to build on the commercial success we are driving. We are very confident in the underlying demand for our key products and we continue to anticipate strong growth for our business for the full year. 
That said, the underlying strength in our Human Health business was impacted this quarter due to the increase in cases and additional lockdowns across the globe. These headwinds were in part the continuation of reduced patient access to physician offices and lower-than-normal wellness visits and were more pronounced early in the quarter given the wave of infections that occurred. The rollout of the COVID-19 vaccines and recommendations against co-administration have also impacted parts of our vaccine business. As a reminder, roughly 70% of our pharmaceutical revenue is comprised of physician-administered products. It is important to keep in mind as well that our year-over-year growth was impacted by the particularly strong first quarter we had in 2020, along with quarter-to-quarter variability in sales of GARDASIL. As a result of these factors, our sales were roughly flat compared to last year, or negative 3%, excluding the positive impact of foreign exchange. I'll walk you through some of our expectations for future trends in just a moment, but first, I'll turn to the first quarter performance of our key brands. 
My comments will be on an ex-exchange basis. 
In oncology, KEYTRUDA sales grew 16% to $3.9 billion, reflecting continued strong demand. In the United States, KEYTRUDA continues to maintain its leadership position in lung cancer, including capturing 8 out of 10 eligible new patients and is benefiting from strong usage across all key tumor types, including renal cell carcinoma, bladder, adjuvant melanoma, MSI high indication, triple-negative breast cancer as well as the Q 6-week dosing regimen. Outside the United States, growth continues to be driven by lung cancer indications and our ongoing launches in head and neck cancer and renal cell carcinoma. 
Lynparza grew 51% in the quarter, benefiting from ongoing launches and broader reimbursement that continue to solidify its position as the leading PARP inhibitor. Lenvima was essentially flat, reflecting competitive entrants in hepatocellular carcinoma and a onetime accrual related to the recent NRDL listing for hepatocellular carcinoma in China. Our vaccine portfolio was impacted by lower-than-normal wellness visits, particularly in the United States, along with headwinds related to the rollout of COVID vaccines in adults. 
GARDASIL sales were negatively impacted by the timing of shipments to China last year and the timing of U.S. public sector purchases in both periods, as well as pandemic impacts in the United States and in Europe. 
Pneumovax sales declined due to a challenging year-over-year comparison given strong demand for pneumococcal vaccination at the start of the pandemic last year and the impact of CDC COVID vaccine coadministration guidelines, partially offset by higher ex-U.S. sales. 
Our hospital business continued its recovery from pandemic impacts. BRIDION sales grew 11% year-over-year, driven by broader usage along with updated operating room protocols that allow for more normal levels of elective procedures. 
We remain confident in the underlying demand for our innovative portfolio given the meaningful values of our products to patients. With the strong rollout of the COVID vaccines, we expect that patients will be more comfortable to seek care in a timely manner. In fact, we are encouraged by the recovery trends we saw as we exited the first quarter, with March wellness visits in the United States tracking above prepandemic levels. 
In oncology, since the start of the pandemic, there has been an unfortunate reduction in the level of cancer screenings, which has resulted in fewer patient diagnosis and reduced new patient starts for many oncology agents, particularly in areas like lung cancer. With the rollout of the COVID vaccines, especially among the elderly where cancer incidence is highest, along with increased awareness campaigns, we believe screenings and diagnosis will soon return to normal levels. 
We expect continued strong growth of KEYTRUDA, given its leadership position across many current indications. In addition, we're excited by the recent launch in esophageal cancer and by potential additional indications in renal cell carcinoma, including in combination with [ lymphoma ] and as monotherapy in the adjuvant setting. 
In vaccines, the recent improvement in wellness visits is encouraging as our awareness campaigns would help raise the potential for catch-up vaccinations across the portfolio as patient access improves. We expect COVID vaccines to be available in the adolescent population in the future. And we will monitor the impact on GARDASIL, especially in the back-to-school season. That said, in the United States, in order to enable safe return in-person learning in the fall, there is heavy attention being put on accelerating adolescents physician visits to catch up on missed routine vaccinations and to schedule new vaccinations around the COVID vaccine rollout to this cohort. We will also monitor many ex-U.S. markets where the rate of COVID vaccination has been slower than in the United States and where there have been renewed lockdowns that are expected to impact physician wealth visits and school-based vaccination programs. Overall, however, we believe there is strong global demand for GARDASIL, particularly in ex-U.S. markets like China. We have seen improvements in our capacity to manufacture this year, which will also benefit our sales. Given this, we expect strong global growth for GARDASIL this year. 
To conclude, we are confident in the strength and resilience of our portfolio of innovative medicines and vaccines. We expect to return to more normal operations later this year and strong full year growth. 
There is underlying patient demand for our products, and we believe that once we move through the temporary market dynamics created by the pandemic, our business will resume to a strong growth trajectory long into the future. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Caroline."

I am excited by the opportunity to lead the finance organization and to help ensure that Merck remains well positioned to make the investments in science and innovation necessary to sustain our unique legacy of making a difference in the world and in creating value for patients and shareholders. 
Now turning to our first quarter results. Total company revenues were $12.1 billion in the quarter, roughly flat year-over-year on a nominal basis or down 1% excluding the positive impact of foreign exchange. These results were broadly in line with our initial expectations. 
Frank describes the underlying strength in the Human Health business as well as the ways in which the pandemic affected the quarter, and we estimate the impact was approximately $600 million. 
Animal Health delivered a particularly strong quarter, growing 15% year-over-year, driven by demand across both companion animal and livestock, which grew 24% and 9%, respectively. In companion animal, growth was driven by higher global demand for a parasiticide, primarily the [ Bravedto ] line of products as well as strength in vaccine. Performance in livestock reflects increased demand in international markets across ruminants, poultry and swine as well as strong growth of our intelligence products. 
I'll now walk you through the remainder of our P&L, and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 75.7% in the quarter, a decrease of 0.8%, driven largely by higher costs associated with COVID programs. Operating expenses increased 10% year-over-year to $4.9 billion, driven largely by higher clinical element costs, including our COVID-19 program, increased investment in our early-stage pipeline and higher promotion costs in support of key growth drivers. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 14.1%, a decrease of 2.8% from a year ago, driven by favorable earnings mix and discrete items. Together, we earned $1.40 per share, a decrease of 7%. 
Turning to our updated 2021 guidance for Merck, including Organon. First quarter revenues were broadly in line with our expectations, and we continue to expect revenues of $51.8 billion to $53.8 billion, representing growth of 8% to 12% versus 2020. The underlying strength of our growth pillars provides us with confidence that we will see strong acceleration in revenues throughout the remainder of the year despite a slightly less favorable impact from foreign exchange and a higher projected impact from the pandemic. 
Our revenue guidance does not include revenue from the potential launch of molnupiravir. Our gross margin is now expected to be roughly 76%, slightly less than prior guidance as a result of the impact of COVID. We now expect operating expenses to grow at a mid- to high single-digit rate, a lower growth rate compared to our prior guidance largely driven by diligent management of SG&A expenses. Normalized for the impact of COVID, operating expenses would be expected to grow closer to a mid-single-digit rate. 
Our guidance for other income and expense, tax rate and shares outstanding remain unchanged from last quarter. 
Taken together, we continue to expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $6.48 to $6.68, reflecting growth of 12% to 15%. This range includes the positive impact from foreign exchange of less than 3%. 
With respect to Organon, on a pro forma basis, assuming it operated as an independent company for the full year, Organon is now expected to achieve revenues of $6.1 billion to $6.4 billion. Assuming completion of the spinoff, Merck's anticipates full year revenues from continuing operations to be $45.8 billion to $47.8 billion. We continue to expect operating efficiencies in [indiscernible] spin of approximately $1.5 billion over 3 years, including $500 million in 2021. 
Due to the high profitability of the Organon products versus overall Merck, we expect Merck's operating margin from continuing operations to be slightly lower in 2021 versus what it would have been without the spin-off, but to accelerate and be higher within 12 to 24 months versus where they would have been in the absence of the spin-off and to be greater than 42% in 2024. We remain confident the transaction will benefit the patients for both Merck and Organon and create value to shareholders. Merck expects its revenue and earnings growth rate to be higher after the spin-off. 
Given the faster growth of Merck and the operating efficiencies we expect to achieve as a result of the spin, combined with the faster growth we expect the Organon products to achieve in an independent structure, we expect combined EPS of the 2 companies to be higher within 12 to 24 months versus what would have been achieved without the spin. Upon the close of the Organon spin-off, we expect to receive a special tax-free dividend of $9 billion, which we hope to deploy in value-enhancing strategic business development opportunities. In the absence of meaningful business development, we intend to return cash to shareholders through share repurchases. 
As always, we remain committed to ensuring appropriate investment in our business, both in support of our key brands, but also to drive forward the innovation progressing in our pipeline. And we will look to increase our dividend payout ratio over time. 
In summary, I am excited to embark upon my journey as CFO and to be setting in at a times in which our company is in such a strong financial position. We remain confident in the outlook of our business. And I look forward to doing my part to ensure Merck remains well positioned financially to drive sustainable value to patients and shareholders. 
With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Dean."

For my remarks today, I will cover key regulatory milestones and clinical updates initially in oncology and then in our broader pipeline. And finally, I will discuss recent business development activities. 
In the first quarter, the FDA accepted and granted priority review for a new drug application for belzutifan, our investigational HIF-2 alpha inhibitor that we acquired from Peloton for the treatment of certain patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease-associated renal cell carcinoma with a September PDUFA date. We are evaluating this asset further in 3 ongoing Phase III studies in RCC. 
We initiated a Phase III study evaluating vibostolimab, our investigation on anti-TIGIT antibody in combination with KEYTRUDA in patients with non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors expressed PD-L1. This is one of several co-formulated assets we are on track to advance this year from our oncology portfolio that builds on the success of KEYTRUDA. 
Turning to FDA approvals. KEYTRUDA was indicated in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of certain patients with advanced esophageal carcinoma regardless of PD-L1 expression based on KEYNOTE 590 This marks the 11th approved indication based on a clinical study that demonstrated overall survival. 
Now outside the United States, the European Commission approved new indications for KEYTRUDA for adult and pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma based on the results from KEYNOTE-204 and for patients with microsatellite instability high or mismatch repair deficient previously untreated colorectal cancer based on KEYNOTE 177. 
Now earlier this month, we announced that following an interim analysis, KEY 564, our Phase III study evaluating KEYTRUDA as an adjuvant monotherapy treatment in patients with renal cell carcinoma met its primary endpoint of disease-free survival. These data will be shared with regulatory authorities and presented at ASCO. This provides another proof point for the benefit of KEYTRUDA in earlier lines of therapy, where we expect additional readouts in several other tumor types this year and it also supports our broad development program in patients with renal cell carcinoma. 
We recently received a positive opinion from the CHMP for Q 6-week dosing across KEYTRUDA combination regimens for patients in the EU, which builds upon the 6-week dosing schedule already approved in monotherapy indications. And at the AACR Annual Meeting, initial results from KEYNOTE 555 evaluating a subcutaneous formulation of KEYTRUDA in patients with metastatic melanoma were presented. We are continuing to study this new formulation and other innovative modes of administration and dosing aimed at providing increased benefit and access for patients. 
Along with our partners at Eisai, we presented potentially practice-changing data, demonstrating the benefit of KEYTRUDA plus Lenvima in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma and in second-line advanced endometrial carcinoma based on results from KEYNOTE-581 and KEYNOTE-775, respectively. These studies demonstrated statistically significant improvements across primary and secondary endpoints, and we look forward to working with global regulatory authorities on these filings. 
In February, in collaboration with AstraZeneca, we announced that following an interim analysis, the Phase III OLYMPIA trial, studying Lynparza, as maintenance therapy in the adjuvant treatment of certain patients with germline BRCA-mutated high-risk HER2-negative early-stage breast cancer crossed the superiority boundary for its primary endpoint of invasive disease-free survival versus placebo. The trial continues to evaluate the dual primary endpoints of overall survival and distant disease-free survival, and this data will be presented at ASCO. 
We are also pleased with the positive outcome of yesterday's Oncologic Drug Advisory Committee review of our first-line advanced bladder cancer indication and recognition of the efficacy and safety that KEYTRUDA has demonstrated in clinical trials. We look forward to further discussions with the committee on other accelerated approvals under review. 
Last month, we announced the decision to voluntarily withdraw an indication for KEYTRUDA for the third-line treatment of patients with metastatic small cell lung cancer. As announced, we received a complete response letter from the FDA for a supplemental biologics application for KEYTRUDA for the neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment of patients with triple-negative breast cancer based on KEYNOTE-522. We anticipate the next interim analysis from this trial in the third quarter of 2021, and we look forward to further discussions with the FDA. 
Now turning to our broader pipeline. On molnupiravir, along with our partners at Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, we announced interim results from the dose-finding phase of Phase II/III studies in both outpatient and hospitalized patients. After analysis of the data, we have decided to proceed to Phase III in outpatients with enrollment focused on higher-risk populations. We will be evaluating molnupiravir as a post-exposure prophylactic option in a study starting later this year. 
As previously discussed, we have made the decision to discontinue the development of MK-7110 for COVID-19 and plan to focus our pandemic efforts on advancing molnupiravir and on producing Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine. 
In HIV, we continue to make good progress in our development program for islatravir. Our potentially first-in-class nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor. Data presented at the [ COI ] meeting last month supports the potential of islatravir in long-acting dosing regimens in both the treatment and in the prep settings. Of note, with early data supporting the potential for the subdermal islatravir implant to provide drug concentrations above the target pharmacokinetic threshold for at least 1 year. 
We are pleased to build upon our legacy of innovation and HIV through our collaboration with Gilead Sciences to co-develop and co-commercialize islatravir and lenacapavir. Both have unique properties that we believe have the potential to enable the creation of effective long-acting oral and injectable regimens that provide important new treatment options and address remaining unmet need for people living with HIV. 
Our pneumococcal vaccine, V114, remains on track for potential FDA approval for adults in July and a readout of pediatric data and associated filings by year-end. V114 is the first of a suite of promising pneumococcal vaccine candidates, which also include V116, our adult-focused vaccine, where a readout from our Phase I/II study is expected later this year. 
Finally, we announced that the FDA accepted our new drug application for gefapixant, a potentially first-in-class P2X3 inhibitor in adult patients with refractory and unexplained chronic cough. The decision is expected in December. This application will be subject of an upcoming advisory committee meeting. 
We continue to pursue business development across the most exciting areas of science. Our acquisition of Pandion Therapeutics expands and complements our internal pipeline of candidates targeting autoimmune diseases. Kandi's lead IL-2 candidate has the potential to be meaningfully differentiated based on high selectivity, and we plan to initiate the Phase Ib/II study this year. We continue to make strong progress with the pipeline. This momentum is due to the passion and commitment to the scientists within our research laboratories to bring life-saving medicines and vaccines to patients around the world. 
Now I will turn the call back to Peter."

If you look at the totality of everything, we continue to believe, and over time, I recognize we're going to have to demonstrate, but we continue to believe that, frankly, The Street is underestimating the potential in our pipeline. And thus, while we are very aware of the potential LOE of KEYTRUDA, we do not see the cliff in the same way The Street does. I think we're very well positioned with what we have internally to address a meaningful part of that. 
And then obviously, as we said, we understand we need to continue to be urgent and looking at business development to continue to augment it. But I do think there is a disconnect that over time, I'm confident we will be able to demonstrate. 
As it goes to long-term guidance, I don't want to take a specific position today on whether or not we would ever do that, but I can tell you historically, I do agree with the position Merck has had, which is that can paint you into corners that caused you to make decisions that are not always in the best long-term interest. So I doubt you're going to see us giving 10-year guidance from what you've heard from others. But we'll have to see. I think, though, what is important to understand is I recognize also, though, over time, we're going to have to pull the cover back in a balanced way around our portfolio. I respect our science, I want to make sure we keep the integrity of our science pure, and that's very important. That's who Merck is.

I'll try to give a scientific point of view and then I'll now send it to Frank to give a more commercial sort of point of view. 
In relationship to molnupiravir, we think we are imminently going to do the Phase III trial in the health patient setting, as was noted in the previous question. We're tightening up the inclusion criteria, reducing the allowable symptom duration for enrollment to be less than 5 days, and we're trying to enroll patients early in the course of disease who have a high risk for poor outcomes. That includes age, and other risk factors such as obesity and diabetes. So we think that will be critically important to have a successful and timely trial. 
In relationship to the post-exposure prophylaxis, there's a number of ways one can design that trial. But if I can just take it as a higher elevation, we think that this move out and the prophylaxis studies is going to be very important, not just for Merck but for the world. As one sees the different places of vaccination, some of it albeit extremely low, creating a reservoir for various, the ability to have a small molecule can that can easily be delivered orally is going to be really important for the world.

I would highlight, and specific to your question about GARDASIL. When you have multiple sort of antigens that you have to deliver, I think there is a role for those sort of platforms, protein-based.

But if you look at where Merck has been over the last few years, we've been in a situation where we've been blessed with the benefits of what KEYTRUDA has been able to do. That has required us to do heavy investments to build out our oncology platform, to invest in the clinical studies for oncology and now more broadly, as we look at all of what we have going on in vaccines. And even now with this islatravir in infectious diseases. So the challenge has been in new ways, we had to prioritize, and we made a decision to deprioritize some of the assets that fit within the Organon portfolio. Many of those are still very good assets. And as you know, particularly in the women's health area, an opportunity for real growth. 
So I believe through focus, through being able to actually drive their own capital allocation aimed at building those businesses and the focus they'll be able to bring, they will accelerate the growth across, not only the women's health business, but excitement around what they have in their biosimilars business. And then there are several areas, if you look that they'll highlight next week where I think they can get to a point of growth. So a lot of it is really about focus and capital allocation in a way that we haven't been able to do. While on our side, we believe with the spin, the simplification it brings, will allow us to go after a lot of -- and I've talked about this in the past, a lot of the -- as I've recalled, if you will, think of it as the muscle. The fact that is strong throughout the muscle in this company, given the complexity of our structure that's been built up over time, looking at those areas that sit between our divisions, as we think about manufacturing and commercial, as we think about supply chain and all of those are opportunities for us to simplify and to take out unneeded bureaucratic complexity, that simplification and focus will allow us to bring more resources to bear against our innovative portfolio and to drive faster growth that Caroline commented on. So I think both businesses, you're going to see grow better as independent businesses than they would as a combined entity, and I'm confident in the story for both. 
And frankly, I'm excited about having a women's health-focused business at this time and where we are as a society. I think there's a real opportunity for us to lead there. And that's what I'm looking forward to see Organon do."

As we look out over the coming years, we will see margin improvement as a result of the $1.5 billion of productivity we expect to achieve as a result of the spin, and we are well on track towards that with $500 million included in 2021. 
As we move forward over time, the real strength for operating margin for Merck will primarily come from the growth opportunities we have with our assets in oncology, in vaccines. In addition, you will see continued investment in our business, but we are confident in achieving the 42%. 
As you note, we also have the tailwind of a step down in the royalty rate as it pertains to KEYTRUDA and actually GARDASIL, and that will help in the achievement of the 42%, which we are very confident in. 
As it pertains to the product mix over time, Our company has been diligent and focused in the types of business development we are doing.

Today, we are well positioned to achieve sustained future success given our highly talented employees, our scientific expertise, our promising pipeline and our financial and operational strength. We also are taking the right steps to evolve Merck's operating model to best position the company for the future as the industry landscape continues to evolve. 
The upcoming spin-off of Organon will further enhance our focus on innovation and on our key growth drivers, and this will enable necessary investments in cutting-edge science. Merck's leadership progressions have been thoughtfully planned and seamless succession is well underway. Each of our newly appointed leaders have a proven track record of success and embodies the mission of the company. I am confident that this team, led by Rob, is more than ready to take the helm and lead this company into the future. 
Reflecting on the results of this quarter. While the pandemic continued to impact both patient access and health care provider capacity to treat, we delivered solid performance, especially considering the high proportion of physician-administered products in our portfolio, particularly on that theme. And speaking of the pandemic, Merck remains committed to the development of molnupiravir as an important potential treatment for COVID-19, and we are proud to partner with Johnson & Johnson on the production of their vaccine. 
This will be my final earnings call as CEO before I retire from the role on June 30. I want you to know that I appreciate the helpful and constructive input you all have given me over the year. And I look forward to serving as Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors and acting in an advisory role and importantly, to watching Merck achieve even greater success.

This is Ken's 42nd and final earnings call as CEO. And on behalf of all of us here at Merck, we thank him for his profound contributions to this company, to the scientific community and to our customers and patients around the world. We wish him much success and happiness as he embarks on life after his distinguished career as the CEO of Merck, and we look forward to his continuing counsel as he serves as our Executive Chairman. 
As I transition to the CEO role, one of my immediate priorities is to ensure that our experienced and empowered leadership team continues building on the strong foundation and positive momentum we have across the company. To that end, I'm very pleased to welcome Caroline Litchfield to the Executive Committee as our new Chief Financial Officer. Caroline most recently served as Merck's Treasurer and prior to this, was Head of Finance for our Human Health business. She's had a distinguished 30-year career at Merck, serving in finance roles across different regions and businesses and is exceptionally well positioned to lead our finance organization and provide strategic insight as a member of our senior leadership team. 
I'm also very pleased by the expansion of Frank's role to the President of our Human Health business, including both our commercial and marketing operations. Frank's insight and leadership have been critical drivers of Merck's success over the past decade, particularly as we've built out our oncology business and achieved extraordinary commercial success. In addition, I've been working closely with Dean to ensure that the connection between the commercial and research operations remain strong. R&D is the lifeblood of Merck. And Dean and his team are fully committed to driving scientific innovation and in efficiently allocating resources to our most promising pipeline opportunities. 
While our portfolio continues to feel the impacts of the pandemic, we are confident that underlying demand for our products remain strong, and we are optimistic that a more normal environment is beginning to emerge. We've executed important business development transactions this quarter and we made meaningful advancements in our pipeline. Frank, Caroline and Dean will speak to this in a moment, but I'll first give you an update on where I've been focusing during this transition period. 
I've been spending a lot of time with the leadership team and many others across the company to ensure we have open lines of communication and a clear path towards continued success. I'm using my time as President to listen to employees throughout the organization to help me flesh out further my own perspectives on our go-forward strategy and to begin to shape our priorities to deliver it. In the meantime, I'm focused on ensuring that we continue to execute on the significant commercial and development opportunities we have in the short term to realize our meaningful growth potential while also taking the necessary steps to transform our operating model to best prepare us for the evolving health care landscape over the long term. 
To that end, we will continue to focus on delivering our late-stage pipeline and advancing programs out of our robust and growing early-stage pipeline. And we will continue to augment our efforts through internal business development focused on meaningful asset additions. The acquisitions of Pandion and its potentially foundational immunology asset and the HIV collaboration with Gilead Sciences are great examples of transactions completed this quarter that each has significant value creation potential. 
Finally, we will continue to take the necessary steps to help shape Merck into a leaner, more focused and agile company such as the upcoming spin-off we're working on. We look forward to hosting an Investor Day on Monday, during which the full Organon leadership team will highlight its strategy and opportunities for growth. We expect to complete the spin-off on June 2, with trading on the new stock commencing on June 3. 
In closing, we remain confident that our business is well positioned for strong long-term growth. Our mission will continue to be the fuel that drives our company forward and gives us purpose. Namely, we will continue to be focused on scientific innovation aimed at addressing significant unmet medical needs that improve the lives of the patients we serve. I firmly believe that by keeping patients at the center of everything we do, we create the most value for all of our stakeholders, including our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn the call to Frank."
288502,709040500,2262715,"Merck & Co., Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2021",2021-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Merck & Co., Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rob. Good morning.

I'm excited to expand my role as President of Human Health and to build on the commercial success we are driving. We are very confident in the underlying demand for our key products and we continue to anticipate strong growth for our business for the full year. 
That said, the underlying strength in our Human Health business was impacted this quarter due to the increase in cases and additional lockdowns across the globe. These headwinds were, in part, the continuation of reduced patient access to physician offices and lower-than-normal wellness visits and were more pronounced early in the quarter given the wave of infections that occurred. The rollout of the COVID-19 vaccines and recommendations against co-administration have also impacted parts of our vaccine business. As a reminder, roughly 70% of our pharmaceutical revenue is comprised of physician-administered products. 
It is important to keep in mind as well that our year-over-year growth was impacted by the particularly strong first quarter we had in 2020, along with quarter-to-quarter variability in sales of GARDASIL. As a result of these factors, our sales were roughly flat compared to last year, or negative 3%, excluding the positive impact of foreign exchange. I'll walk you through some of our expectations for future trends in just a moment, but first, I'll turn to the first quarter performance of our key brands. My comments will be on an ex exchange basis. 
In oncology, KEYTRUDA sales grew 16% to $3.9 billion, reflecting continued strong demand. In the United States, KEYTRUDA continues to maintain its leadership position in lung cancer, including capturing 8 out of 10 eligible new patients and is benefiting from strong usage across all key tumor types, including renal cell carcinoma, bladder, adjuvant melanoma or MSI high indication, triple-negative breast cancer as well as the Q 6-week dosing regimen. Outside the United States, growth continues to be driven by lung cancer indications and our ongoing launches in head and neck cancer and renal cell carcinoma. 
Lynparza grew 51% in the quarter, benefiting from ongoing launches and broader reimbursement that continue to solidify its position as the leading PARP inhibitor. Lenvima was essentially flat, reflecting competitive entrants in hepatocellular carcinoma and a onetime accrual related to the recent NRDL listing for hepatocellular carcinoma in China. 
Our vaccine portfolio was impacted by lower-than-normal wellness visits, particularly in the United States, along with headwinds related to the rollout of COVID vaccines in adults. GARDASIL sales were negatively impacted by the timing of shipments to China last year and the timing of U.S. public sector purchases in both periods as well as pandemic impacts in the United States and in Europe. PNEUMOVAX sales declined due to a challenging year-over-year comparison given strong demand for pneumococcal vaccination at the start of the pandemic last year and the impact of CDC COVID vaccine coadministration guidelines partially offset by higher ex U.S. sales. 
Our hospital business continued its recovery from pandemic impacts. BRIDION sales grew 11% year-over-year driven by broader usage along with updated operating room protocols that allow for more normal levels of elective procedures. We remain confident in the underlying demand for our innovative portfolio given the meaningful values of our products to patients. With the strong rollout of the COVID vaccines, we expect that patients will be more comfortable to seek care in a timely manner. In fact, we are encouraged by the recovery trends we saw as we exited the first quarter, with March wellness visits in the United States tracking above prepandemic levels. 
In oncology, since the start of the pandemic, there has been an unfortunate reduction in the level of cancer screenings, which has resulted in fewer patient diagnoses and reduced new patient starts for many oncology agents, particularly in areas like lung cancer. With the rollout of the COVID vaccines, especially among the elderly where cancer incidence is highest, along with increased awareness campaigns, we believe screenings and diagnosis will soon return to normal levels. We expect continued strong growth of KEYTRUDA, given its leadership position across many current indications. 
In addition, we're excited by the recent launch in esophageal cancer and by potential additional indications in renal cell carcinoma, including in combination with Lenvima and as monotherapy in the adjuvant setting. In vaccines, the recent improvement in wellness visits is encouraging as our awareness campaigns would help raise the potential for catch-up vaccinations across the portfolio as patient access improves. We expect COVID vaccines to be available in the adolescent population in the future. 
And we will monitor the impact on GARDASIL, especially in the back-to-school season. That said, in the United States, in order to enable safe return to in-person learning in the fall, there is heavy attention being put on accelerating adolescents' physician visits to catch up on missed routine vaccinations and to schedule new vaccinations around the COVID vaccine rollout to this cohort. We will also monitor many ex U.S. markets where the rate of COVID vaccination has been slower than in the United States and where there have been renewed lockdowns that are expected to impact physician well visits and school-based vaccination programs. Overall, however, we believe there is strong global demand for GARDASIL, particularly in ex U.S. markets like China. We have seen improvements in our capacity to manufacture this year, which will also benefit our sales. Given this, we expect strong global growth for GARDASIL this year. 
To conclude, we are confident in the strength and resilience of our portfolio of innovative medicines and vaccines. We expect to return to more normal operations later this year and strong full year growth. There is underlying patient demand for our products, and we believe that once we move through the temporary market dynamics created by the pandemic, our business will resume to a strong growth trajectory long into the future. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Caroline."

I am extremely honored to be Merck's new Chief Financial Officer and work more closely with the team of extraordinary leaders who share my deep passion for Merck's mission. I am excited by the opportunity to lead the finance organization and to help ensure that Merck remains well positioned to make the investments in science and innovation necessary to sustain our unique legacy of making a difference in the world and in creating value for patients and shareholders. 
Now turning to our first quarter results. Total company revenues were $12.1 billion in the quarter, roughly flat year-over-year on a nominal basis or down 1% excluding the positive impact of foreign exchange. These results were broadly in line with our initial expectations. Frank describes the underlying strength in the human health business as well as the ways in which the pandemic affected the quarter, and we estimate the impact was approximately $600 million. 
Animal Health delivered a particularly strong quarter, growing 15% year-over-year driven by demand across both companion animal and livestock, which grew 24% and 9%, respectively. In companion animal, growth was driven by higher global demand for our parasiticides, primarily the BRAVECTO line of products, as well as strength in vaccine. Performance in livestock reflects increased demand in international markets across ruminants, poultry and swine as well as strong growth of our Intelligence products. 
I'll now walk you through the remainder of our P&L, and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 75.7% in the quarter, a decrease of 0.8%, driven largely by higher costs associated with COVID programs. Operating expenses increased to 10% year-over-year to $4.9 billion driven largely by higher clinical development costs, including our COVID-19 program, increased investment in our early-stage pipeline and higher provision costs in support of key growth drivers. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 14.1%, a decrease of 2.8% from a year ago driven by favorable earnings mix and discrete items. Together, we earned $1.40 per share, a decrease of 7%. 
Turning to our updated 2021 guidance for Merck, including Organon. First quarter revenues were broadly in line with our expectations, and we continue to expect revenues of $51.8 billion to $53.8 billion, representing growth of 8% to 12% versus 2020. The underlying strength of our growth pillars provides us with confidence that we will see strong acceleration in revenues throughout the remainder of the year despite a slightly less favorable impact from foreign exchange and a higher projected impact from the pandemic. 
Our revenue guidance does not include revenue from the potential launch of molnupiravir. Our gross margin is now expected to be roughly 76%, slightly less than prior guidance as a result of the impact of COVID. We now expect operating expenses to grow at a mid- to high single-digit rate, a lower growth rate compared to our prior guidance largely driven by diligent management of SG&A expenses. Normalized for the impact of COVID, operating expenses would be expected to grow closer to a mid-single-digit rate. Our guidance for other income and expense, tax rate and shares outstanding remain unchanged from last quarter. Taken together, we continue to expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $6.48 to $6.68, reflecting growth of 12% to 15%. This range includes the positive impact from foreign exchange of less than 3%. 
With respect to Organon, on a pro-forma basis, assuming it's operated as an independent company for the full year, Organon is now expected to achieve revenues of $6.1 billion to $6.4 billion. Assuming completion of the spinoff, Merck anticipates full year revenues from continuing operations to be $45.8 billion to $47.8 billion. We continue to expect operating efficiencies enabled by the spin of approximately $1.5 billion over 3 years, including $500 million in 2021. 
Due to the high profitability of the Organon products versus overall Merck, we expect Merck's operating margin from continuing operations to be slightly lower in 2021 versus what it would have been without the spin-off but to accelerate and be higher within 12 to 24 months versus where they would have been in the absence of the spin-off and to be greater than 42% in 2024. We remain confident the transaction will benefit the patients that both Merck and Organon serve and create value for shareholders. 
Merck expects its revenue and earnings growth rate to be higher after the spin-off. Given the faster growth of Merck and the operating efficiencies we expect to achieve as a result of the spin, combined with the faster growth we expect the Organon products to achieve in an independent structure, we expect combined EPS of the 2 companies to be higher within 12 to 24 months versus what would have been achieved without the spin. 
Upon the close of the Organon spin-off, we expect to receive a special tax-free dividend of $9 billion, which we hope to deploy in value-enhancing strategic business development opportunity. In the absence of meaningful business development, we intend to return cash to shareholders through share repurchases. As always, we remain committed to ensuring appropriate investment in our business, both in support of our key brands but also to drive forward the innovation progressing in our pipeline. And we will look to increase our dividend payout ratio over time. 
In summary, I am excited to embark upon my journey as CFO and to be stepping in at a time in which our company is in such a strong financial position. We remain confident in the outlook of our business. And I look forward to doing my part to ensure Merck remains well positioned financially to drive sustainable value to patients and shareholders. 
With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Dean."

For my remarks today, I will cover key regulatory milestones and clinical updates initially in oncology and then in our broader pipeline. And finally, I will discuss recent business development activities. 
In the first quarter, the FDA accepted and granted priority review for a new drug application for belzutifan, our investigational HIF-2 alpha inhibitor that we acquired from Peloton for the treatment of certain patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease-associated renal cell carcinoma with a September PDUFA date. We are evaluating this asset further in 3 ongoing Phase III studies in RCC. We initiated a Phase III study evaluating vibostolimab, our investigation on anti-TIGIT antibody in combination with KEYTRUDA in patients with non-small cell lung cancer whose tumor has expressed PD-L1. This is one of several co-formulated assets we are on track to advance this year from our oncology portfolio that builds on the success of KEYTRUDA. 
Turning to FDA approvals. KEYTRUDA was indicated in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of certain patients with advanced esophageal carcinoma regardless of PD-L1 expression based on KEYNOTE-590. This marks the 11th approved indication based on a clinical study that demonstrated overall survival. Now outside the United States, the European Commission approved new indications for KEYTRUDA for adult and pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma based on the results from KEYNOTE-204 and for patients with microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair deficient previously untreated colorectal cancer based on KEYNOTE-177. 
Now earlier this month, we announced that following an interim analysis, KEYNOTE-564, our Phase III study evaluating KEYTRUDA as an adjuvant monotherapy treatment in patients with renal cell carcinoma met its primary endpoint of disease-free survival. These data will be shared with regulatory authorities and presented at ASCO. This provides another proof point for the benefit of KEYTRUDA in earlier lines of therapy, where we expect additional readouts in several other tumor types this year and it also supports our broad development program in patients with renal cell carcinoma. 
We recently received a positive opinion from the CHMP for Q 6-week dosing across KEYTRUDA combination regimens for patients in the EU, which builds upon the 6-week dosing schedule already approved in monotherapy indications. And at the AACR Annual Meeting, initial results from KEYNOTE-555, evaluating a subcutaneous formulation of KEYTRUDA in patients with metastatic melanoma, were presented. We are continuing to study this new formulation and other innovative modes of administration and dosing aimed at providing increased benefit and access for patients. 
Along with our partners at Eisai, we presented potentially practice-changing data, demonstrating the benefit of KEYTRUDA plus Lenvima in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma and in second-line advanced endometrial carcinoma based on results from KEYNOTE-581 and KEYNOTE-775, respectively. These studies demonstrated statistically significant improvements across primary and secondary endpoints, and we look forward to working with global regulatory authorities on these filings. 
In February, in collaboration with AstraZeneca, we announced that following an interim analysis, the Phase III OlympiA trial, studying Lynparza as maintenance therapy in the adjuvant treatment of certain patients with germline BRCA-mutated high-risk HER2-negative early-stage breast cancer crossed the superiority boundary for its primary endpoint of invasive disease-free survival versus placebo. The trial continues to evaluate the dual primary endpoints of overall survival and distant disease-free survival, and this data will be presented at ASCO. We are also pleased with the positive outcome of yesterday's Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee review of our first-line advanced bladder cancer indication and recognition of the efficacy and safety that KEYTRUDA has demonstrated in clinical trials. We look forward to further discussions with the committee on other accelerated approvals under review. 
Last month, we announced the decision to voluntarily withdraw an indication for KEYTRUDA for the third-line treatment of patients with metastatic small cell lung cancer. As announced, we received a complete response letter from the FDA for a supplemental biologics application for KEYTRUDA for the neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment of patients with triple-negative breast cancer based on KEYNOTE-522. We anticipate the next interim analysis from this trial in the third quarter of 2021, and we look forward to further discussions with the FDA. 
Now turning to our broader pipeline. On molnupiravir, along with our partners at Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, we announced interim results from the dose-finding phase of Phase II/III studies in both outpatient and hospitalized patients. After analysis of the data, we have decided to proceed to Phase III in outpatients with enrollment focused on higher-risk populations. We will be evaluating molnupiravir as a postexposure prophylactic option in a study starting later this year. As previously discussed, we have made the decision to discontinue the development of MK-7110 for COVID-19 and plan to focus our pandemic efforts on advancing molnupiravir and on producing Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine. 
In HIV, we continue to make good progress in our development program for islatravir, our potentially first-in-class nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor. Data presented at the CROI meeting last month supports the potential of islatravir in long-acting dosings regimens in both the treatment and in the PrEP settings. Of note was early data supporting the potential for the subdermal islatravir implant to provide drug concentrations above the target pharmacokinetic threshold for at least 1 year. 
We are pleased to build upon our legacy of innovation in HIV through our collaboration with Gilead Sciences to co-develop and co-commercialize islatravir and lenacapavir. Both have unique properties that we believe have the potential to enable the creation of effective long-acting oral and injectable regimens that provide important new treatment options and address remaining unmet need for people living with HIV. 
Our pneumococcal vaccine, V114, remains on track for potential FDA approval for adults in July and a readout of pediatric data and associated filings by year-end. V114 is the first of a suite of promising pneumococcal vaccine candidates, which also include V116, our adult-focused vaccine, where a readout from our Phase I/II study is expected later this year. Finally, we announced that the FDA accepted our new drug application for gefapixant, a potentially first-in-class P2X3 inhibitor in adult patients with refractory and unexplained chronic cough. The decision is expected in December. This application will be subject of an upcoming advisory committee meeting. 
We continue to pursue business development across the most exciting areas of science. Our acquisition of Pandion Therapeutics expands and complements our internal pipeline of candidates targeting autoimmune diseases. Pandion's lead IL-2 candidate has the potential to be meaningfully differentiated based on high selectivity, and we plan to initiate the Phase Ib/II study this year. We continue to make strong progress with the pipeline. This momentum is due to the passion and commitment to the scientists within our research laboratories to bring life-saving medicines and vaccines to patients around the world. 
Now I will turn the call back to Peter."

And thus, while we are very aware of the potential LOE of KEYTRUDA, we do not see the cliff in the same way The Street does. I think we're very well positioned with what we have internally to address a meaningful part of that. And then obviously, as we said, we understand we need to continue to be urgent and looking at business development to continue to augment it. But I do think there is a disconnect. And over time, I'm confident we will be able to demonstrate. 
As it goes to long-term guidance, I don't want to take a specific position today on whether or not we would ever do that, but I can tell you historically, I do agree with the position Merck has had, which is that can paint you into corners that caused you to make decisions that are not always in the best long-term interest. So I doubt you're going to see us giving 10-year guidance on what you've heard from others. But we'll have to see. I think, though, what is important to understand is I recognize also, though, over time, we're going to have to pull the cover back in a balanced way around our portfolio. I respect our science and I want to make sure we keep the integrity of our science pure, and that's very important. That's who Merck is.

I'll try to give a scientific point of view and then I'll now send it to Frank to give a more commercial sort of point of view. 
In relationship to molnupiravir, we think we are imminently going to do the Phase III trial in the outpatient setting, as was noted in the previous question. We're tightening up the inclusion criteria, reducing the allowable symptom duration for enrollment to be less than 5 days, and we're trying to enroll patients early in the course of disease who have a high risk for poor outcomes. That includes age and other risk factors such as obesity and diabetes. So we think that will be critically important to have a successful and timely trial. 
In relationship to the postexposure prophylaxis, there's a number of ways one can design that trial. But if I can just take it as a higher elevation, we think that this MOVe-OUT and the prophylaxis studies is going to be very important, not just for Merck but for the world. As one sees the different places of vaccination, some of it albeit extremely low, it's creating a reservoir for variants -- the ability to have a small molecule that can easily be delivered orally is going to be really important for the world. So that's what we've been focused on.

I would reemphasize that Merck has been very interested in mRNA and other nucleic acid technology and specifically in the vaccine in mRNA. For the past 5 to 6 years, Merck has partnered with Moderna on vaccines for infectious disease and vaccines for cancer. The validation of the mRNA technology in COVID is impressive and at least, personally, is deserving of admiration and thanks. We continue to be interested in mRNA and other nucleic-acid-based technologies, including viral-based platforms, for vaccines. 
I would highlight, and specific to your question about GARDASIL, when you have multiple sort of antigens that you have to deliver, I think there is a role for those sort of platforms, protein-based. I think there's going to be many different platforms that need to be done specifically for the vaccine and the threat that you're trying to prevent. So RNA and other nucleic-acid-based technologies is important to us, including viral-based platforms. But we also think that broader speaking, there are other protein subunit, other vaccine platforms that will still be relevant moving forward."

But if you look at where Merck has been over the last few years, we've been in a situation where we've been blessed with the benefits of what KEYTRUDA has been able to do. That has required us to do heavy investments to build out our oncology platform, to invest in the clinical studies for oncology and now more broadly, as we look at all of what we have going on in vaccines and even now with this islatravir in infectious diseases. So the challenge has been, in new ways, we had to prioritize, and we made a decision to deprioritize some of the assets that fit within the Organon portfolio. Many of those are still very good assets. And as you know, particularly in the women's health area, an opportunity for real growth. 
So I believe through focus, through being able to actually drive their own capital allocation aimed at building those businesses and the focus they'll be able to bring, they will accelerate the growth across, not only the women's health business, but excitement around what they have in their biosimilars business. And then there are several areas, if you look that they'll highlight next week where I think they can get to a point of growth. So a lot of it is really about focus and capital allocation in a way that we haven't been able to do.
While on our side, we believe with the spin, the simplification it brings will allow us to go after a lot of -- and I've talked about this in the past, a lot of the, as I've called it, if you will, think of it as the muscle. The fat that is chewing throughout the muscle in this company, given the complexity of our structure that's been built up over time, looking at those areas that sit between our divisions, as we think about manufacturing and commercial, as we think about supply chain and all of those are opportunities for us to simplify and to take out unneeded bureaucratic complexity, that simplification and focus will allow us to bring more resources to bear against our innovative portfolio and to drive faster growth that Caroline commented on. 
So I think both businesses, you're going to see grow better as independent businesses than they would as a combined entity, and I'm confident in the story for both. And frankly, I'm excited about having a women's-health-focused business at this time in where we are as a society. I think there's a real opportunity for us to lead there. And that's what I'm looking forward to see Organon do."

Our company's guidance for this year implies margins of 38%, a growth of 120 basis points compared with last year, and we're driving that growth as a result of the strong revenue and mix of revenue in our business as well as continued diligent but focused investments within our business. As we look out over the coming years, we will see margin improvement as a result of the $1.5 billion of productivity we expect to achieve as a result of the spin, and we are well on track towards that with $500 million included in 2021. As we move forward over time, the real strength for operating margin for Merck will primarily come from the growth opportunities we have with our assets in oncology, in vaccines. In addition, you will see continued investment in our business, but we are confident in achieving the 42%. 
As you note, we also have the tailwind of a step down in the royalty rate as it pertains to KEYTRUDA and actually GARDASIL, and that will help in the achievement of the 42%, which we are very confident in. As it pertains to the product mix over time, our company has been diligent and focused in the types of business development we are doing. And Peloton is an ideal example, where we have the opportunity to see the fruit of that impact the top line of our company therefore, the bottom line, as well as support the patients that we serve.

And as we look for these foundational medicines and the recent discussions with Gilead and Pandion, it just shows that, that sort of attitude of how we want to sort of proceed where we're taking foundational medicines and we're matching them with internal and external pipeline so that we can diversify the pipeline. 
And specific to your question, I would look at the '21 to '24 range. There's a whole slew of Lynparza, Lenvima, KEYTRUDA study that you will see, a lot of it driving to adjuvant at earlier stages.

I'm deeply honored to speak to you today in my new role as CEO. Merck is a special company, and I'm fortunate to be surrounded by talented and dedicated colleagues who are intently focused on bringing important life enhancing and life-saving medicines and vaccines to people and animals around the world. This long-standing and unwavering commitment to our mission is real, is tangible, and is what drives us to perform every day. The prioritization of investment in research and development under Dean's leadership and the focus of resources behind key growth drivers has put us in a position of strength that I intend to build upon. As I consider Merck's future, I continue to believe investment in research and development with patients at the center of everything we do is core to who Merck is and is our best path to sustainable ongoing success and value creation. 
However, how we go about both delivering the best external and internal scientific opportunities, as well as how we bring those innovations to patients, must evolve. As I transition to the role of CEO, I solicited candid feedback from colleagues and external stakeholders. What I heard reaffirms my convictions. There's a broad agreement that investment in R&D should remain our highest strategic priority. Employees are confident that we're on the right path. We have rebuilt and reinvigorated our discovery research engine and have a growing and robust pipeline. We're successfully executing on clinical development, and we're delivering strong commercial growth across both our Human and Animal Health businesses now, and will continue to do so well into the future. 
While we are on the right path, we need to work with more speed, urgency and agility, more closely matching the pace of change in the broader environment. We need to accelerate the delivery of our innovations to the patients who need them, and to be leaner, nimbler and more digitally enabled. We need to leverage the scale and reach we have as a global biopharmaceutical leader, while also embracing a commitment to evolve to address new challenges. And we need to move with focus and intentionality, which is a priority for both me and my management team. 
I know that it's not about promising, it's about performing. Actions speak louder than words. With that understanding, I pledge to do all I can to ensure that Merck remains a global biopharmaceutical leader long into the future, delivering value to current and future patients and growth and value for our shareholders. 
Now turning to the quarter, we had very good performance with strong growth. Our results demonstrate that the impact of the pandemic on our business is lessening. Patient access to health care providers has improved, and we expect continued strong growth in the remainder of the year. We're also making meaningful clinical advancements which Dean will speak to you in just a few moments. Our seamless execution during a period in which we successfully completed a complex spin-off without business interruption underwent leadership transitions and delivered accelerated growth only increases my confidence in what our organization can achieve in the future. 
Organon is now an independent company, an important milestone in our company's history. And this transaction is a meaningful catalyst to Merck becoming a more focused, more efficient and faster growing company. 
Let me spend a moment speaking about KEYTRUDA, which again experienced very strong growth this quarter. I'm confident that KEYTRUDA will continue to be a foundational cancer therapy and achieved strong growth for years to come. We are a leader in immuno-oncology and are determined to leverage this and to sustained success. We are rapidly advancing a diverse set of oncology assets, many of which we highlighted in our recent ASCO investor presentation. Across our oncology portfolio, we expect over 90 potential new indications by 2028, more than tripling our current base. We have a wide array of clinical partnerships, providing valuable insights into the biology of disease and into important potential external innovation. With our expanding oncology portfolio outside of KEYTRUDA, we will extend our leadership in cancer long into the future. I also strongly believe we will successfully navigate the eventual KEYTRUDA loss of exclusivity given the breadth of opportunity in areas both within as well as outside of oncology. Internally, our leaders are intensely focused on this period and efforts are underway. 
Externally, I understand the importance of providing investors with increased transparency into the breadth of opportunities we see in our pipeline that will help us do this. As we've done recently in highlighting islatravir, our broader HIV portfolio and our next-generation oncology assets, we are planning deep-dive investor events with our scientific and commercial leaders focused on other areas of our pipeline that we believe are underappreciated yet hold great promise such as our suite of vaccine candidates, our cardiometabolic assets, as well as others. 
Business development plays an important role, and we are putting an increased emphasis on ensuring we are appropriately aggressive in accessing the best external science. Executing value-enhancing BD is a top priority, and we intend to add to our pipeline through acquisitions, partnerships, licensing deals and collaborations. We will be unbounded by therapeutic area, though we are mindful of the need to have a balanced portfolio over time. 
We'll seek new products, modalities and platforms that allow us to establish beachheads in important areas. Our recent acquisition of Pandion and its potentially foundational immunology asset is a good example of this. We will look at both early and late-stage opportunities and we have the financial flexibility to consider deals of all sizes, particularly given the $9 billion distribution from the Organon spin-off. And given our strong operational momentum, we are most interested in transactions that are easily integrated and less disruptive, where value is principally derived by the introduction of innovative new products that address patient needs instead of the cost synergies. 
Before I turn the call over to Frank to discuss second quarter performance on our Human Health business, I want you to know that I appreciate and applaud the increasing societal and investor demand and corporation stack responsibly. In fact, I believe our strong performance across environmental, social and governance issues has and will continue to create sustainable value for all of our stakeholders. Merck has a long track record and history of strong corporate citizenship, and I'm committed to remaining a leader in this area. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Frank."

As Rob highlighted, our Human Health business continues to regain momentum, and we achieved 18% growth in the quarter, excluding the impact of exchange. Across our business, we've been engaging and investing with urgency to encourage more normal levels of physician office visits, oncology screenings and vaccination rates, including catch-up from misdoses. The agility demonstrated by our teams around the world to quickly reallocate resources to drive these patient activation programs has benefited our largely physician-administered portfolio. 
In the United States, we are encouraged that wellness visits and surgical procedures have returned to more normal levels. And in oncology, we're seeing screening rates continue to improve. We're confident that these favorable trends and the strong underlying demand for our products will drive accelerated underlying business momentum in the second half of the year. 
Now I'll turn to the second quarter performance of our key brands. My comments will be on an ex exchange basis. In oncology, KEYTRUDA sales grew 20% to $4.2 billion, reflecting continued strong global demand. In the United States, KEYTRUDA continues to demonstrate strong growth, and over the course of the pandemic has increased its market share of new patients within the immuno-oncology class. KEYTRUDA also maintains its leadership position in lung cancer, capturing 8 out of 10 eligible new patients. We continue to see strong growth across all key  [indiscernible] very strong start with our launch of KEYNOTE-355 in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, and we look forward to adding overall survival to the label. We're also excited by the recent approval and upcoming launch of KEYNOTE-522 in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant setting. 
Outside the United States, growth continues to be driven by lung cancer indications, and the ongoing launches in head and neck cancer and renal cell carcinoma. LYNPARZA grew 34% in the quarter and remains the leading PARP inhibitor. Growth continues to be driven by approvals of recent indications, and we look forward to a potential future launch in adjuvant breast cancer based on the OlympiA data presented at ASCO this year. LENVIMA grew 15% in the quarter, reflecting increased demand in hepatocellular carcinoma following the NRDL listing in China. We are also excited to launch the recently approved combination of LENVIMA plus KEYTRUDA in endometrial carcinoma. And in the near future to potentially launch in renal cell carcinoma based on KEYNOTE-581. 
Our vaccines portfolio recovered sharply due to the return to more normal level of wellness visits. GARDASIL had a very strong quarter, growing 78%. In the United States, higher sales were driven by a recovery from the negative impact of last year's lockdowns. Outside the United States, growth was driven by increased demand in China. Sales also benefited from increased supply due to improved manufacturing, which I'll provide additional details on in a moment. 
Our hospital business continued its recovery, BRIDION sales grew 67% year-over-year, driven by increased surgeries as patient access to hospitals improved from last year. 
Turning to our outlook, the recovery we saw in the quarter gives us confidence that we will have a very strong second half resulting from both market recovery and strong commercial execution. Over the quarter, Merck quickly pivoted its focus and resources to patient activation campaigns to ensure that patients are putting their health first and recognize the importance of returning to physicians' offices for screenings, early detection and routine visits. Our efforts in partnership with public health constituent groups paired with the continued rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations, has resulted in meaningful improvements in patients accessing health care providers. 
In adolescents, we've seen more than 1/3 of teens in the United States vaccinated against COVID-19 with at least 1 dose. We assume that these rapidly growing vaccination rates and continued commercial execution will help to drive a near-normal back-to-school season. Merck has also shown increased agility and efficiency across our organization, and importantly, we've made improvements that will enable meaningful future growth. Of note, we expect GARDASIL to significantly benefit from increases in productivity across our supply chain, which will allow us to fulfill demand that we were previously unable to supply. Furthermore, as global demand for GARDASIL continues to outpace supply, our teams have been working to ensure we have the right regulatory approvals and lead time to appropriately allocate doses to areas of increased demand, particularly as the pandemic continues to force lockdowns in many geographies. These improvements alone will drive very strong sequential and year-over-year growth for GARDASIL in the back half of the year, especially in ex U.S. markets, such as China. 
In oncology, we're encouraged by the recovery we've seen to date and our overall performance throughout the pandemic. We remain confident in the underlying demand for our broad and innovative portfolio, including KEYTRUDA, LYNPARZA, LENVIMA and if approved, belzutifan and expect to drive strong and sustained growth across key tumor types and stages of disease. Overall, the improvements in patient access we are seeing in major markets gives us increased confidence as we look to the second half of the year. 
Before I conclude, I would like to mention the strong execution of our commercial colleagues around the world that enabled our company to drive strong growth in the first half of the year, all the while, we're working to successfully complete the spin-off of Organon. We are confident that the spin-off results in meaningful benefits to the commercial organization, including the ability to drive even stronger growth through more focused commercial execution. [indiscernible] resiliency, but it's value to patients globally. The strong recovery we saw in the quarter underscores our confidence in the underlying demand for our innovative medicines and vaccines, and we look forward to a return to robust long-term demand-driven growth. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Caroline."

Our business delivered meaningful growth in the quarter driven by strong underlying demand for products across our growth pillars and the continued recovery of the business as patient access improves. [indiscernible] and animal 11.4  [indiscernible] or 19%, excluding the positive impact of foreign exchange. Further adjusting for the estimated impact of the pandemic, total revenues grew 8% year-over-year, evidence of the underlying strength of our business. 
The remainder of my comments will be on an ex exchange basis. As Frank highlighted, our Human Health business showed improving momentum, growing 18% or 6% when adjusted for the estimated impact of the pandemic. Animal Health had an outstanding quarter, increasing 27% driven [indiscernible]  companion animal and livestock, which included 38% to 20%, respectively. [indiscernible] pandemic impact [indiscernible] as we drive higher below mine for vaccines as has included to line of products. Performance in livestock reflects increased global demand across ruminants, swine and poultry products along with higher demand for our animal health intelligence product. 
I'll now walk you through the remainder of our P&L, and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 76.5% in the quarter, a decrease of 0.6% and reflecting the unfavorable effects of foreign exchange, pricing pressure and higher manufacturing costs, partially offset by favorable product mix. Operating expenses increased 13% year-over-year to $4.8 billion, driven largely by higher clinical development costs, increased investment in our early-stage pipeline and higher promotion costs in support of returned care activity for our key growth drivers. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 14.6% an increase of 1.3% from a year ago, driven by discrete items last year. Taken together, we earned $1.31 per share, an increase of 27%. 
Before turning to our 2021 guidance, I want to remind you briefly of the benefits we expect to achieve as a result of the spin-off of Organon. With the spin completed, Merck is now a more focused company and better positioned to unlock the full potential of our growth pillars and drive accelerated profitable growth. We are very excited about our future. And as we look out to 2024, we continue to believe that our revenue potential is underappreciated. 
Now for 2021, health systems and patients have largely adapted to the impacts of the pandemic, and we assume this trend will continue. We are narrowing and raising our expected revenue range to $46.4 billion to $47.4 billion, representing growth of 12% to 14%, including a positive impact from foreign exchange of less than 2% using mid-July rates. The underlying demand for our growth pillars and our strong commercial execution provides us with confidence that we will continue to see strong momentum throughout the remainder of the year. As such, we expect total revenues to be sequentially higher in each consecutive quarter. 
Our gross margin is expected to be between 76% and 77%. We expect operating expenses to grow at a high single-digit rate, driven by increased investment in promotion and patient activation programs to accelerate our near-term business momentum. And by increased R&D investment to advance our exciting pipeline to support sustainable long-term revenue growth. As a reminder, our operating margin from continuing operations will be lower than what they were as a combined company, but our guidance range implies significant operating leverage in 2021. In addition, we continue to expect operating margins of greater than 42% in 2024, driven by our accelerated revenue growth and disciplined investment in our business. 
In other income and expense, we expect expense of approximately $300 million. We expect our full year tax rate to be between 14.5% and 15.5%. We assumed 2.53 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we expect non-GAAP EPS -- excuse me, to be between $5.47 and $5.57, reflecting growth of 21% to 23%.  This range includes a positive impact from foreign exchange of approximately 2% using mid-July rates. 
As you consider your models and the allocation of revenues to various products, there are 2 areas to focus on: GARDASIL and Animal Health. Frank described the strong acceleration in growth expected in GARDASIL, and we also expect continued momentum in our Animal Health business. Our updated guidance also reflects the benefits of the approval of KEYNOTE-522, and as a reminder, does not include revenue from the potential launch of molnupiravir. 
Turning to capital allocation. We received $9 billion cash distribution from Organon, which we intend to deploy in value-enhancing strategic business development opportunities that align with the parameters Rob outlined. In the absence of meaningful business development, we will return cash to shareholders through share repurchases. We remain committed to investing in support of our key brands and progressing our innovative pipeline. And we will look to increase our dividend payout ratio over time. 
To conclude, as a leaner, more focused and agile company,  Merck is prepared to capitalize on the meaningful opportunities that lie ahead and is better equipped to succeed in an ever-changing landscape. Merck remains in a position of financial and operational strength, which we will leverage to drive long-term sustainable growth and value creation for our patients and shareholders. 
With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Dean."

I'm delighted to be here today to provide an overview of progress made over the past quarter. I will cover key regulatory milestones and clinical updates, initially in oncology and then across the broader pipeline. As Rob highlighte",1614,"Thank you, Caroline. I'm delighted to be here today to provide an overview of progress made over the past quarter. I will cover key regulatory milestones and clinical updates, initially in oncology and then across the broader pipeline. 
As Rob highlighted, we continue to show strong momentum in our oncology pipeline which positions us well. And it's worth reiterating our goal: to potentially deliver 90-plus approvals and new indications by 2028. A recent report from the American Cancer Society noted that there's been a rapid decrease in lung cancer and melanoma deaths from 2014 to 2018. One factor attributed to this decline is advancements in research including targeted therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors. The report also notes there is an urgent need to [indiscernible] a decline in death rates for breast, prostate and other cancers where Merck is just beginning to make an impact. We are hopeful that our contributions and the advances being made industry-wide, will continue to fuel this decline. 
Notably, during the last quarter, we achieved several milestones for treatments targeting women's cancer. In triple-negative breast cancer, the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer where historically treatment options have been limited, I am pleased to announce several advancements, which will improve options for patients. The first is FDA approval for a new indication in high-risk early-stage triple-negative breast cancer based on results from the pivotal Phase III KEYNOTE-522 study, where KEYTRUDA was evaluated in combination with chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment and then as monotherapy adjuvant treatment post surgery. These practice-changing event-free survival results were presented just 2 weeks ago, which demonstrated a remarkable 37% reduction in the risk of progression including definitive surgery, local or distant recurrings, second primary malignancy or death from any cause compared to chemotherapy alone in patients. 
Now additionally, we announced positive clinically meaningful top line overall survival results from the Phase III KEYNOTE-355 study evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy in patients with untreated metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, whose tumors express PD-L1 with a combined proportion score greater than or equal to 10. This positions KEYTRUDA to be the first anti-PD-1 therapy in combination with chemotherapy to show statistically significant overall survival in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. We will work with the regulators to expand the existing indication to include [indiscernible] benefits and will aim to share full results soon. 
Now for early-stage breast cancer, along with our partners at AstraZeneca, we presented results at ASCO from the Phase II OlympiA trial, evaluating Lynparza for the adjuvant treatment of certain patients with germline BRCA high-risk HER2-negative early-stage breast cancer. These findings clearly demonstrated that Lynparza reduced the risk of invasive breast cancer recurrence, second cancer or death by 42%. Results will be submitted to global regulatory facilities, and the trial continues to evaluate overall survival. 
Now also at ASCO, with our partners at Seagen, we presented additional encouraging data from the HER2CLIMB study to [indiscernible] in patients with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer. It is clear that Merck is establishing an important beachhead in breast cancer with multiple agents. The progress we are making in this area of significant unmet patient need is one example of our strategy to expand into earlier lines of therapy and our strong conviction that our oncology assets have the potential to change the way early-stage cancers are treated. 
We are also making progress across women's cancer more broadly. We received an approval from the FDA for an expanded indication for the combination of KEYTRUDA and LENVIMA for the treatment of certain patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma where along with our partners at Eisai, we showed results from the confirmatory Phase III KEYNOTE-775 study earlier this year. 
And finally, we had positive results from the pivotal Phase III KEYNOTE-826 trial investigating KEYTRUDA in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy with a move without bevacizumab for the first-line treatment of patients with [indiscernible] recurrent or metastatic cervical [indiscernible] regardless of their PD-L1 status. The trial met its dual primary endpoints of overall survival and progression-free survival. Results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting, and submitted to regulatory authorities. 
Additional FDA approvals this quarter included 2 new indications for KEYTRUDA. The first is in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma based on results from the Phase III KEYNOTE-811 study. The second approval was an expanded indication for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma for patients with locally advanced disease that is not curable by surgery or radiation. This was granted under accelerated approval based on a Phase II KEYNOTE-629 study. The FDA also granted priority review based on Phase III data from KEYNOTE-581 in first-line treatment advanced renal cell carcinoma, and we expect the decision in the third quarter. 
Outside the United States, the European Commission approved a new indication for KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy in certain patients with esophageal cancer or HER2 negative gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma based on results from KEYNOTE-590. And in China, Lynparza was granted conditional approval for certain patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who progressed following prior treatment with certain new hormonal agents. This is the first PARP inhibitor to be approved for advanced prostate cancer in China.  
Now also at the ASCO Virtual meeting new data supporting the benefit of KEYTRUDA in earlier lines of therapy from the pivotal Phase III KEYNOTE-564 trial for the adjuvant treatment of certain patients with renal cell carcinoma was presented. KEYTRUDA given after surgery demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in the risk of disease recurrence or death by 32% compared to placebo. Results will be submitted to global regulatory authorities and the trial will continue to evaluate overall survival. 
We are making progress on our strategy to extend the benefit of KEYTRUDA to more patients. This includes the initiation of a Phase III trial evaluating a subcutaneous formulation of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. We believe this new formulation could be an important additional option for patients. This study will be enrolling soon with a readout expected in early 2023. 
And finally, belzutifan continues to make good progress with additional Phase II data presented at ASCO, and an expected FDA action date in September and a development program with 3 Phase III studies in renal cell carcinoma that are gaining momentum. 
Now turning to our broader pipeline. In response to the outbreak of SARS COV 2 in India. We made the decision to enable access to molnupiravir in low and middle-income countries through voluntary license agreements with several Indian generic manufacturers. While the ongoing studies in India are recruiting a different patient population, we are encouraged by the data being generated and we look forward to continuing to help with the crisis. We remain excited by the progress of molnupiravir and the data we've seen to date. Along with our partner, Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, we announced the presentation of full results from the dose-finding phase of Phase II/III studies in both outpatient and hospitalized patients at the [indiscernible] of clinical microbiology and infectious disease 2021. We look forward to the readout from the Phase III portion of the study in the October timeframe. Additionally, we posted a new Phase III study evaluating molnupiravir as a post-exposure prophylactic option and look forward to a readout in the first half of 2022. 
In HIV, we continue to progress our islatravir development program, our investigation on nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor. Phase II data presented at the International AIDS Society Meeting a few weeks ago continued to support the safety and tolerability profile of oral once monthly islatravir in the PrEP setting. We are continuing to enroll patients across diverse populations and geographies in the Phase III EMPOWER trials, and are moving forward with studies evaluating islatravir in treatment and prevention settings. 
In vaccines, I am pleased to note the FDA approval of VAXNEUVANCE, the first in a suite  of promising pneumococcal conjugate vaccine candidate for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease in the dose 18 years and older caused by 15 seretides. Along with immune response data showing that VAXNEUVANCE can maintain progress achieved to date based on noninferiority to serotypes shared with PCV13, VAXNEUVANCE also induced superior immune response to PCC 13 for shared serotypes 3 and for the 2 serotypes unique to VAXNEUVANCE, 22F and 33F. These immunogenicity data position this vaccine to offer an important new option and protection of adults from invasive pneumococcal disease. We look forward to further engagement with the ACIP, including discussing the positive results we achieved through our development program, studying a broad range of adult populations and clinical circumstances, including adults at increased risk. 
Building on our clinical evidence for VAXNEUVANCE, we also announced that 2 of our Phase III pediatric study met their primary immunogenicity and safety endpoints in supporting potential use in healthy infants who may have previously started a pneumococcal vaccination series with PCV13 and in a catch-up setting for healthy children who have either not received pneumococcal vaccine or received a full or partial regimen with lower valency pediatric PCVs. We continue to anticipate data from our Phase I/II program evaluating V116, our adult-focused vaccine, to read out later this year. 
To conclude, I remain excited about the progress in our broader pipeline and efforts stemming from Merck Research Labs that contribute to improving options and treatments for diseases that affect people globally. We continue to deliver on our strategy with speed and urgency to harness the benefits of our cancer therapies for as many patients as possible while advancing a broad pipeline of promising vaccines and therapeutic candidates. 
Now I will turn the call back to Peter."

But how are you thinking about deals that would accelerate the company's kind of investment in oncology where they obviously have a competitive strength versus more therapeutic area diversification? And can you maybe just walk through the pros and cons as you consider and think about larger transactions versus a series of smaller deals? I know you're looking at everything, but I'm just trying to get sense of all else equal, is there a bias kind of one way or the other at this point?"

As we as I said in the prepared remarks, we're very focused on business development and it's something that we recognize we need to do, we need to augment the pipeline. But I also just want to reinforce, and I think, hopefully, you heard it through what Dean just walked through. We also have a strong internal pipeline, and I don't want to lose sight of that, and we really do have a lot of confidence in what we can bring forward across the breadth of both oncology assets, as well as assets outside of oncology and vaccines. Obviously, in HIV, all the areas that Dean touched upon. But with that said, we know we need to add more and build upon that, and we are very focused there. 
Clearly, we see ourselves, and I made a comment about this in the prepared remarks with the strength in oncology, and we want to build upon that strength and actually see ourselves as a company that over time can be a broad player across oncology, really leveraging the foundational position we have with KEYTRUDA. They're going well [indiscernible] and we're already starting to do that. 
So as we [indiscernible] business development, I always will look at that because if you look right now in the space of where there's still one of the largest unmet needs despite the advances we've made with KEYTRUDA and other new agents, which are phenomenal and what they're delivering for patients, the truth is the majority of patients still don't have a solution yet for the cancers they face. So this is still an area of unmet need. There's a ton of science being done in this area, focused in this area. And as I said, we have the strength to leverage the position of KEYTRUDA and really the data we have within our oncology space to really be a differentiated and, I think, unique observer of the space to be able to select the best opportunities. So that will be a focus. 
But I also recognize we have to do more than that. We need to be balanced. And we are looking to areas outside of oncology as well. And I would like to see us do things in both. So build the strong foundation, continue to lead in oncology, leverage the data we have there but look to where can we balance that and augment the portfolio in outside areas. 
On the second part of the question, on the pros and cons between large and small deals, in a perfect world, we would -- where we think we bring the greatest value is if you get assets that are a little bit earlier in development, where we can bring the prowess we have from as clinical side to bring those through and really add value, those are the deals we've been doing historically. But we are not foreclosed to doing larger deals. And as we've always said, and I continue to believe, it's more about finding the right science and first with science as the key component. Informed by the portfolio impact where we believe we add value, and if we can find those deals, we will move on them whether they are large or small. But clearly, one of the areas we continue to believe we do not need to go is to the very large synergy-driven deals. I think we have enough firepower in our own pipeline and through what we can add across the portfolio with deals focused on the science. We don't need to go to those large type of deals at this time."

The reason I emphasize this is your observations and relationship to viral load and such are important observations. But I would just call out that at least we've done the U.S. regulatory framework. The viral load is not the critical issue for the regulatory framework. It is whether or not we can expect clinical events. And so the need to focus on high-risk patients is the critical issue that we want to focus on. 
In relationship to that trial, it has a primary completion date that's listed as October. And we are very enthusiastic of how this trial is progressing, and we hope to see data over the coming months for the trial. I would emphasize that this is a blinded global study, and it is focused on high risk and many of -- the pandemic keeps shifting. And so -- It's not just within the U.S. and the EU, but important countries like South Africa, Brazil, Colombia. Those countries are extremely important for our ability to show not just the reduction of viral load but a big impact on clinical effect. That's what we need to look for in this trial."

And I will just focus not so much in platforms. There's a lot of movement in data platforms that I think are critically important, but also in what I would call technology platforms that are important for making molecules, as you said, such as antibodies. 
Clearly, there's a lot of movement in protein engineering. Clearly, there's movement in protein degradation. Clearly, there's movement in antibody drug conjugates. And we are interested in all of them. I think one of the critical questions that often people think about, especially in relationship to us as a vaccine company is in relationship to mRNA. And really the success of monovalent SARS COV2 vaccine is something that demonstrated the speed which we've always recognized but also scalability. And we were one of the first to invest in mRNA for vaccines, for ID and for oncology. 
And so we're taking some of those lessons and we're prioritizing programs where we believe that mRNA will be important. I do want to emphasize that those programs -- that said, programs such as pneumococcal vaccine, I don't think is a place where mRNA vaccines is a place to take it. And complex multivalent vaccines with profound and proven clinical benefits such as GARDASIL, I'm not so sure that that's where I would drive an mRNA vaccine. 
Outside of infectious disease, we continue to have a very productive partnership with Moderna on oncology. We're a little bit more careful with outside the use of vaccine. We watch with interest the progression of that technology."

Now we've demonstrated that the immune response data really shows that we have noninferiority to serotype share with PCV13 and that we have superior for 3 that are quite important from a an FDA logic standpoint.

And right now, we're focused on reality understand our data and the benefits of our offerings across both pneumovac 23 and [indiscernible].

One, it's important to say we do believe, over time, as I said, we need to have a balanced -- more balanced portfolio and we'd like to bring that diversification. I would make one clarification to your point. I see a difference in diversification away from KEYTRUDA versus diversification away from oncology. Obviously, oncology [indiscernible]. And as I said it earlier, huge unmet need still rests there. So that's an area where we can work state have with KEYTRUDA, the foundational position we have, the data we have, the insights we get from basically being tested either combined with or against pretty much every agent out there. So I see an expansion and diversification across broader oncology as an important role for us future into the future. And then I do believe we also should look for other therapeutic areas, we have a strong position in vaccines. We're looking there. We've mentioned the metabolic is [indiscernible]. And in fact, Dean can make a comment on neuroscience. We actually have several ongoing early-stage programs in the neuroscience space. So we're excited about that. 
To your question on what do we prioritize, first and foremost, I prioritize long-term sustainable growth. And that in our business is about innovation and investment in science.

I would highlight that if we're looking at rare diseases, I do like rare diseases because it's a very quick way to understand proof of concept that can move quickly -- and then once you're at that situation, the ability to expand from that sort of beachhead is very important. And the reason I want to emphasize that deals like futavan, although in oncology is really a rare disease to play with the possibilities of expanding into broader cancers. 
So whether we see that in cancer or in noncancer assets and pathways and possibilities, that's something that we're very interestedin to replicate. In relationship to neurosciences, you're right, there has been met recently at the FDA and the important biomarkers, but I do want to sort of level set back that the imports biomarkers must also be balanced the importance of being able to show changes in important clinical events for patients. It has changed, and we're very anxious to understand how we can best utilize that movement of biomarkers and especially, for example, our [indiscernible] program, which were very enthused [indiscernible] how that should navigate and how we should think about, for example, biomarkers [indiscernible]  given that clinical strategy is of intense interest to us giving the shifting landscape. 
We have other programs, MKD189, MK192 [indiscernible] for treatment resistant depression.

One, as we look forward, all of the expectations we have for our growth in the company that we think in the past doesn't assume we faced meaningful price pressure. So we continue to believe our growth will be driven more by volume than price. And I think that's important as you think about the long-term position of the company. As we look out over the next 5 plus years, we'll largely derisk to our foreign revenue goals and see that regardless of putting that aside, as you think about it from a policy perspective, we are very willing to engage with U.S. government in discussions about how best to achieve a goal of reducing the on-profit costs for patients.

I'm deeply honored to speak to you today in my new role as CEO. Merck is a special company, and I'm fortunate to be surrounded by talented and dedicated colleagues who are intently focused on bringing important life enhancing and life-saving medicines and vaccines to people and animals around the world. 
This long-standing and unwavering commitment to our mission is real, is tangible, and is what drives us to perform every day. The prioritization of investment in research and development under Ken's leadership and the focus of resources behind key growth drivers has put us in a position of strength that I intend to build upon. As I consider Merck's future, I continue to believe investment in research and development with patients at the center of everything we do is core to who Merck is and is our best path to sustainable ongoing success and value creation.  
However, how we go about both delivering the best external and internal scientific opportunities, as well as how we bring those innovations to patients, must evolve. As I transition to the role of CEO, I solicited candid feedback from colleagues and external stakeholders. What I heard reaffirms my convictions. There's a broad agreement that investment in R&D should remain our highest strategic priority. 
Employees are confident that we're on the right path. We have rebuilt and reinvigorated our discovery research engine and have a growing and robust pipeline. We're successfully executing on clinical development, and we're delivering strong commercial growth across both our Human and Animal Health businesses now, and will continue to do so well into the future.  
While we are on the right path, we need to work with more speed, urgency and agility, more closely matching the pace of change in the broader environment. We need to accelerate the delivery of our innovations to the patients who need them, and to be leaner, nimbler and more digitally enabled. 
We need to leverage the scale and reach we have as a global biopharmaceutical leader, while also embracing a commitment to evolve to address new challenges. And we need to move with focus and intentionality, which is a priority for both me and my management team.  
I know that it's not about promising, it's about performing. Actions speak louder than words. With that understanding, I pledge to do all I can to ensure that Merck remains a global biopharmaceutical leader long into the future, delivering value to current and future patients and growth and value for our shareholders.  
Now turning to the quarter, we had very good performance with strong growth. Our results demonstrate that the impact of the pandemic on our business is lessening. Patient access to health care providers has improved, and we expect continued strong growth in the remainder of the year. We're also making meaningful clinical advancements which Dean will speak to you in just a few moments. Our seamless execution during a period in which we successfully completed a complex spin-off without business interruption underwent leadership transitions and delivered accelerated growth only increases my confidence in what our organization can achieve in the future.  
Organon is now an independent company, an important milestone in our company's history. And this transaction is a meaningful catalyst to Merck becoming a more focused, more efficient and faster growing company.  
Let me spend a moment speaking about KEYTRUDA, which again experienced very strong growth this quarter. I'm confident that KEYTRUDA will continue to be a foundational cancer therapy and achieved strong growth for years to come. We are a leader in immuno-oncology and are determined to leverage this and to sustained success. We are rapidly advancing a diverse set of oncology assets, many of which we highlighted in our recent ASCO investor presentation. 
Across our oncology portfolio, we expect over 90 potential new indications by 2028, more than tripling our current base. We have a wide array of clinical partnerships, providing valuable insights into the biology of disease and into important potential external innovation. With our expanding oncology portfolio outside of KEYTRUDA, we will extend our leadership in cancer long into the future. I also strongly believe we will successfully navigate the eventual KEYTRUDA loss of exclusivity given the breadth of opportunity in areas both within as well as outside of oncology. Internally, our leaders are intensely focused on this period and efforts are underway.  
Externally, I understand the importance of providing investors with increased transparency into the breadth of opportunities we see in our pipeline that will help us do this. As we've done recently in highlighting islatravir, our broader HIV portfolio and our next-generation oncology assets, we are planning deep-dive investor events with our scientific and commercial leaders focused on other areas of our pipeline that we believe are underappreciated yet hold great promise such as our suite of vaccine candidates, our cardiometabolic assets, as well as others.  
Business development plays an important role, and we are putting an increased emphasis on ensuring we are appropriately aggressive in accessing the best external science. Executing value-enhancing BD is a top priority, and we intend to add to our pipeline through acquisitions, partnerships, licensing deals and collaborations. We will be unbounded by therapeutic area, though we are mindful on the need to have a balanced portfolio over time.  
We'll seek new products, modalities and platforms that allow us to establish beachheads in important areas. Our recent acquisition of Pandion and its potentially foundational immunology asset is a good example of this. We will look at both early and late-stage opportunities and we have the financial flexibility to consider deals of all sizes, particularly given the $9 billion distribution from the Organon spin-off. 
And given our strong operational momentum, we are most interested in transactions that are easily integrated and less disruptive, where value is principally derived by the introduction of innovative new products that address patient needs instead of the cost synergies.  
Before I turn the call over to Frank to discuss second quarter performance on our Human Health business, I want you to know that I appreciate and applaud the increasing societal and investor demand and corporation stack responsibly. In fact, I believe our strong performance across environmental, social and governance issues has and will continue to create sustainable value for all of our stakeholders. Merck has a long track record and history of strong corporate citizenship, and I'm committed to remaining a leader in this area.  
With that, let me turn the call over to Frank."
288502,709040574,2354454,"Merck & Co., Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Merck & Co., Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rob. Good morning. As Rob highlighted, our Human Health business continues to regain momentum, and we achieved 18% growth in the quarter, excluding the impact of exchange.

As Rob highlighted, our Human Health business continues to regain momentum, and we achieved 18% growth in the quarter, excluding the impact of exchange. Across our business, we've been engaging and investing with urgency to encourage more normal levels of physician office visits, oncology screenings and vaccination rates, including catch-up from misdoses. The agility demonstrated by our teams around the world to quickly reallocate resources to drive these patient activation programs has benefited our largely physician-administered portfolio.  
In the United States, we are encouraged that wellness visits and surgical procedures have returned to more normal levels. And in oncology, we're seeing screening rates continue to improve. We're confident that these favorable trends and the strong underlying demand for our products will drive accelerated underlying business momentum in the second half of the year.  
Now I'll turn to the second quarter performance of our key brands. My comments will be on an ex exchange basis. In oncology, KEYTRUDA sales grew 20% to $4.2 billion, reflecting continued strong global demand. In the United States, KEYTRUDA continues to demonstrate strong growth, and over the course of the pandemic has increased its market share of new patients within the immuno-oncology class. 
KEYTRUDA also maintains its leadership position in lung cancer, capturing 8 out of 10 eligible new patients. We continue to see strong growth across all key  tumors, including renal cell carcinoma, bladder, adjuvant melanoma and MSI high indication. Additionally we are off to a very strong start with our launch of KEYNOTE-355 in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, and we look forward to adding overall survival to the label. We're also excited by the recent approval and upcoming launch of KEYNOTE-522 in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant setting.  
Outside the United States, growth continues to be driven by lung cancer indications, and the ongoing launches in head and neck cancer and renal cell carcinoma. LYNPARZA grew 34% in the quarter and remains the leading PARP inhibitor. Growth continues to be driven by approvals of recent indications, and we look forward to a potential future launch in adjuvant breast cancer based on the OlympiA data presented at ASCO this year. 
LENVIMA grew 15% in the quarter, reflecting increased demand in hepatocellular carcinoma following the NRDL listing in China. We are also excited to launch the recently approved combination of LENVIMA plus KEYTRUDA in endometrial carcinoma. And in the near future to potentially launch in renal cell carcinoma based on KEYNOTE-581.  
Our vaccines portfolio recovered sharply due to the return to more normal level of wellness visits. GARDASIL had a very strong quarter, growing 78%. In the United States, higher sales were driven by a recovery from the negative impact of last year's lockdowns. Outside the United States, growth was driven by increased demand in China. Sales also benefited from increased supply due to improved manufacturing, which I'll provide additional details on in a moment.  
Our hospital business continued its recovery, BRIDION sales grew 67% year-over-year, driven by increased surgeries as patient access to hospitals improved from last year.  
Turning to our outlook, the recovery we saw in the quarter gives us confidence that we will have a very strong second half resulting from both market recovery and strong commercial execution. Over the quarter, Merck quickly pivoted its focus and resources to patient activation campaigns to ensure that patients are putting their health first and recognize the importance of returning to physicians' offices for screenings, early detection and routine visits. 
Our efforts in partnership with public health constituent groups paired with the continued rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations, has resulted in meaningful improvements in patients accessing health care providers.  
In adolescents, we've seen more than 1/3 of teens in the United States vaccinated against COVID-19 with at least 1 dose. We assume that these rapidly growing vaccination rates and continued commercial execution will help to drive a near-normal back-to-school season.
Merck has also shown increased agility and efficiency across our organization, and importantly, we've made improvements that will enable meaningful future growth. Of note, we expect GARDASIL to significantly benefit from increases in productivity across our supply chain, which will allow us to fulfill demand that we were previously unable to supply. 
Furthermore, as global demand for GARDASIL continues to outpace supply, our teams have been working to ensure we have the right regulatory approvals and lead time to appropriately allocate doses to areas of increased demand, particularly as the pandemic continues to force lockdowns in many geographies. These improvements alone will drive very strong sequential and year-over-year growth for GARDASIL in the back half of the year, especially in ex U.S. markets, such as China.  
In oncology, we're encouraged by the recovery we've seen to date and our overall performance throughout the pandemic. We remain confident in the underlying demand for our broad and innovative portfolio, including KEYTRUDA, LYNPARZA, LENVIMA and if approved, belzutifan and expect to drive strong and sustained growth across key tumor types and stages of disease. Overall, the improvements in patient and access we are seeing in major markets gives us increased confidence as we look to the second half of the year.  
Before I conclude, I would like to mention the strong execution of our commercial colleagues around the world that enabled our company to drive strong growth in the first half of the year, all the while, we're working to successfully complete the spin-off of Organon. We are confident that the spin-off results in meaningful benefits to the commercial organization, including the ability to drive even stronger growth through more focused commercial execution. 
To close, our business has regain momentum and we are well positioned to achieve strong growth in the third and fourth quarters. Our portfolio is rebounded by strength and demonstrated not only as resiliency, but it's value to patients globally. The strong recovery we saw in the quarter underscores our confidence in the underlying demand for our innovative medicines and vaccines, and we look forward to a return to robust long-term demand-driven growth.  
With that, I'll turn the call over to Caroline."

Our business delivered meaningful growth in the quarter driven by strong underlying demand for products across our growth pillars and the continued recovery of the business as patient access improves.

Our business delivered meaningful growth in the quarter driven by strong underlying demand for products across our growth pillars and the continued recovery of the business as patient access improves. As we exit the quarter we are confident that our position of financial and operational strength will enable us to drive long-term revenue growth and meaningful margin expansion, creating value for our shareholders by delivering on our mission to improve the health and wellness of people and animals worldwide. 
Now turning to our second quarter results, which reflects Merck on a continuing operations basis. Total company revenue were $11.4 billion, an increase of 22% or 19%, excluding the positive impact of foreign exchange. Further adjusting for the estimated impact of the pandemic, total revenues grew 8% year-over-year, evidence of the underlying strength of our business.  
The remainder of my comments will be on an ex exchange basis. As Frank highlighted, our Human Health business showed improving momentum, growing 18% or 6% when adjusted for the estimated impact of the pandemic. Animal Health had an outstanding quarter, increasing 27% driven by very strong global demand across companion animal and livestock, which increased 38% and 20%, respectively. Animal Health sales grew 19% when adjusted for the estimated pandemic impact. In companion animal growth was driven by higher global demands for vaccines as well as parasiticides including the BRAVECTO line of product. Performance in livestock reflects increased global demand across ruminants, swine and poultry products along with higher demand for our animal health intelligence product.  
I'll now walk you through the remainder of our P&L, and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 76.5% in the quarter, a decrease of 0.6% and reflecting the unfavorable effects of foreign exchange, pricing pressure and higher manufacturing costs, partially offset by favorable product mix. Operating expenses increased 13% year-over-year to $4.8 billion, driven largely by higher clinical development costs, increased investment in our early-stage pipeline and higher promotion costs in support of returned care activity for our key growth drivers.  
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 14.6% an increase of 1.3% from a year ago, driven by discrete items last year. Taken together, we earned $1.31 per share, an increase of 27%.  
Before turning to our 2021 guidance, I want to remind you briefly of the benefits we expect to achieve as a result of the spin-off of Organon. With the spin completed, Merck is now a more focused company and better positioned to unlock the full potential of our growth pillars and drive accelerated profitable growth. We are very excited about our future. And as we look out to 2024, we continue to believe that our revenue potential is underappreciated.  
Now for 2021, health systems and patients have largely adapted to the impacts of the pandemic, and we assume this trend will continue. We are narrowing and raising our expected revenue range to $46.4 billion to $47.4 billion, representing growth of 12% to 14%, including a positive impact from foreign exchange of less than 2% using mid-July rates. The underlying demand for our growth pillars and our strong commercial execution provides us with confidence that we will continue to see strong momentum throughout the remainder of the year. As such, we expect total revenues to be sequentially higher in each consecutive quarter.  
Our gross margin is expected to be between 76% and 77%. We expect operating expenses to grow at a high single-digit rate, driven by increased investment in promotion and patient activation programs to accelerate our near-term business momentum. And by increased R&D investment to advance our exciting pipeline to support sustainable long-term revenue growth. As a reminder, our operating margin from continuing operations will be lower than what they were as a combined company, but our guidance range implies significant operating leverage in 2021. In addition, we continue to expect operating margins of greater than 42% in 2024, driven by our accelerated revenue growth and disciplined investment in our business.  
In other income and expense, we expect expense of approximately $300 million. We expect our full year tax rate to be between 14.5% and 15.5%. We assumed 2.53 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we expect non-GAAP EPS to be -- excuse me, to be between $5.47 and $5.57, reflecting growth of 21% to 23%.  This range includes a positive impact from foreign exchange of approximately 2% using mid-July rates. 
As you consider your models and the allocation of revenues to various products, there are 2 areas to focus on: GARDASIL and Animal Health. Frank described the strong acceleration in growth expected in GARDASIL, and we also expect continued momentum in our Animal Health business. Our updated guidance also reflects the benefits of the approval of KEYNOTE-522, and as a reminder, does not include revenue from the potential launch of molnupiravir. 
Turning to capital allocation. We received $9 billion cash distribution from Organon, which we intend to deploy in value-enhancing strategic business development opportunities that align with the parameters Rob outlined. In the absence of meaningful business development, we will return cash to shareholders through share repurchases. We remain committed to investing in support of our key brands and progressing our innovative pipeline. And we will look to increase our dividend payout ratio over time. 
To conclude, as a leaner, more focused and agile company,  Merck is prepared to capitalize on the meaningful opportunities that lie ahead and is better equipped to succeed in an ever-changing landscape. Merck remains in a position of financial and operational strength, which we will leverage to drive long-term sustainable growth and value creation for our patients and shareholders. 
With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Dean."
288502,709040574,2354454,"Merck & Co., Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Merck & Co., Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Caroline. I'm delighted to be here today to provide an overview of progress made over the past quarter. I will cover key regulatory milestones and clinical updates, initially in oncology and then across the broader pipeline. As Rob highlighte",1614,"Thank you, Caroline. I'm delighted to be here today to provide an overview of progress made over the past quarter. I will cover key regulatory milestones and clinical updates, initially in oncology and then across the broader pipeline. 
As Rob highlighted, we continue to show strong momentum in our oncology pipeline which positions us well. And it's worth reiterating our goal: to potentially deliver 90-plus approvals and new indications by 2028. A recent report from the American Cancer Society noted that there's been a rapid decrease in lung cancer and melanoma deaths from 2014 to 2018. One factor attributed to this decline is advancements in research including targeted therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors. 
The report also notes there is an urgent need to accelerate a decline in death rates for breast, prostate and other cancers where Merck is just beginning to make an impact. We are hopeful that our contributions and the advances being made industry-wide, will continue to fuel this decline. 
Notably, during the last quarter, we achieved several milestones for treatments targeting women's cancer. In triple-negative breast cancer, the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer where historically treatment options have been limited, I am pleased to announce several advancements, which will improve options for patients. The first is FDA approval for a new indication in high-risk early-stage triple-negative breast cancer based on results from the pivotal Phase III KEYNOTE-522 study, where KEYTRUDA was evaluated in combination with chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment and then as monotherapy adjuvant treatment post surgery. 
These practice-changing event-free survival results were presented just 2 weeks ago, which demonstrated a remarkable 37% reduction in the risk of progression including definitive surgery, local or distant recurrings, second primary malignancy or death from any cause compared to chemotherapy alone in patients. 
Now additionally, we announced positive clinically meaningful top line overall survival results from the Phase III KEYNOTE-355 study evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy in patients with untreated metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, whose tumors express PD-L1 with a combined proportion score greater than -- or equal to 10. This positions KEYTRUDA to be the first anti-PD-1 therapy in combination with chemotherapy to show statistically significant overall survival in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. We will work with the regulators to expand the existing indication to include survival benefits and will aim to share full results soon. 
Now also for early-stage breast cancer, along with our partners at AstraZeneca, we presented results at ASCO from the Phase II OlympiA trial, evaluating Lynparza for the adjuvant treatment of certain patients with germline BRCA high-risk HER2-negative early-stage breast cancer. These findings clearly demonstrated that Lynparza reduced the risk of invasive breast cancer recurrence, second cancer or death by 42%. Results will be submitted to global regulatory authorities, and the trial continues to evaluate overall survival. 
Now also at ASCO, with our partners at Seagen, we presented additional encouraging data from the HER2CLIMB study TUKYSA in patients with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer. It is clear that Merck is establishing an important beachhead in breast cancer with multiple agents. The progress we are making in this area of significant unmet patient need is one example of our strategy to expand into earlier lines of therapy and our strong conviction that our oncology assets have the potential to change the way early-stage cancers are treated. 
We are also making progress across women's cancer more broadly. We received an approval from the FDA for an expanded indication for the combination of KEYTRUDA and LENVIMA for the treatment of certain patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma where along with our partners at Eisai, we showed results from the confirmatory Phase III KEYNOTE-775 study earlier this year. 
And finally, we had positive results from the pivotal Phase III KEYNOTE-826 trial investigating KEYTRUDA in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy with and without bevacizumab for the first-line treatment of patients with persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer regardless of their PD-L1 status. The trial met its dual primary endpoints of overall survival and progression-free survival. Results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting, and submitted to regulatory authorities. 
Additional FDA approvals this quarter included 2 new indications for KEYTRUDA. The first is in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma based on results from the Phase III KEYNOTE-811 study. 
The second approval was an expanded indication for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma for patients with locally advanced disease that is not curable by surgery or radiation. This was granted under accelerated approval based on a Phase II KEYNOTE-629 study. The FDA also granted priority review based on Phase III data from KEYNOTE-581 in first-line treatment advanced renal cell carcinoma, and we expect the decision in the third quarter. 
Now outside the United States, the European Commission approved a new indication for KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy in certain patients with esophageal cancer or HER2 negative gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma based on results from KEYNOTE-590. And in China, Lynparza was granted conditional approval for certain patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who progressed following prior treatment with certain new hormonal agents. This is the first PARP inhibitor to be approved for advanced prostate cancer in China.  
Now also at the ASCO virtual meeting new data supporting the benefit of KEYTRUDA in earlier lines of therapy from the pivotal Phase III KEYNOTE-564 trial for the adjuvant treatment of certain patients with renal cell carcinoma was presented. KEYTRUDA given after surgery demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in the risk of disease recurrence or death by 32% compared to placebo. Results will be submitted to global regulatory authorities and the trial will continue to evaluate overall survival. 
We are making progress on our strategy to extend the benefit of KEYTRUDA to more patients. This includes the initiation of a Phase III trial evaluating a subcutaneous formulation of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. We believe this new formulation could be an important additional option for patients. This study will be enrolling soon with a readout expected in early 2023. 
And finally, belzutifan continues to make good progress with additional Phase II data presented at ASCO, and an expected FDA action date in September and a development program with 3 Phase III studies in renal cell carcinoma that are gaining momentum. 
Now turning to our broader pipeline. In response to the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in India. We made the decision to enable access to molnupiravir in low and middle-income countries through voluntary license agreements with several Indian generic manufacturers. While the ongoing studies in India are recruiting a different patient population, we are encouraged by the data being generated and we look forward to continuing to help with the crisis. 
We remain excited by the progress of molnupiravir and the data we've seen to date. Along with our partner, Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, we announced the presentation of full results from the dose-finding phase of Phase II/III studies in both outpatient and hospitalized patients at the European congress of clinical microbiology and infectious disease 2021. We look forward to the readout from the Phase III portion of the study in the October timeframe. 
Additionally, we posted a new Phase III study evaluating molnupiravir as a post-exposure prophylactic option and look forward to a readout in the first half of 2022.  In HIV, we continue to progress our islatravir development program, our investigation on nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor. Phase II data presented at the International AIDS Society Meeting a few weeks ago continued to support the safety and tolerability profile of oral once-monthly islatravir in the PrEP setting. 
We are continuing to enroll patients across diverse populations and geographies in the Phase III EMPOWER trials, and are moving forward with studies evaluating islatravir in treatment and prevention settings. 
In vaccines, I am pleased to note the FDA approval of VAXNEUVANCE, the first in a suite of promising pneumococcal conjugate vaccine candidate for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease in the dose 18 years and older caused by 15 serotypes. Along with immune response data showing that VAXNEUVANCE can maintain progress achieved to date based on noninferiority to serotypes shared with PCV13, VAXNEUVANCE also induced superior immune response to PCC 13 for shared serotypes 3 and for the 2 serotypes unique to VAXNEUVANCE, 22F and 33F. These immunogenicity data position this vaccine to offer an important new option and protection of adults from invasive pneumococcal disease. 
We look forward to further engagement with the ACIP, including discussing the positive results we achieved through our robust development program, studying a broad range of adult populations and clinical circumstances, including adults at increased risk. 
Building on our clinical evidence for VAXNEUVANCE, we also announced that 2 of our Phase III pediatric study met their primary immunogenicity and safety endpoints in supporting potential use in healthy infants who may have previously started a pneumococcal vaccination series with PCV13 and in a catch-up setting for healthy children who have either not received pneumococcal vaccine or received a full or partial regimen with lower valency pediatric PCVs. We continue to anticipate data from our Phase I/II program evaluating V116, our adult-focused vaccine, to read out later this year. 
To conclude, I remain excited about the progress in our broader pipeline and efforts stemming from Merck Research Labs that contribute to improving options and treatments for diseases that affect people globally. We continue to deliver on our strategy with speed and urgency to harness the benefits of our cancer therapies for as many patients as possible while advancing a broad pipeline of promising vaccines and therapeutic candidates. 
Now I will turn the call back to Peter."

Can you just elaborate a little bit more on the business development environment, I guess now that you're post the Organon on transaction, I mean you're highlighting R&D as a priority, kind of bringing more innovation to the company as a priority. 
But how are you thinking about deals that would accelerate the company's kind of investment in oncology where they obviously have a competitive strength versus more therapeutic area diversification? 
And can you maybe just walk through the pros and cons as you consider and think about larger transactions versus a series of smaller deals? I know you're looking at everything, but I'm just trying to get sense of all else equal, is there a bias kind of one way or the other at this point?"

As we as I said in the prepared remarks, we're very focused on business development and it's something that we recognize we need to do, we need to augment the pipeline. But I also just want to reinforce, and I think",615,"Sure. I appreciate the question, Chris. As we as I said in the prepared remarks, we're very focused on business development and it's something that we recognize we need to do, we need to augment the pipeline. But I also just want to reinforce, and I think, hopefully, you heard it through what Dean just walked through. We also have a strong internal pipeline, and I don't want to lose sight of that, and we really do have a lot of confidence in what we can bring forward across the breadth of both oncology assets, as well as assets outside of oncology and vaccines. Obviously, in HIV, all the areas that Dean touched upon. But with that said, we know we need to add more and build upon that, and we are very focused there. 
Clearly, we see ourselves, and I made a comment about this in the prepared remarks with the strength in oncology, and we want to build upon that strength and actually see ourselves as a company that over time can be a broad player across oncology, really leveraging the foundational position we have with KEYTRUDA. They're going well beyond KEYTRUDA and we're already starting to do that. 
So as we think about business development, I always will look at that because if you look right now in the space of where there's still one of the largest unmet needs despite the advances we've made with KEYTRUDA and other new agents, which are phenomenal and what they're delivering for patients, the truth is the majority of patients still don't have a solution yet for the cancers they face. 
So this is still an area of unmet need. There's a ton of science being done in this area, focused just in this area. And as I said, we have the strength to leverage the position of KEYTRUDA and really the data we have within our oncology space to really be a differentiated and, I think, unique observer of the space to be able to select the best opportunities. So that will be our focus. 
But I also recognize we have to do more than that. We need to be balanced and we are looking to areas outside of oncology as well. And I would like to see us do things in both. So build the strong foundation, continue to lead in oncology, leverage the data we have there but look to where can we balance that and augment the portfolio in outside areas. 
On the second part of the question, on the pros and cons between large and small deals, in a perfect world, we would -- where we think we bring the greatest value is if you get assets that are a little bit earlier in development, where we can bring the prowess we have from as clinical side to bring those through and really add value, those are the deals we've been doing historically. 
But we are not foreclosed to doing larger deals. And as we've always said, and I continue to believe, it's more about finding the right science and driven first with science as the key component. Informed by the portfolio impact where we believe we add value, and if we can find those deals, we will move on them whether they are large or small. But clearly, one of the areas we continue to believe we do not need to go is to the very large synergy-driven deals. I think we have enough firepower in our own pipeline and through it what we can add across the portfolio with deals focused on the science. We don't need to go to those large type of deals at this time."

And what's the feedback on the clinical benefit observed with that in the mobile trial? And I ask because it looks like even though you are limiting your primary analysis to patients enrolled in less than 5 days, I still think -- there's a fair amount of seropositive embedded within the way you're looking at the data. And I almost wonder if seronegative is probably that population where you probably see the most cleanest signal. I'd be very curious."

But I would just call out that at least we've done the U.S. regulatory framework. The viral load is not the critical issue for the regulatory framework. It is whether or not we can affect clinical events. And so the need to focus on high-risk patients is the critical issue that we want to focus on. 
In relationship to that trial, it has a primary completion date that's listed as October. And we are very enthusiastic of how this trial is progressing, and we hope to see data over the coming months for the trial. I would emphasize that this is a blinded global study, and it is focused on high risk and many of -- the pandemic keeps shifting. And so -- It's not just within the U.S. and the EU, but important countries like South Africa, Brazil, Colombia. Those countries are extremely important for our ability to show not just the reduction of viral load but a big impact on clinical effect. That's what we need to look for in this trial."

That said, we are also expecting to drive margin expansion. And that margin expansion would come from a few different factors. It will come through from the revenue growth, it will also come from a change in our product mix, and it will also come through efficiencies across our business and our commitment to deliver $1.5 billion dollars of operating efficiencies over the 3-year period. 
Finally, we do expect an increase in margin in 2024 as a result of the step down of royalties specific to KEYTRUDA and GARDASIL. So as I think about margin expansion, our guidance for this year at the midpoint of the range assumes a 2 percentage point increase in margin. And I expect that margin expansion to continue to grow as you look out to the coming year."

And I will just focus not so much in platforms. There's a lot of movement in data platforms that I think are critically important, but also in what I would call technology platforms that are important for making molecules, as you said, such as antibodies. 
Clearly, there's a lot of movement in protein engineering. Clearly, there's movement in protein degradation. Clearly, there's movement in antibody drug conjugates. And we are interested in all of them. I think one of the critical questions that often people think about, especially in relationship to us as a vaccine company is in relationship to mRNA. And really the success of monovalent SARS COV2 vaccine is something that demonstrated the speed which we've always recognized but also scalability. And we were one of the first to invest in mRNA for vaccines, for ID and for oncology. 
And so we're taking some of those lessons and we're prioritizing programs where we believe that mRNA will be important. I do want to emphasize that those programs -- that said, programs such as pneumococcal vaccine, I don't think is a place where mRNA vaccines is a place to take it. 
And complex multivalent vaccines with profound and proven clinical benefits such as GARDASIL, I'm not so sure that that's where I would drive an mRNA vaccine.  Outside of infectious disease, we continue to have a very productive partnership with Moderna on oncology. We're a little bit more careful with outside of the use of vaccine. We watch with interest the progression of that technology."

At this time, there may be a shift and some preference towards some of the newer pneumococcal vaccines that they go with an age-based recommendation. 
There are number of populations that they're looking at in their recommendations. And right now, we're focused on really making sure they understand our data and the benefits of our offerings across our both PNEUMOVAX 23 and VAXNEUVANCE. So if there is some risk to PNEUMOVAX, as I mentioned, we'll have to see how that plays out. But I would also highlight that this is for us, especially with VAXNEUVANCE as Dean talked about, sort of the beginning. We think we have a very competitive offering in adults.

One, it's important to say we do believe, over time, as I said, we need to have a balanced -- more balanced portfolio and we'd like to bring that diversification. 
I would make one clarification to your point. I see a difference in diversification away from KEYTRUDA versus diversification away from oncology. Obviously, oncology is a broad field and as I said it earlier, huge unmet need still rests there. 
So that's an area where we can leverage the strength we have with KEYTRUDA, the foundational position we have, the data we have, the insights we get from basically being tested either combined with or against pretty much every agent out there. And so I see an expansion and diversification across broader oncology as an important goal for its future into the future. 
And then I do believe we also should look for other therapeutic areas, we have a strong position in vaccines. We're looking there. We've mentioned the cardiometabolic is an area and in fact, Dean can make a comment on neuroscience. But we actually have several ongoing early-stage programs in the neuroscience space. So we're excited about that. 
To your question on what do we prioritize, first and foremost, I prioritize long-term sustainable growth. And that in our business is about innovation and investment in science.

I would highlight that if we're looking at rare diseases, I do like rare diseases because it's a very quick way to understand proof of concept that can move quickly and then once you're at that situation, the ability to expand from that sort of beachhead is very important. 
And the reason I want to emphasize that is deals like belzutifan, although in oncology is really a rare disease play with the possibilities of expanding into broader cancers. So whether we see that in cancer or in noncancer assets and pathways and possibilities, that's something that we're very interested to replicate. In relationship to neurosciences, you're right, there has been movement recently at the FDA and the important biomarkers, but I do want to sort of level set back that the importance of biomarkers must also be balanced by the importance of being able to show changes in important clinical events for patients. 
It has changed, and we're very anxious to understand how we can best utilize that movement for biomarkers and especially, for example, our phospho-Tau program, which were very enthusiastic of advancing how that should navigate and how we should think about, for example, biomarkers such as Tau biomarkers in that clinical strategy is of intense interest to us giving the shifting landscape. 
We have other neuroscience programs, MK-8189 is in Phase II for schizophrenia. We have MK-1942 that we're advancing for treatment resistant depression. So the regulatory landscape changing in neuroscience is important. It is something that we take into account and it is affecting how we navigate the field and accelerate the program that we have, and it also changes how we look at business development as well."

Clearly, we continue to expect to see ongoing pressure on pricing. And I think the dialogue that you're pointing to the tapping right now with Congress, and then also with the Biden administration only reinforces that, that threat continues to be there. 
But I think as we focus on it a couple of points. One, as we look forward, all of the expectations we have for our growth in the company that we've communicated in the past does assume we face meaningful price pressure. So we continue to believe our growth will be driven by -- more by volume than price. And I think that's important as you think about the long-term risk position of the company. As we look out over the next 5 plus years, we're largely derisk to our revenue goals and I think can achieve it regardless of price. 
Putting that aside, as you think about it from a policy perspective, we are very willing to engage with U.S. government in discussions about how best to achieve a goal of reducing the out-of-pocket costs for patients. That is our foremost goal. We actually recognize that need and are willing and want to work with them around that goal. Understanding we want to protect innovation because we also want to be able to ensure we can bring the innovations for the next generation of patients that need them.
I think the whole situation with COVID has shown why you want a robust and innovative industry because at the moment you need it, it's important that it's here in our country and we can invest and drive it. So that's our focus. But again, it's really about where is it that we can see reductions in out-of-pocket cost, areas where they look either legislatively or otherwise that don't shift any kind savings to the patients at -- in their pocket book we're opposed to."

So clearly, we see opportunities there. 
I'd also like to highlight that we did see very strong growth. Again, within oncology, LENVIMA, Lynparza, KEYTRUDA grew very strong this quarter. So a number of our growth drivers. And in addition, to that, we also are still seeing strong growth for JANUVIA/JANUMET, diabetes in China as well. So we anticipate that we'll continue to see growth.

ILT4 is a program that we're watching very carefully in our own pipeline. It is a program that was initiated by us looking at patient data from clinical trials with pembrolizumab and looking at those patients who are responsive, but more importantly, those patients who are not responsive and understanding what are possible mechanisms. 
The other point that I would just emphasize is ILT4 in some sense is a checkpoint inhibitor, but it is not the T-cell checkpoint inhibitor. And there's always been a discussion of whether another class of immune cells, such as the myeloid cells could be really important. And so that's the second reason why we're very interested. 
But quite frankly, the third point I would make is, all of that is interesting science and is a great hypothesis. But fundamentally, we have to have clinical trials that show that. We are advancing clinical trials for ILT4. And I think that the interest in other companies to follow our lead in ILT4 is based on the fact that they see us advancing it, and we believe that our data will support us advancing it, and we'll just have to see what that benefit is, but it is a highly differentiated first-in-class mechanism, not just in the molecule, but in the cellular sort of approach of how we're attacking cancer broadly."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I'm very pleased to report significant progress across our key growth and strategic priorities in Merck's first full quarter as a more agile and focused science-driven company. 
We have strong momentum in our business. We have achieved notable clinical milestones, active on a significant business development opportunity consistent with our strategy and executed commercially to drive strong performance this quarter. 
We're also working with diligence and urgency, which is reflected in the speed with which we were able to bring forward our investigational COVID-19 antiviral, molnupiravir, and to rapidly file for emergency use authorization with the FDA. 
It's an exciting time at Merck, and we are determined to build on our recent successes as we pursue our mission to deliver innovations that save and improve lives and as we seek to create long-term value for both our patients and our shareholders. Dean will speak to the significant pipeline advancements we're making in a minute. But I first want to congratulate him and our research colleagues, as well as our partners at Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, on the meaningful clinical results we recently reported regarding the development of molnupiravir. 
From the onset of the pandemic, Merck has sought out opportunities to apply its scientific expertise in the global fight against COV-19, and we are very pleased to now be in a position to make a meaningful difference. As you are aware, at a planned interim analysis of our Phase III trial in at-risk nonhospitalized adult patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, molnupiravir reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by approximately 50% compared with placebo. 
Based on these results and in consultation with the FDA, we stopped our trial early. We are now working with the FDA as the agency reviews our EUA application, and we look forward to next month's advisory committee discussion. I'm pleased with the progress we are making to enter supply and purchase commitments with numerous governments and health care systems around the world and with the success of our effort to rapidly build supply. 
I'm also proud that we will be positioned to provide access to patients around the world through voluntary license agreements, tiered pricing based on country affordability and to our agreement with the Medicines Patent pool. 
We've also taken a meaningful step towards augmenting our pipeline through business development, a key strategic priority. The announced acquisition of Acceleron is a perfect example of our effort to identify and bring in the strongest external science to supplement our own work. Acceleron's lead product candidates, sotatercept, has the potential to become foundational as an add-on therapy in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, where there is a strong need for a new agent that can potentially address the underlying illness and not just the symptoms of this grievous disease. We look forward to the completion of our tender offer in the near future and to receiving the necessary regulatory approvals that will permit us to close the transaction. 
With its multibillion-dollar peak sales potential, and commercial exclusivity well into the next decade. Sotatercept can contribute meaningful revenue growth in the KEYTRUDA LOE period, an important attribute of this and potential future targets. Dean and I will continue to work with our team to identify additional scientifically compelling business development opportunities while also continuing to pursue a robust and growing internal pipeline. 
Our business performed exceptionally well this quarter, and the team continues to display superior and focused execution. We achieved very strong commercial and financial results with meaningful growth across our oncology Vaccines and Animal Health businesses and even greater growth in earnings. 
As expected, GARDASIL sales were particularly robust as we benefited from a sharp improvement in manufacturing output and availability of more doses to help address ongoing strong underlying demand. We are confident that the momentum we are seeing will continue through the end of the year, setting us up for continued growth over the next several years. We remain focused on our efforts to transform the way we work by evolving our operating model to be leaner, nimbler and more digitally enabled. 
My leadership team is fully aligned behind the need for Merck to work with more speed, urgency and agility across all aspects of our business. We must stay ahead of the evolving external environment to ensure we are able to make the significant investments required to deliver future innovations that will address unmet medical needs across the globe. In doing so, we aim to deliver important medicines and vaccines to patients while continuing to drive long-term sustainable growth and value creation for all of our stakeholders. 
Finally, I want to highlight the recent publication of Merck's Environmental, Social and Governance Progress Report. This year's report highlights important updates on metrics and goals around our 4 ESG priority areas, which include access to health; our employees, including their health and safety as well as engagement and diversity; environmental sustainability and ethics and values. These ESG efforts are grounded in the core values that have always guided our mission and support our business strategy. We look forward to providing ongoing updates on these important efforts. 
With that, I will pass it to Frank to review the details behind our Human Health performance."

Good morning. As Rob highlighted, the momentum in our Human Health business continued in the third quarter, and we achieved 17% growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. .
We have continued to invest with urgency in patient activation programs that improve patient awareness and encourage more normal levels of physician office visits, oncology screens and vaccination rates. These actions, while ended benefiting patient health, also meaningfully benefited our largely physician-administered portfolio in the quarter. 
In the United States, we are encouraged that wellness visits and surgical procedures remain at mostly normal levels. In oncology, while screening rates and diagnosis continue to improve, they are unfortunately still below pre-COVID levels, and this is impacting new patient starts. 
Outside of the United States, our business performance remains strong despite lingering impacts from the pandemic in certain markets. Now turning to the third quarter performance of our key brands. My comments will be on an ex exchange basis. 
In oncology, KEYTRUDA sales grew 21% to $4.5 billion, reflecting continued robust global demand. In the United States, KEYTRUDA continues to demonstrate durable momentum across all key tumors, including growth from our recent launches such as KEYNOTE-522 in neoadjuvant adjuvant triple-negative breast cancer. 
KEYTRUDA is continuing to extend its very strong overall IO class leadership, improving new and total patient market share. KEYTRUDA continues to maintain its leadership position in lung cancer, capturing 8 out of 10 eligible new patients despite continued competition. Outside of lung, key tumors contributing to growth include renal cell carcinoma, triple-negative breast, MSI high, esophageal and head and neck. 
We are also excited by the recent approval and upcoming launch of KEYNOTE-826, which is the first anti-PD-1 combination approved as a first-line treatment of cervical cancer. Outside of United States, KEYTRUDA growth continues to be driven by lung cancer indications and the ongoing launches in head and neck and renal cell carcinoma. We are continuing to see the opportunity to expand our reach into earlier lines of therapy materialize. 
We are very excited about the potential upcoming adjuvant launches of KEYNOTE-564 in renal cell carcinoma and KEYNOTE-716 in melanoma. In fact, in the United States, we expect over half of KEYTRUDA's growth to come from indications in early-stage treatment settings through 2025 and to represent roughly 30% of total KEYTRUDA sales by that time. 
Lynparza sales grew 25%, and it remains the leading PARP inhibitor. Growth was driven by our breast cancer indication and continued uptake of the most recent indications, including ovarian prostate, and we look forward to the potential launch next year in a broader prostate population based on the PROPEL trial. 
Lenvima sales grew 30%. In the United States, growth was driven by renal cell carcinoma and endometrial cancer. We've seen very encouraging early trends from the launch of KEYNOTE-581 in first-line renal cell carcinoma. Outside the United States, growth is reflective of increased demand following NRDL listing in China in March of this year. 
We're also excited by the recent approval of WELIREG for patients with certain VHL-associated tumors. We received very positive feedback from scientific leaders, providers and patients about the benefits of WELIREG, which is off to a promising start, and we are hopeful to extend the reach of WELIREG to broader RCC indications in the future. 
Our vaccines portfolio continued to deliver strong growth from GARDASIL, which grew 63% to $2 billion and has grown 35% year-to-date. In the United States, the increase in year-over-year growth was primarily driven by the timing of CDC purchases, which helped us overcome a below normal back-to-school season. Underlying demand for GARDASIL remains strong, and we are seeing some benefits from recovery of missed doses due to the pandemic. 
Outside the United States, growth was largely driven by strong underlying demand in China, as well as increased supply and our ability to reallocate doses. 
In our hospital acute care portfolio, BRIDION sales grew 15%, driven by our ability to capture increased market share within the growing neuromuscular blockade reversal plans. 
Turning to our outlook. The robust underlying demand for our products, paired with our continued excellent commercial execution, gives us confidence in the outlook for our business. Merck has shown increased urgency and agility across our organization that has resulted in improvements that will enable meaningful future growth. 
On GARDASIL, we continue to expect robust ex U.S. demand and increased supply to drive fourth quarter performance. We expect to see more normal seasonality for GARDASIL with the third quarter reflecting the highest in sales. Our teams have been working to ensure we have the right processes in place to appropriately allocate doses to areas of increased demand, particularly as COVID variants continue to impact certain geographies. 
These dynamics will drive very strong year-over-year growth for GARDASIL in the fourth quarter, driven by ex U.S. markets such as China. Given global HPV vaccination levels remain low, we continue to believe long-term growth opportunity for GARDASIL remains significant. 
In oncology, we are encouraged by our strong performance throughout the pandemic with new launches more than offsetting the headwinds seen from reduced new patient starts. We remain confident in the underlying demand for our broad and innovative portfolio, including KEYTRUDA, Lynparza and LENVIMA, and we expect to drive sustained growth across key tumor types and in earlier stages of disease. 
Next, let me provide a few comments on the outlook for monopirivir. As Rob mentioned, we are very excited about the potential to offer the first oral treatment option to at-risk adults with mild to moderate COVID-19 in an effort to help combat the pandemic. 
Merck is committed to providing widespread access to monoperivir globally and is implementing a tiered pricing approach based on World Bank country income criteria. We have announced a number of supply and purchase commitments to date, and we continue to have discussions on similar agreements with customers around the world. 
We are also encouraged by the recent unanimous vote by the Advisory Committee on Immunization practices. Upon adoption as a final recommendation by the CDC, this sequence would offer patients the broadest coverage with a strong immuno response against serotypes responsible for about 2/3 of invasive pneumococcal disease cases in adults. 
As we think about our pneumococcal portfolio more broadly, we are excited about the potential opportunity for Vacuvant in the pediatric setting, which represents a larger market segment. 
To conclude, there is continued momentum in our business, driven by demand and strong commercial execution, and we are well positioned as we move through the end of the year. The growth in the third quarter underscores our confidence in the underlying strength of our business and global demand for our innovative medicines and vaccines, and we look forward to driving that growth long into the future. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Caroline."

Our team drove exceptional financial performance in the third quarter. The investments we are making in our strong portfolio and pipeline, as well as in business development, are helping us deliver outstanding near-term performance while also positioning us to continue to deliver important innovations and long-term value to patients and shareholders. 
Now turning to our third quarter results. Total company revenues were $13.2 billion, an increase of 20% or 19%, excluding the positive impact of foreign exchange. The remainder of my comments will be on an ex exchange basis. As Frank highlighted, our Human Health business achieved improving momentum, growing 17%. Our Animal Health business also delivered robust growth with sales increasing 14% driven by strong global demand across both Companion Animal and livestock. 
Companion Animal sales increased 18%, driven by global demand in parasiticide, including the Bravecto line of products, as well as Companion Animal vaccines. Livestock sales increased 12%, reflecting strong global demand for ruminant and poultry products, including our Animal Health Intelligence products. 
I will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L, and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 76.8%, an increase of 0.3 percentage points, reflecting the favorable effect of product mix, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs. Operating expenses increased 11% to $4.7 billion. This was driven by investments in our key growth pillars, particularly in support of return to care activities and in our early and late-stage pipeline, including molnupiravir. Other expense increased by approximately $200 million, reflecting higher pension settlement costs. 
The effective tax rate was 13%, a decrease of 1.4 percentage points driven by discreet items 
[Audio Gap] 
expecting significant growth of 25% to 26%. This range includes a positive impact from foreign exchange of approximately 2% using mid-October rates. 
As you consider your models, there are a few areas to focus on. Starting with molnupiravir revenue. We expect the global opportunity to be approximately $5 billion to $7 billion through 2022, including $0.5 billion to $1 billion expected to be realized this year. This assumes emergency use authorization in December. 
As a reminder, we will share any profit equally with our partner, Ridgeback. Merck is responsible for recording global revenues and costs and will reflect the profit share within cost of sales. 
For GARDASIL, we have had excellent momentum driven by strong demand and benefit from the step function increase in supply we are achieving this year. Fourth quarter sales will be lower than the third quarter due to normal seasonality and timing effects. However, we expect the growth in the quarter to remain very robust. 
Animal Health has had exceptional growth in the first 3 quarters of the year, driven in part by the pandemic effect on pet adoption and pet spending. In the fourth quarter, we will anniversary that effect, and we expect a more normalized year-over-year growth rate as a result. 
Our operating margin in the third quarter benefited from very strong revenue performance, including the normal seasonality of our vaccine business. As we move through the fourth quarter, we expect operating margins to normalize due to this seasonality and phasing of spend. 
More broadly, as we look out to 2024, we remain confident in our revenue potential and continue to believe it is underappreciated. And we remain on track to achieve our 2024 operating margin target of greater than 42%. 
Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We will continue to invest in the business to drive the many significant near- and long-term growth opportunities we see in our risk portfolio and rich pipeline. We also continue to execute on our business development strategy, including our announced acquisition of Acceleron. We will pursue additional value-enhancing and strategic business development opportunities, and we retain significant balance sheet capacity to do so. 
We remain committed to the dividend with the goal of increasing it over time. To the extent we have excess cash, we will return it to shareholders through share repurchases. To conclude, Merck continues to make exceptional progress on its commitment to drive growth and value for patients and shareholders. We remain in a position of financial and operational strength which will enable us to deliver on that promise now and well into the future. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Dean."

It is a pleasure to be here to provide a summary of progress made since our last quarter call. I will provide an update on our oral antiviral candidate, molnupiravir, highlight the proposed Acceleron acquisition, spotlight some recent progress with islatravir and finish with the synopsis of notable regulatory milestones and clinical updates from across the pipeline. 
The need for additional treatment options remains key in combating the COVID-19 pandemic. Interim analysis from move-out, our Phase III study evaluating monitarvir in at-risk nonhospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 showed an approximately 50% reduction in the risk of hospitalization or death compared to placebo. Of note, through day 29, no deaths were reported in patients who received molnupiravir compared to 8 deaths on placebo. This is the first oral antiviral for a respiratory virus to demonstrate benefits based on robust clinical outcomes and the first to show a meaningful 5-day window for therapeutic intervention after symptoms entree. 
Based on these positive results and at the recommendation of the intended data monitoring committee and in consultation with the FDA, recruitment into the study was stopped early. In light of these findings and given the urgency to address the pandemic, our teams worked tirelessly to submit a robust package to the FDA for EUA within 10 days of receiving data. We look forward to discussing the EUA submission at an upcoming meeting of the Antimicrobial Drugs Advisory Committee scheduled for November 30. And in the interim, we continue to engage with the FDA to support its review. 
Applications have also been submitted to multiple regulatory agencies around the world. I do wish to take a moment to thank the investigators, patients and their families for their participation in the move-out study. I am also grateful to our collaborators at Emory University, Ridgeback and Merck's internal teams with incredible work done in conducting this program during a very challenging time. 
A comprehensive vaccination strategy remains the best sustainable means to confront this COVID-19 pandemic. Timely intervention following symptoms onset with an oral agent that can be self-administered at home may provide an additional meaningful option for patients, health care systems and public health, which could make a significant and positive impact on the pandemic. 
Based on a valuable viral sequence data, molnupiravir showed consistent efficacy against the gamma, delta and new COVID-19 variant. As a reminder, we continue to actively recruit participants in the Move Ahead trial, which is evaluating the safety and efficacy of molnupiravir and preventing the spread of COVID-19 within households as a post-exposure prophylactic with a planned readout in the spring of 2022. 
Now turning to the proposed Acceleron acquisition. Acceleron has an excellent scientific pedigree, which has yielded important treatment for anemia in adult patients with certain rare blood disorders. Their lead clinical candidate, separate, has the potential to be a foundational asset as an add-on therapy for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension and provide a complementary addition to our growing cardiovascular pipeline. 
As such, following the close of the deal, our strategy would be to advance the wide-ranging Phase III clinical program. Now on to the portfolio and pipeline, starting with HIV. 
We continue to generate clinical data that reinforces the foundational potential islatravir and HIV. At the European AIDS Conference in London this week, we presented data from the Phase II study evaluating doravirine and islatravir in previously untreated adults with HIV infections, which demonstrated continued maintenance of viral suppression through 144 weeks. 
We also recently reported positive top line results from 2 pivotal trials evaluating a once-daily oral regimen of daravarine and ezlosevir in a switch setting in adults with HIV infection who are virologically suppressed on other HIV therapy regimen. 
At 48 weeks, both trials met their primary efficacy endpoint for percentage of participants with levels of HIV RNA greater than or equal to 50 copies per milliliter, demonstrating comparable efficacy with those receiving the comparator anti virtual viral therapy. We plan to present these findings at upcoming medical congress and incorporate the data into global regulatory submission. 
This week, we also announced the start of a Phase II clinical study evaluating a once-weekly oral combination of islatravir and lenacapavir in people living with HIV who are virologically suppressed on an antiretroviral therapy. We have made great progress in our collaboration with Gilead and look forward to reporting our future developments, including our long-acting injectable co-formulation. Next, on to vacate. 
We received a positive opinion for back events from the European Medicine Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Youth in individuals 18 years and older. And more recently, in the U.S., the CDC's ACIP unanimously to provisionally recommend a new band followed by New Mobax as an option for pneumococcal vaccination in adult 65 years and older as well as for adults aged 19 to 64 with certain underlying medical conditions with both patient populations being studied in our clinical trials. 
Vaccine performance is multidimensional and includes eliciting a strong [indiscernible] as well as providing coverage for important disease heritage. Our 2-dose regimen accomplishes the best of both by listening a robust immune response across the 15 serotypes in Baxuvans, including serotype-3, as well as providing the broadest seritide coverage among current pneumococcal vaccine options, of which 4 that are unique to New Oba. Furthermore, [indiscernible] fans has the most extensive clinical development program of the newly licensed TCV. This includes completed or ongoing evaluations among those with certain chronic for an immune compromised conditions that increase the susceptibility to and severity of pneumococcal disease. 
We also announced positive top line results for BAX events from the pivotal new PED study evaluating immunogenicity, safety and tolerability in the pediatric setting and have submitted an application to the FDA. Evidence indicates the incorporation of serotypes 22F and 33F as well as strong immunogenicity against serotype 3 has the potential to play an important role in the prevention of pneumococcal disease in infants and children. These 3 serotypes represent more than 1/4 of all cases of invasive disease in children under the age of 5. We will present full results at an upcoming scientific congress. 
And finally, to oncology. The rich flow of data from our clinical development programs across tumor types continue. We maintain momentum in the development of new treatment options for women's cancer with the approval of KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab for recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer based on data from KEYNOTE A26. 
This study showed a meaningful 36% [indiscernible] death. This is the first anti-PD-1 combination treatment option for patients in the first-line setting and together with our industry-leading human papillomavirus vaccine, GARDASIL and GARDASIL 9, we are uniquely positioned to address certain unmet needs in cervical cancer with a focus on both prevention and treatment. 
At ESMO in September, we presented final results from KEYNOTE-355, our study of KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy for advanced triple-negative breast cancer, which showed a reduction in the risk of death by 27%. 
And KEYTRUDA is the only immuno-oncology agent approved in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. This, along with additional data presented across endometrial and ovarian cancers reinforces the remarkable progress being made in our broad women's cancer portfolio. We are also making inroads in new cancer cuts, including prostate cancer. With our partners at AstraZeneca, we announced positive results from the Phase III PROPEL study for the frontline treatment of metastatic aspiration resistant prostate cancer. This study demonstrated the Lynparza, in combination with abiretinol, significantly delayed disease progression regardless of biomarker status. And part is the first PARP inhibitor to demonstrate clinical benefit in radiographic progression-free survival in combination with a new hormonal agent in this setting. 
We are encouraged by this study and the potential to help the increasing number of men diagnosed with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and submitted to regulatory authorities globally. 
Next, to renal cell carcinoma, which represents an important area of expansion. In August, we received FDA approval for WELIREG, a first-in-class HIF2 alpha inhibitor therapy for the treatment of adult patients with boniflimdol disease who require therapy for associated renal cell carcinoma, central nervous system, hemangioblastomas or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, not requiring immediate surgery. 
This approval provides us a beat check as we evaluate weared potential in broader RCC indications and beyond. Also in RCC in partnership with ASA, following FDA priority review, we received approval for the combination of KEYTRUDA and Lenvima in the frontline setting based on results from the KEYNOTE-581 trial. This brings forth an important new first-line treatment option for patients with advanced RCC. We are also rapidly expanding programs into earlier lines of therapy. 
During the quarter, the FDA granted priority review for our application for KEYTRUDA as an adjuvant therapy for patients with RCC at intermediate high or high risk of recurring following effectively or following effectomy and resection metastatic lesions from the KEYNOTE-564 study. Additionally, we received priority review for KEYTRUDA for the treatment of patients with surgically resected high-risk Stage 2 melanoma based on results on the KEYNOTE-716 study that showed an improvement in recurring free survival compared to placebo. Both of these studies demonstrates the benefit of expanding the use of KEYTRUDA to earlier stages of disease, allowing us to extend treatment benefits to more patients sooner. 
We look forward to a decision on both studies by the end of the year. To conclude, I am proud of the progress across our broad pipeline and look forward to providing further updates on our scientific progress in the future. Now I turn the call back to Peter."

Thank you for that question. This is Dean. I would just emphasize, we are very confident in the safety profile of molnupiravir based on our preclinical and clinical data. .
In relationship to the clinical data, I think most people recognize that in the interim analysis, we had a profound reduction in hospitalization or death compared to placebo, and it was stopped early in -- by the guidance of the DSMB and in consultation with the FDA. 
And in that interim analysis, the incidence of any adverse effect was comparable in both molnupiravir and placebo. And actually, if you look, there are a few subjects in the molnupiravir group who discontinue therapy due to an adverse event compared to the placebo group. 
In relationship to our confidence in the safety profile based on our extensive preclinical evaluation, I think it's important to recognize that molnupiravir is a nucleoside analog that functions by creating errors in the genetic material of RNA viruses. These new play side analogs are often used in many other antiviral treatments, including HIV and hepatitis. And we have done a comprehensive nonclinical program to characterize the safety profile of molnupiravir. 
It's been written by other people. There's actually been written in the sort of scientific journals as well, and we will be presenting all of this data, I believe, in the AdCom that the FDA will be holding. But probably the most important pieces of information is the -- in 2 distinct and vivo-rotin-mute genicity assays, commonly called the Big Blue and the Big A, which are well characterized and considered to provide a robust measure of the ability of a drug or chemical to induce mutations in vivo. In these studies, we're administering molnupiravir for longer and higher doses than those employed in the human clinical trial. And the totality of the data from these studies indicate that molnupiravir is not mutagenic or genotoxic in these in vivo mammalian systems. Now we have shared these results throughout with the regulatory agencies worldwide, and we'll continue to provide additional data as this process continues."

And there's going to be an endemic phase, and potentially, there could be other phases after that. 
But for the pandemic phase, I just want to emphasize, we have the move-out trial, and then we'll have to see the potential in the move ahead to see whether we both have a treatment and prophylaxis. 
In the endemic phase, when the pandemic somewhat recedes, it's highly likely that SARS COVID-2 will become an endemic infection. And we all have to recognize and it's related to the previous question, during this phase, there will be a large reservoir of individuals across the globe with high copy number of viruses in many of these individuals that may lead to a constant brewing of variance. 
So this question of resistance becomes very important. It is important to emphasize that molnupiravir has an extremely high barrier to resistance. It has broad efficacy across all SARS COVID-2 variants to date. And in our preclinical studies and preclinical studies of others, it not only has a broad efficacy across SARS COVID-2 variants, but a broad variety of RNA viruses and probably the broadest than all other current mechanisms that we know being developed. I should emphasize. This high barrier to resistance is critically important, both in the pandemic and the endemic phase as has been highlighted, and I need to emphasize for this reason, we prioritize molnupiravir over our other programs, including an internal protease inhibitor given the paramount importance we place on ensuring the highest barrier to resistance given where we are in the world right now."

So we're very focused in the pediatric in relationship to the adults, the critical issue for us in relationship to Videl is that we, as I said in the prepared comments, I think it's very important to give the best coverage in terms of serotype, but not just by immunogenicity by actually studying clinical events, especially in those patients who are compromised or at risk or have some other condition that might increase their susceptibility to have invasive nemmocracco disease. 
And we think that clinical data and the way that we've studied it in these patient populations directly. We have not extrapolated from immunogenicity. We've actually studied it is something that's critically important as one looks at the true efficacy of a vaccine. Frank, did you want to answer?"

The only thing I'll add is actually, we were very pleased that it was unanimous approval for the sequence of Vacuvance and Pneumovax.

And then as Dean mentioned, we're also really excited about the opportunity for Vacuvance in the pediatric segment, which we believe is the larger market opportunity. So overall, from our perspective, we feel really good about the ACIP's recommendation."

I don't think we can really comment on how advisory committees, the FDA or others, the CGC would look at that. But what I will tell you from our perspective, first and foremost, people should be vaccinated that it continues to believe what we think is the right answer. We see our therapy as something that is an important addition to the armamentarium. And obviously, there are places where people cannot get the vaccine or unfortunately, if people get vaccinated and have breakthrough virus. So there's definitely a need for this, but it is in collaboration as a complement to the vaccine not in place of it. That's our perspective. We'll let the government speak to their own."

And if you think about markets such as China, if you think about the approval in Japan, if you think about the gender-neutral opportunities that we have in Europe as well as other age cohorts in mid adult in the U.S. because we feel that there is significant opportunity for continued GARDASIL growth, as you saw a step up in our supply, we will continue to see that.

My understanding is that another $10 billion cash deal would be enough to trigger a 1-notch downgrade. And if it was something like a $30 billion cash deal, that could be a 2-notch downgrade.

And as we look at capacity, I would just say, we believe we have the firepower to do and frankly, any deal that's out there that we would have a strategic interest in doing the balance sheet will not be a rate limiter for us. We have very strong balance sheet capacity. I don't think we want to get into trying to get specifics, some of your numbers, frankly, were quite a bit off, actually, but I don't want to start getting into those kind of specifics because it depends on rating agencies.

Beyond that, I was very pleased with what we did when we gave -- added visibility to our HIV pipeline. The excitement we have around islatravir. That's a foundational drive. Oncology continues to have just multiple shots on goal both with KEYTRUDA and a growing number of new mechanisms. We've highlighted that.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I'm very pleased to report significant progress across our key growth and strategic priorities in Merck's first full quarter as a more agile and focused science-driven company.
We have strong momentum in our business. We have achieved notable clinical milestones, acted on a significant business development opportunity consistent with our strategy and executed commercially to drive strong performance this quarter.  
We're also working with diligence and urgency, which is reflected in the speed with which we were able to bring forward our investigational COVID-19 antiviral, molnupiravir, and to rapidly file for Emergency Use Authorization with the FDA.
It's an exciting time at Merck, and we are determined to build on our recent successes as we pursue our mission to deliver innovations that save and improve lives and as we seek to create long-term value for both our patients and our shareholders. 
Dean will speak to the significant pipeline advancements we're making in a minute. But I first want to congratulate him and our research colleagues, as well as our partners at Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, on the meaningful clinical results we recently reported regarding the development of molnupiravir.
From the onset of the pandemic, Merck has sought out opportunities to apply its scientific expertise in the global fight against COVID-19, and we are very pleased to now be in a position to make a meaningful difference. As you are aware, at a planned interim analysis of our Phase III trial in at-risk nonhospitalized adult patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, molnupiravir reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by approximately 50% compared with placebo.
Based on these results and in consultation with the FDA, we stopped our trial early. We are now working with the FDA as the agency reviews our EUA application, and we look forward to next month's advisory committee discussion. I'm pleased with the progress we are making to enter supply and purchase commitments with numerous governments and health care systems around the world and with the success of our effort to rapidly build supply.
I'm also proud that we will be positioned to provide access to patients around the world through voluntary license agreements, tiered pricing based on country affordability and to our agreement with the Medicines Patent pool.
We've also taken a meaningful step towards augmenting our pipeline through business development, a key strategic priority. The announced acquisition of Acceleron is a perfect example of our effort to identify and bring in the strongest external science to supplement our own work. 
Acceleron's lead product candidate, sotatercept has the potential to become foundational as an add-on therapy in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, where there is a strong need for a new agent that can potentially address the underlying illness and not just the symptoms of this grievous disease. We look forward to the completion of our tender offer in the near future and to receiving the necessary regulatory approvals that will permit us to close the transaction.
With its multibillion-dollar peak sales potential, and commercial exclusivity well into the next decade, sotatercept can contribute meaningful revenue growth in the KEYTRUDA LOE period, an important attribute of this and potential future targets.  Dean and I will continue to work with our team to identify additional scientifically compelling business development opportunities, while also continuing to pursue a robust and growing internal pipeline.  
Our business performed exceptionally well this quarter, and the team continues to display superior and focused execution. We achieved very strong commercial and financial results with meaningful growth across our Oncology, Vaccines and Animal Health businesses and even greater growth in earnings.
As expected, GARDASIL sales were particularly robust as we benefited from a sharp improvement in manufacturing output and availability of more doses to help address ongoing strong underlying demand. We are confident that the momentum we are seeing will continue through the end of the year, setting us up for continued growth over the next several years. We remain focused on our efforts to transform the way we work by evolving our operating model to be leaner, nimbler and more digitally enabled.  
My leadership team is fully aligned behind the need for Merck to work with more speed, urgency and agility across all aspects of our business. We must stay ahead of the evolving external environment to ensure we are able to make the significant investments required to deliver future innovations that will address unmet medical needs across the globe. In doing so, we aim to deliver important medicines and vaccines to patients, while continuing to drive long-term sustainable growth and value creation for all of our stakeholders.  
Finally, I want to highlight the recent publication of Merck's Environmental, Social and Governance Progress Report. This year's report highlights important updates on metrics and goals around our 4 ESG priority areas, which include access to health; our employees, including their health and safety as well as engagement and diversity; environmental sustainability; and ethics and values. These ESG efforts are grounded in the core values that have always guided our mission and support our business strategy. We look forward to providing ongoing updates on these important efforts.  
With that, I will pass it to Frank to review the details behind our Human Health performance."
288502,709040632,2415915,"Merck & Co., Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Merck & Co., Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rob. Good morning. As Rob highlighted, the momentum in our Human Health business continued in the third quarter, and we achieved 17% growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange.We have continued to invest with urgency in patient activation",1131,"Thanks, Rob. Good morning. As Rob highlighted, the momentum in our Human Health business continued in the third quarter, and we achieved 17% growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange.
We have continued to invest with urgency in patient activation programs that improve patient awareness and encourage more normal levels of physician office visits, oncology screens and vaccination rates. These actions, while ended benefiting patient health, also meaningfully benefited our largely physician-administered portfolio in the quarter.  
In the United States, we are encouraged that wellness visits and surgical procedures remain at mostly normal levels. In oncology, while screening rates and diagnosis continue to improve, they are unfortunately still below pre-COVID levels, and this is impacting new patient starts. Outside of the United States, our business performance remains strong, despite lingering impacts from the pandemic in certain markets. 
Now turning to the third quarter performance of our key brands. My comments will be on an ex exchange basis. In oncology, KEYTRUDA sales grew 21% to $4.5 billion, reflecting continued robust global demand. In the United States, KEYTRUDA continues to demonstrate durable momentum across all key tumors, including growth from our recent launches such as KEYNOTE-522 in neoadjuvant adjuvant triple-negative breast cancer.  
KEYTRUDA is continuing to extend its very strong overall IO class leadership, improving new and total patient market share. KEYTRUDA continues to maintain its leadership position in lung cancer, capturing 8 out of 10 eligible new patients despite continued competition. Outside of lung, key tumors contributing to growth, include renal cell carcinoma, triple-negative breast, MSI high, esophageal and head and neck. We are also excited by the recent approval and upcoming launch of KEYNOTE-826, which is the first anti-PD-1 combination, approved as a first-line treatment of cervical cancer. 
Outside of United States, KEYTRUDA growth continues to be driven by lung cancer indications and the ongoing launches in head and neck and renal cell carcinoma. We are continuing to see the opportunity to expand our reach into earlier lines of therapy materialize. 
We are very excited about the potential upcoming adjuvant launches of KEYNOTE-564 in renal cell carcinoma and KEYNOTE-716 in melanoma. In fact, in the United States, we expect over half of KEYTRUDA's growth to come from indications in early-stage treatment settings through 2025 and to represent roughly 30% of total contributed sales by that time. 
Lynparza sales grew 25%, and it remains the leading PARP inhibitor. Growth was driven by our breast cancer indication and continued uptake of the most recent indications, including ovarian and prostate, and we look forward to the potential launch next year in a broader prostate population based on the PROpel trial.  
Lenvima sales grew 30%. In the United States, growth was driven by renal cell carcinoma and endometrial cancer. We've seen very encouraging early trends from the launch of KEYNOTE-581 in first-line renal cell carcinoma. Outside the United States, growth is reflective of increased demand following NRDL listing in China in March of this year.  
We're also excited by the recent approval of WELIREG for patients with certain VHL-associated tumors. We received very positive feedback from scientific leaders, providers and patients about the benefits of WELIREG, which is off to a promising start, and we are hopeful to extend the reach of WELIREG to broader RCC indications in the future.
Our vaccines portfolio continued to deliver strong growth from GARDASIL, which grew 63% to $2 billion and has grown 35% year-to-date. In the United States, the increase in year-over-year growth was primarily driven by the timing of CDC purchases, which helped us overcome a below normal back-to-school season. Underlying demand for GARDASIL remains strong, and we are seeing some benefits from recovery of missed doses due to the pandemic.
Outside the United States, growth was largely driven by strong underlying demand in China, as well as increased supply and our ability to reallocate doses.
In our hospital acute care portfolio, BRIDION sales grew 15%, driven by our ability to capture increased market share within the growing neuromuscular blockade reversal plans.
Turning to our outlook. The robust underlying demand for our products, paired with our continued excellent commercial execution, gives us confidence in the outlook for our business. Merck has shown increased urgency and agility across our organization that has resulted in improvements that will enable meaningful future growth.  
On GARDASIL, we continue to expect robust ex U.S. demand and increased supply to drive fourth quarter performance. We expect to see more normal seasonality for GARDASIL with the third quarter reflecting the highest in sales. Our teams have been working to ensure we have the right processes in place to appropriately allocate doses to areas of increased demand, particularly as COVID variants continue to impact certain geographies.  
These dynamics will drive very strong year-over-year growth for GARDASIL in the fourth quarter, driven by ex U.S. markets such as China. Given global HPV vaccination levels remain low, we continue to believe long-term growth opportunity for GARDASIL remains significant.
In oncology, we are encouraged by our strong performance throughout the pandemic, with new launches more than offsetting the headwinds seen from reduced new patient starts. We remain confident in the underlying demand for our broad and innovative portfolio, including KEYTRUDA, Lynparza and Lenvima, and we expect to drive sustained growth across key tumor types and in earlier stages of disease.
Next let me provide a few comments on the outlook for molnupiravir. As Rob mentioned, we are very excited about the potential to offer the first oral treatment option to at-risk adults with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in an effort to help combat the pandemic.  
Merck is committed to providing widespread access to molnupiravir globally and is implementing a tiered pricing approach based on World Bank country income criteria. We have announced a number of supply and purchase commitments to date, and we continue to have discussions on similar agreements with customers around the world.
We are also encouraged by the recent unanimous vote by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Upon adoption as a final recommendation by the CDC, this sequence would offer patients the broadest coverage with a strong immune response against serotypes responsible for about 2/3 of invasive pneumococcal disease cases in adults.  
As we think about our pneumococcal portfolio more broadly, we are excited about the potential opportunity for VAXNEUVANCE in the pediatric setting, which represents a larger market segment.  
To conclude, there is continued momentum in our business, driven by demand and strong commercial execution, and we are well positioned as we move through the end of the year. The growth in the third quarter underscores our confidence in the underlying strength of our business and global demand for our innovative medicines and vaccines, and we look forward to driving that growth long into the future.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Caroline."
288502,709040632,2415915,"Merck & Co., Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Merck & Co., Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Frank. Good morning. Our team drove exceptional financial performance in the third quarter.

Our team drove exceptional financial performance in the third quarter. The investments we are making in our strong portfolio and pipeline, as well as in business development, are helping us deliver outstanding near-term performance while also positioning us to continue to deliver important innovations and long-term value to patients and shareholders.  
Now turning to our third quarter results. Total company revenues were $13.2 billion, an increase of 20% or 19%, excluding the positive impacts of foreign exchange. The remainder of my comments will be on an ex exchange basis. As Frank highlighted, our Human Health business achieved improving momentum, growing 17%. Our Animal Health business also delivered robust growth with sales increasing 14%, driven by strong global demand across both companion animal and livestock. Companion Animal sales increased 18%, driven by global demand in parasiticide, including the BRAVECTO line of products, as well as Companion Animal vaccines. Livestock sales increased 12%, reflecting strong global demand for ruminant and poultry products, including our Animal Health Intelligence products.  
I will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L, and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 76.8%, an increase of 0.3 percentage points, reflecting the favorable effect of product mix, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs. Operating expenses increased 11% to $4.7 billion. This was driven by investments in our key growth pillars, particularly in supportive return to care activities and in our early and late-stage pipeline, including molnupiravir. Other expense increased by approximately $200 million, reflecting higher pension settlement costs. The effective tax rate was 13%, a decrease of 1.4 percentage points driven by discreet items. Taken together, we earned $1.75 per share, an increase of 26%.
Turning now to our 2021 non-GAAP guidance. While the pandemic continues to impact many regions around the world, health systems and patients have largely adapted, and we assume this trend will continue. Our guidance assumes the Acceleron transaction will close during the fourth quarter, subject to the successful completion of the tender offer and regulatory approvals and does not include potential sales or earnings from molnupiravir. 
The underlying strength of our business enables us to narrow and raise our expected revenue range to $47.4 to $47.9 billion, representing growth of 14% to 15%, including a positive impact from foreign exchange of approximately 1.5% using mid-October rates. 
Our gross margin is expected to be approximately 76.5%. We continue to expect operating expenses to grow at a high single-digit rate. In other income and expense, we expect expense of approximately $450 million. We expect our full year tax rate to be between 14% and 14.5%. We assumed 2.54 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we are raising and narrowing our EPS range to $5.65 to $5.70 reflecting significant growth of 25% to 26%. This range includes a positive impact from foreign exchange of approximately 2% using mid-October rates.
As you consider your models, there are a few areas to focus on. Starting with molnupiravir revenue. We expect the global opportunity to be approximately $5 billion to $7 billion through 2022, including $0.5 billion to $1 billion expected to be realized this year. This assumes emergency use authorization in December. As a reminder, we will share any profit equally with our partner, Ridgeback. Merck is responsible for recording global revenues and costs and will reflect the profit share within cost of sales.  
For GARDASIL, we have had excellent momentum driven by strong demand and benefit from the step function increase in supply we are achieving this year. Fourth quarter sales will be lower than the third quarter due to normal seasonality and timing effects; however, we expect the growth in the quarter to remain very robust.
Animal Health has had exceptional growth in the first 3 quarters of the year, driven in part by the pandemic effect on pet adoption and pet spending. In the fourth quarter, we will anniversary that effect, and we expect a more normalized year-over-year growth rate as a result.
Our operating margin in the third quarter benefited from very strong revenue performance, including the normal seasonality of our vaccine business. As we move through the fourth quarter, we expect operating margins to normalize due to this seasonality and phasing of spend.
More broadly, as we look out to 2024, we remain confident in our revenue potential and continue to believe it is underappreciated. And we remain on track to achieve our 2024 operating margin target of greater than 42%.
Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We will continue to invest in the business to drive the many significant near- and long-term growth opportunities we see in our derisk portfolio and rich pipeline. We also continue to execute on our business development strategy, including our announced acquisition of Acceleron. We will pursue additional value-enhancing and strategic business development opportunities, and we retain significant balance sheet capacity to do so.  
We remain committed to the dividend with the goal of increasing it over time. To the extent we have excess cash, we will return it to shareholders through share repurchases. 
To conclude, Merck continues to make exceptional progress on its commitment to drive growth and value for patients and shareholders. We remain in a position of financial and operational strength, which will enable us to deliver on that promise now and well into the future. 
With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Dean."

It is a pleasure to be here to provide a summary of progress made since our last quarter call. I will provide an update on our oral antiviral candidate, molnupiravir, highlight the proposed Acceleron acquisitio",1596,"Thank you, Caroline. Good morning, everyone. It is a pleasure to be here to provide a summary of progress made since our last quarter call. I will provide an update on our oral antiviral candidate, molnupiravir, highlight the proposed Acceleron acquisition, spotlight some recent progress with islatravir and finish with the synopsis of notable regulatory milestones and clinical updates from across the pipeline.  
The need for additional treatment options remains key in combating the COVID-19 pandemic. Interim analysis from  MOVe-OUT, our Phase III study evaluating molnupiravir in at-risk, nonhospitalized patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 showed an approximately 50% reduction in the risk of hospitalization or death compared to placebo. 
Of note, through day 29, no deaths were reported in patients who received molnupiravir compared to 8 deaths on placebo. This is the first oral antiviral for a respiratory virus to demonstrate benefits based on robust clinical outcomes and the first to show a meaningful 5-day window for therapeutic intervention after symptoms onset.  
Based on these positive results and at the recommendation of the Independent Data Monitoring Committee and in consultation with the FDA, recruitment into the study was stopped early. In light of these findings and given the urgency to address the pandemic, our teams worked tirelessly to submit a robust package to the FDA for EUA within 10 days of receiving data. We look forward to discussing the EUA submission at an upcoming meeting of the Antimicrobial Drugs Advisory Committee scheduled for November 30. And in the interim, we continue to engage with the FDA to support its review.
Applications have also been submitted to multiple regulatory agencies around the world. I do wish to take a moment to thank the investigators, patients and their families for their participation in the MOVe-OUT study. I am also grateful to our collaborators at Emory University, Ridgeback and Merck's internal teams for the incredible work done in conducting this program during a very challenging time.  
A comprehensive vaccination strategy remains the best sustainable means to confront this COVID-19 pandemic. Timely intervention following symptoms onset with an oral agent that can be self-administered at home may provide an additional meaningful option for patients, health care systems and public health, which could make a significant and positive impact on the pandemic.
Based on a valuable viral sequence data, molnupiravir showed consistent efficacy against the gamma, delta and new COVID-19 variant. As a reminder, we continue to actively recruit participants in the MOVe-AHEAD trial, which is evaluating the safety and efficacy of molnupiravir and preventing the spread of COVID-19 within households as a post-exposure prophylactic with a planned readout in the spring of 2022.
Now turning to the proposed Acceleron acquisition. Acceleron has an excellent scientific pedigree, which has yielded important treatment for anemia in adult patients with certain rare blood disorders. Their lead clinical candidate, sotatercept, has the potential to be a foundational asset as an add-on therapy for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension and provide a complementary addition to our growing cardiovascular pipeline. As such, following the close of the deal, our strategy would be to advance the wide-ranging Phase III clinical program. 
Now on to the portfolio and pipeline, starting with HIV. We continue to generate clinical data that reinforces the foundational potential islatravir and HIV. At the European AIDS Conference in London this week, we presented data from the Phase II study evaluating doravirine and islatravir in previously untreated adults with HIV infections, which demonstrated continued maintenance of viral suppression through 144 weeks. We also recently reported positive top line results from 2 pivotal trials evaluating a once-daily oral regimen of doravirine and islatravir in a SWITCH setting in adults with HIV infection, who are virologically suppressed on other HIV therapy regimen.  
At 48 weeks, both trials met their primary efficacy endpoint for percentage of participants with levels of HIV RNA greater than or equal to 50 copies per milliliter, demonstrating comparable efficacy with those receiving the comparator antiretroviral therapy. We plan to present these findings at upcoming medical congress and incorporate the data into global regulatory submission.
This week, we also announced the start of a Phase II clinical study evaluating a once-weekly oral combination of islatravir and lenacapavir in people living with HIV, who are virologically suppressed on an antiretroviral therapy. We have made great progress in our collaboration with Gilead and look forward to reporting our future developments, including our long-acting injectable co-formulation. 
Next, on to VAXNEUVANCE.  We received a positive opinion for VAXNEUVANCE from the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use in individuals 18 years of age and older. And more recently, in the U.S., the CDC's ACIP unanimously to provisionally recommend VAXNEUVANCE followed by PNEUMOVAX as an option for pneumococcal vaccination in adults 65 years and older as well as for adults aged 19 to 64 with certain underlying medical conditions with both patient populations being studied in our clinical trials.
Vaccine performance is multidimensional and includes eliciting a strong immune response as well as providing coverage for important disease serotype. Our 2-dose regimen accomplishes the best of both by eliciting a robust immune response across the 15 serotypes in VAXNEUVANCE, including serotype-3, as well as providing the broadest serotype coverage among current pneumococcal vaccine options, of which 4 that are unique to PNEUMOVAX. 
Furthermore, VAXNEUVANCE has the most extensive clinical development program of the newly-licensed TCV. This includes completed or ongoing evaluations among those with certain chronic or an immune-compromised conditions that increase the susceptibility to and severity of pneumococcal disease.
We also announced positive top line results for VAXNEUVANCE from the pivotal PNEU-PED study, evaluating immunogenicity, safety and tolerability in the pediatric setting and have submitted an application to the FDA. Evidence indicates the incorporation of serotypes 22F and 33F as well as strong immunogenicity against serotype 3 has the potential to play an important role in the prevention of pneumococcal disease in infants and children. These 3 serotypes represent more than 1/4 of all cases of invasive disease in children under the age of 5. We will present full results at an upcoming scientific congress.
And finally, to oncology. The rich flow of data from our clinical development programs across tumor types continue. We maintain momentum in the development of new treatment options for women's cancer with the approval of KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab for recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer based on data from KEYNOTE-826. This study showed a meaningful 36% reduction in the risk of death. This is the first anti-PD-1 combination treatment option for patients in the first-line setting and together with our industry-leading human papillomavirus vaccine, GARDASIL and GARDASIL 9, we are uniquely positioned to address certain unmet needs in cervical cancer with a focus on both prevention and treatment.  
At ESMO in September, we presented final results from KEYNOTE-355, our study of KEYTRUDA, in combination with chemotherapy for advanced triple-negative breast cancer, which showed a reduction in the risk of death by 27%. KEYTRUDA is the only immuno-oncology agent approved in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. This, along with additional data presented across endometrial and ovarian cancers, reinforces the remarkable progress being made in our broad women's cancer portfolio. 
We are also making inroads in new cancer types, including prostate cancer. With our partners at AstraZeneca, we announced positive results from the Phase III PROpel study for the frontline treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. This study demonstrated that Lynparza, in combination with abiraterone, significantly delayed disease progression regardless of biomarker status. Lynparza is the first PARP inhibitor to demonstrate clinical benefit in radiographic progression-free survival in combination with a new hormonal agent in this setting.  
We are encouraged by this study and the potential to help the increasing number of men diagnosed with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and submitted to regulatory authorities globally.  
Next, to renal cell carcinoma, which represents an important area of expansion. In August, we received FDA approval for WELIREG, a first-in-class HIF-2 alpha inhibitor therapy for the treatment of adult patients with Von Hippel-Lindau disease, who require therapy for associated renal cell carcinoma, central nervous system, hemangioblastomas or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, not requiring immediate surgery.
This approval provides us a [indiscernible] as we evaluate WELIREG potential and broader RCC indications and beyond. Also in RCC, in partnership with Eisai, following FDA priority review, we received approval for the combination of KEYTRUDA and Lenvima in the frontline setting based on results from the KEYNOTE-581 trial. This brings forth an important new first-line treatment option for patients with advanced RCC. We are also rapidly expanding programs into earlier lines of therapy.
During the quarter, the FDA granted priority review for our application for KEYTRUDA as an adjuvant therapy for patients with RCC at intermediate high or high risk of recurring following nephrectomy, or following nephrectomy and resection of metastatic lesions from the KEYNOTE-564 study. 
Additionally, we received priority review for KEYTRUDA for the treatment of patients with surgically resected high-risk Stage 2 melanoma based on results from the KEYNOTE-716 study that showed an improvement in recurrence-free survival compared to placebo. Both of these studies demonstrates the benefit of expanding the use of KEYTRUDA to earlier stages of disease, allowing us to extend treatment benefits to more patients sooner. We look forward to a decision on both studies by the end of the year. 
To conclude, I am proud of the progress across our broad pipeline and look forward to providing further updates on our scientific progress in the future. Now I turn the call back to Peter."

In relationship to the clinical data, I think most people recognize that in the interim analysis, we had a profound reduction in hospitalization or death compared to placebo, and it was stopped early in -- by the guidance of the DSMB and in consultation with the FDA.
And in that interim analysis, the incidence of any adverse effect was comparable in both molnupiravir and placebo. And actually, if you look, there are a few subjects in the molnupiravir group who discontinued therapy due to an adverse event compared to the placebo group.
In relationship to our confidence in the safety profile based on our extensive preclinical evaluation, I think it's important to recognize that molnupiravir is a nucleoside analog that functions by creating errors in the genetic material of RNA viruses. These nucleoside analogs are often used in many other antiviral treatments, including HIV and hepatitis. And we have done a comprehensive nonclinical program to characterize the safety profile of molnupiravir.
It's been written by other people. There's actually been written in the sort of scientific journals as well, and we will be presenting all of this data, I believe, in the AdCom that the FDA will be holding. But probably the most important pieces of information is the -- in 2 distinct in vivo rodent mutagenicity assay, commonly called the Big Blue and the Big A, which are well characterized and considered to provide a robust measure of the ability of a drug or chemical to induce mutations in vivo. 
In these studies, we're administering molnupiravir for longer and higher doses than those employed in the human clinical trial. And the totality of the data from these studies indicate that molnupiravir is not mutagenic or genotoxic in these in vivo mammalian systems. Now we have shared these results throughout with the regulatory agencies worldwide, and we'll continue to provide additional data as this process continues."

Just in relation to supply, it strikes me, given some of the published improvements in manufacturing and the 4-gram per patient dose, the 20 million looks like a very conservative estimate, given particularly the inclusion of third parties, what could be achieved given the dosing and the API. I'd like you to comment, please, on where you think the 2022 real supply could be? And then second, perhaps you could just comment on the appetite of Merck to use direct-to-consumer advertising or other promotion on molnupiravir. I understand that promotion and advertising is allowed under an EUA, if you could confirm or deny that would be great."

And as we have mentioned, that we have line of sight and we will, at a minimum, double that in 2022. So to your question, we're going to do everything we can to increase the supply for this product. In addition, we have voluntary license partners you have seen, and we also have a number of partners that we're working with to provide global supply. So rest assured, Andrew, we're going to try to do everything on the supply front. 
On direct-to-consumer, I think it's a little bit early for us on that. We have not made a decision around that. We are really focused on doing everything we can to sign up agreements with governments, get the product available globally, and we'll be providing additional information as we go forward on molnupiravir, but this is our #1 priority for the company, and it's something that we're really looking forward to trying to help address the pandemic going forward."

And there's going to be an endemic phase, and potentially, there could be other phases after that. 
But for the pandemic phase, I just want to emphasize, we have the MOVe-OUT trial, and then we'll have to see the potential in the MOVe-AHEAD to see whether we both have a treatment and prophylaxis.
In the endemic phase, when the pandemic somewhat recedes, it's highly likely that SARS-CoV-2 will become an endemic infection. And we all have to recognize and it's related to the previous question, during this phase, there will be a large reservoir of individuals across the globe with high copy number of viruses in many of these individuals that may lead to a constant brewing of variance.
So this question of resistance becomes very important. It is important to emphasize that molnupiravir has an extremely high barrier to resistance. It has broad efficacy across all SARS-CoV-2 variants to date. And in our preclinical studies and preclinical studies of others, it not only has a broad efficacy across SARS-CoV-2 variants, but a broad variety of RNA viruses and probably the broadest than all other current mechanisms that we know being developed. 
I should emphasize this high barrier to resistance is critically important, both in the pandemic and the endemic phase as has been highlighted, and I need to emphasize for this reason, we prioritize molnupiravir over our other programs, including an internal protease inhibitor given the paramount importance we place on ensuring the highest barrier to resistance given where we are in the world right now."

So we are comfortable with that $5 billion to $7 billion range through '22. And just to reemphasize, the numbers based on the agreements signed, those in line of sight and others that have high probability of execution. 
A couple of other things, as we've mentioned and Rob reiterated, we will produce 10 million courses of therapy by the end of '21 and have committed to at least doubling that in '22. Our focus initially are as important that it's on the treatment with COVID-19. And you mentioned the broad global access, which does come with global tiered pricing around the world, and that's an important aspect that the pricing will be tiered based on affordability measures. If our post-exposure prophylactic trial is successful, as Dean was highlighting, with an expected readout in spring, there is potential upside to these estimates.
Furthermore, throughout 2022, we do not assume, to your question, all of the supply is used. As such, we have the ability to fulfill additional demand. We also do assume that there will be other oral antivirals in the market, and we'll have to see how that unfolds.

In relationship to the adults, the critical issue for us in relationship to [indiscernible] is that we, as I said in the prepared comments, I think it's very important to give the best coverage in terms of serotypes, but not just by immunogenicity, by actually studying clinical events, especially in those patients who are compromised or at risk or have some other condition that might increase their susceptibility to have invasive pneumococcal disease.
And we think that clinical data and the way that we've studied it in these patient populations directly. We have not extrapolated from immunogenicity.

Oncology continues to have just multiple shots on goal both with KEYTRUDA and a growing number of new mechanisms. We've highlighted that.

And I first want to make sure that we really continue to emphasize that oncology we see is really data driven. And the importance of strong clinical data, and I think you have seen that position us well, and also the wall of data that we've established with a product like KEYTRUDA with 33 indications right now and just the familiarity and the growth that we're seeing across so many different cancer types that I was highlighting, we feel we're very well positioned.  We also think that the regulatory role for new entrants increases with additional KEYTRUDA approvals. And as physicians continuing to gain experience, we think that also you would have to have a broader structural change, would be required in the U.S. to adopt broadly. 
So our view is we'll continue to monitor the competitive landscape, as we always do, but we feel very confident in KEYTRUDA and our growth prospects going forward."

First, I want to thank and recognize our Merck employees across the globe for their hard work and dedication with the pandemic. The way we've been able to execute, really, I think shows the best of who we are, and I couldn't be more proud across all elements of our business, clinically, commercially, manufacturing, it's really phenomenal. So I do want to first recognize them because I think that's important. 
And hopefully, what you took from the call is this is an exciting time at Merck. We really have growing momentum and I can tell you, growing confidence that we have the ability to grow not only in the near term, but a growing portfolio of assets that set us up to sustainably be an important contributor to human health and to continue to deliver significant value for our shareholders.
We're a more focused company. We're a faster-growing company. We're working with urgency to achieve our mission and deliver for patients and shareholders. So hopefully, that came through. And I'm also quite pleased with the amount of progress we've made in a short period of time. You've heard today good developments across businesses, but development -- good developments and delivering an incredibly strong quarter, moving fast with what we're doing with molnupiravir, great results coming with islatravir and our broader oncology portfolio. So we're firing on all cylinders, and I'm confident and proud of where we are, and I thank you for your time."
