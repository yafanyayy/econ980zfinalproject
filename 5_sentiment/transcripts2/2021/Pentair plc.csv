Please turn to Slide #4, titled Executive Summary. I would first like to say how proud I am of the entire Pentair organization and the contributions everyone made to help deliver on our commitments to all of our stakeholders in a uniquely challenging year. Our teams navigated this unprecedented environment, and I believe that our company will emerge stronger as a result.
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all of our global channel partners and suppliers for their patience and efforts in working with us and our consumers to meet our commitments despite the effects of the ongoing pandemic.
We are pleased to deliver 2% sales growth and 5% adjusted EPS growth for the year. We generated over $500 million in free cash flow and returned over $275 million to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks. While navigating this uncertain environment and making sure employees and customers were as safe as possible, we continue to invest in our top growth priorities through digital transformation, innovation and technology. During the year, we successfully launched both the Pentair Home and Pentair Dealer apps. We also launched a brand redesign of the pentair.com website allowing for better cross-functional use and microsite enablement based on feedback on how people want to interface with us.
We also were able to fill out our management team by hiring Bob as our new CFO, Mario is the new leader for Consumer Solutions, Steve is our Chief Supply Chain Officer and appointing Jerome Pedretti as our IoT segment leader.
We have been busy building out capabilities throughout the organization, including adding over 100 IoT engineers in 2020 and to drive connected solutions for consumers and for our OEM customers.
We introduced new products like freshpoint and Easy Flow in our residential POU category. Our connected Solutions salt sensor for installed water softeners, advanced our leading sustainable gas solutions offering to recover and reuse methane and CO2 as well as introduced our brew assist digital services to remotely optimize our beer membrane solutions. By the end of 2021, we expect to have over 20 new IoT products in the pipeline as we continue to move our Consumer Solutions platform to Smart Solutions.
We also made great strides in advancing our ESG stewardship. Most recently importing our General Counsel, Karla Robertson, to the additional role of Chief Social Responsibility Officer. We recently completed a comprehensive ESG assessment to identify key topics of importance to our shareholders, customers, suppliers, employees and communities. We are planning to announce specific targets, including science-based environmental targets in 2021 to further advance our social responsibility goals and progress.
We have spent the past few years repositioning our portfolio and making investments to build out the Pentair brand and create a better experience for consumers to help solve their water treatment needs. While we benefited from a residential focused portfolio in 2020, we believe that the momentum will carry into 2021 and beyond.
I would now like to turn the call over to Bob to discuss our performance and our financial results in more detail, after which I'll provide an update on our overall strategic position."

During the fourth quarter, we delivered sales growth of 5% and core sales growth of 3%. On a core basis, Consumer Solutions was up 8% while Industrial and Flow technology declined 3%. I will discuss the details for each segment on the subsequent slides.
Segment income was flat, while adjusted EPS increased 3%. Our tax rate was 14%, while net interest came in at $5 million. Price improved from the third quarter. Productivity did not read out in the quarter due to the fact that we paid bonuses this year and we continue to see some of our facilities disrupted with higher absenteeism due to COVID.
Please turn to Slide 6, labeled Full Year 2020 Pentair performance. Given the unusual timing of 2020 by quarter, we thought it would be helpful to look at the full year results to better appreciate the progress we were able to make in these challenging times. For the full year, core sales increased 1%, with Consumer Solutions growing 7% and Industrial & Flow Technologies declining 6%. Segment income was flat for the year, while adjusted EPS grew 5%. Price and Productivity mostly offset inflation. But as we highlighted in the third quarter, the robust growth in pool led to higher than usual rebate activity that lowered price. We expect price and productivity to offset inflation going forward. Given the challenges that we faced in 2020, we were very pleased to deliver overall growth while still investing for the future. 
Please turn to Slide 7, labeled Q4 2020 Consumer Solutions performance. Momentum for consumer Solutions in the third quarter carried over into the fourth quarter. For the quarter, sales grew 10%, segment income increased 9%, and return on sales was essentially flat. Considering the challenges the team faced in the first half of the year, the fourth quarter performance was a strong close to a remarkable year, and we believe validation for the growth prospects of the segment's portfolio of businesses.
Pool experienced tremendous growth of 15% in the fourth quarter and slightly above that for the full year. The total pool industry received significant tailwinds from the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced consumers to stay at home and increase their desire to invest in their backyards. This trend has continued into 2021 as demand for new pools and pool maintenance remains strong. We believe the business enters 2021 with strong momentum.
While the market dynamics assisted in the growth of the pool business, this could not have been achieved, have there not been previous focused on increasing dealers and driving new products into the industry. That strategy allowed pool to reap the benefit of the remarkable growth in 2020.
This past year, we spent time building the foundation of data analytics, specifically around the performance of dealers and channels. This advancement allows the leaders in the business to better dissect the areas where the business is winning and where there are opportunities to improve. Specific plans are being developed down to the individual dealer to accelerate growth in core product areas. The data shows there is still growth potential in the core, even though the business has seen significant historical growth.
Water treatment grew 4% in the quarter, with strong residential growth being offset by continued weakness in Commercial. In particular, we saw the second consecutive quarter of growth in China, which we believe is a positive sign that the markets hit earliest by the pandemic have stabilized and are showing potential signs of a sustained recovery.
Residential components posted high single-digit growth with strength in all geographies and product lines. We saw very strong growth in our key valves product line, which is a positive indicator for overall industry growth. We launched the Flex connected valve during the quarter and are seeing early signs of market acceptance. We believe the overall North American industry as well as Europe continues to benefit from consumer focus on in home water quality. Our Residential Systems and Services businesses both delivered strong double-digit growth as our investments to build out these businesses are beginning to read through.
We had 2 new product launches during the quarter. Our salt level sensor and the fresh point easy flow point-of-use filtration system for existing faucets.
In addition, we recently announced the acquisition of Roche, which builds out our point-of-use product offering and complements our already strong point of entry portfolio. Equally important, we believe Roche's product offerings allow Pentair to participate in an even more meaningful way to help tackle the growing challenge of single-use plastic bottled water and its impact on the environment.
Our Commercial Systems business was down low double digits in the quarter, but this was an improvement from the third quarter performance and the sharp drop off we experienced in the second quarter when many of our customers were forced to close due to shelter-in-place requirements. While our sales in this profitable product line have been down for 3 consecutive quarters, we are mildly encouraged that we have been outperforming the market. We attribute this in part to our strong cartridge replacements, mix of business and also finding new business opportunities, such as our total water management program we discussed last quarter. While we have one more tough comparison in the first quarter, we expect Commercial Systems to continue its recovery in 2021. 
Please turn to Slide 8, labeled Q4 2020 Industrial & Flow Technologies performance. Industrial & Flow Technologies, or IFT, saw sales decline 1% as residential and irrigation flow delivered double-digit growth in the quarter, while the other 2 businesses continued to be negatively impacted by a global freeze in capital spending. Segment income decreased 22%, and return on sales declined 280 basis points to 10.6%. Productivity was challenged in the quarter, principally as a function of a mix with lower margin backlog in addition to lower revenue spread across a higher fixed cost base. IFP has also begun some notable activities aimed at reducing complexity and reducing costs, which include the discontinuation of several product lines.
Residential & Irrigation Flow grew 12% in the quarter, following 6% growth last quarter this business normally does not experience strong demand in the fourth quarter, but similar to our other residential facing businesses and consumer solutions, there was broad-based demand for residential and irrigation following the slowdown in demand experienced during the second quarter. We saw all product lines contribute to the strong fourth quarter performance and we remain cautiously optimistic entering 2021 given channel inventory levels are still slightly below historical levels.
Commercial and Infrastructure Flow declined 9% in the quarter as the business continues to experience soft demand. The business has begun to focus more intently on complexity reduction resulting in the decision to exit several product lines. The focus within C&I remains on improving operational efficiencies, in addition to building up the backlog with higher-margin business.
Industrial filtration continued to be negatively impacted by a global capital spending freeze as seen in the 8% sales decline in the quarter. In addition to the broader capital spending freeze, many of our industrial customers have been negatively impacted due to worldwide COVID-related lockdowns. We are seeing sequential improvements, and we are starting to see some modest increases in orders exiting the quarter, resulting in an increased backlog. Encouragingly, we have begun to see an increase in orders for our sustainable gas solutions business. 
Please turn to Slide 9, labeled balance sheet and cash flow. One of the biggest positive developments in 2020 was the prodigious cash flow generation we experienced. For the full year, we generated $512 million of free cash flow, which was well north of 100% conversion for the year. One of the biggest contributors to our strong free cash flow was the linearity of pool sales in the second half and a minimal amount of early buy in the fourth quarter. This resulted in a dramatic year-over-year improvement in receivables collection.
We also showed further strengthening of the balance sheet, ending the year at 1.3x levered and the majority of our revolver are available. During the year, we returned over $275 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Last December, we announced that our Board authorized the new $750 million share repurchase authorization as there was only $100 million remaining under our prior authorization. In addition, the Board approved a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend to be paid in the first quarter. 2020 marks the 45th consecutive year that Pentair has increased its annual dividend. Our balance sheet remains in excellent shape to fund both organic and inorganic opportunities. And as always, we plan to remain disciplined with our capital. 
Please turn to Slide 10, late Q1 and full year 2021 Pentair outlook. We are initiating first quarter and full year 2020 guidance. For the first quarter, we expect sales to grow 7% to 12% and adjusted EPS to increase 6% to 21% to a range of $0.55 to $0.63. March is historically an important month for the quarter, and we are still managing through sporadic and isolated COVID-related disruptions due to the recent global spike in infection rates and are doing our best to ensure the safety of all of our employees. Below the operating line, we expect corporate expense to be approximately $16 million, net interest of $6 million to $7 million, a 15% tax rate and a share count of around $168 million. For the full year, we expect sales to grow 3% to 5%, and adjusted EPS to increase 5% to 10% to a range of $2.60 to $2.75.
We recognize that our first half has easier comparisons that become more challenged in the second half. However, we expect continued demand in our larger residential focused businesses and remain cautiously optimistic for our Commercial Water Treatment business to show improvements throughout the year. We remain focused on investing in our most attractive businesses. Below the operating line, we expect corporate expense to be around $65 million, net interest to be in a range of $20 million to $23 million, our tax rate to be around 15%, and the share count is expected to average near 166 million shares for the full year.
Capital expenditures are expected to be around $65 million, while depreciation and amortization is expected to be around $80 million. We continue to target free cash flow to be greater than or equal to net income.
I'd now like to turn the call back to John to provide an update on some of our key strategies."

As we enter 2021, our Residential busines",730,"Thank you, Bob. Please turn to Slide 11, labeled 2021 Execution Expectations. Our focus for 2021 does not change from last year as we are focused on delivering on our core while continuing to build out our future. As we enter 2021, our Residential businesses remain strong, and we are encouraged to see ongoing signs of stabilization in our commercial businesses. Although we have not yet seen indicators of year-over-year growth, we are expecting recovery likely in the tail end of 2021.
We believe that our smaller exposure to industrial capital spending will remain hindered for now. We have a long successful history of price realization across the majority of our portfolio. We will monitor closely the rapidly evolving inflation environment and respond accordingly. We are also pacing our growth investments and have the ability to modulate as needed, but we prefer to remain on offense and build on the momentum of the past 2 years. We recognize that we have opportunities to address our cost structure, particularly with an IFT, and we plan to act as appropriate.
We discussed last year the G&A benchmarking efforts we undertook and identified that we have room for improvement. We are well underway in terms of our G&A efforts that are looking closely at our overall global enablement structure. Our goal is to deliver transformation plans that we expect will drive significant ROS expansion by 2024 while funding our strategic growth initiatives.
As we look to the future, our priorities are unchanged around growing both our Pool and Water Treatment businesses. We have identified growing interest in our sustainable gas solutions business, I look forward to updating all of you in the future as we believe this business has exciting growth opportunities ahead.
We believe that pool is a long runway of continued growth. The Department of Energy regulation going into effect in mid-2021 is shifting the industry even further toward variable speed pumps, which is a category we helped to create over a decade ago. Today, nearly 60% of the pumps we sell are variable speed, while the industry adoption rate is closer to 50%. Over the next 2 years, we expect the industry, including us, to move closer to 85% as it is expected that there will still be certain parts of the industry that will be able to use single speed pumps.
We also continue to invest in our automation platform for Pool and see strong adoption of our new offerings. In addition, despite being a leading brand in the U.S. on the pool pad, when a consumer contacts us directly on pentair.com, it has not been the best experience for the consumer. We believe that there's a tremendous opportunity of engaging the consumer and curating their experience through our existing channel while also ensuring that the consumer received the experience that they desired.
Within Water Treatment, we believe there are opportunities to rapidly expand our $50 million end-to-end residential services business and to be the leader in advanced technology and connected solutions and residential point-of-use solutions through our existing technology and the acquisition of 
We also have a leading commercial food service offering that we look to expand into other segments as well as add important services for our customers.
In sustainable gas, it is merely focusing on our high-growth segment within Industrial and adding global capability to accelerate our offerings.
Finally, I wanted to touch on our approach to capital allocation, which remains unchanged. Our top priority is our commitment to our investment-grade rating. Our strong cash flows allow us to invest in our top organic growth opportunities. From an M&A perspective, we remain focused on strategic bolt-on and tuck-in deals and focused strategic priorities, like I just shared with you.
While M&A valuations remain elevated, we continue to actively build our deal pipeline and plan to remain disciplined. Finally, we are committed to returning cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and opportunistic buybacks.
We believe that Pentair has a bright outlook, and we will continue to invest for the future while delivering on our core business. Our goal remains to deliver more consistent, predictable results for our customers, the environment, our employees, and our shareholders.
I would now like to turn the call over to James for Q&A, after which I will have a few closing remarks. James, please open the line for questions. Thank you."

So I think inflation is high. I think as we enter this guidance and look at next year, we think we're balanced. Between the price, we think we can realize from the channel and where we are on the inflation pressures as we head into next year. If we need to do more, I think there's an opt to do so because I think the inflation that's hitting us will also impact the whole entire industry.

The demand to have a more consumer enabled and have that be an effortless process through ordering on the Internet. That's a shift. And we think we have an opportunity to take a look at our global cost structure. And to think about where we should put the work and where is the right person doing the right work at.

But then in '19, you obviously got a lot more price. And I think the realization of the inflation kind of hit you mid-season in 2018. So maybe just talk about like the differences in timing between now and 2018? Because this seems to be kind of like a slow-moving train that you can see from a mile away and perhaps react to it.

What I was referring to is that the '18 levels of inflation feel like that. And I do think we're out in front of the price increases because it was a slow-moving train.

It was important for us to specify mid-single-digit plus is our guidance for the pool business embedded in our overall guidance. We continue to see strong momentum as we enter the first quarter, but good natural demand. So as the year plays out, we expect obviously, stronger growth as we have weaker compares in the first half, but still a strong business in the back half as we bump up against those bigger compares.
So overall, I think we're optimistic about the growth in the pool business, and that will certainly help free cash flow as well."

I think the more important piece that we want to make sure we convey is our quarters last year represented a softer Q2 as the orders came through the distribution channel, we were not yet producing those. So we had pretty sizable Q3 and Q4 as we're catching up. And this year, if you think about the demand and the way we're meeting it in Q1 and Q2, we'll have stronger year-over-year comparisons there.
As we assess where the market is going, as we start to think beyond this pool year and the next pool year, we'll have a better understanding as we exit Q2, what the back half of the year looks like."

Julian, I promise the first part of my answer here is not a filibuster, but I want to make sure we describe that one of the reasons we're setting up these 3 strategic growth investments, two are in Consumer Solutions and one is an is we're going to disproportionately fund those with investments to drive the future. What we're going to do a better job on and sharing with you as we go forward is the value of the core, meaning take a look at the core performance, absent those incremental investments. We're getting the drop through, as you would expect. We're getting the price and productivity offset inflation, the volumes coming through at a nice flow through rate. And then we're taking the opportunity to build out a services organization in residential, in consumer Solutions, build out the front end capability and pool. And then also make sure we put the investment ahead of the likely growth opportunities in SGS.
And there's pretty substantial investment there in those 3 things, which draw down those margins for both of those 2 segments. Absent that, I think, we're pretty balanced in a more normal year. And so we'll do a better job highlighting throughout 2021, how we're doing on the core and then how these investments are starting to roll through -- rest of the question.

This is about building out a water treatment brand that people recognize that they can come in and work with Pentair to help curate their water experience. This is about customer experience, capability, more consumer related, so that we can quickly get consumers the dealer help and/or the technical support that they need to fix their particular challenges.
So it's capability, we don't have today. It's capability, we think we'll add a lot of value. And also, it's about putting more trucks on the road as far as the services in residential. But the breakeven point is roughly a year when you put the sales team in place and you put the dealers in a geography, and you wait for the return on the accrual of the annuity base.
So that's the type of investment we're making. And we pace it a little bit more in 2020 than we would have liked. And we really want to accelerate it if we can here in 2021. And so it can be modulated, but that's an example of what it is and the likely levels of it.

Please turn to Slide #4, titled Executive Summary. I would first like to say how proud I am of the entire Pentair organization and the contributions everyone made to help deliver on our commitments to all of our stakeholders in a uniquely challenging year. Our teams navigated this unprecedented environment, and I believe that our company will emerge stronger as a result.
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all of our global channel partners and suppliers for their patience and efforts in working with us and our consumers to meet our commitments despite the effects of the ongoing pandemic.
We are pleased to deliver 2% sales growth and 5% adjusted EPS growth for the year. We generated over $500 million in free cash flow and returned over $275 million to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks. While navigating this uncertain environment and making sure employees and customers were as safe as possible, we continue to invest in our top growth priorities through digital transformation, innovation and technology. During the year, we successfully launched both the Pentair Home and Pentair Dealer apps. We also launched a brand redesign of the pentair.com website allowing for better cross-functional use and microsite enablement based on feedback on how people want to interface with us.
We also were able to fill out our management team by hiring Bob as our new CFO, Mario as the new leader for Consumer Solutions, Steve as our Chief Supply Chain Officer and appointing Jerome Pedretti as our IFT segment leader. We have been busy building out capabilities throughout the organization, including adding over 100 IoT engineers in 2020 to drive connected solutions for consumers and for our OEM customers.
We introduced new products like FreshPoint and Easy Flow in our residential POU category, our Connected Solutions salt sensor for installed water softeners, advanced our leading sustainable gas solutions offering to recover and reuse methane and CO2 as well as introduced our brew assist digital services to remotely optimize our beer membrane solutions. By the end of 2021, we expect to have over 20 new IoT products in the pipeline as we continue to move our Consumer Solutions platform to Smart Solutions.
We also made great strides in advancing our ESG stewardship, most recently importing our General Counsel, Karla Robertson, to the additional role of Chief Social Responsibility Officer. We recently completed a comprehensive ESG assessment to identify key topics of importance to our shareholders, customers, suppliers, employees and communities. We are planning to announce specific targets, including science-based environmental targets, in 2021 to further advance our social responsibility goals and progress.
We have spent the past few years repositioning our portfolio and making investments to build out the Pentair brand and create a better experience for consumers to help solve their water treatment needs. While we benefited from a residential focused portfolio in 2020, we believe that the momentum will carry into 2021 and beyond.
I would now like to turn the call over to Bob to discuss our performance and our financial results in more detail, after which I'll provide an update on our overall strategic position."

Please turn to Slide 5, labeled Q4 2020 Pentair Performance. During the fourth quarter, we delivered sales growth of 5% and core sales growth of 3%. On a core basis, Consumer Solutions was up 8% while Industrial & Flow Technology declined",1760,"Thank you, John. Please turn to Slide 5, labeled Q4 2020 Pentair Performance. During the fourth quarter, we delivered sales growth of 5% and core sales growth of 3%. On a core basis, Consumer Solutions was up 8% while Industrial & Flow Technology declined 3%. I will discuss the details for each segment on the subsequent slides.
Segment income was flat, while adjusted EPS increased 3%. Our tax rate was 14%, while net interest came in at $5 million. Price improved from the third quarter. Productivity did not read out in the quarter due to the fact that we paid bonuses this year and we continued to see some of our facilities disrupted with higher absenteeism due to COVID.
Please turn to Slide 6, labeled Full Year 2020 Pentair Performance. Given the unusual timing of 2020 by quarter, we thought it would be helpful to look at the full year results to better appreciate the progress we were able to make in these challenging times. For the full year, core sales increased 1%, with Consumer Solutions growing 7% and Industrial & Flow Technologies declining 6%. Segment income was flat for the year, while adjusted EPS grew 5%. Price and productivity mostly offset inflation. But as we highlighted in the third quarter, the robust growth in pool led to higher-than-usual rebate activity that lowered price. We expect price and productivity to offset inflation going forward. Given the challenges that we faced in 2020, we were very pleased to deliver overall growth while still investing for the future. 
Please turn to Slide 7, labeled Q4 2020 Consumer Solutions performance. Momentum for Consumer Solutions in the third quarter carried over into the fourth quarter. For the quarter, sales grew 10%, segment income increased 9%, and return on sales was essentially flat. Considering the challenges the team faced in the first half of the year, the fourth quarter performance was a strong close to a remarkable year, and we believe validation for the growth prospects of the segment's portfolio of businesses.
Pool experienced tremendous growth of 15% in the fourth quarter and slightly above that for the full year. The total pool industry received significant tailwinds from the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced consumers to stay at home and increase their desire to invest in their backyards. This trend has continued into 2021 as demand for new pools and pool maintenance remains strong. We believe the business enters 2021 with strong momentum.
While the market dynamics assisted in the growth of the pool business, this could not have been achieved had there not been previous focus on increasing dealers and driving new products into the industry. That strategy allowed pool to reap the benefit of the remarkable growth in 2020.
This past year, we spent time building the foundation of data analytics, specifically around the performance of dealers and channels. This advancement allows leaders in the business to better dissect the areas where the business is winning and where there are opportunities to improve. Specific plans are being developed down to the individual dealer to accelerate growth in core product areas. The data shows there is still growth potential in the core, even though the business has seen significant historical growth.
Water treatment grew 4% in the quarter, with strong residential growth being offset by continued weakness in commercial. In particular, we saw the second consecutive quarter of growth in China, which we believe is a positive sign that the markets hit earliest by the pandemic have stabilized and are showing potential signs of a sustained recovery.
Residential components posted high single-digit growth with strength in all geographies and product lines. We saw very strong growth in our key valves product line, which is a positive indicator for overall industry growth. We launched the flat connected valve during the quarter and are seeing early signs of market acceptance. We believe the overall North American industry as well as Europe continues to benefit from consumer focus on in-home water quality. Our residential systems and services businesses both delivered strong double-digit growth as our investments to build out these businesses are beginning to read through. We had 2 new product launches during the quarter: our salt level sensor and the FreshPoint Easy Flow point-of-use filtration system for existing faucets.
In addition, we recently announced the acquisition of Rocean, which builds out our point-of-use product offering and complements our already strong point-of-entry portfolio. Equally important, we believe Rocean's product offerings allow Pentair to participate in an even more meaningful way to help tackle the growing challenge of single-use plastic bottled water and its impact on the environment.
Our commercial systems business was down low double digits in the quarter, but this was an improvement from the third quarter performance and the sharp drop off we experienced in the second quarter when many of our customers were forced to close due to shelter-in-place requirements. While our sales in this profitable product line have been down for 3 consecutive quarters, we are mildly encouraged that we have been outperforming the market. We attribute this in part to our strong cartridge replacements, mix of business and also finding new business opportunities, such as our total water management program we discussed last quarter. While we have one more tough comparison in the first quarter, we expect commercial systems to continue its recovery in 2021. 
Please turn to Slide 8, labeled Q4 2020 Industrial & Flow Technologies performance. Industrial & Flow Technologies, or IFT, saw sales decline 1% as residential and irrigation flow delivered double-digit growth in the quarter, while the other 2 businesses continued to be negatively impacted by a global freeze in capital spending. Segment income decreased 22%, and return on sales declined 280 basis points to 10.6%. Productivity was challenged in the quarter, principally as a function of a mix with lower margin backlog in addition to lower revenue spread across a higher fixed cost base. IFT has also begun some notable activities aimed at reducing complexity and reducing costs, which include the discontinuation of several product lines.
Residential and irrigation flow grew 12% in the quarter, following 6% growth last quarter. This business normally does not experience strong demand in the fourth quarter, but similar to our other residential facing businesses and consumer solutions, there was broad-based demand for residential and irrigation following the slowdown in demand experienced during the second quarter. We saw all product lines contribute to the strong fourth quarter performance, and we remain cautiously optimistic entering 2021 given channel inventory levels are still slightly below historical levels.
Commercial and Infrastructure flow declined 9% in the quarter as the business continues to experience soft demand. The business has begun to focus more intently on complexity reduction resulting in the decision to exit several product lines. The focus within C&I remains on improving operational efficiencies, in addition to building up the backlog with higher-margin business.
Industrial filtration continued to be negatively impacted by a global capital spending freeze as seen in the 8% sales decline in the quarter. In addition to the broader capital spending freeze, many of our industrial customers have been negatively impacted due to worldwide COVID-related lockdowns. We are seeing sequential improvements, and we are starting to see some modest increases in orders exiting the quarter, resulting in an increased backlog. Encouragingly, we have begun to see an increase in orders for our sustainable gas solutions business. 
Please turn to Slide 9, labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. One of the biggest positive developments in 2020 was the prodigious cash flow generation we experienced. For the full year, we generated $512 million of free cash flow, which was well north of 100% conversion for the year. One of the biggest contributors to our strong free cash flow was the linearity of pool sales in the second half and a minimal amount of early buy in the fourth quarter. This resulted in a dramatic year-over-year improvement in receivables collection.
We also showed further strengthening of the balance sheet, ending the year at 1.3x levered and the majority of our revolver available. During the year, we returned over $275 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Last December, we announced that our Board authorized a new $750 million share repurchase authorization as there was only $100 million remaining under our prior authorization. In addition, the Board approved a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend to be paid in the first quarter. 2020 marks the 45th consecutive year that Pentair has increased its annual dividend. Our balance sheet remains in excellent shape to fund both organic and inorganic opportunities. And as always, we plan to remain disciplined with our capital. 
Please turn to Slide 10, labeled Q1 and Full Year 2021 Pentair Outlook. We are initiating first quarter and full year 2020 (sic) [ 2021 ] guidance. For the first quarter, we expect sales to grow 7% to 12% and adjusted EPS to increase 6% to 21% to a range of $0.55 to $0.63. March is historically an important month for the quarter, and we are still managing through sporadic and isolated COVID-related disruptions due to the recent global spike in infection rates and are doing our best to ensure the safety of all of our employees. Below the operating line, we expect corporate expense to be approximately $16 million, net interest of $6 million to $7 million, a 15% tax rate and a share count of around 168 million. For the full year, we expect sales to grow 3% to 5% and adjusted EPS to increase 5% to 10% to a range of $2.60 to $2.75.
We recognize that our first half has easier comparisons that become more challenged in the second half. However, we expect continued demand in our larger residential focused businesses and remain cautiously optimistic for our commercial water treatment business to show improvements throughout the year. We remain focused on investing in our most attractive businesses. Below the operating line, we expect corporate expense to be around $65 million, net interest to be in a range of $20 million to $23 million, our tax rate to be around 15%, and the share count is expected to average near 166 million shares for the full year.
Capital expenditures are expected to be around $65 million, while depreciation and amortization is expected to be around $80 million. We continue to target free cash flow to be greater than or equal to net income.
I'd now like to turn the call back to John to provide an update on some of our key strategies."

Our focus for 2021 does not change from last year as we are focused on delivering on our core while continuing to build out our future. As we enter 2021, our residential businesses remain strong, and we are encouraged to see ongoing signs of stabilization in our commercial businesses. Although we have not yet seen indicators of year-over-year growth, we are expecting recovery likely in the tail end of 2021.
We believe that our smaller exposure to industrial capital spending will remain hindered for now. We have a long successful history of price realization across the majority of our portfolio. We will monitor closely the rapidly evolving inflation environment and respond accordingly. We are also pacing our growth investments and have the ability to modulate as needed, but we prefer to remain on offense and build on the momentum of the past 2 years. We recognize that we have opportunities to address our cost structure, particularly within IFT, and we plan to act as appropriate.
We discussed last year the G&A benchmarking efforts we undertook and identified that we have room for improvement. We are well underway in terms of our G&A efforts and are looking closely at our overall global enablement structure. Our goal is to deliver transformation plans that we expect will drive significant ROS expansion by 2024 while funding our strategic growth initiatives.
As we look to the future, our priorities are unchanged around growing both our pool and water treatment businesses. We have identified growing interest in our sustainable gas solutions business. I look forward to updating all of you in the future as we believe this business has exciting growth opportunities ahead.
We believe that pool has a long runway of continued growth. The Department of Energy regulation going into effect in mid-2021 is shifting the industry even further toward variable speed pumps, which is a category we helped to create over a decade ago. Today, nearly 60% of the pumps we sell are variable speed, while the industry adoption rate is closer to 50%. Over the next 2 years, we expect the industry, including us, to move closer to 85% as it is expected that there will still be certain parts of the industry that will be able to use single speed pumps.
We also continue to invest in our automation platform for pool and see strong adoption of our new offerings. In addition, despite being a leading brand in the U.S. on the pool pad, when a consumer contacts us directly on pentair.com, it has not been the best experience for the consumer. We believe that there's a tremendous opportunity of engaging the consumer and curating their experience through our existing channel while also ensuring that the consumer received the experience that they desired.
Within water treatment, we believe there are opportunities to rapidly expand our $50 million end-to-end residential services business and to be the leader in advanced technology and connected solutions and residential point-of-use solutions through our existing technology and the acquisition of Rocean.
We also have a leading commercial foodservice offering that we look to expand into other segments as well as add important services for our customers.
In sustainable gas, it is merely focusing on our high-growth segment within Industrial and adding global capability to accelerate our offerings.
Finally, I wanted to touch on our approach to capital allocation, which remains unchanged. Our top priority is our commitment to our investment-grade rating. Our strong cash flows allow us to invest in our top organic growth opportunities. From an M&A perspective, we remain focused on strategic bolt-on and tuck-in deals and focused strategic priorities, like I just shared with you.
While M&A valuations remain elevated, we continue to actively build our deal pipeline and plan to remain disciplined. Finally, we are committed to returning cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and opportunistic buybacks.
We believe that Pentair has a bright outlook, and we will continue to invest for the future while delivering on our core business. Our goal remains to deliver more consistent, predictable results for our customers, the environment, our employees, and our shareholders.
I would now like to turn the call over to James for Q&A, after which I will have a few closing remarks. James, please open the line for questions. Thank you."

So I think inflation is high.

I mean we've all learned that some of our people are now able to work virtually or work from home, and we don't need all of the necessary facilities we have. But at the same time, we want to create workspaces and collaboration centers for our businesses to work with customers and work with dealers on.
So this is going to be a fairly sizable transformation. I think in 2021, as I said, not expecting a lot other than the planning elements of this. And then we expect significant contributions in 2022 and beyond, beyond G&A even as the sales and marketing resources also get more effective and efficient."

So if I pick my own area of FP&A as an example, I have big businesses like pool that probably drive their own kind of FP&A piece.

That goes to data analytics as well. So those are the type of things that we're thinking through."

I think the more important piece that we want to make sure we convey is our quarters last year represented a softer Q2, as the orders came through the distribution channel, we were not yet producing those. So we had pretty sizable Q3 and Q4 as we're catching up. And this year, if you think about the demand and the way we're meeting it in Q1 and Q2, we'll have stronger year-over-year comparisons there.

Julian, I promise the first part of my answer here is not a filibuster, but I want to make sure we describe that one of the reasons we're setting up these 3 strategic growth investments, 2 are in Consumer Solutions and 1 is in IFT is we're going to disproportionately fund those with investments to drive the future. What we're going to do a better job on and sharing with you as we go forward is the value of the core, meaning, take a look at the core performance absent those incremental investments. We're getting the drop through, as you would expect. We're getting the price and productivity offset inflation, the volumes coming through at a nice flow through rate. And then we're taking the opportunity to build out a services organization in residential, in Consumer Solutions, build out the front end capability and pool. And then also make sure we put the investment ahead of the likely growth opportunities in SGS.
And there's pretty substantial investment there in those 3 things, which draw down those margins for both of those 2 segments. Absent that, I think, we're pretty balanced and more normal year.

And right now, what's happening is these contractors or these dealers are really busy. So they're not always able to get to them.

Please turn to Slide #4, titled Executive Summary. I would first like to say how proud I am of the entire Pentair organization and the contributions everyone made to help deliver on our commitments to all of our stakeholders in a uniquely challenging year. Our teams navigated this unprecedented environment, and I believe that our company will emerge stronger as a result.
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all of our global channel partners and suppliers for their patience and efforts in working with us and our consumers to meet our commitments despite the effects of the ongoing pandemic.
We are pleased to deliver 2% sales growth and 5% adjusted EPS growth for the year. We generated over $500 million in free cash flow and returned over $275 million to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks. While navigating this uncertain environment and making sure employees and customers were as safe as possible, we continue to invest in our top growth priorities through digital transformation, innovation and technology. During the year, we successfully launched both the Pentair Home and Pentair Dealer apps. We also launched a brand redesign of the pentair.com website allowing for better cross-functional use and microsite enablement based on feedback on how people want to interface with us.
We also were able to fill out our management team by hiring Bob as our new CFO, Mario as the new leader for Consumer Solutions, Steve as our Chief Supply Chain Officer and appointing Jerome Pedretti as our IFT segment leader. We have been busy building out capabilities throughout the organization, including adding over 100 IoT engineers in 2020 to drive connected solutions for consumers and for our OEM customers.
We introduced new products like FreshPoint and Easy Flow in our residential POU category, our Connected Solutions salt sensor for installed water softeners, advanced our leading sustainable gas solutions offering to recover and reuse methane and CO2 as well as introduced our brew assist digital services to remotely optimize our beer membrane solutions. By the end of 2021, we expect to have over 20 new IoT products in the pipeline as we continue to move our Consumer Solutions platform to Smart Solutions.
We also made great strides in advancing our ESG stewardship, most recently importing our General Counsel, Karla Robertson, to the additional role of Chief Social Responsibility Officer. We recently completed a comprehensive ESG assessment to identify key topics of importance to our shareholders, customers, suppliers, employees and communities. We are planning to announce specific targets, including science-based environmental targets, in 2021 to further advance our social responsibility goals and progress.
We have spent the past few years repositioning our portfolio and making investments to build out the Pentair brand and create a better experience for consumers to help solve their water treatment needs. While we benefited from a residential focused portfolio in 2020, we believe that the momentum will carry into 2021 and beyond.
I would now like to turn the call over to Bob to discuss our performance and our financial results in more detail, after which I'll provide an update on our overall strategic position."
295688,700922866,2218873,"Pentair plc, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2021",2021-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Pentair plc","Executives","Thank you, John. Please turn to Slide 5, labeled Q4 2020 Pentair Performance. During the fourth quarter, we delivered sales growth of 5% and core sales growth of 3%. On a core basis, Consumer Solutions was up 8% while Industrial & Flow Technology declined",1760,"Thank you, John. Please turn to Slide 5, labeled Q4 2020 Pentair Performance. During the fourth quarter, we delivered sales growth of 5% and core sales growth of 3%. On a core basis, Consumer Solutions was up 8% while Industrial & Flow Technology declined 3%. I will discuss the details for each segment on the subsequent slides.
Segment income was flat, while adjusted EPS increased 3%. Our tax rate was 14%, while net interest came in at $5 million. Price improved from the third quarter. Productivity did not read out in the quarter due to the fact that we paid bonuses this year and we continued to see some of our facilities disrupted with higher absenteeism due to COVID.
Please turn to Slide 6, labeled Full Year 2020 Pentair Performance. Given the unusual timing of 2020 by quarter, we thought it would be helpful to look at the full year results to better appreciate the progress we were able to make in these challenging times. For the full year, core sales increased 1%, with Consumer Solutions growing 7% and Industrial & Flow Technologies declining 6%. Segment income was flat for the year, while adjusted EPS grew 5%. Price and productivity mostly offset inflation. But as we highlighted in the third quarter, the robust growth in pool led to higher-than-usual rebate activity that lowered price. We expect price and productivity to offset inflation going forward. Given the challenges that we faced in 2020, we were very pleased to deliver overall growth while still investing for the future. 
Please turn to Slide 7, labeled Q4 2020 Consumer Solutions performance. Momentum for Consumer Solutions in the third quarter carried over into the fourth quarter. For the quarter, sales grew 10%, segment income increased 9%, and return on sales was essentially flat. Considering the challenges the team faced in the first half of the year, the fourth quarter performance was a strong close to a remarkable year, and we believe validation for the growth prospects of the segment's portfolio of businesses.
Pool experienced tremendous growth of 15% in the fourth quarter and slightly above that for the full year. The total pool industry received significant tailwinds from the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced consumers to stay at home and increase their desire to invest in their backyards. This trend has continued into 2021 as demand for new pools and pool maintenance remains strong. We believe the business enters 2021 with strong momentum.
While the market dynamics assisted in the growth of the pool business, this could not have been achieved had there not been previous focus on increasing dealers and driving new products into the industry. That strategy allowed pool to reap the benefit of the remarkable growth in 2020.
This past year, we spent time building the foundation of data analytics, specifically around the performance of dealers and channels. This advancement allows leaders in the business to better dissect the areas where the business is winning and where there are opportunities to improve. Specific plans are being developed down to the individual dealer to accelerate growth in core product areas. The data shows there is still growth potential in the core, even though the business has seen significant historical growth.
Water treatment grew 4% in the quarter, with strong residential growth being offset by continued weakness in commercial. In particular, we saw the second consecutive quarter of growth in China, which we believe is a positive sign that the markets hit earliest by the pandemic have stabilized and are showing potential signs of a sustained recovery.
Residential components posted high single-digit growth with strength in all geographies and product lines. We saw very strong growth in our key valves product line, which is a positive indicator for overall industry growth. We launched the flat connected valve during the quarter and are seeing early signs of market acceptance. We believe the overall North American industry as well as Europe continues to benefit from consumer focus on in-home water quality. Our residential systems and services businesses both delivered strong double-digit growth as our investments to build out these businesses are beginning to read through. We had 2 new product launches during the quarter: our salt level sensor and the FreshPoint Easy Flow point-of-use filtration system for existing faucets.
In addition, we recently announced the acquisition of Rocean, which builds out our point-of-use product offering and complements our already strong point-of-entry portfolio. Equally important, we believe Rocean's product offerings allow Pentair to participate in an even more meaningful way to help tackle the growing challenge of single-use plastic bottled water and its impact on the environment.
Our commercial systems business was down low double digits in the quarter, but this was an improvement from the third quarter performance and the sharp drop off we experienced in the second quarter when many of our customers were forced to close due to shelter-in-place requirements. While our sales in this profitable product line have been down for 3 consecutive quarters, we are mildly encouraged that we have been outperforming the market. We attribute this in part to our strong cartridge replacements, mix of business and also finding new business opportunities, such as our total water management program we discussed last quarter. While we have one more tough comparison in the first quarter, we expect commercial systems to continue its recovery in 2021. 
Please turn to Slide 8, labeled Q4 2020 Industrial & Flow Technologies performance. Industrial & Flow Technologies, or IFT, saw sales decline 1% as residential and irrigation flow delivered double-digit growth in the quarter, while the other 2 businesses continued to be negatively impacted by a global freeze in capital spending. Segment income decreased 22%, and return on sales declined 280 basis points to 10.6%. Productivity was challenged in the quarter, principally as a function of a mix with lower margin backlog in addition to lower revenue spread across a higher fixed cost base. IFT has also begun some notable activities aimed at reducing complexity and reducing costs, which include the discontinuation of several product lines.
Residential and irrigation flow grew 12% in the quarter, following 6% growth last quarter. This business normally does not experience strong demand in the fourth quarter, but similar to our other residential facing businesses and consumer solutions, there was broad-based demand for residential and irrigation following the slowdown in demand experienced during the second quarter. We saw all product lines contribute to the strong fourth quarter performance, and we remain cautiously optimistic entering 2021 given channel inventory levels are still slightly below historical levels.
Commercial and Infrastructure flow declined 9% in the quarter as the business continues to experience soft demand. The business has begun to focus more intently on complexity reduction resulting in the decision to exit several product lines. The focus within C&I remains on improving operational efficiencies, in addition to building up the backlog with higher-margin business.
Industrial filtration continued to be negatively impacted by a global capital spending freeze as seen in the 8% sales decline in the quarter. In addition to the broader capital spending freeze, many of our industrial customers have been negatively impacted due to worldwide COVID-related lockdowns. We are seeing sequential improvements, and we are starting to see some modest increases in orders exiting the quarter, resulting in an increased backlog. Encouragingly, we have begun to see an increase in orders for our sustainable gas solutions business. 
Please turn to Slide 9, labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. One of the biggest positive developments in 2020 was the prodigious cash flow generation we experienced. For the full year, we generated $512 million of free cash flow, which was well north of 100% conversion for the year. One of the biggest contributors to our strong free cash flow was the linearity of pool sales in the second half and a minimal amount of early buy in the fourth quarter. This resulted in a dramatic year-over-year improvement in receivables collection.
We also showed further strengthening of the balance sheet, ending the year at 1.3x levered and the majority of our revolver available. During the year, we returned over $275 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Last December, we announced that our Board authorized a new $750 million share repurchase authorization as there was only $100 million remaining under our prior authorization. In addition, the Board approved a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend to be paid in the first quarter. 2020 marks the 45th consecutive year that Pentair has increased its annual dividend. Our balance sheet remains in excellent shape to fund both organic and inorganic opportunities. And as always, we plan to remain disciplined with our capital. 
Please turn to Slide 10, labeled Q1 and Full Year 2021 Pentair Outlook. We are initiating first quarter and full year 2020 (sic) [ 2021 ] guidance. For the first quarter, we expect sales to grow 7% to 12% and adjusted EPS to increase 6% to 21% to a range of $0.55 to $0.63. March is historically an important month for the quarter, and we are still managing through sporadic and isolated COVID-related disruptions due to the recent global spike in infection rates and are doing our best to ensure the safety of all of our employees. Below the operating line, we expect corporate expense to be approximately $16 million, net interest of $6 million to $7 million, a 15% tax rate and a share count of around 168 million. For the full year, we expect sales to grow 3% to 5% and adjusted EPS to increase 5% to 10% to a range of $2.60 to $2.75.
We recognize that our first half has easier comparisons that become more challenged in the second half. However, we expect continued demand in our larger residential focused businesses and remain cautiously optimistic for our commercial water treatment business to show improvements throughout the year. We remain focused on investing in our most attractive businesses. Below the operating line, we expect corporate expense to be around $65 million, net interest to be in a range of $20 million to $23 million, our tax rate to be around 15%, and the share count is expected to average near 166 million shares for the full year.
Capital expenditures are expected to be around $65 million, while depreciation and amortization is expected to be around $80 million. We continue to target free cash flow to be greater than or equal to net income.
I'd now like to turn the call back to John to provide an update on some of our key strategies."

Our focus for 2021 does not change from last year as we are focused on delivering on our core while continuing to build out our future. As we enter 2021, our residential businesses remain strong, and we are encouraged to see ongoing signs of stabilization in our commercial businesses. Although we have not yet seen indicators of year-over-year growth, we are expecting recovery likely in the tail end of 2021.
We believe that our smaller exposure to industrial capital spending will remain hindered for now. We have a long successful history of price realization across the majority of our portfolio. We will monitor closely the rapidly evolving inflation environment and respond accordingly. We are also pacing our growth investments and have the ability to modulate as needed, but we prefer to remain on offense and build on the momentum of the past 2 years. We recognize that we have opportunities to address our cost structure, particularly within IFT, and we plan to act as appropriate.
We discussed last year the G&A benchmarking efforts we undertook and identified that we have room for improvement. We are well underway in terms of our G&A efforts and are looking closely at our overall global enablement structure. Our goal is to deliver transformation plans that we expect will drive significant ROS expansion by 2024 while funding our strategic growth initiatives.
As we look to the future, our priorities are unchanged around growing both our pool and water treatment businesses. We have identified growing interest in our sustainable gas solutions business. I look forward to updating all of you in the future as we believe this business has exciting growth opportunities ahead.
We believe that pool has a long runway of continued growth. The Department of Energy regulation going into effect in mid-2021 is shifting the industry even further toward variable speed pumps, which is a category we helped to create over a decade ago. Today, nearly 60% of the pumps we sell are variable speed, while the industry adoption rate is closer to 50%. Over the next 2 years, we expect the industry, including us, to move closer to 85% as it is expected that there will still be certain parts of the industry that will be able to use single speed pumps.
We also continue to invest in our automation platform for pool and see strong adoption of our new offerings. In addition, despite being a leading brand in the U.S. on the pool pad, when a consumer contacts us directly on pentair.com, it has not been the best experience for the consumer. We believe that there's a tremendous opportunity of engaging the consumer and curating their experience through our existing channel while also ensuring that the consumer received the experience that they desired.
Within water treatment, we believe there are opportunities to rapidly expand our $50 million end-to-end residential services business and to be the leader in advanced technology and connected solutions and residential point-of-use solutions through our existing technology and the acquisition of Rocean.
We also have a leading commercial foodservice offering that we look to expand into other segments as well as add important services for our customers.
In sustainable gas, it is merely focusing on our high-growth segment within Industrial and adding global capability to accelerate our offerings.
Finally, I wanted to touch on our approach to capital allocation, which remains unchanged. Our top priority is our commitment to our investment-grade rating. Our strong cash flows allow us to invest in our top organic growth opportunities. From an M&A perspective, we remain focused on strategic bolt-on and tuck-in deals and focused strategic priorities, like I just shared with you.
While M&A valuations remain elevated, we continue to actively build our deal pipeline and plan to remain disciplined. Finally, we are committed to returning cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and opportunistic buybacks.
We believe that Pentair has a bright outlook, and we will continue to invest for the future while delivering on our core business. Our goal remains to deliver more consistent, predictable results for our customers, the environment, our employees, and our shareholders.
I would now like to turn the call over to James for Q&A, after which I will have a few closing remarks. James, please open the line for questions. Thank you."

So I think inflation is high.

I think we've got certainly areas of the portfolio that could do better. But when I step back and we looked at the G&A transformation, I believe it's more than a G&A transformation. I think what we learned from 2020, the way we sell globally, the way we interact with our customers, a lot of the virtual capability that was brought in and how we worked with our channel partners, the demand to have a more consumer enabled and have that be an effortless process through ordering on the Internet, that's a shift. And we think we have an opportunity to take a look at our global cost structure and to think about where we should put the work and where is the right person doing the right work at. And there's an opportunity across the portfolio to drive significant margin expansion for that.
Same in operations and sourcing. I mean we have factories that are at record capacity levels, and we have other factories that are undercapacitized right now. So all of that is in what we're labeling as transformation plan. In 2021, I think it's more planning, the efforts to get after it.

And we've seen a modest recovery off of that deep decline into Q3 and in Q4. We're sort of in that flattish range now. And that basically has restaurants open at roughly half capacity or quarter capacity depending on where they're living. 
The piece that we have not yet seen the recovery on is really the hospitality side of the hotel industry. And we're expecting that, as we said in our prepared comments, probably to the tail end of 2021. That would be a really big help to that business. The, obviously, replacement of cartridges are continuing, probably at a slower rate because the usage is slightly slower. And our portfolio is skewed more to some of the faster service and to the drive-through coffee shops. So we do get a little bit better than the overall restaurant average."

Within that construct, how do we get the best resources, the point of impact. And that's globally, right? I mean we've all learned that some of our people are now able to work virtually or work from home, and we don't need all of the necessary facilities we have. But at the same time, we want to create workspaces and collaboration centers for our businesses to work with customers and work with dealers on.
So this is going to be a fairly sizable transformation. I think in 2021, as I said, not expecting a lot other than the planning elements of this. And then we expect significant contributions in 2022 and beyond, beyond G&A even as the sales and marketing resources also get more effective and efficient."

I think the more important piece that we want to make sure we convey is our quarters last year represented a softer Q2, as the orders came through the distribution channel, we were not yet producing those. So we had pretty sizable Q3 and Q4 as we're catching up. And this year, if you think about the demand and the way we're meeting it in Q1 and Q2, we'll have stronger year-over-year comparisons there.

Julian, I promise the first part of my answer here is not a filibuster, but I want to make sure we describe that one of the reasons we're setting up these 3 strategic growth investments, 2 are in Consumer Solutions and 1 is in IFT is we're going to disproportionately fund those with investments to drive the future. What we're going to do a better job on and sharing with you as we go forward is the value of the core, meaning, take a look at the core performance absent those incremental investments. We're getting the drop through, as you would expect. We're getting the price and productivity offset inflation, the volumes coming through at a nice flow through rate. And then we're taking the opportunity to build out a services organization in residential, in Consumer Solutions, build out the front end capability and pool. And then also make sure we put the investment ahead of the likely growth opportunities in SGS.
And there's pretty substantial investment there in those 3 things, which draw down those margins for both of those 2 segments. Absent that, I think, we're pretty balanced and more normal year.

This is about building out a water treatment brand that people recognize that they can come in and work with Pentair to help curate their water experience. This is about customer experience, capability, more consumer related, so that we can quickly get consumers the dealer help and/or the technical support that they need to fix their particular challenges.
So it's capability, we don't have today. It's capability, we think, will add a lot of value. And also, it's about putting more trucks on the road as far as the services in residential. The paybacks are enormous from an IRR perspective over 2-year intervals, but the breakeven point is roughly a year when you put the sales team in place and you put the dealers in a geography, and you wait for the return on the accrual of the annuity base.
So that's the type of investment we're making. And we paced it a little bit more in 2020 than we would have liked. And we really want to accelerate it if we can here in 2021. And so it can be modulated, but that's an example of what it is and the likely levels of it."

Please turn to Slide #4, titled Executive Summary. 
I would first like to start by thanking the entire Pentair organization and the contributions they have made to help deliver on our commitments to all of our stakeholders. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all of our global channel partners and suppliers for their patience and efforts and working with us and our consumers to meet our commitments, despite the effects of decreases in the south, Canal blockages, supply chain constraints and, of course, the ongoing pandemic. 
Building off the momentum from last year, we started 2021 strong, with sales up 22%, adjusted EPS increasing 56% and free cash flow improving significantly from the comparable period last year. Our Residential business has led the way as Consumer Solutions experienced a 34% increase in sales. Encouragingly, we saw sales in all 3 businesses in Industrial Flow Technologies returned to growth for the first time in over a year. 
We announced the acquisition of Ken’s Beverage earlier this week. This is a strategic bolt-on acquisition that provides Pentair valuable national direct service network to expand our commercial water treatment business. We believe we will be in a position to seamlessly manage the full customer experience from product development, sales, installation and service to ensure the best quality products are matched with the most reliable and dedicated service network for all commercial applications. We believe Ken's provides us a platform to grow from as well as an opportunity to continue to expand our products offered to this important channel. 
Our balance sheet remains in excellent shape, and we are well positioned to fund organic growth and inorganic growth opportunities and return capital to our shareholders through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. With a strong start to the year, we are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $2.80 to $2.95. While inflation remains high, we have instituted a number of selling price increases across the portfolio that we expect to help mitigate inflation in the second half of the year. 
The strong start to the year and continued strength in our Residential businesses gives us confidence that we will have another strong year of growth for Pentair. Equally important are the signs of recovery in our Commercial and Industrial businesses. We plan to continue to invest in our strategic growth initiatives, and we will remain disciplined with our balance sheet. 
Please turn to Slide 5, labeled 2021 Execution Expectations. As we highlighted at the end of last year, we understand the importance of delivering the core while we also build our future. The focus has been and will remain on consistently making our commitments. Our actual results for the past 3 quarters have come in significantly better than our expectations as residential demand has been very strong. While we have experienced robust sales and EPS growth, we have also improved our cash flow and our balance sheet is the strongest it's been in years. Building our future means focusing on the things that are within our control. We look forward to providing more depth on this topic at our June 10 Investor Day, however, this is a continuation of the hard work we have been undertaking for the past several years. 
It starts with our focus growth initiatives, primarily in our Consumer Solutions segment. We are a leader in the pool industry, and we continue to build on our leading position. Investments in this area include automation, smart and connected solutions, energy efficiency offerings and now better filtration solutions. Within water treatment, we have expanded from components into systems and services within both residential and commercial. We have made significant investments in digitally building our brand and expanding our reach. 
We recently created a transformation office as we embark on the journey to drive growth while being more agile and flexible. Transformation can have many meanings. But to us, it means that we will have the right strategy, organization, leadership and culture, while accelerating growth and driving margin expansion by leveraging our internal capabilities and reducing complexity. This is not an either/or but a both and. We recognize that we must grow and drive productivity in order to maximize our ability to deliver for customers and create value for shareholders. 
We plan to continue to accelerate our digital innovation, technology and ESG investments, and we expect to fund many of these initiatives through our complexity reduction efforts. We believe that we are better positioned to deliver consistent growth and margin expansion, while also generating strong cash flow. Our goal has been and continues to be delivering consistently for our customers, employees, shareholders and the environment. 
I would now like to turn the call over to Bob to discuss our performance and our financial results in more detail. After which, I'll provide an update on our overall strategic position. Bob?"

First quarter sales grew an impressive 22%, with core sales increasing 19%. Consumer Solutions grew in excess of 30% and Industrial and Flow Technologies returned to growth for the first time in 5 quarters. Segment income was up nearly 50% as we saw strong drop-through and return on sales expanded 330 basis points to 19%. Adjusted EPS jumped 56% to $0.81. We saw price and productivity offset inflation in the quarter. This was the third consecutive quarter of strong double-digit sales growth within our Residential businesses. But just as encouraging was our Commercial and Industrial businesses, showing sequential improvement and some pockets of growth. We were very pleased with our first quarter performance, and we believe the momentum should continue. 
Please turn to Slide 7, Labeled Q1 2021 Consumer Solutions Performance. Consumer Solutions sales growth was 34% as both businesses delivered double-digit growth. Segment income increased 54%, and return on sales expanded 330 basis points to 25.1%. Pool experienced remarkable growth of almost 50% in the first quarter. Traditionally, the first quarter is preparing for the upcoming pool season, but we saw strong demand flow through the channel as we believe pool dealers continue to do their best to keep up with robust demand. The theme of consumers investing in the backyard as part of their Home Oasis continued. Demand for new pools remained strong as many builders saw bookings well past the current pool season. An already strong pool maintenance space grew only stronger as the freeze earlier this year in the Southern U.S. caused many premature equipment failures due to water freezing within the equipment. Pool has experienced strong double-digit sales growth for 3 consecutive quarters, and this would not be possible without our operations and supply teams and their ability to continuously increase capacity and execute at historically high-volume levels. 
We saw strong demand for pumps during the quarter and continued to see broader adoption of our variable speed pumps as a new DOE regulation goes into effect later this year. Demand for heaters remains quite high, and we have significantly increased our production capacity. Water treatment delivered 12% sales growth as residential demand remained robust and the decline in commercial volumes showed further sequential improvement. Within residential products, we saw strong growth in valves, tanks, and faucets. We experienced strong growth in the U.S., Europe and especially in China. We're in the early stages of integrating Rocean, but we believe the acquisition will greater enhance our product offerings going forward. 
Within residential services, we continue to experience strong demand and healthy conversion of leads into actual orders. We've made good progress on our journey to become the trusted, nationally-branded experience, led in part by our brand transition to Pentair Water Solutions. We are launching a number of new recurring revenue services, including preventative maintenance programs, service bolt-ons for plumbing services, cartridge change-outs and extended warranty programs. We are seeing continued signs of these foundational building blocks coming together, leading to more consistent, predictable growth. 
We believe that commercial demand is finally finding a bottom and expect comps to get easier going forward. We continue to build a strong new business funnel, particularly for our total water management offerings. We believe the addition of Ken's Beverage will help strengthen these offerings. 
Please turn to Slide 8, labeled Q1 2021 Industrial and Flow Technologies Performance. Industrial and Flow Technology sales increased 7% in the quarter, led by another quarter of double-digit growth in residential flow and both commercial flow and industrial filtration encouragingly posted modest growth in the quarter. Segment income increased 12% and return on sales expanded 60 basis points to 14.5%. Residential flow grew at a double-digit rate for the second consecutive quarter as demand remains strong across residential, irrigation and ag spray. We also experienced strong growth across retail, Pro and OEM channels. 
Commercial flow returned to growth, with backlog growing for the first time in many quarters. While infrastructure remains soft, we were encouraged by a growing backlog within commercial. We were pleased to see industrial filtration returned to growth in the first quarter and improve its backlog both year-over-year and sequentially. While headwinds remain in our longer cycle businesses due to caution and larger capital investments, we saw solid improvement in short-cycle component demand. Within our food and beverage business, we are beginning to see orders for our beer membrane filtration systems, including a new system for beer stabilization. In addition, we continue to expand our IoT offering with existing beer customers. Finally, we have seen a substantial increase in backlog for our biogas systems. Industrial and Flow Technologies remains focused on reducing complexity, selective growth and margin expansion, and we are encouraged by the improving top and bottom line to start the year. 
Please turn to Slide 9, labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. While the first quarter is historically a period of cash flow usage due to seasonal working capital being built, we were very pleased to see only minimal usage this year and over $150 million year-over-year improvement. This was driven primarily by our pool business and improved linearity. We expect another good year of free cash flow, driven by strong demand and continued disciplined working capital management. We ended the quarter at 1.3x leverage our return on invested capital was a strong 16.3%. As we look at our cash flow needs going forward, we have a bond maturing in the second quarter, and we will be paying our quarterly dividend. Beyond that, we will continue to be disciplined in our capital allocation as we continue to work the M&A pipeline, and we continue to have in our plan of buyback of at least $150 million of our shares this year. 
Please turn to Slide 10, labeled Q2 and Full Year 2021 Pentair Outlook. We are initiating second quarter and updating our full year 2021 guidance. For the second quarter, we expect sales to grow 13% to 16%, segment income to grow 12% to 20% and adjusted EPS to grow 17% to 25% to a range of $0.69 to $0.74. And for the full year, we expect sales to grow 6% to 11%, segment income to increase 10% to 16%, and adjusted EPS to grow 12% to 18% to a range of $2.80 to $2.95. 
We continue to work through material shortages and inflation that is impacting the second quarter. We believe that our pricing actions taken in the first half will help mitigate full year inflationary pressures. We have not factored in Ken's Beverage into our forecast as we are awaiting finalization of the transaction. 
Embedded in our full year sales guidance is anticipated low double-digit growth in Consumer Solutions, with pool expected to be up midteens, and water treatment up high single digits to low double digits. Within Industrial and Flow Technologies, we expect the top line to be up low-to-mid single digits, with Residential above the segment average. While we are experiencing an increase in orders for the short-cycle parts of our Commercial and Industrial businesses, we have not yet seen larger capital spending materialize. 
Below the operating line, we expect corporate expense to be around $65 million. Net interest to be in a range of $16 million to $18 million. Our tax rate to be around 15%, and the share count is expected to average between 167 million and 168 million shares for the full year. Capital expenditures are expected to be around $65 million while depreciation and amortization is anticipated to be about $80 million. We continue to target free cash flow to be greater than or equal to net income. 
I would now like to turn the call over to Stephanie for Q&A. After which, John will have a few closing remarks. Stephanie, please open the line for questions. Thank you."

We've also, through the acquisitions that we purchased, through Pelican and Rainsoft, have the direct access to the consumer through the affiliated channel and/or building out the services network ourselves. And so thank you for noticing that growth. We feel we're making great progress there, and we're excited. And that's why I'm excited about Ken's. I mean we just now put a services extension on top of our ability to sell products into the foodservice space, where we've always had a nice product offering. And that allows us to create end-to-end solutions, inclusive of the service and the ability to take care of the customer when the customer needs us to show up. So really building out that part of the portfolio, and we really like the momentum, and we're seeing the fruits of the work."

We're trying to get those people in place and the assets that we're at to digital, IoT, Smart connected solutions, I mean those are tight labor markets with a lot of people chasing the same skill set. So it's just more of a timing issue to put them in. And then we're also expanding the markets that we're serving.

It's not necessarily cyclical where we do the early buying pool. And we're trying to manage our capacity levels. So we're not spiking our labor and then laying the labor off. So we work to trying to fulfill those labor outlets.

That's what I wanted to sort of better understand and whether that deferral of investment spend, is that pushing much into next year as well? Or do you think the catch-up this year gets you to the right level, medium term?"

So let me tell you where we're spending it and strategically why.

So let me tell you where we're spending it and strategically why. So in pool, it's really around how do we be a destination site through our pool brands on the pad to bring you into and there, help you understand what's available and then connect you to our channel. So there's no desire to work around our channel. We want to go directly through our dealers and our distributors to continue to service you, but we want you to come and learn what's available to you to help pull demand. And that's where the investment has been going in pool as well as making sure that we've got a consumer services mindset around both services that you might need as well as making sure there's someone to answer the phone or chat with you upon your particular challenges and then connecting it to dealer to solve that for you. And we've been steadily seeing more consumer inquiries into our service network than we've traditionally seen the dealer network. So we've had to augment that and build that up. 
In water treatment, it's about accelerating our residential services offering, building our brand and again, being more effortless to do business with, which you should read into is digitally transacting. And that's where those investments have been. And then on the IFT side, as we mentioned before, we believe we've got a nice biogas upgrading capability and sustainable gas. And we want to shift the investments to North America, which traditionally been on the European side. And we think that we've got a nice run rate ahead of us to grow that sustainable gas offering over the next several years. So that's where the investments are focused. And then obviously, one of those categories we just filled in with the acquisition of Ken's, which was a buy investment platform instead of trying to do it on their own. And as far as the actual dollars, Bob?"

We have an opportunity to improve it, focus it and really expand the margins, which I'm comfortable that Jerome and team is working on. And then we've got a really nice set of industrial assets, and there is some cross-utilization. The membranes that we talk about on the industrial side are the membranes that are servicing this pool filter that I mentioned. And also, hopefully, will be the foundation for our salt-free softener that we'll introduce a water treatment in the next several years. So I think there's cost -- a lot more cost synergies.

Please turn to Slide #4 titled Executive Summary. I would first like to start by thanking the entire Pentair organization and the contributions they have made to help deliver on our commitments to all of our stakeholders. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all of our global channel partners and suppliers for their patience and efforts and working with us and our consumers to meet our commitments despite the effects of decreases in the South, canal blockages, supply chain constraints and, of course, the ongoing pandemic.
Building off the momentum from last year, we started 2021 strong, with sales up 22%, adjusted EPS increasing 56% and free cash flow improving significantly from the comparable period last year. Our residential business has led the way as Consumer Solutions experienced a 34% increase in sales. Encouragingly, we saw sales in all 3 businesses in Industrial & Flow Technologies return to growth for the first time in over a year.
We announced the acquisition of Ken’s Beverage earlier this week. This is a strategic bolt-on acquisition that provides Pentair a valuable national direct service network to expand our commercial water treatment business. We believe we will be in a position to seamlessly manage the full customer experience from product development, sales, installation and service to ensure the best quality products are matched with the most reliable and dedicated service network for all commercial applications. We believe Ken's provides us a platform to grow from as well as an opportunity to continue to expand our products offered to this important channel.
Our balance sheet remains in excellent shape, and we are well positioned to fund organic growth and inorganic growth opportunities and return capital to our shareholders through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. With a strong start to the year, we are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $2.80 to $2.95. While inflation remains high, we have instituted a number of selling price increases across the portfolio that we expect to help mitigate inflation in the second half of the year.
The strong start to the year and continued strength in our Residential businesses gives us confidence that we will have another strong year of growth for Pentair. Equally important are the signs of recovery in our commercial and industrial businesses. We plan to continue to invest in our strategic growth initiatives, and we will remain disciplined with our balance sheet.
Please turn to Slide 5 labeled 2021 Execution Expectations. As we highlighted at the end of last year, we understand the importance of delivering the core while we also build our future. The focus has been and will remain on consistently making our commitments. Our actual results for the past 3 quarters have come in significantly better than our expectations as residential demand has been very strong. While we have experienced robust sales and EPS growth, we have also improved our cash flow and our balance sheet is the strongest it's been in years. Building our future means focusing on the things that are within our control. We look forward to providing more depth on this topic at our June 10 Investor Day. However, this is a continuation of the hard work we have been undertaking for the past several years.
It starts with our focus growth initiatives primarily in our Consumer Solutions segment. We are a leader in the pool industry, and we continue to build on our leading position. Investments in this area include automation, smart and connected solutions, energy efficiency offerings and now better filtration solutions. Within water treatment, we have expanded from components into systems and services within both residential and commercial. We have made significant investments in digitally building our brand and expanding our reach.
We recently created a transformation office as we embark on the journey to drive growth while being more agile and flexible. Transformation can have many meanings. But to us, it means that we will have the right strategy, organization, leadership and culture while accelerating growth and driving margin expansion by leveraging our internal capabilities and reducing complexity. This is not an either/or but a both/and. We recognize that we must grow and drive productivity in order to maximize our ability to deliver for customers and create value for shareholders.
We plan to continue to accelerate our digital innovation, technology and ESG investments, and we expect to fund many of these initiatives through our complexity reduction efforts. We believe that we are better positioned to deliver consistent growth and margin expansion while also generating strong cash flow. Our goal has been and continues to be delivering consistently for our customers, employees, shareholders and the environment.
I would now like to turn the call over to Bob to discuss our performance and our financial results in more detail. After which, I'll provide an update on our overall strategic position. Bob?"

First quarter sales grew an impressive 22%, with core sales increasing 19%. Consumer Solutions grew in excess of 30%, and Industrial & Flow Technologies returned to growth for the first time in 5 quarters. Segment income was up nearly 50% as we saw strong drop-through, and return on sales expanded 330 basis points to 19%. Adjusted EPS jumped 56% to $0.81. We saw price and productivity offset inflation in the quarter. This was the third consecutive quarter of strong double-digit sales growth within our residential businesses. But just as encouraging was our commercial and industrial businesses showing sequential improvement and some pockets of growth. We were very pleased with our first quarter performance, and we believe the momentum should continue.
Please turn to Slide 7 labeled Q1 2021 Consumer Solutions Performance. Consumer Solutions sales growth was 34% as both businesses delivered double-digit growth. Segment income increased 54%, and return on sales expanded 330 basis points to 25.1%. Pool experienced remarkable growth of almost 50% in the first quarter. Traditionally, the first quarter is preparing for the upcoming pool season, but we saw strong demand flow through the channel as we believe pool dealers continue to do their best to keep up with robust demand.
The theme of consumers investing in the backyard as part of their home oasis continued. Demand for new pools remained strong as many builders saw bookings well past the current pool season. An already strong pool maintenance space grew only stronger as the freeze earlier this year in the Southern U.S. caused many premature equipment failures due to water freezing within the equipment. Pool has experienced strong double-digit sales growth for 3 consecutive quarters, and this would not be possible without our operations and supply teams and their ability to continuously increase capacity and execute at historically high-volume levels. We saw strong demand for pumps during the quarter and continued to see broader adoption of our variable speed pumps as a new DOE regulation goes into effect later this year. Demand for heaters remains quite high, and we have significantly increased our production capacity.
Water treatment delivered 12% sales growth as residential demand remained robust and the decline in commercial volumes showed further sequential improvement. Within residential products, we saw strong growth in valves, tanks, pitchers and faucets. We experienced strong growth in the U.S., Europe and especially in China. We're in the early stages of integrating Rocean, but we believe the acquisition will greater enhance our product offerings going forward.
Within residential services, we continue to experience strong demand and healthy conversion of leads into actual orders. We've made good progress on our journey to become the trusted, nationally branded experience, led in part by our brand transition to Pentair Water Solutions. We are launching a number of new recurring revenue services, including preventative maintenance programs, service bolt-ons for plumbing services, cartridge change-outs and extended warranty programs. We are seeing continued signs of these foundational building blocks coming together, leading to more consistent, predictable growth.
We believe that commercial demand is finally finding a bottom and expect comps to get easier going forward. We continue to build a strong new business funnel, particularly for our total water management offerings. We believe the addition of Ken's Beverage will help strengthen these offerings.
Please turn to Slide 8 labeled Q1 2021 Industrial & Flow Technologies Performance. Industrial & Flow Technologies sales increased 7% in the quarter, led by another quarter of double-digit growth in residential flow, and both commercial flow and industrial filtration encouragingly posted modest growth in the quarter. Segment income increased 12%, and return on sales expanded 60 basis points to 14.5%. Residential flow grew at a double-digit rate for the second consecutive quarter as demand remains strong across residential, irrigation and ag spray. We also experienced strong growth across retail, Pro and OEM channels. 
Commercial flow returned to growth, with backlog growing for the first time in many quarters. While infrastructure remains soft, we were encouraged by a growing backlog within commercial. We were pleased to see industrial filtration return to growth in the first quarter and improve its backlog both year-over-year and sequentially. While headwinds remain in our longer-cycle businesses due to caution in larger capital investments, we saw solid improvement in short-cycle component demand.
Within our food and beverage business, we are beginning to see orders for our beer membrane filtration systems, including a new system for beer stabilization. In addition, we continue to expand our IoT offering with existing beer customers. Finally, we have seen a substantial increase in backlog for our biogas systems. Industrial & Flow Technologies remains focused on reducing complexity, selective growth and margin expansion, and we are encouraged by the improving top and bottom line to start the year.

While the first quarter is historically a period of cash flow usage due to seasonal working capital being built, we were very pleased to see only minimal usage this year and over $150 million year-over-year improvement. This was driven primarily by our pool business and improved linearity. We expect another good year of free cash flow driven by strong demand and continued disciplined working capital management. We ended the quarter at 1.3x leverage, and our return on invested capital was a strong 16.3%. As we look at our cash flow needs going forward, we have a bond maturing in the second quarter, and we will be paying our quarterly dividend. Beyond that, we will continue to be disciplined in our capital allocation as we continue to work the M&A pipeline, and we continue to have in our plan a buyback of at least $150 million of our shares this year. 
Please turn to Slide 10 labeled Q2 and Full Year 2021 Pentair Outlook. We are initiating second quarter and updating our full year 2021 guidance. For the second quarter, we expect sales to grow 13% to 16%, segment income to grow 12% to 20% and adjusted EPS to grow 17% to 25% to a range of $0.69 to $0.74. For the full year, we expect sales to grow 6% to 11%, segment income to increase 10% to 16% and adjusted EPS to grow 12% to 18% to a range of $2.80 to $2.95.
We continue to work through material shortages and inflation that is impacting the second quarter. We believe that our pricing actions taken in the first half will help mitigate full year inflationary pressures. We have not factored in Ken's Beverage into our forecast as we are awaiting finalization of the transaction.
Embedded in our full year sales guidance is anticipated low double-digit growth in Consumer Solutions, with pool expected to be up mid-teens and water treatment up high single digits to low double digits. Within Industrial & Flow Technologies, we expect the top line to be up low-to-mid single digits, with residential above the segment average. While we are experiencing an increase in orders for the short-cycle parts of our commercial and industrial businesses, we have not yet seen larger capital spending materialize.
Below the operating line, we expect corporate expense to be around $65 million, net interest to be in a range of $16 million to $18 million, our tax rate to be around 15%, and the share count is expected to average between 167 million and 168 million shares for the full year. Capital expenditures are expected to be around $65 million, while depreciation and amortization is anticipated to be about $80 million. We continue to target free cash flow to be greater than or equal to net income.
I would now like to turn the call over to Stephanie for Q&A. After which, John will have a few closing remarks. Stephanie, please open the line for questions. Thank you."

No surprise. Any way to talk about kind of what's happening under the surface with whether it's kind of replacement versus new or wallet share versus like-for-like as -- yes, 50% is a lot of growth. I can appreciate that the last year has been kind of a unique environment, and comps play into it as well. But at the end of the day, I don't know if we've seen that much more kind of utilization in breakage. In theory, the stuff is always kind of out there, spinning around somewhere. Yes, how much of the strength that you're seeing right now kind of speaks to that upsell of the pool pad that you guys have been talking about versus the volume side of the equation?"

And I think people are not traveling as much and using their backyard more as their vacation destination spot so they become more aware. Without a doubt, and we shared this, we've seen a lot better penetration than we've ever seen before as people want to extend the season and make sure that their pool water is the temperature that they want.
But where we've been excited is we've seen the upgrades around the energy-efficient lighting, the automation and also the self-chlorination and the self-saltwater capability. So the maintenance of the pool side is well, Josh. So it's been a really good situation because the more we made those consumers aware, the more they were able to expand the offering. And we think the more that expands, the more people talk about it, and I think we believe that's a trend that's going to sustain."

So it's great to talk about it, Rob.
I mean I think we've got several things going on. We've definitely spent a lot of time upgrading our capability around our products to sell to the independent dealer channel. And people are more aware of the water in their home these days, and they're doing things to try to make it better, either to -- either for [ base ] reasons or trying to improve the overall benefits regarding their water. So we've got a lot of interest, and we've been expanding our portfolio to be more consumer-friendly.
We've also, through the acquisitions that we purchased, through Pelican and RainSoft, have the direct access to the consumer through the affiliate channel and/or building out the services network ourselves. And so thank you for noticing that growth. We feel we're making great progress there, and we're excited.
And that's why I'm excited about Ken's. I mean we just now put a services extension on top of our ability to sell products into the foodservice space, where we've always had a nice product offering. And that allows us to create end-to-end solutions, inclusive of the service and the ability to take care of the customer when the customer needs us to show up. So really building out that part of the portfolio, and we really like the momentum, and we're seeing the fruits of the work."

As far as the early buy, I mean, just remind you, I mean, this is a seasonable business. It's not necessarily cyclical where we do the early buy in pool. And we're trying to manage our capacity levels. So we're not spiking our labor and then laying the labor off. So we work to trying to fulfill those labor outlets.

We launched a side stream filtration product in a soft launch basis. So we're seeing amazing results as far as the clarity of the pool water by putting what was the CPT X-flow membranes on the side of a regular pool filter application. And that smart filter capability that we have in the soft launch applications has really demonstrated superior results. So that one, I'm really excited because that's a category that we haven't really seen new product introductions in pool for some period of time.
And then on the Consumer Solutions side, it's really about connecting to that app that we mentioned around the smart product launches, the technologies. And then the most exciting one we have is this acquisition, Rocean, that we purchased and more of a countertop POU unit that will be launched either later this year or early next year."

So in pool, it's really around how do we be a destination site through our pool brands on the pad to bring you into Pentair, help you understand what's available and then connect you to our channel. So there's no desire to work around our channel. We want to go directly through our dealers and our distributors to continue to service you, but we want you to come and learn what's available to you to help pull demand. And that's where the investment has been going in pool as well as making sure that we've got a consumer services mindset around both services that you might need as well as making sure there's someone to answer the phone or chat with you upon your particular challenges and then connecting you with the dealer to solve that for you. And we've been steadily seeing more consumer inquiries into our service network than we've traditionally seen the dealer network. So we've had to augment that and build that up.
In water treatment, it's about accelerating our residential services offering, building our brand and again, being more effortless to do business with, which you should read into as digitally transacting. And that's where those investments have been.
And then on the IFT side, as we mentioned before, we believe we've got a nice biogas upgrading capability and sustainable gas. And we want to shift the investments to North America, which traditionally been on the European side. And we think that we've got a nice run rate ahead of us to grow that sustainable gas offering over the next several years.

And then we've got a really nice set of industrial assets, and there is some cross-utilization.

We were pleased to deliver a strong second quarter with sales up over 30%, adjusted EPS growth greater than 40% and free cash flow up over $100 million in the fi",630,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide #4 titled Executive Summary. We were pleased to deliver a strong second quarter with sales up over 30%, adjusted EPS growth greater than 40% and free cash flow up over $100 million in the first half of the year. I would like to thank our Pentair teams for helping deliver these results even in the face of unprecedented material shortages and inflation. 
Our orders continue to grow, and our backlog ended the quarter at record levels. We believe our order trajectory gives us increased confidence not only in our ability to keep growing in the second half, but it also gives us comfort that the top line momentum we have built the past several quarters will carry over into next year. Our transformation work is on track, and we have built a strong pipeline of initiatives across the enterprise. 
Regarding the current inflationary environment, we have implemented further price increases, and we expect the price cost gap to further narrow in the second half. Our cash flow remain robust, and our balance sheet is in a very solid position. We have a strong M&A pipeline tied to our strategic growth initiatives, and we plan to remain disciplined with our capital allocation. 
We are introducing third quarter guidance and raising our full year expectations once again, which Bob will give more detail on later in the call. Our forecast reflects our expectations that material shortages and inflation are not going away nor will they improve materially. We believe we have better visibility than we have had in the last few quarters, and that our proven focus around manufacturing and sourcing gives us the tools to navigate the current environment. We are encouraged to see our commercial and industrial businesses recovering our residential businesses remaining seasonally strong. And as mentioned earlier, our backlog supports continued growth. 
Please turn to Slide 5, labeled Building a Track Record of Consistent Growth. At our June 10 Investor Day, we introduced several targets for 2022 to 2025, including mid-single-digit sales growth, 300 basis point margin expansion and a 10%-plus CAGR for adjusted EPS. Our 2025 targets were based on our guidance as of June 10, which we are raising once again following our strong second quarter performance. Our longer-term target provided at Investor Day would now be based off of our revised guidance. 
We have experienced significant growth since the second half of 2020 and we believe the momentum that we have created will continue into the foreseeable future. We continue to believe that we have a well-positioned portfolio benefiting from many positive secular trends. Our Pool business serves a large installed base, Water Treatment helps solve water quality issues for residential and commercial customers and Industrial & Flow Technologies serves some attractive niches like biogas in addition to a large installed base of pumps. While our consumer businesses are seasonal, we do not believe them to be cyclical. 
While our focus is on driving the core to create consistent value creation, we are investing in a few strategic growth initiatives to accelerate the top line. These include getting closer to the consumer in Pool, expanding Water Treatment further into services and biogas and carbon capture within Industrial & Flow Technologies. As we drive transformation more broadly across the entire enterprise, we expect that this will drive both ROS expansion and help fund growth initiatives. 
Finally, we believe our balance sheet provides a great degree of flexibility to drive further upside, primarily through M&A tied to our strategic growth initiatives. I would now like to turn the call over to Bob to discuss our performance and our financial results in more detail, after which I will provide an update on our overall strategic position. Bob?"

Please turn to Slide 6 labeled Q2 2021 Pentair Performance. Second quarter sales grew 32%, with core sales increasing 28%. Consumer Solutions grew core sales nearly 40%, and Industrial & Flow Technologies delivered core sales growth of 12",1145,"Thank you, John. Please turn to Slide 6 labeled Q2 2021 Pentair Performance. Second quarter sales grew 32%, with core sales increasing 28%. Consumer Solutions grew core sales nearly 40%, and Industrial & Flow Technologies delivered core sales growth of 12%, its second consecutive quarter of growth. Segment income was up 40%, and return on sales expanded 110 basis points to 18.6%. Adjusted EPS increased 42% to $0.84. 
Consistent with our guidance, the second quarter did not see price fully offset inflation as we saw higher inflation that we have continued to implement price increases to help offset. The second half should see price costs start to even out, but an unprecedented amount of material and wage inflation, coupled with robust demand, has contributed to price reading out at a slower pace. 
Corporate expense was $26 million in the quarter as we recorded higher levels of compensation expense given the performance our businesses have delivered this year. Our tax rate was 17.4% in the quarter as we now expect the full year tax rate to approximate 16%. This is due primarily to higher levels of North American income as our residential businesses continued to grow at strong double-digit levels. 
Please turn to Slide 7, labeled Q2 2021 Consumer Solutions Performance. Consumer Solutions sales growth was 44% as both businesses delivered strong double-digit growth. Segment income increased 48%, and return on sales expanded 80 basis points to 24.9%. Consumer Solutions experienced significant inflation during the first half as demand continued to grow. 
Pool experienced sales growth of 50% in the quarter. While we have seen significant growth 2 quarters in a row to start the year, we believe pool dealers are doing their best to keep up with robust demand. The theme of consumers investing in their backyards continued. The Pool team has significantly increased capacity even in the face of material shortages and inflation. Backlog remains at record levels and orders have more than doubled. Even with the record year, we believe the improvement in orders and strong backlog gives us improved visibility that growth will continue looking ahead to next year. 
The macro trends continue to be favorable and the installed base of pools continue to grow. Demand for new pools remain strong, with many builders reporting backlogs into next year. We believe consumers remain committed to enhancing their at-home quantity of life and enjoying a pool is a major part of the experience for many consumers. In addition to new pool construction, aftermarket growth remains strong as consumers have used their pools more. 
Water Treatment delivered 35% sales growth as residential demand remained robust and commercial showed strong signs of post pandemic recovery. Our residential business grew nearly 20% and our commercial business grew sales by over 40%, excluding the contribution from KBI in the quarter. 
Overall, we believe Consumer Solutions is well positioned to deliver continued double-digit growth in the second half based on strong order and backlog trends. We expect price to read out further in the second half and close the gap on the higher inflation experienced in the first half. 
Please turn to Slide 8 labeled Q2 2021 Industrial & Flow Technologies Performance. Industrial & Flow Technologies increased sales 17% in the quarter as its end markets further recovered and the business continued to execute its strategy. Segment income increased 30% and return on sales expanded 160 basis points to 15.7%. 
Residential flow grew at a double-digit rate for the third consecutive quarter. Orders continued to exceed sales, and we expect the seasonal business to end the year well positioned within all of its channels. Commercial flow increased sales 11% and further build backlog. The commercial recovery has gained momentum with orders continuing to improve. We expect growth to continue for the smaller part of the segment. 
Industrial Filtration delivered 14% sales growth as the shorter-cycle aftermarket showed further signs of improvement, particularly within food and beverage. We experienced double-digit increases in both orders and backlog. Industrial & Flow Technologies remains focused on reducing complexity, selective growth and margin expansion. 
Please turn to Slide 9, labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. Free cash flow continued to be a great story with over $100 million improvement year-over-year. We generated $340 million of free cash in the first half. We have returned $117 million to shareholders through dividends and buybacks in the first half. We also repaid a $104 million bond that matured during the quarter and paid approximately $80 million to acquire KBI. 
Although we continue to invest our capital wisely, we ended the quarter at just under 1x leverage. We are extremely proud and excited to see our return on invested capital exceed 18%. As we look at our cash flow needs going forward, we plan to remain disciplined in our capital allocation approach. We plan to continue working the M&A pipeline and to buy back at least $150 million of our shares this year. 
Please turn to Slide 10 labeled Q3 and Full Year 2021 Pentair Outlook. We are initiating third quarter and updating our full year 2021 guidance. For the quarter, we expect sales to grow 16% to 19%; segment income to grow 18% to 23%; and adjusted EPS to grow 16% to 21% to a range of $0.81 to $0.85. Our forecast reflects our expectations that material shortages and inflation are not going away nor will they improve materially. 
For the full year, we expect sales to grow 21% to 23%; segment income to increase 30% to 34%; and  adjusted EPS to grow 32% to 36% to a range of $3.30 to $3.40. Embedded in our full year sales guidance, this anticipated growth in Consumer Solutions around 30%, with Pool expected to be up nearly 40% and water Treatment up over 20% as commercial is expected to further recover and KBI is expected to contribute in the second half. Also incorporated in the revised guidance is anticipated low double-digit growth for Industrial & Flow Technologies. 
Below the operating line, we expect corporate expense to be around $80 million, given the higher levels of compensation expense in 2021 given the record performance expected this year. We expect corporate expense to go back to more normalized levels next year. We now expect net interest to be in the range of $15 million to $16 million and our tax rate to be around 16%. 
We anticipate the share count to average between 167 million and 168 million shares for the full year. Capital expenditures are expected to be around $60 million, while depreciation and amortization is anticipated to be around $80 million. We continue to target free cash flow to be greater than or equal to net income. 
I would now like to turn the call over to Michelle for Q&A, after which John will have a few closing remarks. Michelle, please open the line for questions. Thank you."

And then we've got to work on next year, which we feel is also going to be strong demand. I think another level of confidence is we've been able to start to attract labor and keep labor in our pool factories, which has been -- was harder to do 3 to 4 months ago. And we're starting to manage the supply chain, uniqueness of that, availability of product and be able to demonstrate the agility in the factories to get product out to customers. So those are the differences of how we feel.

And the fact that all of that aftermarket demand still needs to be satisfied off of what happened with the freezes. And then the rest of the markets, I would say that they're just accelerated, meaning that the rate of new builds are consistent across those areas.

So when you see the increase in the new build simultaneously with the demand for aftermarket, you're trying to balance those 2 things at the same time.

There's also better technology at great price points that we're participating in to manage and monitor water chemistry, and then to begin to determine what's necessary to balance those water areas. So that's where I'm really super excited. We also saw and we shared this openly that as people use their pools, more the heater matters. And that was always a nice to have on the pad on the older builds. And as they -- most people remodel, now they're putting those heaters in both for the spa and for the pool. So we've seen the trends in lighting earlier. We saw the trends working around some of the variable speed pump penetration. We're now starting to see that extend to the other capabilities around the pool.

But it looks like, particularly as of Thursday, you're going to have a very clear path to do that.

If you recall, when commercial happened, there was generally a closure of most restaurants and hospitality. And that's the end offices where people drink water, and that was each step back for our business last Q2. That has slowly been recovering as people return to more of the normal of the way it used to be pre COVID, but we're not yet back globally to where we expect it to be. I think our addition of KBI gives us the ability to add services components on top of products, which strategically is what we think our customers want.

Please turn to Slide #4 titled Executive Summary. We were pleased to deliver a strong second quarter, with sales up over 30%, adjusted EPS growth greater than 40% and free cash flow up over $100 million in the f",631,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide #4 titled Executive Summary. We were pleased to deliver a strong second quarter, with sales up over 30%, adjusted EPS growth greater than 40% and free cash flow up over $100 million in the first half of the year. I would like to thank our Pentair teams for helping deliver these results even in the face of unprecedented material shortages and inflation.
Our orders continued to grow, and our backlog ended the quarter at record levels. We believe our order trajectory gives us increased confidence not only in our ability to keep growing in the second half, but it also gives us comfort that the top line momentum we have built the past several quarters will carry over into next year. Our transformation work is on track, and we have built a strong pipeline of initiatives across the enterprise.
Regarding the current inflationary environment, we have implemented further price increases, and we expect the price cost gap to further narrow in the second half. Our cash flow remained robust, and our balance sheet is in a very solid position. We have a strong M&A pipeline tied to our strategic growth initiatives, and we plan to remain disciplined with our capital allocation.
We are introducing third quarter guidance and raising our full year expectations once again, which Bob will give more detail on later in the call. Our forecast reflects our expectations that material shortages and inflation are not going away nor will they improve materially. We believe we have better visibility than we have had in the last few quarters and that our proven focus around manufacturing and sourcing gives us the tools to navigate the current environment. We are encouraged to see our commercial and industrial businesses recovering and our residential businesses remaining seasonally strong. And as mentioned earlier, our backlog supports continued growth.
Please turn to Slide 5 labeled Building a Track Record of Consistent Growth. At our June 10 Investor Day, we introduced several targets for 2022 to 2025, including mid-single-digit sales growth, 300 basis points margin expansion and a 10%-plus CAGR for adjusted EPS. Our 2025 targets were based on our guidance as of June 10, which we are raising once again following our strong second quarter performance. Our longer-term target provided at Investor Day would now be based off of our revised guidance.
We have experienced significant growth since the second half of 2020, and we believe the momentum that we have created will continue into the foreseeable future. We continue to believe that we have a well-positioned portfolio, benefiting from many positive secular trends: our pool business serves a large installed base; water treatment helps solve water quality issues for residential and commercial customers; and Industrial & Flow Technologies serves some attractive niches like biogas, in addition to a large installed base of pumps. While our consumer businesses are seasonal, we do not believe them to be cyclical.
While our focus is on driving the core to create consistent value creation, we are investing in a few strategic growth initiatives to accelerate the top line. These include getting closer to the consumer in pool, expanding water treatment further into services and biogas and carbon capture within Industrial & Flow Technologies. As we drive transformation more broadly across the entire enterprise, we expect that this will drive both ROS expansion and help fund growth initiatives. Finally, we believe our balance sheet provides a great degree of flexibility to drive further upside, primarily through M&A tied to our strategic growth initiatives.
I would now like to turn the call over to Bob to discuss our performance and our financial results in more detail, after which I will provide an update on our overall strategic position. Bob?"

Please turn to Slide 6 labeled Q2 2021 Pentair Performance. Second quarter sales grew 32%, with core sales increasing 28%. Consumer Solutions grew core sales nearly 40%, and Industrial & Flow Technologies delivered core sales growth of 12",1144,"Thank you, John. Please turn to Slide 6 labeled Q2 2021 Pentair Performance. Second quarter sales grew 32%, with core sales increasing 28%. Consumer Solutions grew core sales nearly 40%, and Industrial & Flow Technologies delivered core sales growth of 12%, its second consecutive quarter of growth. Segment income was up 40%, and return on sales expanded 110 basis points to 18.6%. Adjusted EPS increased 42% to $0.84.
Consistent with our guidance, the second quarter did not see price fully offset inflation as we saw higher inflation that we have continued to implement price increases to help offset. The second half should see price costs start to even out, but an unprecedented amount of material and wage inflation, coupled with robust demand, has contributed to price reading out at a slower pace.
Corporate expense was $26 million in the quarter as we recorded higher levels of compensation expense given the performance our businesses have delivered this year. Our tax rate was 17.4% in the quarter as we now expect the full year tax rate to approximate 16%. This is due primarily to higher levels of North American income as our residential businesses continued to grow at strong double-digit levels.
Please turn to Slide 7 labeled Q2 2021 Consumer Solutions Performance. Consumer Solutions sales growth was 44% as both businesses delivered strong double-digit growth. Segment income increased 48%, and return on sales expanded 80 basis points to 24.9%. Consumer Solutions experienced significant inflation during the first half as demand continued to grow.
Pool experienced sales growth of 50% in the quarter. While we have seen significant growth 2 quarters in a row to start the year, we believe pool dealers are doing their best to keep up with robust demand. The theme of consumers investing in their backyards continued.
The pool team has significantly increased capacity even in the face of material shortages and inflation. Backlog remains at record levels, and orders have more than doubled. Even with the record year, we believe the improvement in orders and strong backlog gives us improved visibility that growth will continue looking ahead to next year.
The macro trends continue to be favorable, and the installed base of pools continue to grow. Demand for new pools remain strong, with many builders reporting backlogs into next year. We believe consumers remain committed to enhancing their at-home quality of life, and enjoying a pool is a major part of the experience for many consumers. In addition to new pool construction, aftermarket growth remains strong as consumers have used their pools more.
Water treatment delivered 35% sales growth as residential demand remained robust and commercial showed strong signs of post-pandemic recovery. Our residential business grew nearly 20%, and our commercial business grew sales by over 40%, excluding the contribution from KBI in the quarter.
Overall, we believe Consumer Solutions is well positioned to deliver continued double-digit growth in the second half based on strong order and backlog trends. We expect price to read out further in the second half and close the gap on the higher inflation experienced in the first half.
Please turn to Slide 8 labeled Q2 2021 Industrial & Flow Technologies Performance. Industrial & Flow Technologies increased sales 17% in the quarter as its end markets further recovered and the business continued to execute its strategy. Segment income increased 30%, and return on sales expanded 160 basis points to 15.7%. Residential flow grew at a double-digit rate for the third consecutive quarter. Orders continued to exceed sales, and we expect the seasonal business to end the year well positioned within all of its channels. Commercial flow increased sales 11% and further built backlog. The commercial recovery has gained momentum, with orders continuing to improve. We expect growth to continue for the smaller part of the segment.
Industrial filtration delivered 14% sales growth as the shorter-cycle aftermarket showed further signs of improvement, particularly within food and beverage. We experienced double-digit increases in both orders and backlog. Industrial & Flow Technologies remains focused on reducing complexity, selective growth and margin expansion.
Please turn to Slide 9 labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. Free cash flow continued to be a great story, with over $100 million improvement year-over-year. We generated $340 million of free cash in the first half. We have returned $117 million to shareholders through dividends and buybacks in the first half. We also repaid a $104 million bond that matured during the quarter and paid approximately $80 million to acquire KBI.
Although we continue to invest our capital wisely, we ended the quarter at just under 1x leverage. We are extremely proud and excited to see our return on invested capital exceed 18%. As we look at our cash flow needs going forward, we plan to remain disciplined in our capital allocation approach. We plan to continue working the M&A pipeline and to buy back at least $150 million of our shares this year.
Please turn to Slide 10 labeled Q3 and Full Year 2021 Pentair Outlook. We are initiating third quarter and updating our full year 2021 guidance. For the quarter, we expect sales to grow 16% to 19%, segment income to grow 18% to 23% and adjusted EPS to grow 16% to 21% to a range of $0.81 to $0.85. Our forecast reflects our expectations that material shortages and inflation are not going away nor will they improve materially.
For the full year, we expect sales to grow 21% to 23%, segment income to increase 30% to 34% and  adjusted EPS to grow 32% to 36% to a range of $3.30 to $3.40. Embedded in our full year sales guidance is anticipated growth in Consumer Solutions, around 30%, with pool expected to be up nearly 40% and water treatment up over 20%, as commercial is expected to further recover and KBI is expected to contribute in the second half. Also incorporated in the revised guidance is anticipated low double-digit growth for Industrial & Flow Technologies.
Below the operating line, we expect corporate expense to be around $80 million, given the higher levels of compensation expense in 2021 given the record performance expected this year. We expect corporate expense to go back to more normalized levels next year. We now expect net interest to be in the range of $15 million to $16 million and our tax rate to be around 16%. We anticipate the share count to average between 167 million and 168 million shares for the full year.
Capital expenditures are expected to be around $60 million, while depreciation and amortization is anticipated to be around $80 million. We continue to target free cash flow to be greater than or equal to net income.
I would now like to turn the call over to Michelle for Q&A, after which John will have a few closing remarks. Michelle, please open the line for questions. Thank you."

And then we've got to work on next year, which we feel is also going to be strong demand.
I think another level of confidence is we've been able to start to attract labor and keep labor in our pool factories, which has been -- was harder to do 3 to 4 months ago. And we're starting to manage the supply chain, the uniqueness of that, availability of product and be able to demonstrate the agility in the factories to get product out to customers.

One, we had the Department of Engineering (sic) [ Department of Energy ] changeover from single speed to variable.

And then obviously, the acceleration of new pools and remodeled pools is really putting a significant demand nationally on that product, and that is the same product generally sold in all of the pool regions.
And then state by state, you've got these disruptions like Texas that has been disruptive for everybody and the fact that all of that aftermarket demand still needs to be satisfied off of what happened with the freezes. And then the rest of the markets, I would say that they're just accelerated, meaning that the rate of new builds are consistent across those areas. And then the aftermarket demand replacement cycles or the additive, ""I want more products for my pad,"" have been traditionally across the Sun Belt states. So right now, it's -- I would say the demand is not easing, and we're all trying to catch up with that demand and work through our supply partners to do that."

I mean we've been stuck and the industry has been stuck, and we've been with it, somewhere around -- just modestly in the double digits of automation. And I think just with the recent trends and more mesh networks and getting WiFi into the backyard on a more dependable basis, it creates more opportunities for more automation. You really need awareness, and you need people to use the pool or to care to really drive that behavioral change. And that's what we're most encouraged by. There's also better technology at great price points that we're participating in to manage and monitor water chemistry and then to begin to determine what's necessary to balance those water areas. So that's where I'm really super excited.
We also saw and we shared this openly that as people use their pools, more the heater matters. And that was always a nice to have on the pad in -- on the older builds. And as they -- most people remodel now, they're putting those heaters in, both for the spa and for the pool.
So we've seen the trends in lighting earlier. We saw the trends working around some of the variable speed pump penetration. We're now starting to see that extend to the other capabilities around the pool. So I think it's a few points of overall pad penetration for the industry over the next several years, and that encourages us and excites us."

So we'd say that even though we've had availability of most of the supply we need, it's very inconsistent in its predictability of when and how it's coming, which has forced tremendous agility in our factories to rearrange in a lean way where we put the labor efforts. And sometimes we're producing 75% of a product and then coming back and finishing 25% later, to give you an example. So that's why we're very complementary of our teams, as Bob said, because it's required all kinds of different skills to be able to move forward. Main challenges to us are would be chips would be drives. We make motors. Those would be the areas that are in high demand for the products that we serve."

Please turn to Slide #4 titled Executive Summary. We were pleased to deliver a strong second quarter, with sales up over 30%, adjusted EPS growth greater than 40% and free cash flow up over $100 million in the first half of the year. I would like to thank our Pentair teams for helping deliver these results even in the face of unprecedented material shortages and inflation.
Our orders continued to grow, and our backlog ended the quarter at record levels. We believe our order trajectory gives us increased confidence not only in our ability to keep growing in the second half, but it also gives us comfort that the top line momentum we have built the past several quarters will carry over into next year. Our transformation work is on track, and we have built a strong pipeline of initiatives across the enterprise.
Regarding the current inflationary environment, we have implemented further price increases, and we expect the price cost gap to further narrow in the second half. Our cash flow remained robust, and our balance sheet is in a very solid position. We have a strong M&A pipeline tied to our strategic growth initiatives, and we plan to remain disciplined with our capital allocation.
We are introducing third quarter guidance and raising our full year expectations once again, which Bob will give more detail on later in the call. Our forecast reflects our expectations that material shortages and inflation are not going away nor will they improve materially. We believe we have better visibility than we have had in the last few quarters and that our proven focus around manufacturing and sourcing gives us the tools to navigate the current environment. We are encouraged to see our commercial and industrial businesses recovering and our residential businesses remaining seasonally strong. And as mentioned earlier, our backlog supports continued growth.
Please turn to Slide 5 labeled Building a Track Record of Consistent Growth. At our June 10 Investor Day, we introduced several targets for 2022 to 2025, including mid-single-digit sales growth, 300 basis points margin expansion and a 10%-plus CAGR for adjusted EPS. Our 2025 targets were based on our guidance as of June 10, which we are raising once again following our strong second quarter performance. Our longer-term target provided at Investor Day would now be based off of our revised guidance.
We have experienced significant growth since the second half of 2020, and we believe the momentum that we have created will continue into the foreseeable future. We continue to believe that we have a well-positioned portfolio, benefiting from many positive secular trends: our pool business serves a large installed base; water treatment helps solve water quality issues for residential and commercial customers; and Industrial & Flow Technologies serves some attractive niches like biogas, in addition to a large installed base of pumps. While our consumer businesses are seasonal, we do not believe them to be cyclical.
While our focus is on driving the core to create consistent value creation, we are investing in a few strategic growth initiatives to accelerate the top line. These include getting closer to the consumer in pool, expanding water treatment further into services, and biogas and carbon capture within Industrial & Flow Technologies. As we drive transformation more broadly across the entire enterprise, we expect that this will drive both ROS expansion and help fund growth initiatives. Finally, we believe our balance sheet provides a great degree of flexibility to drive further upside, primarily through M&A tied to our strategic growth initiatives.
I would now like to turn the call over to Bob to discuss our performance and our financial results in more detail, after which I will provide an update on our overall strategic position. Bob?"

Please turn to Slide 6 labeled Q2 2021 Pentair Performance. Second quarter sales grew 32%, with core sales increasing 28%. Consumer Solutions grew core sales nearly 40%, and Industrial & Flow Technologies delivered core sales growth of 12",1144,"Thank you, John. Please turn to Slide 6 labeled Q2 2021 Pentair Performance. Second quarter sales grew 32%, with core sales increasing 28%. Consumer Solutions grew core sales nearly 40%, and Industrial & Flow Technologies delivered core sales growth of 12%, its second consecutive quarter of growth. Segment income was up 40%, and return on sales expanded 110 basis points to 18.6%. Adjusted EPS increased 42% to $0.84.
Consistent with our guidance, the second quarter did not see price fully offset inflation, as we saw higher inflation that we have continued to implement price increases to help offset. The second half should see price costs start to even out, but an unprecedented amount of material and wage inflation, coupled with robust demand, has contributed to price reading out at a slower pace.
Corporate expense was $26 million in the, quarter as we recorded higher levels of compensation expense given the performance our businesses have delivered this year. Our tax rate was 17.4% in the quarter as we now expect the full year tax rate to approximate 16%. This is due primarily to higher levels of North American income as our residential businesses continued to grow at strong double-digit levels.
Please turn to Slide 7 labeled Q2 2021 Consumer Solutions Performance. Consumer Solutions sales growth was 44% as both businesses delivered strong double-digit growth. Segment income increased 48%, and return on sales expanded 80 basis points to 24.9%. Consumer Solutions experienced significant inflation during the first half as demand continued to grow.
Pool experienced sales growth of 50% in the quarter. While we have seen significant growth 2 quarters in a row to start the year, we believe pool dealers are doing their best to keep up with robust demand. The theme of consumers investing in their backyards continued.
The pool team has significantly increased capacity even in the face of material shortages and inflation. Backlog remains at record levels, and orders have more than doubled. Even with the record year, we believe the improvement in orders and strong backlog gives us improved visibility that growth will continue looking ahead to next year.
The macro trends continue to be favorable, and the installed base of pools continue to grow. Demand for new pools remained strong, with many builders reporting backlogs into next year. We believe consumers remain committed to enhancing their at-home quality of life, and enjoying a pool is a major part of the experience for many consumers. In addition to new pool construction, aftermarket growth remains strong as consumers have used their pools more.
Water treatment delivered 35% sales growth as residential demand remained robust and commercial showed strong signs of post-pandemic recovery. Our residential business grew nearly 20%, and our commercial business grew sales by over 40%, excluding the contribution from KBI in the quarter.
Overall, we believe Consumer Solutions is well positioned to deliver continued double-digit growth in the second half based on strong order and backlog trends. We expect price to read out further in the second half and close the gap on the higher inflation experienced in the first half.
Please turn to Slide 8 labeled Q2 2021 Industrial & Flow Technologies Performance. Industrial & Flow Technologies increased sales 17% in the quarter, as its end markets further recovered and the business continued to execute its strategy. Segment income increased 30%, and return on sales expanded 160 basis points to 15.7%. Residential flow grew at a double-digit rate for the third consecutive quarter. Orders continued to exceed sales, and we expect the seasonal business to end the year well positioned within all of its channels. Commercial flow increased sales 11% and further built backlog. The commercial recovery has gained momentum, with orders continuing to improve. We expect growth to continue for this smaller part of the segment.
Industrial filtration delivered 14% sales growth, as the shorter-cycle aftermarket showed further signs of improvement, particularly within food and beverage. We experienced double-digit increases in both orders and backlog. Industrial & Flow Technologies remains focused on reducing complexity, selective growth and margin expansion.
Please turn to Slide 9 labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. Free cash flow continued to be a great story, with over $100 million improvement year-over-year. We generated $340 million of free cash in the first half. We have returned $117 million to shareholders through dividends and buybacks in the first half. We also repaid a $104 million bond that matured during the quarter and paid approximately $80 million to acquire KBI.
Although we continue to invest our capital wisely, we ended the quarter at just under 1x leverage. We are extremely proud and excited to see our return on invested capital exceed 18%. As we look at our cash flow needs going forward, we plan to remain disciplined in our capital allocation approach. We plan to continue working the M&A pipeline and to buy back at least $150 million of our shares this year.
Please turn to Slide 10 labeled Q3 and Full Year 2021 Pentair Outlook. We are initiating third quarter and updating our full year 2021 guidance. For the quarter, we expect sales to grow 16% to 19%, segment income to grow 18% to 23% and adjusted EPS to grow 16% to 21% to a range of $0.81 to $0.85. Our forecast reflects our expectations that material shortages and inflation are not going away nor will they improve materially.
For the full year, we expect sales to grow 21% to 23%, segment income to increase 30% to 34% and  adjusted EPS to grow 32% to 36% to a range of $3.30 to $3.40. Embedded in our full year sales guidance is anticipated growth in Consumer Solutions, around 30%, with pool expected to be up nearly 40% and water treatment up over 20%, as commercial is expected to further recover and KBI is expected to contribute in the second half. Also incorporated in the revised guidance is anticipated low double-digit growth for Industrial & Flow Technologies.
Below the operating line, we expect corporate expense to be around $80 million, given the higher levels of compensation expense in 2021 given the record performance expected this year. We expect corporate expense to go back to more normalized levels next year. We now expect net interest to be in the range of $15 million to $16 million and our tax rate to be around 16%. We anticipate the share count to average between 167 million and 168 million shares for the full year.
Capital expenditures are expected to be around $60 million, while depreciation and amortization is anticipated to be around $80 million. We continue to target free cash flow to be greater than or equal to net income.
I would now like to turn the call over to Michelle for Q&A, after which John will have a few closing remarks. Michelle, please open the line for questions. Thank you."

And then we've got to work on next year, which we feel is also going to be strong demand.
I think another level of confidence is we've been able to start to attract labor and keep labor in our pool factories, which has been -- was harder to do 3 to 4 months ago. And we're starting to manage the supply chain, the uniqueness of that, availability of product and be able to demonstrate the agility in the factories to get product out to customers. So those are the differences of how we feel. As far as higher confidence or not, Mike, I think we've always been confident this is a good business and that this is a good demand, but we wanted to make sure we were able to make progress on meeting that demand throughout the year."

One, we had the Department of Engineering (sic) [ Department of Energy ] changeover from single speed to variable. So we're already expecting that we're going to see strong growth in that particular product line. And then obviously, the acceleration of new pools and remodeled pools is really putting a significant demand nationally on that product, and that is the same product generally sold in all of the pool regions.
And then state by state, you've got these disruptions like Texas that has been disruptive for everybody and the fact that all of that aftermarket demand still needs to be satisfied off of what happened with the freezes. And then the rest of the markets, I would say that they're just accelerated, meaning that the rate of new builds are consistent across those areas. And then the aftermarket demand replacement cycles or the additive, ""I want more products for my pad,"" have been traditionally across the Sun Belt states. So right now, it's -- I would say the demand is not easing, and we're all trying to catch up with that demand and work through our supply partners to do that."

I know it sounds like from listening to other supply chain players, the general expectation is for about 110,000 or so, call it, this year. But wondering if you think that number grows next year.

And then where we're really pleased is the penetration rate of the products on the pad and more and more awareness of heaters, automation, salt-based chlorinators. Those types of products are where we've really seen the acceleration.

But think of price reading out at closer to 4 points in the back half. So we improve from Q2 and narrow the gap, but it continues to be a challenge.
And the whole material shortages is a challenge for our ops and supply team. And we're really appreciative of all of the work that, that team has done. In the second quarter, they really did a nice job, helping us drive that 32% sales growth. They did have the luxury of more raw material sitting in that opening inventory. So as we move into Q3 and Q4, the challenge for the team is really to deal with the lumpiness of the material shortages.

So that's where I'm really super excited.
We also saw and we shared this openly that as people use their pools, more the heater matters. And that was always a nice-to-have on the pad in -- on the older builds. And as they -- most people remodel now, they're putting those heaters in, both for the spa and for the pool.
So we've seen the trends in lighting earlier. We saw the trends working around some of the variable speed pump penetration.

So I would confirm that the pipeline of opportunities is very robust. A lot of complexity, reduction initiatives. There are some huge opportunities to drive margin expansion and to really help with those Analyst Day numbers. We said in the prepared remarks that even with a higher guide this year, we're going to go ahead and add on to this year, the 300 basis points of margin expansion into the future with -- while revenue will grow at that mid-single digit plus number that we shared at Analyst Day. So transformation will be a big part to us achieving those results. And embedded in all of this is ease of doing business with Pentair. So it will be a much, much better situation for our distributors and dealers as well."

A little lumpy through COVID with the ability to get in people's houses or not, as far as what we're trying to do there, but now to a point where I think we've got steady-state growth.
If you recall, when commercial happened, there was generally a closure of most restaurants and hospitality and that's the -- and offices where people drink water, and that was a huge setback for our business last Q2. That has slowly been recovering as people return to more of the normal of the way it used to be pre-COVID, but we're not yet back globally to where we expect it to be.
I think our addition of KBI gives us the ability to add services components on top of products, which strategically is what we think our customers want.

Please turn to Slide #4, titled Executive Summary. I'd like to thank -- start by thanking our Pentair teams for delivering an outstanding third quarter in the face of unprecedented material shortages and inflation. We were pleased to once again deliver strong double-digit sales and EPS gains. While it's easy to focus on the supply chain and inflation challenges that we all currently face, it is also important to appreciate how strong 2021 has been for Pentair. 
Year-to-date, we have delivered 25% sales growth, nearly 40% segment income growth. We've expanded margins 170 basis points and growing EPS 40%. We have said that we view our businesses as more seasonal than cyclical, and our robust backlogs give us further confidence in our ability to continue our strong momentum in Q4 and into 2022. In addition to the strong sales and earnings growth, we have generated over $500 million of free cash flow this year, and our balance sheet is strong. We ended the quarter under onetime levered, and I am especially proud of our 19% ROIC. 
We have completed 2 acquisitions this year that further advanced our strategy. We acquired KBI earlier this year that added commercial services capabilities to our growing water treatment business. We recently completed the Pico acquisition that brings strong aftermarket filtration products not only to our flagship pool business, but also to our Industrial Filtration business. 
Given the strong third quarter performance, we are tightening our full year guidance range, which Bob will give additional color on shortly. There remains a lot of uncertainty as we end the year given the ongoing material shortages, logistical challenges and inflation. In fact, we experienced more inflation in the third quarter of 2021 than we did in the full year of 2020. 
We have gone out with multiple price increases across most of our businesses this year. There is a lag from when price increases are announced and when we recognize them, particularly given our strong sales and backlog growth this year. The good news, however, is we ship strong pricing tailwind entering next year. This has been a great year, and we believe we have a lot more runway ahead to become an even stronger company. 
Please turn to Slide 5, labeled Building a Track Record of Consistent Growth. We believe our strong performance over the past several quarters reinforces that we are in the right spaces for the future. Our portfolio of industry-leading products and now services help consumers move, improve and enjoy their water in addition to a growing industrial filtration business focused on faster-growing niches such as sustainable gas. We are building a track record of consistent growth. Our residential businesses have enjoyed robust growth, and we believe there's more to come. Our commercial and industrial businesses have been recovering back to 2019 levels, and backlogs have been building in these longer-cycle businesses. 
We are making great progress in building out our strategic growth initiatives. As I mentioned previously, we have completed 2 acquisitions this year that furthered our pool and our water treatment strategies. We are also driving transformation to both unlock value and to fund growth. While some of our businesses are further along the journey, we have identified a strong funnel of opportunities to help us become more productive, better serve our customers and drive growth and margin expansion. 
Our balance sheet is another lever available that offers great flexibility to invest in our core, return cash to shareowners and to fund strategic acquisitions. 2021 has been a great year for Pentair and we believe there's a lot more yet to come. I would now like to turn the call over to Bob to discuss our performance and our financial results in more detail, after which I will provide an update on our overall strategic position. Bob?"
295688,1684949952,2412578,"Pentair plc, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2021",2021-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Pentair plc","Executives","Thank you, John. Please turn to Slide 6 labeled Q3 2021 Pentair Performance. Third quarter sales grew 21%, with core sales increasing 18%. Consumer Solutions grew core sales 26%, and Industrial & Flow Technologies delivered core sales growth of 8%. Segmen",1176,"Thank you, John. Please turn to Slide 6 labeled Q3 2021 Pentair Performance. Third quarter sales grew 21%, with core sales increasing 18%. Consumer Solutions grew core sales 26%, and Industrial & Flow Technologies delivered core sales growth of 8%. Segment income was up 28% and return on sales expanded 90 basis points to 18.5%. 
Adjusted EPS increased 27% to $0.89. Inflation continues to be a significant headwind, but we saw price nearly offset it in the third quarter. Corporate expense was $17 million in the quarter, and our tax rate was 16% in the quarter. Overall, the third quarter was another solid performance across the enterprise as our teams continue to deliver in the face of material shortages, logistical challenges and inflation. 
Please turn to Slide 7 labeled Q3 2021 Consumer Solutions Performance. Consumer Solutions sales growth was 30% as both businesses continue to perform at record levels. Segment income increased 27%, while return on sales contracted as price did not fully keep up with the significant inflation headwind. While we have implemented additional price increases, our record backlogs and strong double-digit growth create a lag from when the price -- new prices read out. We believe this creates a tailwind on price entering next year, but inflation does not appear to be moderating. 
Pook experienced sales growth of 32% in the quarter and was up 5% sequentially. Demand in the industry remains strong even as the full fiscal year ends and activity begins to moderate. In fact, dealers are booked well into the third quarter of next year, which we anticipate will result in another strong pool season next year. Favorable mortgage rates, continued increases in home equity and the ongoing trend of suburban migration are all contributing to robust demand for the industry. 
We continue to see strong demand for our variable speed pumps as new efficiency regulations drive transition from single-speed pumps. The majority of our mix has shifted to variable speed. 2021 has been a good year for new products, including our Intelli bright, HD Light and higher energy-efficient tiers. We expect next year to be another strong year, including advancements in filtration and continued expansion of connected products. Demand for new pools remain strong with many builders reporting backlogs into the latter half of next year. Our record backlog and favorable demographic trends give us increased confidence and momentum as we look to next year. 
Water Treatment delivered 28% sales growth as residential demand remained robust and commercial showed strong signs of post-pandemic recovery. We saw our direct-to-consumer business improving leads and closings in several new markets, and we continue to evolve our business model. We've made great progress in rebranding the business and are also building out our service capabilities. 
The commercial recovery continued and the integration of KBI is going well. We had a total water management win in the quarter that was a great example of taking a product sale and adding installation and services with an existing KBI customer. While restaurant foot traffic is still not back to 2019 levels, average ticket prices are up and the result is continued improvement in orders and backlog for what has historically been a shorter cycle business. 
While Consumer Solutions has felt the biggest impact from inflation and material shortages in the short term, we have successfully implemented multiple price increases that are yet to fully read out and strong backlog levels point to anticipated continued growth for the segment. 
Please turn to Slide 8, labeled Q3 2021 Industrial & Flow Technologies Performance. Industrial & Flow Technologies increased sales 8% in the quarter, while segment income grew 23% and return on sales expanded 180 basis points to 14.8%. Residential flow grew at a double-digit rate for the fourth consecutive quarter. This growth was accomplished even in the face of supply chain constraints that are not showing signs of mitigating. Our customers have continued to experience strong sell-through, which gives us confidence that we will continue to grow. Price is also beginning to read out further and should be a tailwind entering next year. 
Commercial flow increased sales 6% in the quarter. The focus in commercial flow continues to be on complexity reduction, better price realization and building out the aftermarket business, given the large installed base. 
Industrial Filtration delivered 8% sales growth, led once again by recovery in the shorter cycle business of food and beverage. We continue to see strong orders, and our sustainable gas business had strong backlog growth and a growing order funnel where we experienced an improvement in our win rate. IFT is building momentum on return on sales expansion and our transformation initiatives, coupled with price realization improving, we believe, should drive more improvement going forward. 
Please turn to Slide 9, labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. Free cash flow continued to be a great story as we have generated over $500 million year-to-date. We have returned $200 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase during 2021. The balance sheet ended the quarter exceptionally strong with leverage remaining under 1x. Return on invested capital ended the quarter at 19%, a number we are particularly proud of. We had a higher-than-average amount of cash on hand at the end of the quarter as we awaited the completion of the Petco acquisition, which occurred last week. Our balance sheet gives us a great deal of flexibility to invest in our strategic growth initiatives, both organically and through strategic acquisitions like KBI and FleetCo. 
Please turn to Slide 10 labeled Q4 and Full Year 2021 Pentair Outlook. We are initiating fourth quarter and updating our full year 2021 guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to grow 15% to 19%; segment income to grow 16% to 24%; and adjusted EPS to grow 16% to 24% to a range of $0.81 to $0.87. Our forecast reflects ongoing material availability headwinds and higher inflation. For the full year, we expect sales to grow 22% to 23%; segment income to increase 32% to 34%; and adjusted EPS to grow 34% to 36% to a range of $3.34 to $3.40. 
In addition to supply chain and logistics challenges, we would also remind investors that the fourth quarter historically incurs a seasonal slowdown for many of our residential businesses as the weather turns less favorable for outdoor activity in addition to fewer work days around the holidays. 
Below the operating line, we continue to expect corporate expense to be around $80 million. We now expect net interest to be around $15 million, and our tax rate assumption remains around 16%. We anticipate the share count to be around $167.5 million both for the quarter and the full year. Capital expenditures are expected to be around $60 million, while depreciation and amortization is anticipated to be about $80 million. We continue to target free cash flow to be greater than net income. 
I would now like to turn the call over to Stephanie for Q&A, after which John will have a few closing remarks. Stephanie, please open the line for questions."

Unfortunately, inflation continues to be a headwind as we look at the fourth quarter. I think that Consumer Solutions, there's probably the bigger impact of the margin challenge with the bigger backlog and the fact that prices reading out a little bit more slowly in that business. I think we'll continue to see a challenged margin, at least, in the fourth quarter.

The other point I would make is -- and you saw a little of this in the quarter, despite KBI being a very strategic acquisition, it is a services business. Services businesses don't have the large margin profile, and so it's not going to have the same margin profile as Consumer Solutions so it is slightly dilutive to margins. And as we bring Petco in as well, even though it's a really highly valuable asset and one that we think is going to have great runway in the aftermarket side, it will also have a lower margin profile than Consumer Solutions today. So both of those will be a slight drag on the margins but both are various strategic tuck-ins that we think add significant value over the long time."

That's where I would share with you what that contribution is. As Bob said, we don't think we see the supply chain ramping up between Q3 and Q4. While there's still a strong demand, we don't think it's prudent to anticipate that we would ship more in Q4, given that there's holiday seasons that are also clamoring for the same ports and the same trade routes that we're trying to get to. So we're doing the best we can to sequentially improve every single quarter. And I think we made great progress from last year into Q1 to Q2 to Q3. And now what we're suggesting is it's wise to think that we're flattish in our ability to get product out the door from Q4 -- people's homes to treat water treatment. And those businesses are seasonal, not too many people look to do that over the holiday season. And as I've mentioned, that's why we usually see a Q3 to Q4 dip in those particular offerings.

You create that logistics and end-to-end freight costs are pretty sizable, not just for us but for our partners. So how do we get after that with price. 
Second on sourcing, how do we lean in on sourcing and really look at global supply chains on a total landed cost basis and make sure we're making the best choices. And the SKU rationalization is a big enabler there as well. The third one is the manufacturing and distribution footprint. I think the distribution one gives us a big opportunity. And the fourth one is the organizational enablement. And that's really about making sure that as we find new channels, new adjacencies, we're getting productivity from the old way of doing things to fund the new way that we want to do things. And so those are the 4 big pillars, transformation. We made a lot of progress, and we hope to create tailwinds to 2022 from those initiatives."

So let's just say hypothetically the Fed does tap the brakes early next year, inflation pretty quickly comes down. Some of your raws go down, your freight goes down. How should we think about price in that scenario? Do you keep a lot of that price in that scenario and realize the margin upside, at least for a while? And how long could that be?

That's an easier mitigation strategy than trying to get new price in an area where people are anticipating the inflationary pressures to subside. So I think those -- that's the scenario planning that we're going through, which is why we're not ready to share 2022 with yet.

So there's a little timing delay related to that backlog. The other business model we have is project-based. And you've got to predict where your price increases need to be to reflect the inflationary pressures that are out there 6 to 9 months in advance. And that's always the hardest to get right, especially in these environments. And then the third one would be more OEM or larger customer-based business models, where, again, you're in a process of negotiation. And before those price increases go in, you got to get both sides degree on what that partnership looks like. And so those are the 3 basic premises.

They cross all of our residential streams from -- also including R&I flow or our small pump lines and as well as our water treatment and our pool applications. So I think one of the bright spots I've seen this year is that we continue to see the automation penetration pool in addition to the upgrades that we saw across the pad, both for new pool builds and in the aftermarket side. Sometimes in the busy seasons, you don't see people also upgrading to those solutions. And so that was very positive. And we're starting to make progress on our IoT-related valves for water treatment and also our pressure treatment in our small pumps. So really good progress. And I think we're getting good feedback on that capability and the usage from our channel, and we're excited about the momentum we're really building.

So obviously, when you look at it year-over-year, it's a piece. But when you go back and look at the start of this, which for us was Q2 of 2020, we've seen the significant demand and that demand has turned into supply pressures. And then we've seen the corresponding inflation across the freight and all the other components here. So I mean, I'm not going to give an exact answer because I know you -- everybody's asked me in every single way, but we've got to price appropriately to cover the anticipated inflation that we see coming to us in 2022.

Please turn to Slide #4, titled Executive Summary. I'd like to thank -- start by thanking our Pentair teams for delivering an outstanding third quarter in the face of unprecedented material shortages and inflation. We were pleased to once again deliver strong double-digit sales and EPS gains. While it's easy to focus on the supply chain and inflation challenges that we all currently face, it is also important to appreciate how strong 2021 has been for Pentair.  
Year-to-date, we have delivered 25% sales growth, nearly 40% segment income growth, we've expanded margins 170 basis points and growing EPS 40%. We have said that we view our businesses as more seasonal than cyclical, and our robust backlogs give us further confidence in our ability to continue our strong momentum in Q4 and into 2022. In addition to the strong sales and earnings growth, we have generated over $500 million of free cash flow this year, and our balance sheet is strong. We ended the quarter under one-time levered, and I am especially proud of our 19% ROIC.  
We have completed 2 acquisitions this year that further advanced our strategy. We acquired KBI earlier this year that added commercial services capabilities to our growing water treatment business. We recently completed the Pleatco acquisition that brings strong aftermarket filtration products, not only to our flagship pool business, but also to our industrial filtration business.  
Given the strong third quarter performance, we are tightening our full year guidance range, which Bob will give additional color on shortly. There remains a lot of uncertainty as we end the year given the ongoing material shortages, logistical challenges and inflation. In fact, we experienced more inflation in the third quarter of 2021 than we did in the full year of 2020. 
We have gone out with multiple price increases across most of our businesses this year. There is a lag from when price increases are announced and when we recognize them, particularly given our strong sales and backlog growth this year. The good news, however, is we shift strong pricing tailwind entering next year. This has been a great year, and we believe we have a lot more runway ahead to become an even stronger company.  
Please turn to Slide 5, labeled Building a Track Record of Consistent Growth. We believe our strong performance over the past several quarters reinforces that we are in the right spaces for the future. Our portfolio of industry-leading products and now services help consumers move, improve and enjoy their water in addition to a growing industrial filtration business focused on faster-growing niches such as sustainable gas.  
We are building a track record of consistent growth. Our residential businesses have enjoyed robust growth, and we believe there's more to come. Our commercial and industrial businesses have been recovering back to 2019 levels, and backlogs have been building in these longer-cycle businesses. 
We are making great progress in building out our strategic growth initiatives. As I mentioned previously, we have completed 2 acquisitions this year that furthered our pool and our water treatment strategies. We are also driving transformation to both unlock value and to fund growth. While some of our businesses are further along the journey, we have identified a strong funnel of opportunities to help us become more productive, better serve our customers and drive growth and margin expansion.  
Our balance sheet is another lever available that offers great flexibility to invest in our core, return cash to shareowners and to fund strategic acquisitions. 2021 has been a great year for Pentair and we believe there's a lot more yet to come. 
I would now like to turn the call over to Bob to discuss our performance and our financial results in more detail, after which I will provide an update on our overall strategic position. Bob?"

Please turn to Slide 6 labeled Q3 2021 Pentair Performance. Third quarter sales grew 21%, with core sales increasing 18%. Consumer Solutions grew core sales 26%, and Industrial & Flow Technologies delivered core sales growth of 8%. Segmen",1173,"Thank you, John. Please turn to Slide 6 labeled Q3 2021 Pentair Performance. Third quarter sales grew 21%, with core sales increasing 18%. Consumer Solutions grew core sales 26%, and Industrial & Flow Technologies delivered core sales growth of 8%. Segment income was up 28% and return on sales expanded 90 basis points to 18.5%.  
Adjusted EPS increased 27% to $0.89. Inflation continues to be a significant headwind, but we saw price nearly offset it in the third quarter. Corporate expense was $17 million in the quarter, and our tax rate was 16% in the quarter. Overall, the third quarter was another solid performance across the enterprise as our teams continue to deliver in the face of material shortages, logistical challenges and inflation.  
Please turn to Slide 7 labeled Q3 2021 Consumer Solutions Performance. Consumer Solutions sales growth was 30% as both businesses continue to perform at record levels. Segment income increased 27%, while return on sales contracted as price did not fully keep up with the significant inflation headwind. While we have implemented additional price increases, our record backlogs and strong double-digit growth create a lag from when the price -- new prices read out. We believe this creates a tailwind on price entering next year, but inflation does not appear to be moderating.  
Pool experienced sales growth of 32% in the quarter and was up 5% sequentially. Demand in the industry remains strong even as the full fiscal year ends and activity begins to moderate. In fact, dealers are booked well into the third quarter of next year, which we anticipate will result in another strong pool season next year.  Favorable mortgage rates, continued increases in home equity and the ongoing trend of suburban migration are all contributing to robust demand for the industry. 
We continue to see strong demand for our variable speed pumps as new efficiency regulations drive transition from single-speed pumps. The majority of our mix has shifted to variable speed. 2021 has been a good year for new products, including our IntelliBrite HD light and higher energy-efficient tiers. We expect next year to be another strong year, including advancements in filtration and continued expansion of connected products.  
Demand for new pools remain strong with many builders reporting backlogs into the latter half of next year. Our record backlog and favorable demographic trends give us increased confidence and momentum as we look to next year.  
Water treatment delivered 28% sales growth as residential demand remained robust and commercial showed strong signs of post-pandemic recovery. We saw our direct-to-consumer business improving leads and closings in several new markets, and we continue to evolve our business model. We've made great progress in rebranding the business and are also building out our service capabilities.  
The commercial recovery continued and the integration of KBI is going well. We had a total water management win in the quarter, that was a great example of taking a product sale and adding installation and services with an existing KBI customer. While restaurant foot traffic is still not back to 2019 levels, average ticket prices are up and the result is continued improvement in orders and backlog for what has historically been a shorter cycle business.  
While Consumer Solutions has felt the biggest impact from inflation and material shortages in the short-term, we have successfully implemented multiple price increases that are yet to fully read out and strong backlog levels point to anticipated continued growth for the segment.  
Please turn to Slide 8, labeled Q3 2021 Industrial & Flow Technologies Performance. Industrial & Flow Technologies increased sales 8% in the quarter, while segment income grew 23% and return on sales expanded 180 basis points to 14.8%. 
Residential flow grew at a double-digit rate for the fourth consecutive quarter. This growth was accomplished even in the face of supply chain constraints that are not showing signs of mitigating. Our customers have continued to experience strong sell-through, which gives us confidence that we will continue to grow. Price is also beginning to read out further and should be a tailwind entering next year.  
Commercial flow increased sales 6% in the quarter. The focus in commercial flow continues to be on complexity reduction, better price realization and building out the aftermarket business, given the large installed base.  
Industrial filtration delivered 8% sales growth, led once again by recovery in the shorter cycle business of food and beverage. We continue to see strong orders, and our sustainable gas business had strong backlog growth and a growing order funnel where we experienced an improvement in our win rate. 
IFT is building momentum on return on sales expansion and our transformation initiatives, coupled with price realization improving, we believe, should drive more improvement going forward.  
Please turn to Slide 9, labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. Free cash flow continued to be a great story as we have generated over $500 million year-to-date. We have returned $200 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase during 2021. The balance sheet ended the quarter exceptionally strong with leverage remaining under 1x. 
Return on invested capital ended the quarter at 19%, a number we are particularly proud of. We had a higher-than-average amount of cash on hand at the end of the quarter as we awaited the completion of the Pleatco acquisition, which occurred last week. Our balance sheet gives us a great deal of flexibility to invest in our strategic growth initiatives, both organically and through strategic acquisitions like KBI and Pleatco.
Please turn to Slide 10 labeled Q4 and Full Year 2021 Pentair Outlook. We are initiating fourth quarter and updating our full year 2021 guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to grow 15% to 19%; segment income to grow 16% to 24%; and adjusted EPS to grow 16% to 24% to a range of $0.81 to $0.87. Our forecast reflects ongoing material availability headwinds and higher inflation. 
For the full year, we expect sales to grow 22% to 23%; segment income to increase 32% to 34%; and adjusted EPS to grow 34% to 36% to a range of $3.34 to $3.40.  
In addition to supply chain and logistics challenges, we would also remind investors that the fourth quarter historically incurs a seasonal slowdown for many of our residential businesses as the weather turns less favorable for outdoor activity in addition to fewer workdays around the holidays. 
Below the operating line, we continue to expect corporate expense to be around $80 million. We now expect net interest to be around $15 million, and our tax rate assumption remains around 16%. We anticipate the share count to be around 167.5 million, both for the quarter and the full year. 
Capital expenditures are expected to be around $60 million, while depreciation and amortization is anticipated to be about $80 million. We continue to target free cash flow to be greater than net income.  
I would now like to turn the call over to Stephanie for Q&A, after which John will have a few closing remarks. Stephanie, please open the line for questions."

Unfortunately, inflation continues to be a headwind as we look at the fourth quarter. I think that Consumer Solutions, there's probably the bigger impact of the margin challenge with the bigger backlog and the fact that prices reading out a little bit more slowly in that business. I think we'll continue to see a challenged margin, at least, in the fourth quarter. For IFP, they have some really nice productivity improvements, and so margins should continue to improve even though inflation continues to be a challenge."

The other point I would make is -- and you saw a little of this in the quarter, despite KBI being a very strategic acquisition, it is a services business. Services businesses don't have the large margin profile, and so it's not going to have the same margin profile as Consumer Solutions so it is slightly dilutive to margins. And as we bring Pleatco in as well, even though it's a really highly valuable asset and one that we think is going to have great runway in the aftermarket side, it will also have a lower margin profile than Consumer Solutions today. So both of those will be a slight drag on the margins but both are various strategic tuck-ins that we think add significant value over the long time."

That's where I would share with you what that contribution is. 
As Bob said, we don't think we see the supply chain ramping up between Q3 and Q4. While there's still a strong demand, we don't think it's prudent to anticipate that we would ship more in Q4, given that there's holiday seasons that are also clamoring for the same ports and the same trade routes that we're trying to get to. So we're doing the best we can to sequentially improve every single quarter. And I think we made great progress from last year into Q1 to Q2 to Q3. And now what we're suggesting is it's wise to think that we're flattish in our ability to get product out the door from Q4 to Q3.
The seasonality of the businesses which is normal is more of our service businesses, the businesses that go into people's homes to treat water treatment. And those businesses are seasonal, but not too many people look to do that over the holiday season. And as I've mentioned, that's why we usually see a Q3 to Q4 dip in those particular offerings. So normal seasonality with the belief that we're not going to raise our expectations beyond what we delivered in Q3."

I have desires to have a 4 in front of that gross margin as we exit the transformation period that we talked about. And most of the levers that we're pulling, we believe that pricing is a big initiative and we're leaning into that with outside help, more looking at our value adds and looking at end-to-end cost and trying to think about even our partners cost and how we help mitigate some of the expense. We created that logistics and end-to-end freight costs are pretty sizable, not just for us but for our partners. So how do we get after that with price. 
Second one, sourcing, how do we lean in on sourcing and really look at global supply chains on a total landed cost basis and make sure we're making the best choices. And the SKU rationalization is a big enabler there as well. The third one is the manufacturing and distribution footprint. I think the distribution one gives us a big opportunity. And the fourth one is the organizational enablement. And that's really about making sure that as we find new channels, new adjacencies, we're getting productivity from the old way of doing things to fund the new way that we want to do things. And so those are the 4 big pillars, transformation. We made a lot of progress, and we hope to create tailwinds to 2022 from those initiatives."

So let's just say hypothetically the Fed does tap the brakes early next year, inflation pretty quickly comes down. Some of your raws go down, your freight goes down. How should we think about price in that scenario? Do you keep a lot of that price in that scenario and realize the margin upside, at least for a while? And how long could that be? Or do you think that the competitive dynamics in that kind of a scenario would dictate that the price has given back pretty quickly?

Because if that happens and we're out in front -- because we've been trying to catch up on price all year long, but if we can get out in front of it, then the worst-case scenario is that we start to trim back pricing to our channel to basically reflect the lower inflation rate that we have. That's an easier mitigation strategy than trying to get new price in an area where people are anticipating the inflationary pressures to subside. 
So I think those -- that's the scenario planning that we're going through, which is why we're not ready to share 2022 with yet. But I'm going to lean towards that we think inflation and supply chain challenges continue. And the worst-case scenario is we dial back from there."

And our manufacturing, build the stock, make the stock that goes through dealer distributors are the most responsive to inflationary pressures and price increases normally. This year is a little unique in the sense that we've had these large backlogs, and it's hard we're not going to go back and reprice backlog, right? So there's a little timing delay related to that backlog. 
The other business model we have is project-based. And you've got to predict where your price increases need to be to reflect the inflationary pressures that are out there 6 to 9 months in advance. And that's always the hardest to get right, especially in these environments. 
And then the third one would be more OEM or larger customer-based business models, where, again, you're in a process of negotiation. And before those price increases go in, you got to get both sides degree on what that partnership looks like. And so those are the 3 basic premises. And so obviously, to make the stock a little easier in most normal times. The project, you have to be more careful and the OEM is just a negotiation of ensuring that everybody got the best productivity in the cycle."

I think the way to think about it is, when you look at it year-over-year, you have to add what it also increased the previous year. And so when we think about adding to the price increases next year, I mean, it's important to realize how inflation is compounded from 2020 and '21 and then how much more will be added as we go into 2022. So obviously, when you look at it year-over-year, it's a piece. But when you go back and look at the start of this, which for us was Q2 of 2020, we've seen the significant demand and that demand has turned into supply pressures. And then we've seen the corresponding inflation across the freight and all the other components here. 
So I think, I'm not going to give an exact answer because I know you -- everybody's asked me in every single way, but we've got to price appropriately to cover the anticipated inflation that we see coming to us in 2022. We don't yet have that number and when we do, we'll share it, but we're going to price appropriately."

Please turn to Slide #4, titled Executive Summary. I'd like to thank -- start by thanking our Pentair teams for delivering an outstanding third quarter in the face of unprecedented material shortages and inflation. We were pleased to once again deliver strong double-digit sales and EPS gains. While it's easy to focus on the supply chain and inflation challenges that we all currently face, it is also important to appreciate how strong 2021 has been for Pentair. 
Year-to-date, we have delivered 25% sales growth, nearly 40% segment income growth, we've expanded margins 170 basis points and growing EPS 40%. We have said that we view our businesses as more seasonal than cyclical, and our robust backlogs give us further confidence in our ability to continue our strong momentum in Q4 and into 2022. In addition to the strong sales and earnings growth, we have generated over $500 million of free cash flow this year, and our balance sheet is strong. We ended the quarter under one-time levered, and I am especially proud of our 19% ROIC. 
We have completed 2 acquisitions this year that further advanced our strategy. We acquired KBI earlier this year that added commercial services capabilities to our growing water treatment business. We recently completed the Pleatco acquisition that brings strong aftermarket filtration products not only to our flagship pool business but also to our industrial filtration business. 
Given the strong third quarter performance, we are tightening our full year guidance range, which Bob will give additional color on shortly. There remains a lot of uncertainty as we end the year given the ongoing material shortages, logistical challenges and inflation. In fact, we experienced more inflation in the third quarter of 2021 than we did in the full year of 2020. 
We have gone out with multiple price increases across most of our businesses this year. There's a lag from when price increases are announced and when we recognize them, particularly given our strong sales and backlog growth this year. The good news, however, is we have strong pricing tailwind entering next year. This has been a great year, and we believe we have a lot more runway ahead to become an even stronger company. 
Please turn to Slide 5, labeled Building a Track Record of Consistent Growth. We believe our strong performance over the past several quarters reinforces that we are in the right spaces for the future. Our portfolio of industry-leading products and now services help consumers move, improve and enjoy their water in addition to a growing industrial filtration business focused on faster-growing niches such as sustainable gas. 
We are building a track record of consistent growth. Our residential businesses have enjoyed robust growth, and we believe there's more to come. Our commercial and industrial businesses have been recovering back to 2019 levels, and backlogs have been building in these longer-cycle businesses. We are making great progress in building out our strategic growth initiatives. As I mentioned previously, we have completed 2 acquisitions this year that furthered our pool and our water treatment strategies. We are also driving transformation to both unlock value and to fund growth. While some of our businesses are further along the journey, we have identified a strong funnel of opportunities to help us become more productive, better serve our customers, and drive growth and margin expansion. 
Our balance sheet is another lever available that offers great flexibility to invest in our core, return cash to shareowners, and to fund strategic acquisitions. 2021 has been a great year for Pentair and we believe there's a lot more yet to come. 
I would now like to turn the call over to Bob to discuss our performance and our financial results in more detail, after which I will provide an update on our overall strategic position. Bob?"

Please turn to Slide 6 labeled Q3 2021 Pentair Performance. 
Third quarter sales grew 21%, with core sales increasing 18%. Consumer Solutions grew core sales 26%, and Industrial & Flow Technologies delivered core sales growth of 8%. Segment income was up 28% and return on sales expanded 90 basis points to 18.5%. Adjusted EPS increased 27% to $0.89. Inflation continues to be a significant headwind, but we saw price nearly offset it in the third quarter. Corporate expense was $17 million in the quarter, and our tax rate was 16% in the quarter. Overall, the third quarter was another solid performance across the enterprise as our teams continue to deliver in the face of material shortages, logistical challenges, and inflation. 
Please turn to Slide 7 labeled Q3 2021 Consumer Solutions Performance. Consumer Solutions sales growth was 30% as both businesses continue to perform at record levels. Segment income increased 27%, while return on sales contracted as price did not fully keep up with the significant inflation headwind. While we have implemented additional price increases, our record backlogs and strong double-digit growth create a lag from when the price -- new prices read out. We believe this creates a tailwind on price entering next year, but inflation does not appear to be moderating. 
Pool experienced sales growth of 32% in the quarter and was up 5% sequentially. Demand in the industry remains strong even as the full fiscal year ends and activity begins to moderate. In fact, dealers are booked well into the third quarter of next year, which we anticipate will result in another strong pool season next year. Favorable mortgage rates, continued increases in home equity, and the ongoing trend of suburban migration are all contributing to robust demand for the industry. 
We continue to see strong demand for our variable speed pumps as new efficiency regulations drive transition from single-speed pumps. The majority of our mix has shifted to variable speed. 2021 has been a good year for new products, including our IntelliBrite HD light and higher energy-efficient tiers. We expect next year to be another strong year, including advancements in filtration and continued expansion of connected products. 
Demand for new pools remain strong with many builders reporting backlogs into the latter half of next year. Our record backlog and favorable demographic trends give us increased confidence and momentum as we look to next year. 
Water treatment delivered 28% sales growth as residential demand remained robust and commercial showed strong signs of post-pandemic recovery. We saw our direct-to-consumer business improving leads and closings in several new markets, and we continue to evolve our business model. We've made great progress in rebranding the business and are also building out our service capabilities. 
The commercial recovery continued and the integration of KBI is going well. We had a total water management win in the quarter that was a great example of taking a product sale and adding installation and services with an existing KBI customer. While restaurant foot traffic is still not back to 2019 levels, average ticket prices are up and the result is continued improvement in orders and backlog for what has historically been a shorter cycle business. 
While Consumer Solutions has felt the biggest impact from inflation and material shortages in the short-term, we have successfully implemented multiple price increases that are yet to fully read out and strong backlog levels point to anticipated continued growth for the segment. 
Please turn to Slide 8, labeled Q3 2021 Industrial & Flow Technologies Performance. Industrial & Flow Technologies increased sales 8% in the quarter, while segment income grew 23% and return on sales expanded 180 basis points to 14.8%. 
Residential flow grew at a double-digit rate for the fourth consecutive quarter. This growth was accomplished even in the face of supply chain constraints that are not showing signs of mitigating. Our customers have continued to experience strong sell-through, which gives us confidence that we will continue to grow. Price is also beginning to read out further and should be a tailwind entering next year. 
Commercial flow increased sales 6% in the quarter. The focus in commercial flow continues to be on complexity reduction, better price realization, and building out the aftermarket business given the large installed base. 
Industrial filtration delivered 8% sales growth, led once again by recovery in the shorter cycle business of food and beverage. We continue to see strong orders, and our sustainable gas business had strong backlog growth and a growing order funnel where we experienced an improvement in our win rate. 
IFT is building momentum on return on sales expansion and our transformation initiatives, coupled with price realization improving, we believe, should drive more improvement going forward. 
Please turn to Slide 9, labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. Free cash flow continued to be a great story as we have generated over $500 million year-to-date. We have returned $200 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase during 2021. The balance sheet ended the quarter exceptionally strong with leverage remaining under 1x. Return on invested capital ended the quarter at 19%, a number we are particularly proud of. We had a higher-than-average amount of cash on hand at the end of the quarter as we awaited the completion of the Pleatco acquisition, which occurred last week. Our balance sheet gives us a great deal of flexibility to invest in our strategic growth initiatives, both organically and through strategic acquisitions like KBI and Pleatco.
Please turn to Slide 10, labeled Q4 and Full Year 2021 Pentair Outlook. We are initiating fourth quarter and updating our full year 2021 guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to grow 15% to 19%; segment income to grow 16% to 24%; and adjusted EPS to grow 16% to 24% to a range of $0.81 to $0.87. Our forecast reflects ongoing material availability headwinds and higher inflation. For the full year, we expect sales to grow 22% to 23%; segment income to increase 32% to 34%; and adjusted EPS to grow 34% to 36% to a range of $3.34 to $3.40. 
In addition to supply chain and logistics challenges, we would also remind investors that the fourth quarter historically incurs a seasonal slowdown for many of our residential businesses as the weather turns less favorable for outdoor activity in addition to fewer workdays around the holidays. 
Below the operating line, we continue to expect corporate expense to be around $80 million. We now expect net interest to be around $15 million, and our tax rate assumption remains around 16%. We anticipate the share count to be around 167.5 million, both for the quarter and the full year. 
Capital expenditures are expected to be around $60 million, while depreciation and amortization is anticipated to be about $80 million. We continue to target free cash flow to be greater than net income. 
I would now like to turn the call over to Stephanie for Q&A, after which, John will have a few closing remarks. Stephanie, please open the line for questions."

The other point I would make is -- and you saw a little of this in the quarter, despite KBI being a very strategic acquisition, it is a services business. Services businesses don't have the large margin profile, and so it's not going to have the same margin profile as Consumer Solutions, so it is slightly dilutive to margins. And as we bring Pleatco in as well, even though it's a really highly valuable asset and one that we think is going to have great runway in the aftermarket side, it will also have a lower margin profile than Consumer Solutions today. So both of those will be a slight drag on the margins, but both are very strategic tuck-ins that we think add significant value over the long time."

That's where I would share with you what that contribution is. 
As Bob said, we don't think we see the supply chain ramping up between Q3 and Q4. While there's still a strong demand, we don't think it's prudent to anticipate that we would ship more in Q4, given that there's holiday seasons that are also clamoring for the same ports and the same trade routes that we're trying to get to. So we're doing the best we can to sequentially improve every single quarter. And I think we made great progress from last year into Q1 to Q2 to Q3. And now what we're suggesting is it's wise to think that we're flattish in our ability to get product out the door from Q4 to Q3.
The seasonality of the businesses, which is normal, is more of our service businesses, the businesses that go into people's homes to treat water -- treatment. And those businesses are seasonal, but not too many people look to do that over the holiday season. And as I've mentioned, that's why we usually see a Q3 to Q4 dip in those particular offerings. So normal seasonality with the belief that we're not going to raise our expectations beyond what we delivered in Q3."

I have desires to have a 4 in front of that gross margin as we exit the transformation period that we talked about. And most of the levers that we're pulling, we believe that pricing is a big initiative and we're leaning into that with outside help, more looking at our value adds and looking at end-to-end cost and trying to think about even our partners cost and how we help mitigate some of the expense. We agree that logistics and end-to-end freight costs are pretty sizable, not just for us but for our partners. So how do we get after that with price.
Second one, sourcing, how do we lean in on sourcing and really look at global supply chains on a total landed cost basis and make sure we're making the best choices. And the SKU rationalization is a big enabler there as well. The third one is the manufacturing and distribution footprint. I think the distribution one gives us a big opportunity. And the fourth one is the organizational enablement. And that's really about making sure that as we find new channels, new adjacencies, we're getting productivity from the old way of doing things to fund the new way that we want to do things. And so those are the 4 big pillars of transformation. We made a lot of progress, and we hope to create tailwinds to 2022 from those initiatives."

But obviously, we've seen what a difference a year can make, so a kind of a big picture, structural question around price cost. You've gotten a lot of price to pass all this stuff through. So let's just say hypothetically the Fed does tap the brakes early next year, inflation pretty quickly comes down, some of your raws go down, and your freight goes down. How should we think about price in that scenario? Do you keep a lot of that price in that scenario and realize the margin upside, at least for a while? And how long could that be? Or do you think that the competitive dynamics in that kind of a scenario would dictate that the price is given back pretty quickly?

Because if that happens and we're out in front -- because we've been trying to catch up on price all year long, but if we can get out in front of it, then the worst-case scenario is that we start to trim back pricing to our channel to basically reflect the lower inflation rate that we have. That's an easier mitigation strategy than trying to get new price in an area where people are anticipating the inflationary pressures to subside. 
So I think those -- that's the scenario planning that we're going through, which is why we're not ready to share 2022 with yet. But I'm going to lean towards that we think inflation and supply chain challenges continue. And the worst-case scenario is we dial back from there."

And our manufacturing build the stock, make the stock that goes through dealer-distributors are the most responsive to inflationary pressures and price increases normally. This year is a little unique in the sense that we've had these large backlogs, and it's hard -- we're not going to go back and reprice backlog, right? So there's a little timing delay related to that backlog. 
The other business model we have is project-based. And you've got to predict where your price increases need to be to reflect the inflationary pressures that are out there 6 to 9 months in advance. And that's always the hardest to get right, especially in these environments. 
And then the third one would be more OEM or larger customer-based business models, where, again, you're in a process of negotiation. And before those price increases go in, you got to get both sides to agree on what that partnership looks like. And so those are the 3 basic premises. And so obviously, to make the stock a little easier in most normal times. The project, you have to be more careful and the OEM is just a negotiation of ensuring that everybody got the best productivity in the cycle."

I mean, I think traditionally, we would look at the new pool builds is getting an opportunity to expand -- do the whole pad. And that's why we enjoy that new build. The remodels, we have that same opportunity, right, to talk to the consumers and share with them the possibilities and upgrade that pool pad. And then we always have the break and fix. And you don't get this type of growth from just break and fix. So the predominance of the incremental demand over what we've historically seen, call it, mid- to high-single digits, is likely penetration into the aftermarket pool pads or into the new pool pads from adding out to the pad."

I think the way to think about it is, when you look at it year-over-year, you have to add what it also increased the previous year. And so when we think about adding to the price increases next year, I mean, it's important to realize how inflation is",187,"Yes. I think the way to think about it is, when you look at it year-over-year, you have to add what it also increased the previous year. And so when we think about adding to the price increases next year, I mean, it's important to realize how inflation is compounded from 2020 and '21 and then how much more will be added as we go into 2022. So obviously, when you look at it year-over-year, it's a piece. But when you go back and look at the start of this, which for us was Q2 of 2020, we've seen the significant demand and that demand has turned into supply pressures. And then we've seen the corresponding inflation across the freight and all the other components here.
So I mean, I'm not going to give an exact answer because I know you -- everybody's asked me in every single way, but we've got to price appropriately to cover the anticipated inflation that we see coming to us in 2022. We don't yet have that number and when we do, we'll share it, but we're going to price appropriately."

So that's where really where the future is. And currently, there's a few small markets or small regions where a substitute could be appropriate."
