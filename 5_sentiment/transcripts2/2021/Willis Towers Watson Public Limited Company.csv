Joining me today is Mike Burwell, our Chief Financial Officer. Today, we'll review our results for the fourth quarter and for the full year ended December 31, 2020.
Our overall performance reflects the durability and resilience of our business model. In the fourth quarter, we continue to navigate through challenging economic conditions, and I'm pleased with our financial performance. While our revenue continues to be impacted by the pandemic, particularly in our discretionary lines of business in many of our core businesses, we continue to experience new business generation, strong client retention rates and increased operating leverage. We continue to reduce our controllable spending and improve our liquidity. We believe our resilience positions us well for the proposed combination with Aon and bringing together the best of both organizations to provide opportunities for clients, for colleagues and for shareholders. As we've continued to navigate through the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic conditions, our colleagues stood in solidary, steadfast in their collaborative spirit across geographies and segments. They managed to achieve another year of solid financial performance. To all of our 46,000 colleagues around the globe, thank you for all of your hard work. We continue to be grateful for your resilience and your focus.
The ongoing dedication of our colleagues reflects the rich history of Willis Towers Watson. I'm extremely proud to have served this organization in various roles for the last 43 years. It's been a privilege to work alongside my esteemed colleagues and to build what is now Willis Towers Watson. With roots dating back to 1828, the company was formed with the goal of becoming a leading advisory, broking and solutions company. It's especially gratifying to know that almost 200 years later, the future of our business remains bright. For this company to be even more relevant today than it was at its inception is an honor that few organizations experience. Remaining relevant over hundreds of years is not some serendipitous event, remaining relevant requires hard work, a genuine desire to find solutions for the industries we serve and constant innovation. Willis Towers Watson's commitment to constant innovation is evident in part in the technology we developed for the insurance industry. Our solutions help both insureds and insurers make more informed, data-driven decisions and make them faster.
For example, Connected Risk intelligence, or CRI, is a platform which brings modern finance approaches to the corporate risk management decision process, providing clients with the ability to optimize risk financing decisions by taking a portfolio approach allows for optimal risk retention and transfer decisions. This platform has been highly impactful for clients burdened by the hard market and COVID recession. CRI leverages a broad range of data sources and allows organizations to take advantage of insurance meet inefficiencies. We also have a platform called Core Analytics, which consists of risk models, tools and rich data sources that enable deep dives into specific risks and provide insights into risk, transfer and mitigation and decision-making. In addition, we have Radar Live, which is a fast, flexible and agile decision engine, which allows prices, rules, adjustments, scores and other metrics developed in analytical models to be deployed by insurance companies directly to their pricing, underwriting and claim systems in real time.
Software innovations like these become a launching pad for reaching underserved industries. Many industry sectors face unique risks that lack risk financing and/or mitigation solutions. Small to medium-sized enterprises in established as well as emerging markets are particularly underserved. These assets can help underserved industries understand risks that dominate their concerns and quickly form strategies to protect themselves.
When I think about the range of capabilities that Willis Towers Watson brings to the table to help the underserved and I consider Aon's own data analytics and differentiated software, I see a special opportunity to create a combined firm that we believe will make an even greater difference in the global economy. Underserved organizations often need greater support in controlling and protecting their organizations from their main risks. As a combined firm, we believe our integrated data and advanced analytical capabilities will enable us to serve these industries and geographies which we believe will allow these organizations to greatly improve the risk investment decision-making and their negotiating power with insurance market. In effect, we believe we will become capable of transforming these clients from buyers of risk protection to sellers of risk. By blending the best of both firms, we can unlock our potential for the benefit of all our stakeholders.
So now let's move on to our fourth quarter results. Reported revenue for the fourth quarter was $2.8 billion, up 3% as compared to the prior year fourth quarter, up 1% on a constant currency basis and up 2% on an organic basis, and that's all despite having a difficult comparable in the prior year of 6% organic growth over the fourth quarter of 2019. Similar to last year, we experienced solid financial performance in areas where we have a well-established market position, mature relationships and annuity or compliance-driven business. We faced some headwinds in areas where our revenue is more dependent on discretionary project spending and where macroeconomic factors dampened markets.
Net income was $483 million, down 12% for the fourth quarter as compared to $551 million of net income in the prior year fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $1 billion or 35.0% of revenue for the fourth quarter as compared to $930 million or 34.6% of revenue for the same period last year, representing a 4% increase on an adjusted EBITDA dollar basis and 40 basis points of margin improvement. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $3.66, a decrease of 12% as compared to the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $5.23 for the fourth quarter, reflecting an increase of 7% compared to the prior year. Overall, it was a solid quarter. We grew revenue and adjusted earnings per share and had enhanced adjusted EBITDA margin performance. Reported revenue for the full year of 2020 increased 3% as compared to the prior year, increased 4% on a constant currency basis and was up 2% on an organic basis. This was against the prior year comparable of 5% organic growth over the full year of 2019.
So now let's look at each of the segments in some more detail to provide comparability with prior periods. All commentary regarding each of our segments will be on an organic basis, unless specifically stated otherwise. Segment margins are calculated using segment revenue and exclude unallocated corporate costs such as amortization of intangibles, certain transaction and integration expenses resulting from mergers and acquisitions as well as other items which we consider noncore to our operating results. The segment results include discretionary compensation.
The Human Capital & Benefits, or HCB segment, was down 1% on an organic basis and down 2% on a constant currency basis compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year. This result represents sequential revenue improvement compared to our prior quarter. The Q4 segment revenue decline was driven primarily in our Talent and Rewards business. Talent and rewards revenue decreased 5% as there was the client compensation survey sales and an accelerated degree of survey that shifted revenue to Q3 this year compared to Q4 in 2019. Talent and Rewards experienced improving demand for our advisory services as we progress through 2020.
Our Health and Benefits revenue declined nominally for the quarter. We continue to grow revenue from global benefit management and local brokerage appointments outside of North America. However, this offset is due to a strong prior year comparable in North America. Retirement revenue was flat compared to the prior year, with somewhat reduced derisk activity in North America, being balanced by increased administration work in North America and project consulting work in Western Europe and Great Britain.
Technology and Administration Solutions revenue increased 8%, primarily due to a nonrecurring event in the prior year's comparable. HCB's operating margin increased by 120 basis points compared to the prior year fourth quarter as a result of careful cost management efforts. We are really pleased with HCB's sequential improvement and strong margin growth. We remain confident about the long-term prospects of this segment.
Now let's look at Corporate Risk & Broking, or CRB, which had a revenue decrease of 1% on an organic and constant currency basis as compared to the prior year fourth quarter. North America's revenue was up by 7% in the fourth quarter, driven by new business and strong fuels across almost all lines. Revenue for Western Europe decreased 4% as the macroeconomic impact of COVID-19 put pressure on certain insurance lines, notably P&C. Great Britain and international's revenue declined 6% and 8%, respectively, for the fourth quarter. Their results were negatively impacted by a change in the remuneration model for certain lines of business. This change, which is neutral to operating income, results in lower revenue and an equal reduction of the salaries and benefits expense. Absent this change, Great Britain's and international's revenue declined modestly due to headwinds from onetime nonrecurring placements in the prior year in the construction and natural resource insurance lines, coupled with pressure on airline volume-driven commissions as departure volume  remain low and premium returns are common.
CRB revenue was $888 million for the quarter, with an operating margin of 32.3% compared to $877 million of revenue, with an operating margin of 30.3% in the prior year fourth quarter. The margin improvement was primarily driven by effective cost containment efforts. We're pleased with CRB's performance for the year, and we're looking forward to its future growth prospects. The pandemic and the hard insurance market have depleted the financial resilience of many organizations. Against this complex economic backdrop, CRB's global team of dedicated experts stand ready to partner with clients to help reimagine and rethink their approach to risk management.
Turning to investment, Risk and Reinsurance, or IRR. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $292 million, an increase of 1% on an organic basis and a decrease of 9% on a constant currency basis as compared to the prior year fourth quarter. Reinsurance with growth of 22% continued to lead the segment's growth through a combination of net new business and favorable renewals. The growth was partially offset by declines in other businesses, with reduced demand for discretionary work having negatively impacted revenues in both the insurance consulting and technology and investments business, which were down 4% and 2%, respectively.
The wholesale business was down 17% on an organic basis. Although it's reported as organic, about half the decline was because we transferred wholesale special contingency risk business to the CRB segment in the fourth quarter. The remainder of the revenue decline was largely caused by COVID-19-related pressure on marine and insurance energy lines. As a reminder, we sold the Max Matthiessen in September 2020, and its revenue is not reflected in our quarter 4 results.
IRR had an operating margin of 11.0% as compared to 9.1% for the prior year fourth quarter, having thoughtfully reduced the expenses to increase profitability. During this challenging time and extended period of uncertainty, IRR remains committed to helping clients navigate the changing landscape by focusing on their business priorities, capital strategy, operations, technology, risk and people.
Revenue for the Benefits, Delivery and Administration, or BDA segment increased by 16% on both a constant currency and organic basis from the prior year fourth quarter. The growth in revenue was largely driven by individual marketplace, primarily by TRANZACT, which contributed $279 million to BDA's top line this quarter, with growth in Medicare Advantage products. The benefits outsourcing business all also contributed to the increase in revenue, which was largely driven by its expanded client base. The BDA segment had revenue of $693 million, with a 50.7% operating margin as compared to 52.4% in the prior year fourth quarter. The margin declined as TRANZACT's rapid growth outpaced the rest of the segment. We continue to be optimistic about the long-term growth of our BDA segment. The pandemic threated the well-being of people all over the globe. In this time of heightened stress and uncertainty, BDA empowers employees and retirees by providing easy access to the tools they need to understand their benefits options and to take control of their health care.
Overall, I'm very pleased with our results this year. We delivered steady overall financial performance with modest margin expansion and adjusted EPS growth despite lingering economic turmoil. Our colleagues showed great resilience in adapting and rising to the challenges 2020 brought, and I could be prouder of how we came together to achieve these results.
Now I'll turn the call over to Mike."

And good morning, everyone. Thanks to all of you for joining us. I'd also like to echo John's sentiments and extend my gratitude to our colleagues for another solid quarter and also to thank our clients for their continued support and trust",1280,"Thanks, John. And good morning, everyone. Thanks to all of you for joining us. I'd also like to echo John's sentiments and extend my gratitude to our colleagues for another solid quarter and also to thank our clients for their continued support and trust in us in this challenging environment. I'm proud of our leadership, our colleagues and the overall resiliency that's demonstrated by our businesses.
So now let's turn to our financial overview. In the fourth quarter, we continue to face some headwinds from COVID-19, but we are reassured by the demand for our services and solutions and by our ability to reduce discretionary expenses and to manage our cash. We were pleased to see another quarter of solid revenue growth with underlying adjusted EPS growth and outstanding free cash flow improvement.
So now I'll turn to the overall detailed financial results. There are a couple of significant charges incurred in the fourth quarter that we consider noncore to our operations. In addition to the $45 million in transaction integration expenses primarily related to our pending combination with Aon, we also recorded a $50 million provision for significant litigation and $24 million of restructuring costs. The restructuring costs were incurred in connection with our assessment of our ongoing strategy in certain businesses. We aligned resources across different geographies and service lines, primarily within our Talent and Rewards business, to better prepare for future market demands. All of these noncore charges, the transaction integration expenses, the provision for significant litigation and the restructuring costs had a negative impact on our GAAP profitability measures for the fourth quarter and the full year. However, these charges were adjusted from our non-GAAP profitability measures for the same periods.
Income from operations for the fourth quarter was $587 million or 21.2% of revenue, down 430 basis points from the prior year fourth quarter income from operations of $687 million or 25.5% of revenue. Adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter was $820 million or 29.7% of revenue, down 40 basis points from $809 million or 30.1% of revenue in the prior year fourth quarter. Income from operations for the full year 2020 was $1.2 billion or 12.6% of revenue, down 210 basis points over the prior year of $1.3 billion or 14.7% of revenue. Adjusted operating income for the full year of 2020 was $1.9 billion or 20.1% of revenue and down 20 basis points from the prior year of $1.8 billion or 20.3% of revenue.
For the fourth quarters of 2020 and 2019, our diluted EPS was $3.66 and $4.18, respectively. For the fourth quarter of 2020, our adjusted EPS was up 7% to $5.23 per share as compared to $4.90 per share in the prior year fourth quarter. For the full years 2020 and 2019, diluted EPS was $7.65 and $8.02, respectively. For the full year 2020, adjusted EPS was up 7% to $11.7 per share versus $10.96 per share in the prior year. Foreign currency rate changes caused an increase in our consolidated revenue of $42 million or 2% of revenue for the quarter compared to the prior year fourth quarter with $0.05 tailwind to adjusted diluted EPS this quarter. Foreign currency rate changes caused a decrease in our consolidated revenue of $10 million for the full year 2020 compared to prior year, with a $0.01 headwind to adjusted diluted EPS overall for the year.
I'd also like to note that our fourth quarter 2020 unallocated net expenses grew $122 million from $57 million in the prior year fourth quarter. As we mentioned in our second quarter earnings call, this cost category relates to corporate functions and other unbudgeted costs that we don't directly allocate to the segments each quarter, including items such as true-ups on benefit and stock compensation expense accruals, incentive accrual adjustments and other items. In Q4, the year-over-year increase mostly relates to incentive accrual adjustments, and discretionary compensation increased alongside improved performance.
Our U.S. GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter was 19.7% versus 18.3% in the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was 17.8%, down from 19.4% rate in the prior year. For the full year, the U.S. GAAP tax rate was 23.8% for 2020 as compared to 18.8% for the prior year, while the adjusted tax rate was 20.8% compared to 20.3% for the prior year. The current year tax rate was higher as a result of enacted statutory tax rate changes in the U.K., requiring us to remeasure our U.K. deferred tax liabilities and recognize a discrete deferred taxes of $11 million or $0.08 on an adjusted as basis, third quarter of 2020. Excluding this nonrecurring item, our adjusted tax rate for the full year would have been approximately 20%.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the fourth quarter with a strong capital and liquidity position, with cash and cash equivalents of $2.1 billion and full capacity in our undrawn $1.25 billion revolving credit facility. Willis Towers Watson remains well positioned from a liquidity perspective. We aim to continue to maintain a strong and durable balance sheet and continue pushing forward our cost savings and efficiency initiatives. We continue to monitor the ever-evolving impact of the pandemic and are prepared to take appropriate measures as needed to preserve our financial position.
Lastly, full year free cash flow almost doubled to $1.6 billion from $835 million in the prior year. This far exceeds the $1 billion we targeted as part of our original pre-COVID guidance that we gave during last year's fourth quarter earnings call despite also having paid approximately $7 million in cash-based transaction integration costs. The remarkable year-over-year growth in free cash flow is primarily due to improvements in working capital, coupled with our effective cost contained efforts. The substantial increase in free cash flow is a testament to the hard work of our colleagues. We remain dedicated and focused on improving this performance in this area despite all the additional demands they were juggling in 2020.
In terms of capital allocation for full year of 2020, we paid approximately $346 million in dividends. We do not expect to repurchase any shares in 2021 given certain prohibitions in the transaction agreement with Aon. Pension contributions to our qualified plans totaled $129 million in 2020, and we're currently projecting contributions of $132 million for 2021. We remain committed to deleveraging in the near term. In March, we will use on-hand cash to pay the $500 million in senior notes due. We will also use our cash to fund the $210 million of payments related to the settlement of Stanford-Willis Towers Watson merger-related litigations.
Now as a general matter, the COVID-19 pandemic did not have a material adverse impact to our overall financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. However, the pandemic did impact revenue growth, particularly in some discretionary lines, it was -- and we expect that the effects of COVID-19 on general economic activity will negatively impact our revenue results in 2021. The duration of the pandemic, the full magnitude of its economic impact and the subsequent speed of recovery remain unknown. In the meantime, we remain focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet, liquidity and financial flexibility.
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused considerable economic people, but I'm very proud of the leadership team and the resolve of our colleagues and supporting our clients during these difficult times. These fourth quarter results are a direct reflection of the agility of our global model. Overall, we delivered solid financial performance in the fourth quarter, and I remain confident in our ability to continue driving value for all our stakeholders.
I'll now turn the call back to John."

36623,700855940,2200597,"Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2021",2021-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company","Executives","Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. Joining me today is Mike Burwell, our Chief Financial Officer. Today, we'll review our results for the fourth quarter and for the full year ended De",2135,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. Joining me today is Mike Burwell, our Chief Financial Officer. Today, we'll review our results for the fourth quarter and for the full year ended December 31, 2020. 
Our overall performance reflects the durability and resilience of our business model. In the fourth quarter, we continue to navigate through challenging economic conditions, and I'm pleased with our financial performance. While our revenue continues to be impacted by the pandemic, particularly in our discretionary lines of business in many of our core businesses, we continue to experience new business generation, strong client retention rates and increased operating leverage. 
We continue to reduce our controllable spending and improve our liquidity. We believe our resilience positions us well for the proposed combination with Aon and bringing together the best of both organizations to provide opportunities for clients, for colleagues and for shareholders. As we've continued to navigate through the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic conditions, our colleagues stood in solidary, steadfast in their collaborative spirit across geographies and segments. 
They managed to achieve another year of solid financial performance. To all of our 46,000 colleagues around the globe, thank you for all of your hard work. We continue to be grateful for your resilience and your focus. 
The ongoing dedication of our colleagues reflects the rich history of Willis Towers Watson. I'm extremely proud to have served this organization in various roles for the last 43 years. It's been a privilege to work alongside my esteemed colleagues and to build what is now Willis Towers Watson. With roots dating back to 1828, the company was formed with the goal of becoming a leading advisory, broking and solutions company. It's especially gratifying to know that almost 200 years later, the future of our business remains bright. 
For this company to be even more relevant today than it was at its inception is an honor that few organizations experience. Remaining relevant over hundreds of years is not some serendipitous event. Remaining relevant requires hard work, a genuine desire to find solutions for the industries we serve and constant innovation. Willis Towers Watson's commitment to constant innovation is evident in part in the technology we developed for the insurance industry. Our solutions help both insured and insurers make more informed, data-driven decisions and make them faster. 
For example, Connected Risk Intelligence, or CRI, is a platform which brings modern finance approaches to the corporate risk management decision process. Providing clients with the ability to optimize risk financing decisions by taking a portfolio approach allows for optimal risk retention and transfer decisions. This platform has been highly impactful for clients burdened by the hard market in COVID recession. CRI leverages a broad range of data sources and allows organizations to take advantage of insurance market inefficiencies. We also have a platform called core analytics, which consists of risk models, tools and rich data sources that enable deep dives into specific risks and provide insights into risk transfer and mitigation and decision-making. In addition, we have Radar Live, which is a fast, flexible and agile decision engine, which allows prices, rules, adjustments, scores and other metrics developed in analytical models to be deployed by insurance companies directly to their pricing, underwriting and claim systems in real time. Software innovations like these become a launching pad for reaching underserved industries.
Many industries sector face unique risks that lack risk financing and risk mitigation solutions. Small to medium size enterprises in established as well as 
emerging markets are particularly underserved. These assets can help underserved industries understand risks that dominate their concerns and quickly form strategies to protect themselves. When I think about the range of capabilities that Willis Towers Watson's brings to the table to help the underserved, and I consider Aon's own data analytics and differentiated software. I see a special opportunity to create a combined firm that we believe will make an even greater difference in the global economy. Underserved organizations often need greater support in controlling and protecting their organization from their main risks.
As a combined firm, we believe our integrated data and advanced analytical capabilities will enable us to serve these industries and geographies, which we believe will allow these organizations to greatly improve the risk investment decision-making and their negotiating power with insurance market. In effect, we believe we will become capable of transforming these clients from buyers of risk to threat protection to sellers of risk. By blending the best of both firms, we can unlock our potential for the benefit of all our stakeholders. 
So now let's move on to our fourth quarter results. Reported revenue for the fourth quarter was $2.8 billion, up 3% as compared to the prior year fourth quarter, up 1% on a constant currency basis and up 2% on an organic basis. And that's all despite having a difficult comparable in the prior year of 6% organic growth over the fourth quarter of 2019. Similar to last year, we experienced solid financial performance in areas where we have a well-established market position, mature relationships and annuity or compliance driven business. We faced some headwinds in areas where our revenue was more dependent on discretionary project spending and where macroeconomic factors dampened markets. 
Net income was $483 million, down 12% for the fourth quarter as compared to $551 million of net income in the prior year fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $1 billion or 35.0% of revenue for the fourth quarter as compared to $930 million or 34.6% of revenue for the same period last year, representing a 4% increase on an adjusted EBITDA dollar basis and 40 basis points of margin improvement. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $3.66, a decrease of 12% as compared to the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $5.23 for the fourth quarter, reflecting an increase of 7% compared to the prior year. Overall, it was a solid quarter. We grew revenue and adjusted earnings per share and had enhanced adjusted EBITDA margin performance. Reported revenue for the full year of 2020 increased 3% as compared to the prior year, increased 4% on a constant currency basis and was up 2% on an organic basis. This was against the prior year comparable of 5% organic growth over the full year of 2019. 
So now let's look at each of the segments in some more detail to provide clear comparability with prior periods. All commentary regarding the results of our segments will be on an organic basis, unless specifically stated otherwise. Segment margins are calculated using segment revenue and exclude unallocated corporate costs such as amortization of intangibles, certain transaction and integration expenses resulting from mergers and acquisitions as well as other items which we consider noncore to our operating results. The segment results include discretionary compensation. 
The Human Capital & Benefits, or HCB segment, was down 1% on an organic basis and down 2% on a constant currency basis compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year. This result represents sequential revenue improvement compared to our prior quarter. The Q4 segment revenue decline was driven primarily in our Talent and Rewards business. Talent and Rewards revenue decreased 5% as there was decline in compensation survey sales and an accelerated degree of surveys that shifted revenue to Q3 this year compared to Q4 in 2019. Talent and Rewards experienced improving demand for our advisory services as we progress through 2020. 
Our Health and Benefits revenue declined nominally for the quarter. We continue to grow revenue from global benefit management and local brokerage appointments outside of North America. However, this offset is due to a strong prior year comparable in North America. Retirement revenue was flat compared to the prior year, with somewhat reduced derisk activity in North America, being balanced by increased administration work in North America and project consulting work in Western Europe and Great Britain. 
Technology and Administration Solutions revenue increased 8%, primarily due to a nonrecurring event in the prior year's comparable. HCB's operating margin increased by 120 basis points compared to the prior year fourth quarter as a result of careful cost management efforts. We are really pleased with HCB's sequential improvement and strong margin growth. We remain confident about the long-term prospects of this segment. 
Now let's look at Corporate Risk & Broking, or CRB, which had a revenue decrease of 1% on an organic and constant currency basis as compared to the prior year fourth quarter. North America's revenue was up by 7% in the fourth quarter, driven by new business and strong renewals across almost all lines. Revenue for Western Europe decreased 4% as the macroeconomic impact of COVID-19 put pressure on certain insurance lines, notably P&C. Great Britain and International's revenue declined 6% and 8%, respectively, for the fourth quarter. Their results were negatively impacted by a change in the remuneration model for certain lines of business. This change, which is neutral to operating income, results in lower revenue and an equal reduction of the salaries and benefits expense. 
Absent this change, Great Britain's and International's revenue declined modestly due to headwinds from onetime nonrecurring placements in the prior year in the construction and natural resource insurance lines, coupled with pressure on airline volume-driven commissions as departure volume remain well and premium returns are common. 
CRB revenue was $888 million for the quarter, with an operating margin of 32.3% compared to $877 million of revenue, with an operating margin of 30.3% in the prior year fourth quarter. The margin improvement was primarily driven by effective cost containment efforts. We're pleased with CRB's performance for the year, and we're looking forward to its future growth prospects. The pandemic and the hard insurance market have depleted the financial resilience of many organizations. Against this complex economic backdrop, CRB's global team of dedicated experts stand ready to partner with clients to help reimagine and rethink their approach to risk management. 
Turning to Investment, Risk and Reinsurance, or IRR. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $292 million, an increase of 1% on an organic basis and a decrease of 9% on a constant currency basis as compared to the prior year fourth quarter. Reinsurance with growth of 22% continued to lead this segment's growth through a combination of net new business and favorable renewals. The growth was partially offset by declines in other businesses, with reduced demand for discretionary work having negatively impacted revenues in both the Insurance Consulting and Technology and Investments business, which were down 4% and 2%, respectively. 
The wholesale business was down 17% on an organic basis. Although it's reported as organic, about half the decline was because we transferred wholesale special contingency risk business to the CRB segment in the fourth quarter. The remainder of the revenue decline was largely caused by COVID-19-related pressure on marine and insurance energy lines. As a reminder, we sold the Max Matthiessen in September 2020, and its revenue is not reflected in our quarter 4 results. 
IRR had an operating margin of 11.0% as compared to 9.1% for the prior year fourth quarter, having thoughtfully reduced the expenses to increase profitability. During this challenging time and extended period of uncertainty, IRR remains committed to helping clients navigate the changing landscape by focusing on their business priorities, capital strategy, operations, technology, risk and people. 
Revenue for the Benefits Delivery & Administration, or BDA segment increased by 16% on both a constant currency and organic basis from the prior year fourth quarter. The growth in revenue was largely driven by individual marketplace, primarily by TRANZACT, which contributed $279 million to BDA's top line this quarter, with growth in Medicare Advantage products. The Benefits Outsourcing business also contributed to the increase in revenue, which was largely driven by its expanded client base. The BDA segment had revenue of $693 million, with a 50.7% operating margin as compared to 52.4% in the prior year fourth quarter. The margin declined as TRANZACT's rapid growth outpaced the rest of the segment. We continue to be optimistic about the long-term growth of our BDA segment. The pandemic threated the well-being of people all over the globe. In this time of heightened stress and uncertainty, BDA empowers employees and retirees by providing easy access to the tools they need to understand their benefits options and to take control of their health care.
Overall, I'm very pleased with our results this year. We delivered steady overall financial performance with modest margin expansion and adjusted EPS growth despite the lingering economic turmoil. Our colleagues showed great resilience in adapting and rising to the challenges 2020 brought, and I could be prouder of how we came together to achieve these results.
Now I'll turn the call over to Mike."

And good morning, everyone. Thanks to all of you for joining us. I'd also like to echo John's sentiments and extend my gratitude to our colleagues for another solid quarter and also to thank our clients for their continued support and trust",1295,"Thanks, John. And good morning, everyone. Thanks to all of you for joining us. I'd also like to echo John's sentiments and extend my gratitude to our colleagues for another solid quarter and also to thank our clients for their continued support and trust in us in this challenging environment. I'm proud of our leadership, our colleagues and the overall resiliency that is demonstrated by our businesses.
So now let's turn to our financial overview. In the fourth quarter, we continue to face some headwinds from COVID-19, but we are reassured by the demand for our services and solutions and by our ability to reduce discretionary expenses and to manage our cash. We were pleased to see another quarter of solid revenue growth with underlying adjusted EPS growth and outstanding free cash flow improvement.
So now I'll turn to the overall detailed financial results. There are a couple of significant charges incurred in the fourth quarter that we consider noncore to our operations. In addition to the $45 million in transaction integration expenses primarily related to our pending combination with Aon, we also recorded a $50 million provision for significant litigation and $24 million of restructuring costs. The restructuring costs were incurred in connection with our assessment of our ongoing strategy in certain businesses. We realigned resources across different geographies and service lines, primarily within our Talent and Rewards business, to better prepare for future market demands. All of these noncore charges, the transaction integration expenses, the provision for significant litigation and the restructuring costs had a negative impact on our GAAP profitability measures for the fourth quarter and the full year. However, these charges were adjusted from our non-GAAP profitability measures for the same periods.
Income from operations for the fourth quarter was $587 million or 21.2% of revenue, down 430 basis points from the prior year fourth quarter income from operations of $687 million or 25.5% of revenue. Adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter was $820 million or 29.7% of revenue, down 40 basis points from $809 million or 30.1% of revenue in the prior year fourth quarter. Income from operations for the full year 2020 was $1.2 billion or 12.6% of revenue, down 210 basis points over the prior year of $1.3 billion or 14.7% of revenue. Adjusted to the operating income for the full year of 2020 was $1.9 billion or 20.1% of revenue and down 20 basis points from the prior year of $1.8 billion or 20.3% of revenue.
For the fourth quarters of 2020 and 2019, our diluted EPS was $3.66 and $4.18, respectively. For the fourth quarter of 2020, our adjusted EPS was up 7% to $5.23 per share as compared to $4.90 per share in the prior year fourth quarter. For the full years 2020 and 2019, diluted EPS was $7.65 and $8.02, respectively. For the full year 2020, adjusted EPS was up 7% to $11.7 per share versus $10.96 per share in the prior year. Foreign currency rate changes caused an increase in our consolidated revenue of $42 million or 2% of revenue for the quarter compared to the prior year fourth quarter with $0.05 tailwind to adjusted diluted EPS this quarter. Foreign currency rate changes caused a decrease in our consolidated revenue of $10 million for the full year 2020 compared to prior year, with a $0.01 headwind to adjusted diluted EPS overall for the year.
I'd also like to note that our fourth quarter 2020 unallocated net expenses grew $122 million from $57 million in the prior year fourth quarter. As we mentioned at our second quarter earnings call, this cost category relates to corporate functions and other budgeted -- unbudgeted costs that we don't directly allocate to this segments each quarter, including items such as true-ups on benefit and stock compensation expense accruals, incentive accrual adjustments and other items. In Q4, the year-over-year increase mostly relates to incentive accrual adjustments, and discretionary compensation increased alongside improved performance.
Our U.S. GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter was 19.7% versus 18.3% in the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was 17.8%, down from 19.4% rate in the prior year. For the full year, the U.S. GAAP tax rate was 23.8% for 2020 as compared to 18.8% for the prior year, while the adjusted tax rate was 20.8% compared to 20.3% for the prior year. The current year tax rate was higher as a result of enacted statutory tax rate changes in the U.K., requiring us to remeasure our U.K. deferred tax liabilities and recognize a discrete deferred tax expense of $11 million or $0.08 on an adjusted EPS basis from the third quarter of 2020. Excluding this nonrecurring item, our adjusted tax rate for all the full year would have been approximately 20%.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the fourth quarter with a strong capital and liquidity position, with cash and cash equivalents of $2.1 billion and full capacity in our undrawn $1.25 billion revolving credit facility. Willis Towers Watson remains well positioned from a liquidity perspective. We aim to continue to maintain a strong and durable balance sheet and continue pushing forward our cost savings and efficiency initiatives. We continue to monitor the ever-evolving impact of the pandemic and are prepared to take appropriate measures as needed to preserve our financial position.
Lastly, full year free cash flow almost doubled to $1.6 billion from $835 million in the prior year. This far exceeds the $1 billion we targeted as part of our original pre-COVID guidance that we gave during last year's fourth quarter earnings call despite also having paid approximately $7 million in cash-based transaction integration costs. The remarkable year-over-year growth in free cash flow is primarily due to improvements in working capital, coupled with our effective cost contained efforts. The substantial increase in free cash flow is a testament to the hard work of our colleagues, who remain dedicated and focused on improving this performance in this area despite all the additional demands they were juggling in 2020.
In terms of capital allocation for full year of 2020, we paid approximately $346 million in dividends. We do not expect to repurchase any shares in 2021 given certain prohibitions in the transaction agreement with Aon. Pension contributions to our qualified plans totaled $129 million in 2020, and we're currently projecting contributions of $132 million for 2021. We remain committed to deleveraging in the near term. In March, we will use on-hand cash to pay the $500 million in senior notes due. We will also use our cash to fund the $210 million of payments related to the settlement of Stanford and Willis Towers Watson merger-related litigations.
Now as a general matter, the COVID-19 pandemic did not have a material adverse impact to our overall financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. However, the pandemic did impact revenue growth, particularly in some discretionary lines, it was -- and we expect that the effects of COVID-19 on general economic activity will negatively impact our revenue results in 2021. The duration of the pandemic, the full magnitude of its economic impact and the subsequent speed of recovery remain unknown. In the meantime, we remain focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet, liquidity and financial flexibility.
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused considerable economic [indiscernible], but I'm very proud of our leadership team and the resolve of our colleagues in supporting our clients during these difficult times. These fourth quarter results are a direct reflection of the agility of our global model. Overall, we delivered solid financial performance in the fourth quarter, and I remain confident in our ability to continue driving value for all our stakeholders.
I'll now turn the call back to you -- back to John."

Joining me today is Mike Burwell, our Chief Financial Officer. Today, we'll review our results for the fourth quarter and for the full year ended December 31, 2020. 
Our overall performance reflects the durability and resilience of our business model. In the fourth quarter, we continued to navigate through challenging economic conditions, and I'm pleased with our financial performance. While our revenue continues to be impacted by the pandemic, particularly in our discretionary lines of business in many of our core businesses, we continue to experience new business generation, strong client retention rates and increased operating leverage. We continue to reduce our controllable spending and improve our liquidity. We believe our resilience positions us well for the proposed combination with Aon and bringing together the best of both organizations to provide opportunities for clients, for colleagues and for shareholders.
As we've continued to navigate through the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic conditions, our colleagues stood in solidarity, steadfast in their collaborative spirit across geographies and segments. They managed to achieve another year of solid financial performance. To all of our 46,000 colleagues around the globe, thank you for all of your hard work. We continue to be grateful for your resilience and your focus. 
The ongoing dedication of our colleagues reflects the rich history of Willis Towers Watson. I'm extremely proud to have served this organization in various roles for the last 43 years. It's been a privilege to work alongside my esteemed colleagues and to build what is now Willis Towers Watson. With roots dating back to 1828, the company was formed with the goal of becoming a leading advisory, broking and solutions company. It's especially gratifying to know that almost 200 years later, the future of our business remains bright. 
For this company to be even more relevant today than it was at its inception is an honor that few organizations experience. Remaining relevant over hundreds of years is not some serendipitous event. Remaining relevant requires hard work, a genuine desire to find solutions for the industries we serve and constant innovation. Willis Towers Watson's commitment to constant innovation is evident in part in the technology we develop for the insurance industry. Our solutions help both insured and insurers make more informed, data-driven decisions and make them faster. 
For example, Connected Risk Intelligence, or CRI, is a platform which brings modern finance approaches to the corporate risk management decision process. Providing clients with the ability to optimize risk financing decisions by taking a portfolio approach allows for optimal risk retention and transfer decisions. This platform has been highly impactful for clients burdened by the hard market in COVID recession. CRI leverages a broad range of data sources and allows organizations to take advantage of insurance market inefficiencies. We also have a platform called core analytics, which consists of risk models, tools and rich data sources that enable deep dives into specific risks and provide insights into risk transfer and mitigation and decision-making. In addition, we have Radar Live, which is a fast, flexible and agile decision engine which allows prices, rules, adjustments, scores and other metrics developed in analytical models to be deployed by insurance companies directly to their pricing, underwriting and claim systems in real time. Software innovations like these become a launching pad for reaching underserved industries.
Many industries sectors face unique risks that lack risk financing and risk mitigation solutions. Small to medium size enterprises in established as well as 
emerging markets are particularly underserved. These assets can help underserved industries understand risks that dominate their concerns and quickly form strategies to protect themselves. When I think about the range of capabilities that Willis Towers Watson brings to the table to help the underserved and I consider Aon's own data analytics and differentiated software, I see a special opportunity to create a combined firm that we believe will make an even greater difference in the global economy. Underserved organizations often need greater support in controlling and protecting their organization from their main risks.
As a combined firm, we believe our integrated data and advanced analytical capabilities will enable us to serve these industries and geographies, which we believe will allow these organizations to greatly improve the risk investment decision-making and their negotiating power with insurance market. In effect, we believe we will become capable of transforming these clients from buyers of risk to threat protection to sellers of risk. By blending the best of both firms, we can unlock our potential for the benefit of all our stakeholders. 
So now let's move on to our fourth quarter results. Reported revenue for the fourth quarter was $2.8 billion, up 3% as compared to the prior year fourth quarter, up 1% on a constant currency basis and up 2% on an organic basis. And that's all despite having a difficult comparable in the prior year of 6% organic growth over the fourth quarter of 2019. Similar to last year, we experienced solid financial performance in areas where we have a well-established market position, mature relationships, and annuity or compliance driven business. We faced some headwinds in areas where our revenue was more dependent on discretionary project spending and where macroeconomic factors dampened markets. 
Net income was $483 million, down 12% for the fourth quarter as compared to $551 million of net income in the prior year fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $1 billion or 35.0% of revenue for the fourth quarter as compared to $930 million or 34.6% of revenue for the same period last year, representing a 4% increase on an adjusted EBITDA dollar basis and 40 basis points of margin improvement. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $3.66, a decrease of 12% as compared to the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $5.23 for the fourth quarter, reflecting an increase of 7% compared to the prior year.
Overall, it was a solid quarter. We grew revenue and adjusted earnings per share and had enhanced adjusted EBITDA margin performance. Reported revenue for the full year of 2020 increased 3% as compared to the prior year, increased 4% on a constant currency basis and was up 2% on an organic basis. This was against the prior year comparable of 5% organic growth over the full year of 2019. 
So now let's look at each of the segments in some more detail to provide clear comparability with prior periods. All commentary regarding the results of our segments will be on an organic basis, unless specifically stated otherwise. Segment margins are calculated using segment revenue and exclude unallocated corporate costs such as amortization of intangibles, certain transaction and integration expenses resulting from mergers and acquisitions, as well as other items which we consider noncore to our operating results. The segment results include discretionary compensation. 
The Human Capital & Benefits, or HCB segment, was down 1% on an organic basis and down 2% on a constant currency basis compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year. This result represents sequential revenue improvement compared to our prior quarter. The Q4 segment revenue decline was driven primarily in our Talent and Rewards business. Talent and Rewards revenue decreased 5% as there was decline in compensation survey sales and an accelerated delivery of surveys that shifted revenue to Q3 this year compared to Q4 in 2019. Talent and Rewards experienced improving demand for our advisory services as we progressed through 2020. Our Health and Benefits revenue declined nominally for the quarter. We continue to grow revenue from global benefit management and local brokerage appointments outside of North America. However, this growth was offset due to a strong prior year comparable in North America. Retirement revenue was flat compared to the prior year, with somewhat reduced derisking activity in North America being balanced by increased administration work in North America and project consulting work in Western Europe and Great Britain.  Technology and Administration Solutions revenue increased 8%, primarily due to a nonrecurring event in the prior year's comparable.
HCB's operating margin increased by 120 basis points compared to the prior year fourth quarter as a result of careful cost management efforts. We are really pleased with HCB's sequential improvement and strong margin growth. We remain confident about the long-term prospects of this segment. 
Now let's look at Corporate Risk & Broking, or CRB, which had a revenue decrease of 1% on an organic and constant currency basis as compared to the prior year fourth quarter. North America's revenue was up by 7% in the fourth quarter, driven by new business and strong renewals across almost all lines. Revenue for Western Europe decreased 4% as the macroeconomic impact of COVID-19 put pressure on certain insurance lines, notably P&C. Great Britain and International's revenue declined 6% and 8%, respectively, for the fourth quarter. Their results were negatively impacted by a change in the remuneration model for certain lines of business. This change, which is neutral to operating income, results in lower revenue and an equal reduction of the salaries and benefits expense. Absent this change, Great Britain's and International's revenue declined modestly due to headwinds from onetime nonrecurring placements in the prior year in the construction and natural resource insurance lines, coupled with pressure on airline volume-driven commissions as departure volume remained low and premium returns are common. 
CRB revenue was $888 million for the quarter with an operating margin of 32.3%, compared to $877 million of revenue with an operating margin of 30.3% in the prior year fourth quarter. The margin improvement was primarily driven by effective cost containment efforts. We're pleased with CRB's performance for the year, and we're looking forward to its future growth prospects. The pandemic and the hard insurance market have depleted the financial resilience of many organizations. Against this complex economic backdrop, CRB's global team of dedicated experts stand ready to partner with clients to help reimagine and rethink their approach to risk management. 
Turning to Investment, Risk and Reinsurance, or IRR. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $292 million, an increase of 1% on an organic basis and a decrease of 9% on a constant currency basis as compared to the prior year fourth quarter. Reinsurance, with growth of 22%, continued to lead this segment's growth through a combination of net new business and favorable renewals. The growth was partially offset by declines in other businesses, with reduced demand for discretionary work having negatively impacted revenues in both the Insurance Consulting and Technology and Investments business, which were down 4% and 2%, respectively. The Wholesale business was down 17% on an organic basis. Although it's reported as organic, about half the decline was because we transferred Wholesale's special contingency risk business to the CRB segment in the fourth quarter. The remainder of the revenue decline was largely caused by COVID-19-related pressure on marine and insurance energy lines. As a reminder, we sold the Max Matthiessen in September 2020, and its revenue is not reflected in our quarter 4 results. 
IRR had an operating margin of 11.0% as compared to 9.1% for the prior year fourth quarter, having thoughtfully reduced expenses to increase profitability. During this challenging time and extended period of uncertainty, IRR remains committed to helping clients navigate the changing landscape by focusing on their business priorities: capital strategy, operations, technology, risk and people. 
Revenue for the Benefits Delivery & Administration, or BDA, segment increased by 16% on both a constant currency and organic basis from the prior year fourth quarter. The growth in revenue was largely driven by Individual Marketplace, primarily by TRANZACT, which contributed $279 million to BDA's top line this quarter, with growth in Medicare Advantage products. The Benefits Outsourcing business also contributed to the increase in revenue, which was largely driven by its expanded client base. The BDA segment had revenue of $693 million, with a 50.7% operating margin as compared to 52.4% in the prior year fourth quarter. The margin declined as TRANZACT's rapid growth outpaced the rest of the segment.
We continue to be optimistic about the long-term growth of our BDA segment. The pandemic threated the well-being of people all over the globe. In this time of heightened stress and uncertainty, BDA empowers employees and retirees by providing easy access to the tools they need to understand their benefits options and to take control of their health care.
Overall, I'm very pleased with our results this year. We delivered steady overall financial performance with modest margin expansion and adjusted EPS growth despite the lingering economic turmoil. Our colleagues showed great resilience in adapting and rising to the challenges 2020 brought, and I couldn't be prouder of how we came together to achieve these results.
Now I'll turn the call over to Mike."

And good morning, everyone. Thanks to all of you for joining us. I'd also like to echo John's sentiments and extend my gratitude to our colleagues for another solid quarter and also to thank our clients for their continued support and trust",1294,"Thanks, John. And good morning, everyone. Thanks to all of you for joining us. I'd also like to echo John's sentiments and extend my gratitude to our colleagues for another solid quarter and also to thank our clients for their continued support and trust in us in this challenging environment. I'm proud of our leadership, our colleagues and the overall resiliency that is demonstrated by our businesses.
So now let's turn to our financial overview. In the fourth quarter, we continued to face some headwinds from COVID-19, but we are reassured by the demand for our services and solutions and by our ability to reduce discretionary expenses and to manage our cash. We were pleased to see another quarter of solid revenue growth with underlying adjusted EPS growth and outstanding free cash flow improvement.
So now I'll turn to the overall detailed financial results. There are a couple of significant charges incurred in the fourth quarter that we consider noncore to our operations. In addition to the $45 million in transaction integration expenses primarily related to our pending combination with Aon, we also recorded a $50 million provision for significant litigation and $24 million of restructuring costs. The restructuring costs were incurred in connection with our assessment of our ongoing strategy in certain businesses. We realigned resources across different geographies and service lines, primarily within our Talent and Rewards business, to better prepare for future market demands. All of these noncore charges, the transaction integration expenses, the provision for significant litigation and the restructuring costs had a negative impact on our GAAP profitability measures for the fourth quarter and the full year. However, these charges were adjusted from our non-GAAP profitability measures for the same periods.
Income from operations for the fourth quarter was $587 million or 21.2% of revenue, down 430 basis points from the prior year fourth quarter income from operations of $687 million or 25.5% of revenue. Adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter was $820 million or 29.7% of revenue, down 40 basis points from $809 million or 30.1% of revenue in the prior year fourth quarter. Income from operations for the full year 2020 was $1.2 billion or 12.6% of revenue, down 210 basis points over the prior year of $1.3 billion or 14.7% of revenue. Adjusted operating income for the full year of 2020 was $1.9 billion or 20.1% of revenue and down 20 basis points from the prior year of $1.8 billion or 20.3% of revenue.
For the fourth quarters of 2020 and 2019, our diluted EPS was $3.66 and $4.18, respectively. For the fourth quarter of 2020, our adjusted EPS was up 7% to $5.23 per share as compared to $4.90 per share in the prior year fourth quarter. For the full years 2020 and 2019, diluted EPS was $7.65 and $8.02, respectively. For the full year 2020, adjusted EPS was up 7% to $11.70 per share versus $10.96 per share in the prior year. Foreign currency rate changes caused an increase in our consolidated revenue of $42 million or 2% of revenue for the quarter compared to the prior year fourth quarter, with $0.05 tailwind to adjusted diluted EPS this quarter. Foreign currency rate changes caused a decrease in our consolidated revenue of $10 million for the full year 2020 compared to the prior year, with a $0.01 headwind to adjusted diluted EPS overall for the year.
I'd also like to note that our fourth quarter 2020 unallocated net expenses grew to $122 million from $57 million in the prior year fourth quarter. As we mentioned at our second quarter earnings call, this cost category relates to corporate functions and other budgeted -- unbudgeted costs that we don't directly allocate to this segments each quarter, including items such as true-ups on benefit and stock compensation expense accruals, incentive accrual adjustments and other items. In Q4, the year-over-year increase mostly relates to incentive accrual adjustments, as discretionary compensation increased alongside improved performance.
Our U.S. GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter was 19.7% versus 18.3% in the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was 17.8%, down from 19.4% rate in the prior year. For the full year, the U.S. GAAP tax rate was 23.8% for 2020 as compared to 18.8% for the prior year, while the adjusted tax rate was 20.8% compared to 20.3% for the prior year. The current year tax rate was higher as a result of enacted statutory tax rate changes in the U.K., requiring us to remeasure our U.K. deferred tax liabilities and recognize a discrete deferred tax expense of $11 million or $0.08 on an adjusted EPS basis from the third quarter of 2020. Excluding this nonrecurring item, our adjusted tax rate for all the full year would have been approximately 20%.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the fourth quarter with a strong capital and liquidity position, with cash and cash equivalents of $2.1 billion and full capacity in our undrawn $1.25 billion revolving credit facility. Willis Towers Watson remains well positioned from a liquidity perspective. We aim to continue to maintain a strong and durable balance sheet and continue pushing forward our cost savings and efficiency initiatives. We continue to monitor the ever-evolving impact of the pandemic and are prepared to take appropriate measures as needed to preserve our financial position.
Lastly, full year free cash flow almost doubled to $1.6 billion from $835 million in the prior year. This far exceeds the $1 billion we targeted as part of our original pre-COVID guidance that we gave during last year's fourth quarter earnings call despite also having paid approximately $7 million in cash-based transaction integration costs. The remarkable year-over-year growth in free cash flow is primarily due to improvements in working capital, coupled with our effective cost-containment efforts. The substantial increase in free cash flow is a testament to the hard work of our colleagues, who remain dedicated and focused on improving this performance in this area despite all the additional demands they were juggling in 2020.
In terms of capital allocation for full year of 2020, we paid approximately $346 million in dividends. We do not expect to repurchase any shares in 2021 given certain prohibitions in the transaction agreement with Aon. Pension contributions to our qualified plans totaled $129 million in 2020, and we're currently projecting contributions of $132 million for 2021. We remain committed to deleveraging in the near term. In March, we will use on-hand cash to pay the $500 million in senior notes due. We will also use our cash to fund the $210 million of payments related to the settlement of Stanford and Willis Towers Watson merger-related litigations.
Now as a general matter, the COVID-19 pandemic did not have a material adverse impact to our overall financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. However, the pandemic did impact revenue growth, particularly in some discretionary lines, it was -- and we expect that the effects of COVID-19 on general economic activity will negatively impact our revenue results in 2021. The duration of the pandemic, the full magnitude of its economic impact and the subsequent speed of recovery remain unknown. In the meantime, we remain focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet, liquidity and financial flexibility.
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused considerable economic upheaval, but I'm very proud of our leadership team and the resolve of our colleagues in supporting our clients during these difficult times. These fourth quarter results are a direct reflection of the agility of our global model. Overall, we delivered solid financial performance in the fourth quarter, and I remain confident in our ability to continue driving value for all our stakeholders.
I'll now turn the call back to you -- back to John."

I'd like to extend my heartfelt thanks to all our colleagues for their dedication, professionalism and support of 1 another. Thank you for continuing to bring your very best on the table every day. Your solidarity and resilience are truly inspiring. 
Our accomplishments in quarter 1 are reflective of our purpose and action. The impact of our work extends to the people and our client organizations to each other and to our communities. For many of us, this greater impact is our why. It's the purpose behind the work we do. Creating clarity and confidence today for a more sustainable tomorrow. Grounded in this sense of purpose, we've continued to partner with our clients to help strengthen their resilience and progress towards long-term success. 
The events of the past year have sharpened our focus. Our clients, our colleagues and our other stakeholders expect us to conduct our business with integrity and in an environmentally and socially responsible manner with high ethical standards. We take these expectations seriously and have embraced principles that are aligned with our business priorities are consistent with our commitment to ethical and sustainable practices and demonstrate our respect for the communities in which we operate around the globe. 
For this reason, Willis Towers Watson has partnered with companies worldwide to increase racial justice by joining the World Economic Forums Racial Justice and Business Initiative. The purpose of this initiative is to build more equitable and just workplaces for professionals with underrepresented racial and ethnic identities. Willis Towers Watson is among 44 founding members, representing 5.2 million employees and 13 industries. As part of this ongoing global conversation with leading organizations worldwide, we can both learn from them to increase racial diversity and inclusion inside the company and contribute our own ideas to address the issue more broadly. In working towards the goal of improving the communities which we serve, I'm proud to say we recently announced our commitment to delivering net zero greenhouse gas emissions in alignment with the science-based targets initiative by 2015 at the latest, with at least 50% reduction by 2030. 
Through improvements to energy efficiency in our operations, leveraging virtual meeting tools, promoting recycling and encouraging our colleagues to adapt environmentally responsible habits, the company aims to minimize its carbon emissions and any other related harmful environmental impacts. 
Turning now to our proposed combination with Aon. We continue to be excited about the potential of the combined firm and are committed to its completion. Upon close, we will serve a common purpose to serve clients and improve communities, blending the best of both of our firms. We'll innovate on behalf of our clients and co-create solutions to address unmet client needs. We will build inclusive and diverse teams, engage colleagues and enable them to deliver their full potential. During the first quarter, we continued to build momentum towards closing the transaction with Aon and made significant progress in our integration planning efforts. We anticipate closing in the first half of 2021, subject, of course, to regulatory approvals. 
Now let's move on to our first quarter results. Reported revenue for the first quarter was $2.6 billion. That's up 5% as compared to the prior year first quarter, up 1% on a constant currency basis and up 4% on an organic basis. In quarter 1, we continued to face some headwinds due to macroeconomic factors such as COVID-19. In the prior year, we only started to see the impacts near the end of the first quarter. We started to experience some improvement in areas where revenue is tied to discretionary project spending. 
Similar to last quarter, we experienced solid financial performance in areas where we have a well-established market position, mature relationships and annuity or compliance-driven business. Net income was $736 million, up 135% for the first quarter as compared to $313 million of net income in the prior year first quarter. It should be noted, we disposed of our Miller Wholesale business on March 1, 2020, for $696 million in proceeds and a gain of $356 million on a tax-free basis or $2.73 per share. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $730 million or 28.2% of revenue for the first quarter as compared to $680 million or 27.6% of revenue for the same period last year, representing a 7% increase on an adjusted EBITDA dollar basis and 60 basis of margin improvement. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $5.63, an increase of 140% as compared to the prior year. This included a net $350 million gain on disposal of operations, mostly resulting from the sale of our Miller Wholesale business. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $3.64 for the first quarter, reflecting an increase of 9% compared to the prior year. Overall, it was a solid quarter. We grew revenue, we enhanced margin performance and we increased earnings per share. Now let's take a look at each of the segments in more detail. To provide clear comparability with prior periods, all commentary regarding the results of our segments will be on an organic basis, unless specifically stated otherwise. 
Segment margins are calculated using segment revenue, and they exclude unallocated corporate costs such as amortization of intangibles, certain transaction and integration expenses resulting from mergers and acquisitions as well as other items which we consider noncore to our operating results. The segment results do include discretionary compensation. 
The Health Capital & Benefits, HCB, segment revenue was flat on an organic basis and constant currency basis compared to the prior -- the first quarter of the prior year and generated this similar level of revenue with 1 less billing day this year. This result represents sequential revenue improvement compared to our prior quarter, which was driven by increased demand for advisory services across various lines of business. Talent and Rewards revenue decreased nominally, with the uptick in executive compensation and rewards strategy work offset by declines in our traditional survey sales and communications and change management offerings. 
Our Health and Benefits revenue was flat for the quarter. We continue to grow revenue from advisory work in North America and global benefit management and local brokerage appointments outside of North America. However, this growth was offset by lower commission-based revenue, which was tied to prior year book sales. Retirement revenue was also flat compared to the prior year, with funding and guaranteed minimum pension equalization work in Great Britain, offset by declines in North America resulting from 1 less billing day and less derisking activity. 
Technology and Administration Solutions revenue grew moderately, primarily due to increased project work and new business activity in Great Britain. HCB's operating margin increased by 20 basis points compared to the prior year first quarter as a result of continued expense reduction efforts. We're pleased with HCB's sequential improvement and margin growth. Our long-term outlook on HCB remains positive. That pandemic has changed the needs and demands of workers and workplaces. HCB stands ready to help clients navigate the transition. 
Now let's look at Corporate Risk & Broking, or CRB, which had a revenue increase of 5% on an organic and constant currency basis as compared to the prior year first quarter. Great Britain and International's revenue increased 8% and 15%, respectively, for the first quarter. The revenue increases were primarily driven by new business wins, most notably in natural resource and FINEX insurance lines. 
North America's revenue was up by 6% in the first quarter, driven by strong renewals across all regions, but also particularly in the FINEX lines. Revenue for Western Europe decreased 2% due to both the timing of some revenue moving to later quarters and the departure of some senior staff, which pressured business in certain geographies. CRB revenue was $810 million for the quarter, with an operating margin of 20.0% compared to $739 million of revenue with an operating margin of 17.2% in the prior year first quarter. The 200 basis -- 280 basis point margin improvement reflects the continuation of effective cost containment. 
To see the strong top line growth and improved profitability in the first quarter is encouraging, and we remain optimistic about both CRB's short-term and long-term growth prospects. In a world marked by uncertainty, CRB goes beyond the traditional boundaries of insurance products and risk management to deliver services that help organizations prepare for what may lie ahead. 
Turning to Investment, Risk and Reinsurance, or IRR. Revenue for the first quarter was $605 million, an increase of 4% on an organic basis and a decrease of 5% on a constant currency basis as compared to the prior year first quarter. Reinsurance with growth of 4% continued to lead the segment's growth through a combination of net new business and favorable renewal factors. The Insurance Consulting and Technology and Investment businesses also contributed to the segment's revenue growth. Both lines of business were up 8% compared to the first quarter of the prior year, having benefited from increased demand for advisory work. 
Insurance Consulting and Technology revenue growth was aided further by increased software sales. The Wholesale business was down 14% on an organic basis. Although that's reported as organic, about half of the decline was because we transferred Wholesale Special Contingency Risk business to the CRB segment in the fourth quarter of 2020. The remainder of the revenue decline was largely caused by ongoing pressure on various insurance lines from COVID-19.  As a reminder, we sold the Wholesale business on March 1, 2021. 
IRR had an operating margin of 47.9%, up 280 basis points as compared to 45.1% for the first -- prior year first quarter. The strong margin expansion was a result of careful cost containment efforts, coupled with solid top line growth. IRR helps businesses and communities to sustainably navigate the risks and opportunities ahead. IRR's powerful combination of advisory services, technology solutions and analytical capabilities continues to create value for companies as they reevaluate risk and reinforce resilience post pandemic. 
Revenue for the Benefits Delivery & Administration or BDA, segment increased by 23% on an organic basis and 24% on a constant currency basis from the prior year first quarter. The growth in revenue was largely driven by individual marketplace, primarily by TRANZACT, which contributed $148 million to BDA's top line this quarter with growth in Medicare Advantage products. The Benefits Outsourcing business also contributed to the increase in revenue, which was largely driven by its expanded client base. 
The BDA segment had revenue of $287 million with a 2.5% operating margin as compared to revenue of $231 million and a negative operating margin of minus 4.7% in the prior year fourth quarter -- first quarter, excuse me. We continue to feel positive about the momentum of our BDA business for 2021. For many people, the pandemic has highlighted the importance of securing health and wellness plans that meet their individual needs. BDA provides education, communication and decision support tools that empower employers, employees and retirees to navigate the changing world of benefits. 
Overall, I'm very pleased with our results this quarter. We delivered strong overall financial performance with top line growth, margin expansion and EPS growth all while continuing to make progress against strategic initiatives and our proposed combination with Aon. Now I'll turn the call over to Mike."

We have asked a lot of our teams and our colleagues continue to pull together and deliver. I'm proud of all the work they have done to continue supporting our clients each other and the communities in which we work and live. We're off to a solid start this year. While we continue to face some headwinds from COVID-19 pandemic, we are reassured by the improved demand for our discretionary services and solutions and by our ability to generate profitable growth. 
We're pleased to see another quarter of solid revenue growth with underlying adjusted EPS growth, while free cash flow decreased and improved when normalized for certain significant litigation and compensation payments made this quarter. Now I'll turn to the overall detailed financial results. 
Income from operations for the first quarter was $452 million or 17.5% of revenue, up 290 basis points from the prior year first quarter income from operations of $360 million or 14.6% of revenue. Adjusted operating income for the first quarter was $579 million or 22.4% of revenue, up 110 basis points from $525 million or 21.3% of revenue in the prior year first quarter. For the first quarters of 2021 and 2020, our diluted EPS were $5.63 and $2.34, respectively, which included the $359 million gain on disposals. 
For the first quarter of 2021, our adjusted EPS was up 9% to $3.64 per share as compared to $3.34 per share in the prior year first quarter. Foreign currency rate changes caused an increase in our consolidated revenue of $86 million or 4% of revenue for the quarter compared to the prior year first quarter with $0.12 tailwind to adjusted diluted EPS per share this quarter. 
Our U.S. GAAP tax rate for the first quarter was 11.5% versus 20% in the prior year. The current quarter tax rate was lower primarily due to the tax-exempt disposal of our Miller business. Our adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was 20.5%, up nominally from 20.4% in the prior year. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with a strong capital and liquidity position with cash and cash equivalents of $2 billion and full capacity in our undrawn $1.25 billion revolving credit facility. We also successfully reduced our leverage profile by repaying $500 million of bonds outstanding during the quarter. Willis Towers Watson remains well positioned from a liquidity perspective. We aim to continue to maintain a strong and durable balance sheet and continue pushing forward on our cost savings and efficiency initiatives. 
As the economic recovery unfolds, we will continue to monitor the ever-evolving impact of the pandemic and are prepared to take appropriate measures as needed to preserve our financial position. Free cash flow was a negative $165 million compared to negative $43 million in the prior year. The decrease in the year-over-year free cash flow was due to the net legal settlement payments of approximately $185 million in respect to the previously announced Stanford and Willis Towers Watson merger settlement and higher incentive compensation and benefit-related items of approximately $180 million. 
Absent these one-off items, free cash flow would have increased, more accurately reflecting our run rate improvements in working capital and cost containment efforts. We've made tremendous progress to improve our free cash flow in 2020, and we remain dedicated and focused on maintaining our progress in this area in 2021. In terms of capital allocation, in the first quarter of 2021, we paid approximately $92 million in dividends. We do not expect to repurchase any shares for the remainder of 2021, given certain prohibitions in the transaction agreement with Aon in connection with our pending business combination. 
Pension contribution to our qualified plans totaled $86 million in the first quarter, and we are currently projecting contributions of $126 million for 2021. As a general matter, COVID-19 pandemic did not have a material adverse impact on our overall financial results in 2020 or in the first quarter of 2021. However, the pandemic did continue to impact revenue growth, particularly in some discretionary lines, and we expect the effects of COVID-19 on general economic activity may continue to negatively impact our revenue and results for the remainder of 2021. 
The duration of the pandemic, the full magnitude of its economic impact and the subsequent speed of recovery remain unknown. In the meantime, we remain focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet, liquidity and financial flexibility. We are very pleased with these first quarter results. They are a direct reflection of our resilience and our continued focus on strategic priorities. Our first quarter results were very encouraging. We have momentum, solid financial results and a strong balance sheet and an excellent team, which gives me confidence in our ability to continue driving value for all our stakeholders. And now I'll turn the call back to John."

But overall, our -- if I look at it segment by segment, our turnover is slightly improved. Now at the same time, every time a transaction like a big merger or acquisition gets announced, there are some people that decide they don't want to be part of the new organization. And certainly, we've seen that in some instances. But when we look at it in terms of the overall impact, it's not necessarily showing up as a big overall impact. But we can certainly point to isolated instances where that's happened. 
Those are the kind of things we've seen happen before in this business, and we think we're prepared to deal with them, but it is something we continue to look at."

I'm pleased wi",1995,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on our first quarter 2021 earnings call. Joining me today is Mike Burwell, our Chief Financial Officer. Today, we'll review our results for the first quarter of 2021. I'm pleased with our first quarter financial results and the continued momentum in our business. We generated organic revenue growth of 4% and 110 basis point adjusted operating margin improvement. Each of our operating segments contributed to the margin expansion this quarter, driven by new business generation, strong retention rates and increased operating leverage across our core businesses. 
Through the first quarter of 2021, our colleagues continued their tremendous efforts to serve our clients through these challenging times and delivered a strong financial performance. I'd like to extend my heartfelt thanks to all our colleagues for their dedication, professionalism and support of one another. Thank you for continuing to bring your very best on the table every day. Your solidarity and resilience are truly inspiring.
Our accomplishments in quarter 1 are reflective of our purpose and action. The impact of our work extends to the people and our client organizations to each other and to our communities. For many of us, this greater impact is our why. It's the purpose behind the work we do. Creating clarity and confidence today for a more sustainable tomorrow. Grounded in this sense of purpose, we've continued to partner with our clients to help strengthen their resilience and progress towards long-term success.
The events of the past year have sharpened our focus. Our clients, our colleagues and our other stakeholders expect us to conduct our business with integrity and in an environmentally and socially responsible manner with high ethical standards. We take these expectations seriously and have embraced principles that are aligned with our business priorities are consistent with our commitment to ethical and sustainable practices and demonstrate our respect for the communities in which we operate around the globe. 
For this reason, Willis Towers Watson has partnered with companies worldwide to increase racial justice by joining the World Economic Forums Racial Justice and Business Initiative. The purpose of this initiative is to build more equitable and just workplaces for professionals with underrepresented racial and ethnic identities. Willis Towers Watson is among 44 founding members, representing 5.2 million employees and 13 industries. 
As part of this ongoing global conversation with leading organizations worldwide, we can both learn from them to increase racial diversity and inclusion inside the company and contribute our own ideas to address the issue more broadly. In working towards the goal of improving the communities which we serve, I'm proud to say we recently announced our commitment to delivering net zero greenhouse gas emissions in alignment with the science-based targets initiative by 2015 at the latest, with at least 50% reduction by 2030.
Through improvements to energy efficiency in our operations, leveraging virtual meeting tools, promoting recycling and encouraging our colleagues to adapt environmentally responsible habits, the company aims to minimize its carbon emissions and any other related harmful environmental impacts.
Turning now to our proposed combination with Aon. We continue to be excited about the potential of the combined firm and are committed to its completion. Upon close, we will serve a common purpose, to serve clients and improve communities, blending the best of both of our firms. We'll innovate on behalf of our clients and co-create solutions to address unmet client needs. We will build inclusive and diverse teams, engage colleagues and enable them to deliver their full potential. During the first quarter, we continued to build momentum towards closing the transaction with Aon and made significant progress in our integration planning efforts. We anticipate closing in the first half of 2021, subject, of course, to regulatory approvals. 
Now let's move on to our first quarter results. Reported revenue for the first quarter was $2.6 billion. That's up 5% as compared to the prior year first quarter, up 1% on a constant currency basis and up 4% on an organic basis. In quarter 1, we continued to face some headwinds due to macroeconomic factors such as COVID-19. In the prior year, we only started to see the impacts near the end of the first quarter. We started to experience some improvement in areas where revenue is tied to discretionary project spending.
Similar to last quarter, we experienced solid financial performance in areas where we have a well-established market position, mature relationships and annuity or compliance-driven business. Net income was $736 million, up 135% for the first quarter as compared to $313 million of net income in the prior year first quarter. It should be noted, we disposed off our Miller Wholesale business on March 1, 2020, for $696 million in proceeds and a gain of $356 million on a tax-free basis or $2.73 per share. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $730 million or 28.2% of revenue for the first quarter as compared to $680 million or 27.6% of revenue for the same period last year, representing a 7% increase on an adjusted EBITDA dollar basis and 60 basis of margin improvement. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $5.63, an increase of 140% as compared to the prior year. This included a net $350 million gain on disposal of operations, mostly resulting from the sale of our Miller Wholesale business. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $3.64 for the first quarter, reflecting an increase of 9% compared to the prior year. Overall, it was a solid quarter. We grew revenue, we enhanced margin performance and we increased earnings per share. Now let's take a look at each of the segments in more detail. To provide clear comparability with prior periods, all commentary regarding the results of our segments will be on an organic basis, unless specifically stated otherwise. 
Segment margins are calculated using segment revenue, and they exclude unallocated corporate costs such as amortization of intangibles, certain transaction and integration expenses resulting from mergers and acquisitions as well as other items which we consider noncore to our operating results. The segment results do include discretionary compensation. 
The Health Capital & Benefits, HCB, segment revenue was flat on an organic basis and constant currency basis compared to the prior -- the first quarter of the prior year and generated this similar level of revenue with 1 less billing day this year. This result represents sequential revenue improvement compared to our prior quarter, which was driven by increased demand for advisory services across various lines of business. Talent and Rewards revenue decreased nominally, with the uptick in executive compensation and rewards strategy work offset by declines in our traditional survey sales and communications and change management offerings. 
Our Health and Benefits revenue was flat for the quarter. We continue to grow revenue from advisory work in North America and global benefit management and local brokerage appointments outside of North America. However, this growth was offset by lower commission-based revenue, which was tied to prior year book sales. Retirement revenue was also flat compared to the prior year, with funding and guaranteed minimum pension equalization work in Great Britain, offset by declines in North America resulting from 1 less billing day and less derisking activity. 
Technology and Administration Solutions revenue grew moderately, primarily due to increased project work and new business activity in Great Britain. HCB's operating margin increased by 20 basis points compared to the prior year first quarter as a result of continued expense reduction efforts. We're pleased with HCB's sequential improvement and margin growth. Our long-term outlook on HCB remains positive. The pandemic has changed the needs and demands of workers and workplaces. HCB stands ready to help clients navigate the transition.
Now let's look at Corporate Risk & Broking, or CRB, which had a revenue increase of 5% on an organic and constant currency basis as compared to the prior year first quarter. Great Britain and International's revenue increased 8% and 15%, respectively, for the first quarter. The revenue increases were primarily driven by new business wins, most notably in natural resource and FINEX insurance lines. 
North America's revenue was up by 6% in the first quarter, driven by strong renewals across all regions, but also particularly in the FINEX lines. Revenue for Western Europe decreased 2% due to both the timing of some revenue moving to later quarters and the departure of some senior staff, which pressured business in certain geographies. CRB revenue was $810 million for the quarter, with an operating margin of 20.0% compared to $739 million of revenue with an operating margin of 17.2% in the prior year first quarter. The 200 basis -- 280 basis point margin improvement reflects the continuation of effective cost containment. 
To see the strong top line growth and improved profitability in the first quarter is encouraging, and we remain optimistic about both CRB's short-term and long-term growth prospects. In a world marked by uncertainty, CRB goes beyond the traditional boundaries of insurance products and risk management to deliver services that help organizations prepare for what may lie ahead. 
Turning to Investment, Risk and Reinsurance, or IRR. Revenue for the first quarter was $605 million, an increase of 4% on an organic basis and a decrease of 5% on a constant currency basis as compared to the prior year first quarter. Reinsurance with growth of 4% continued to lead the segment's growth through a combination of net new business and favorable renewal factors. The Insurance Consulting and Technology and Investment businesses also contributed to the segment's revenue growth. Both lines of business were up 8% compared to the first quarter of the prior year, having benefited from increased demand for advisory work.
Insurance Consulting and Technology revenue growth was aided further by increased software sales. The Wholesale business was down 14% on an organic basis. Although that's reported as organic, about half of the decline was because we transferred Wholesale Special Contingency Risks Business to the CRB segment in the fourth quarter of 2020. The remainder of the revenue decline was largely caused by ongoing pressure on various insurance lines from COVID-19.  As a reminder, we sold the Wholesale business on March 1, 2021. 
IRR had an operating margin of 47.9%, up 280 basis points as compared to 45.1% for the first -- prior year first quarter. The strong margin expansion was a result of careful cost containment efforts, coupled with solid top line growth. IRR helps businesses and communities to sustainably navigate the risks and opportunities ahead. IRR's powerful combination of advisory services, technology solutions and analytical capabilities continues to create value for companies as they reevaluate risk and reinforce resilience post pandemic. 
Revenue for the Benefits Delivery & Administration or BDA Segment increased by 23% on an organic basis and 24% on a constant currency basis from the prior year first quarter. The growth in revenue was largely driven by individual marketplace, primarily by TRANZACT, which contributed $148 million to BDA's top line this quarter with growth in Medicare Advantage products. The Benefits Outsourcing business also contributed to the increase in revenue, which was largely driven by its expanded client base.
The BDA segment had revenue of $287 million with a 2.5% operating margin as compared to revenue of $231 million and a negative operating margin of minus 4.7% in the prior year fourth quarter -- first quarter, excuse me. We continue to feel positive about the momentum of our BDA business for 2021. For many people, the pandemic has highlighted the importance of securing health and wellness plans that meet their individual needs. BDA provides education, communication and decision support tools that empower employers, employees and retirees to navigate the changing world of benefits.
Overall, I'm very pleased with our results this quarter. We delivered strong overall financial performance with top line growth, margin expansion and EPS growth all while continuing to make progress against strategic initiatives and our proposed combination with Aon. Now I'll turn the call over to Mike."

We have asked a lot of our teams and our colleagues continue to pull together and deliver. I'm proud of all the work they have done to continue supporting our clients each other and the communities in which we work and live. We're off to a solid start this year. While we continue to face some headwinds from COVID-19 pandemic, we are reassured by the improved demand for our discretionary services and solutions and by our ability to generate profitable growth.
We're pleased to see another quarter of solid revenue growth with underlying adjusted EPS growth, while free cash flow decreased and improved when normalized for certain significant litigation and compensation payments made this quarter. Now I'll turn to the overall detailed financial results.
Income from operations for the first quarter was $452 million or 17.5% of revenue, up 290 basis points from the prior year first quarter income from operations of $360 million or 14.6% of revenue. Adjusted operating income for the first quarter was $579 million or 22.4% of revenue, up 110 basis points from $525 million or 21.3% of revenue in the prior year first quarter. For the first quarters of 2021 and 2020, our diluted EPS were $5.63 and $2.34, respectively, which included the $359 million gain on disposals. 
For the first quarter of 2021, our adjusted EPS was up 9% to $3.64 per share as compared to $3.34 per share in the prior year first quarter. Foreign currency rate changes caused an increase in our consolidated revenue of $86 million or 4% of revenue for the quarter compared to the prior year first quarter with $0.12 tailwind to adjusted diluted EPS per share this quarter. 
Our U.S. GAAP tax rate for the first quarter was 11.5% versus 20% in the prior year. The current quarter tax rate was lower primarily due to the tax-exempt disposal of our Miller Business. Our adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was 20.5%, up nominally from 20.4% in the prior year.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with a strong capital and liquidity position with cash and cash equivalents of $2 billion and full capacity in our undrawn $1.25 billion revolving credit facility. We also successfully reduced our leverage profile by repaying $500 million of bonds outstanding during the quarter. Willis Towers Watson remains well positioned from a liquidity perspective. We aim to continue to maintain a strong and durable balance sheet and continue pushing forward on our cost savings and efficiency initiatives.
As the economic recovery unfolds, we will continue to monitor the ever-evolving impact of the pandemic and are prepared to take appropriate measures as needed to preserve our financial position. Free cash flow was a negative $165 million compared to negative $43 million in the prior year. The decrease in the year-over-year free cash flow was due to the net legal settlement payments of approximately $185 million in respect to the previously announced Stanford and Willis Towers Watson merger settlement and higher incentive compensation and benefit-related items of approximately $180 million. 
Absent these one-off items, free cash flow would have increased, more accurately reflecting our run rate improvements in working capital and cost containment efforts. We've made tremendous progress to improve our free cash flow in 2020, and we remain dedicated and focused on maintaining our progress in this area in 2021. In terms of capital allocation, in the first quarter of 2021, we paid approximately $92 million in dividends. We do not expect to repurchase any shares for the remainder of 2021, given certain prohibitions in the transaction agreement with Aon in connection with our pending business combination.
Pension contribution to our qualified plans totaled $86 million in the first quarter, and we are currently projecting contributions of $126 million for 2021. As a general matter, COVID-19 pandemic did not have a material or adverse impact on our overall financial results in 2020 or in the first quarter of 2021. However, the pandemic did continue to impact revenue growth, particularly in some discretionary lines, and we expect the effects of COVID-19 on general economic activity may continue to negatively impact our revenue and results for the remainder of 2021. 
The duration of the pandemic, the full magnitude of its economic impact and the subsequent speed of recovery remain unknown. In the meantime, we remain focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet, liquidity and financial flexibility. We are very pleased with these first quarter results. They are a direct reflection of our resilience and our continued focus on strategic priorities. Our first quarter results were very encouraging. We have momentum, solid financial results and a strong balance sheet and an excellent team, which gives me confidence in our ability to continue driving value for all our stakeholders. And now I'll turn the call back to John."

But overall, our -- if I look at it segment by segment, our turnover is slightly improved. Now at the same time, every time a transaction like a big merger or acquisition gets announced, there are some people that decide they don't want to be part of the new organization. And certainly, we've seen that in some instances. But when we look at it in terms of the overall impact, it's not necessarily showing up as a big overall impact. But we can certainly point to isolated instances where that's happened.

There's lots of potential changes, which could read down to the benefit of organizations like TRANZACT. 
So we think we're in the early innings, second, third. I mean, this is -- there's a lot left to play out here yet, I think, Mark."

I'm pleased wi",1993,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on our first quarter 2021 earnings call. Joining me today is Mike Burwell, our Chief Financial Officer. Today, we'll review our results for the first quarter of 2021. I'm pleased with our first quarter financial results and the continued momentum in our business. We generated organic revenue growth of 4% and 110 basis point adjusted operating margin improvement. Each of our operating segments contributed to the margin expansion this quarter, driven by new business generation, strong retention rates and increased operating leverage across our core businesses. 
Through the first quarter of 2021, our colleagues continued their tremendous efforts to serve our clients through these challenging times and delivered a strong financial performance. I'd like to extend my heartfelt thanks to all our colleagues for their dedication, professionalism and support of one another. Thank you for continuing to bring your very best to the table every day. Your solidarity and resilience are truly inspiring.
Our accomplishments in quarter 1 are reflective of our purpose and action. The impact of our work extends to the people and our client organizations to each other and to our communities. For many of us, this greater impact is our why. It's the purpose behind the work we do. Creating clarity and confidence today for a more sustainable tomorrow. Grounded in this sense of purpose, we've continued to partner with our clients to help strengthen their resilience and progress towards long-term success.
The events of the past year have sharpened our focus. Our clients, our colleagues and our other stakeholders expect us to conduct our business with integrity and in an environmentally and socially responsible manner with high ethical standards. We take these expectations seriously and have embraced principles that are aligned with our business priorities are consistent with our commitment to ethical and sustainable practices and demonstrate our respect for the communities in which we operate around the globe. 
For this reason, Willis Towers Watson has partnered with companies worldwide to increase racial justice by joining the World Economic Forums Racial Justice and Business Initiative. The purpose of this initiative is to build more equitable and just workplaces for professionals with underrepresented racial and ethnic identities. Willis Towers Watson is among 44 founding members, representing 5.2 million employees and 13 industries. 
As part of this ongoing global conversation with leading organizations worldwide, we can both learn from them to increase racial diversity and inclusion inside the company and contribute our own ideas to address the issue more broadly. In working towards the goal of improving the communities which we serve, I'm proud to say we recently announced our commitment to delivering net zero greenhouse gas emissions in alignment with the science-based targets initiative by 2015 at the latest, with at least 50% reduction by 2030.
Through improvements to energy efficiency in our operations, leveraging virtual meeting tools, promoting recycling and encouraging our colleagues to adapt environmentally responsible habits, the company aims to minimize its carbon emissions and any other related harmful environmental impacts.
Turning now to our proposed combination with Aon. We continue to be excited about the potential of the combined firm and are committed to its completion. Upon close, we will serve a common purpose, to serve clients and improve communities, blending the best of both of our firms. We'll innovate on behalf of our clients and co-create solutions to address unmet client needs. We will build inclusive and diverse teams, engage colleagues and enable them to deliver their full potential. During the first quarter, we continued to build momentum towards closing the transaction with Aon and made significant progress in our integration planning efforts. We anticipate closing in the first half of 2021, subject, of course, to regulatory approvals. 
Now let's move on to our first quarter results. Reported revenue for the first quarter was $2.6 billion. That's up 5% as compared to the prior year first quarter, up 1% on a constant currency basis and up 4% on an organic basis. In quarter 1, we continued to face some headwinds due to macroeconomic factors such as COVID-19. In the prior year, we only started to see the impacts near the end of the first quarter. We started to experience some improvement in areas where revenue is tied to discretionary project spending.
Similar to last quarter, we experienced solid financial performance in areas where we have a well-established market position, mature relationships and annuity or compliance-driven business. Net income was $736 million, up 135% for the first quarter as compared to $313 million of net income in the prior year first quarter. It should be noted, we disposed of our Miller Wholesale business on March 1, 2020, for $696 million in proceeds and a gain of $356 million on a tax-free basis or $2.73 per share. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $730 million or 28.2% of revenue for the first quarter as compared to $680 million or 27.6% of revenue for the same period last year, representing a 7% increase on an adjusted EBITDA dollar basis and 60 basis of margin improvement. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $5.63, an increase of 140% as compared to the prior year. This included a net $350 million gain on disposal of operations, mostly resulting from the sale of our Miller Wholesale business. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $3.64 for the first quarter, reflecting an increase of 9% compared to the prior year. Overall, it was a solid quarter. We grew revenue, we enhanced margin performance and we increased earnings per share. Now let's take a look at each of the segments in more detail. To provide clear comparability with prior periods, all commentary regarding the results of our segments will be on an organic basis, unless specifically stated otherwise. 
Segment margins are calculated using segment revenue, and they exclude unallocated corporate costs such as amortization of intangibles, certain transaction and integration expenses resulting from mergers and acquisitions as well as other items which we consider noncore to our operating results. The segment results do include discretionary compensation. 
The Human Capital & Benefits, HCB, segment revenue was flat on an organic basis and constant currency basis compared to the prior -- the first quarter of the prior year and generated this similar level of revenue with 1 less billing day this year. This result represents sequential revenue improvement compared to our prior quarter, which was driven by increased demand for advisory services across various lines of business. Talent and Rewards revenue decreased nominally, with the uptick in executive compensation and rewards strategy work offset by declines in our traditional survey sales and communications and change management offerings. 
Our Health and Benefits revenue was flat for the quarter. We continue to grow revenue from advisory work in North America and global benefit management and local brokerage appointments outside of North America. However, this growth was offset by lower commission-based revenue, which was tied to prior year book sales. Retirement revenue was also flat compared to the prior year, with funding and guaranteed minimum pension equalization work in Great Britain, offset by declines in North America resulting from 1 less billing day and less derisking activity. 
Technology and Administration Solutions revenue grew moderately, primarily due to increased project work and new business activity in Great Britain. HCB's operating margin increased by 20 basis points compared to the prior year first quarter as a result of continued expense reduction efforts. We're pleased with HCB's sequential improvement and margin growth. Our long-term outlook on HCB remains positive. The pandemic has changed the needs and demands of workers and workplaces. HCB stands ready to help clients navigate the transition.
Now let's look at Corporate Risk & Broking, or CRB, which had a revenue increase of 5% on an organic and constant currency basis as compared to the prior year first quarter. Great Britain and International's revenue increased 8% and 15%, respectively, for the first quarter. The revenue increases were primarily driven by new business wins, most notably in natural resource and FINEX insurance lines. 
North America's revenue was up by 6% in the first quarter, driven by strong renewals across all regions, but also particularly in the FINEX lines. Revenue for Western Europe decreased 2% due to both the timing of some revenue moving to later quarters and the departure of some senior staff, which pressured business in certain geographies. CRB revenue was $810 million for the quarter, with an operating margin of 20.0% compared to $739 million of revenue with an operating margin of 17.2% in the prior year first quarter. The 200 basis -- 280 basis point margin improvement reflects the continuation of effective cost containment. 
To see the strong top line growth and improved profitability in the first quarter is encouraging, and we remain optimistic about both CRB's short-term and long-term growth prospects. In a world marked by uncertainty, CRB goes beyond the traditional boundaries of insurance products and risk management to deliver services that help organizations prepare for what may lie ahead. 
Turning to Investment, Risk and Reinsurance, or IRR. Revenue for the first quarter was $605 million, an increase of 4% on an organic basis and a decrease of 5% on a constant currency basis as compared to the prior year first quarter. Reinsurance with growth of 4% continued to lead the segment's growth through a combination of net new business and favorable renewal factors. The Insurance Consulting and Technology and Investment businesses also contributed to the segment's revenue growth. Both lines of business were up 8% compared to the first quarter of the prior year, having benefited from increased demand for advisory work.
Insurance Consulting and Technology revenue growth was aided further by increased software sales. The Wholesale business was down 14% on an organic basis. Although that's reported as organic, about half of the decline was because we transferred Wholesale Special Contingency Risks Business to the CRB segment in the fourth quarter of 2020. The remainder of the revenue decline was largely caused by ongoing pressure on various insurance lines from COVID-19.  As a reminder, we sold the Wholesale business on March 1, 2021. 
IRR had an operating margin of 47.9%, up 280 basis points as compared to 45.1% for the prior year first quarter. The strong margin expansion was a result of careful cost containment efforts, coupled with solid top line growth. IRR helps businesses and communities to sustainably navigate the risks and opportunities ahead. IRR's powerful combination of advisory services, technology solutions and analytical capabilities continues to create value for companies as they reevaluate risk and reinforce resilience post pandemic. 
Revenue for the Benefits Delivery & Administration or BDA Segment increased by 23% on an organic basis and 24% on a constant currency basis from the prior year first quarter. The growth in revenue was largely driven by individual marketplace, primarily by TRANZACT, which contributed $148 million to BDA's top line this quarter with growth in Medicare Advantage products. The Benefits Outsourcing business also contributed to the increase in revenue, which was largely driven by its expanded client base.
The BDA segment had revenue of $287 million with a 2.5% operating margin as compared to revenue of $231 million and a negative operating margin of minus 4.7% in the prior year fourth quarter -- first quarter, excuse me. We continue to feel positive about the momentum of our BDA business for 2021. For many people, the pandemic has highlighted the importance of securing health and wellness plans that meet their individual needs. BDA provides education, communication and decision support tools that empower employers, employees and retirees to navigate the changing world of benefits.
Overall, I'm very pleased with our results this quarter. We delivered strong overall financial performance with top line growth, margin expansion and EPS growth all while continuing to make progress against strategic initiatives and our proposed combination with Aon. Now I'll turn the call over to Mike."

We have asked a lot of our teams and our colleagues continue to pull together and deliver. I'm proud of all the work they have done to continue supporting our clients, each other, and the communities in which we work and live. We're off to a solid start this year. While we continue to face some headwinds from COVID-19 pandemic, we are reassured by the improved demand for our discretionary services and solutions and by our ability to generate profitable growth.
We're pleased to see another quarter of solid revenue growth with underlying adjusted EPS growth, while free cash flow decreased and improved when normalized for certain significant litigation and compensation payments made this quarter. Now I'll turn to the overall detailed financial results.
Income from operations for the first quarter was $452 million or 17.5% of revenue, up 290 basis points from the prior year first quarter income from operations of $360 million or 14.6% of revenue. Adjusted operating income for the first quarter was $579 million or 22.4% of revenue, up 110 basis points from $525 million or 21.3% of revenue in the prior year first quarter. For the first quarters of 2021 and 2020, our diluted EPS were $5.63 and $2.34, respectively, which included the $359 million gain on disposals. 
For the first quarter of 2021, our adjusted EPS was up 9% to $3.64 per share as compared to $3.34 per share in the prior year first quarter. Foreign currency rate changes caused an increase in our consolidated revenue of $86 million or 4% of revenue for the quarter compared to the prior year first quarter with $0.12 tailwind to adjusted diluted EPS per share this quarter. 
Our U.S. GAAP tax rate for the first quarter was 11.5% versus 20% in the prior year. The current quarter tax rate was lower primarily due to the tax-exempt disposal of our Miller Business. Our adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was 20.5%, up nominally from 20.4% in the prior year.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with a strong capital and liquidity position with cash and cash equivalents of $2 billion and full capacity in our undrawn $1.25 billion revolving credit facility. We also successfully reduced our leverage profile by repaying $500 million of bonds outstanding during the quarter. Willis Towers Watson remains well positioned from a liquidity perspective. We aim to continue to maintain a strong and durable balance sheet and continue pushing forward on our cost savings and efficiency initiatives.
As the economic recovery unfolds, we will continue to monitor the ever-evolving impact of the pandemic and are prepared to take appropriate measures as needed to preserve our financial position. Free cash flow was a negative $165 million compared to negative $43 million in the prior year. The decrease in the year-over-year free cash flow was due to the net legal settlement payments of approximately $185 million in respect to the previously announced Stanford and Willis Towers Watson merger settlement and higher incentive compensation and benefit-related items of approximately $180 million. 
Absent these one-off items, free cash flow would have increased, more accurately reflecting our run rate improvements in working capital and cost containment efforts. We've made tremendous progress to improve our free cash flow in 2020, and we remain dedicated and focused on maintaining our progress in this area in 2021. In terms of capital allocation, in the first quarter of 2021, we paid approximately $92 million in dividends. We do not expect to repurchase any shares for the remainder of 2021, given certain prohibitions in the transaction agreement with Aon in connection with our pending business combination.
Pension contribution to our qualified plans totaled $86 million in the first quarter, and we are currently projecting contributions of $126 million for 2021. As a general matter, COVID-19 pandemic did not have a material or adverse impact on our overall financial results in 2020 or in the first quarter of 2021. However, the pandemic did continue to impact revenue growth, particularly in some discretionary lines, and we expect the effects of COVID-19 on general economic activity may continue to negatively impact our revenue and results for the remainder of 2021. 
The duration of the pandemic, the full magnitude of its economic impact and the subsequent speed of recovery remain unknown. In the meantime, we remain focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet, liquidity and financial flexibility. We are very pleased with these first quarter results. They are a direct reflection of our resilience and our continued focus on strategic priorities. Our first quarter results were very encouraging. We have momentum, solid financial results and a strong balance sheet and an excellent team, which gives me confidence in our ability to continue driving value for all our stakeholders. And now I'll turn the call back to John."

Let me say, first of all, I think our -- when we look at our turnover, say rolling 12 months today compared to where it was a year ago, and I look at it segment by segment, it's pretty much about the same, maybe slightly improved, in general. The 1 segment that is up is BDA. And that's just a function of some of the expansion, I think, of TRANZACT, and we have a lot of turnover, a lot of turnover there. 
But overall, our -- if I look at it segment by segment, our turnover is slightly improved. Now at the same time, every time a transaction like a big merger or acquisition gets announced, there are some people that decide they don't want to be part of the new organization. And certainly, we've seen that in some instances. But when we look at it in terms of the overall impact, it's not necessarily showing up as a big overall impact. But we can certainly point to isolated instances where that's happened. 
Those are the kind of things we've seen happen before in this business, and we think we're prepared to deal with them, but it is something we continue to look at."

Today, we'll review our results for the second quarter of 2021. Let me start by than",2399,"Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2021 earnings call. Joining me today is Mike Burwell, our Chief Financial Officer. Today, we'll review our results for the second quarter of 2021. 
Let me start by thanking our 45,000-plus colleagues for their resilience, their commitment and their focus on serving clients with excellence. At Willis Towers Watson, our colleagues have persisted through an unprecedented global pandemic while simultaneously preparing for a proposed integration and for potential divestitures. What our teams have accomplished is nothing short of extraordinary. We're now moving forward with clarity. Today, I'm going to share some observations on the termination of our proposed combination -- business combination agreement with Aon. But I really want to focus on our strong second quarter results and excellent return to shareholders. 
In Q2, our team delivered outstanding results with organic revenue increasing by 8% compared to the second quarter of 2020. All our business segments contributed meaningfully to this result. Our adjusted operating margin improved by 390 basis points. This translates into 48% adjusted EPS growth rate in Q2 and 30% free cash flow improvement when normalized for onetime items. Our 6% organic revenue growth for the first half reflects mid-single-digit or greater organic growth in 3 of our 4 segments. 
Turning now to the termination of our proposed business combination with Aon. We recently announced our mutual agreement to move forward independently. On behalf of Willis Towers Watson, I'd like to thank our counterparts at Aon for their professionalism over the past 16-plus months since we announced the transaction. I again would also like to thank our Willis Towers Watson colleagues for all of their efforts as well as our clients for their continued support throughout this process. 
The proposed combination had significant regulatory momentum. A notable exception was the United States, where the parties reached an impasse with the Department of Justice. In the end, working closely with Aon, we decided to terminate our agreement. We're confident this is the right decision for Willis Towers Watson, for our colleagues, for our clients and for all of our stakeholders, including our shareholders. Aon has already paid the $1 billion termination fee. 
We now move forward with confidence and from a position of strength. As we look to the future, we will build on our successes, which have been significant, as evidenced by our performance over the last several quarters. We will also leverage our formidable resources, including our durable client relationships, our talented colleagues and our healthy financial position. It's worth noting that our client retention rates have remained at the same level as prior years. 
Regarding colleagues, while we're disappointed that we've lost some valued colleagues in what has become a hot talent market, our top leadership ranks remain intact, and our ability to compete continues unabated. 
We were pleased to announce last week that we would be reinstating our share buyback program, which has been suspended to comply with the terms of the agreement with Aon. Our announcement noted that we would be increasing the share repurchase program by $1 billion. This will include $500 million in accelerated share repurchases and $500 million in our normal program. Subject to market conditions and other factors, we believe we should be able to execute a majority, if not all, of the repurchases by the end of 2021. 
Our Board of Directors has authorized a 13% increase in our quarterly dividend payment given our continued improvement in free cash flow. We've been paying down debt, and we expect to have retired almost $1 billion in total by the end of the year. This, together with the significant capacity we've generated, provides us with plenty of capacity to invest in both organic and inorganic growth going forward. We intend to use this capacity to make investments in our businesses so that we're well positioned to address evolving client needs. We're excited about the significant opportunities across our whole portfolio of businesses, both brokerage and consulting. 
As a result, we've asked each of our business segment leaders to look at potential areas of growth for investment. We look forward to providing you with more details about this as well as an update on the overall company at our upcoming Investor Day on September 9, 2021. 
I'd also like to announce today that we're conducting a review of strategic alternatives for Willis Re, our reinsurance operations. The Board has authorized us and our advisers to initiate such a process. While we highly value the Willis Re platform and our colleagues who contribute to its success, we believe now is an appropriate time to explore strategic alternatives for this business. There can be no assurance the strategic alternatives review process will result in a sale of Willis Re or other strategic change or outcome. 
One other question that has been raised about how we will move forward independently is what is my transition plan. As part of our ongoing planning process, the Board of Directors has been working with me on CEO succession. I still intend to retire, and I will continue to work with the Board to ensure a smooth transition of the CEO role. This will require an announcement of my replacement in an adequate time frame to ensure this is accomplished. 
Now let's move on to our second quarter results. Reported revenue for the second quarter was $2.3 billion, up 8% as compared to the prior year second quarter, up 4% on a constant currency basis and up 8% on an organic basis. In Q2, we experienced clear improvement in areas where revenue is tied to discretionary project spending as the economy continued to recover. 
Net income was $186 million. That's up 82% for the second quarter as compared to $102 million of net income in the prior year second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $557 million or 24.4% of revenue for the second quarter as compared to $441 million or 20.9% of revenue for the same period last year. That represents a 26% increase on an adjusted EBITDA dollar basis and 350 basis points of margin improvement. 
For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $1.41, an increase of 96% as compared to the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.66 in the second quarter, reflecting an increase of 48% compared to the prior year. Overall, it was a very strong quarter. We grew revenue, we enhanced margin performance and we increased earnings per share. 
So now we'll look at each of the segments in more detail. To provide clear comparability with prior periods, all commentary regarding the results of our segments will be on an organic basis, unless specifically stated otherwise. Segment margins are calculated using segment revenue and exclude unallocated corporate costs such as amortization of intangibles, certain transaction and integration expenses resulting from mergers and acquisitions, as well as other items which we consider noncore to our operating results. The segment results do include discretionary compensation. 
The Human Capital and Benefits or HCB segment revenue was up 5% on an organic basis and 4% on a constant currency basis compared to the second quarter of the prior year. This result represents a strong return to revenue growth, which was driven by increased demand for advisory services across various lines of business. 
Talent and Rewards revenue increased 22%, with a major uptick in executive compensation and reward strategy work. We anticipate continued strong demand for broad-based rewards and transaction projects in the second half of the year with demand evident across all geographies. We are also experiencing strong participation rates across various data survey products in the midst of a tight labor markets and companies looking to attract and retain talent, which should fuel growth in the second half of the year. 
Our Health and Benefits revenue increased 1% for the quarter on top of similar growth in the second quarter of 2021. We continue to grow revenue from our advisory work in North America and global benefits management and local brokerage appointments outside of North America. However, this growth was partially offset by lower commission based revenue, which was tied to prior year book sales. In this business, we anticipate a stronger second half performance driven by U.S. legislative changes alongside pent-up demand for strategic benefits reviews. 
Retirement revenue was up 3% compared to the prior year, driven primarily by funding and guaranteed minimum pension equalization or GMP work in Great Britain. We expect high demand for GMP work to continue through the remainder of 2021 and into 2022 and 2023. 
Technology and Administration Solutions revenue grew 2%, primarily due to increased project work and new business activity in Great Britain. We're optimistic about growth opportunities for this business as clients are engaging with us to deliver more high-touch solutions with higher-end service levels to support their employee base. 
HCB's operating margin increased by 210 basis points compared to the prior year second quarter as a result of continued expense reduction efforts. We're very pleased with HCB's sequential improvement and margin growth. Our long-term outlook on HCB remains positive. 
Now let's look at Corporate Risk & Broking or CRB, which had a revenue increase of 8% on an organic and constant currency basis as compared to the prior year second quarter. North America's revenue was up 13% in the second quarter, driven by gains on book of business sales alongside new business across all regions, particularly in the FINEX and marine lines. Revenue for Western Europe increased 3% due to new business and renewal expansion, particularly in Retail and FINEX. 
Great Britain and International's revenue increased 2% and 9%, respectively, for the second quarter. The revenue increases were primarily driven by new business wins across multiple lines, including FINEX, aerospace, construction, marine and retail insurance lines. 
CRB revenue was $788 million for the quarter with an operating margin of 22.9% compared to $701 million of revenue with an operating margin of 19.2% in the prior year second quarter. That's up 15% from 2019. The 370 basis point margin improvement contributes to a 2-year increase of 770 basis points and reflects the continuation of effective cost containment. 
Consistent with last quarter, CRB once again delivered strong top line growth and improved profitability. CRB's second quarter performance is encouraging as we look toward the future. As the economic outlook improves, we believe our Corporate Risk & Broking segment will see the demand for mitigating asset exposures and other insurance and risk mitigation strategies increased, set against the backdrop of a firm market. We expect to see investment in large-scale infrastructure projects, building volumes and transportation and increasing deal volume and M&A. 
Our CRB segment is focused on delivering industry and product expertise and has a mature strategy in place across all its global lines of business. We believe that the depth of our talent in these global communities, coupled with our connected broking and risk and analytics strategies continue to enable us to deliver innovative solutions to both existing and prospective clients. 
Turning to Investment, Risk and Reinsurance, or IRR. Revenue for the second quarter was $400 million, an increase of 15% on an organic basis and a decrease of 7% on a constant currency basis as compared to the prior year second quarter. This organic growth is on top of 3% revenue growth in the 2020 second quarter. The constant currency change reflects the divestitures of our wholesale subsidiary, Miller and our Max Matthiessen business. 
The Investment business with revenue growth of 44% led the segment's growth, with new business and higher fees.  Investment's growth was aided further by increased performance fees. Insurance Consulting and Technology revenue was up 13% compared to the second quarter of the prior year when revenue growth was modest. This business benefited from increased demand for advisory work. 
Reinsurance revenue grew 4% through a combination of net new business and favorable renewal factors. Revenue growth was partially offset by a decline in investment income due to lower interest rates. IRR had an operating margin of 33.3%, up 460 basis points as compared to 28.7% for the prior year second quarter. The strong margin expansion was a result of careful cost containment efforts, coupled with solid top line growth. Our investment risk and reinsurance segment is seeing strong demand from insurers for technology, advice and analytics, driving new business across our insurance consulting and technology and reinsurance businesses. We believe we're well positioned to provide leading advice and innovative solutions to our clients in the transition to a low-carbon future. 
IRR's powerful combination of advisory services, technology solutions and analytical capabilities continues to create value for companies as they reevaluate risk and reinforce resilience post pandemic. We believe this unique combination enables us to deliver industry-leading expertise and innovative solutions to help our clients navigate challenges and leverage opportunities as the socioeconomic legacy of the pandemic continues to evolve, and the world adapts to meet the increasing challenge of climate change events. 
Revenue for the Benefits Delivery & Administration, or BDA segment increased by 14% on an organic basis and 16% on a constant currency basis from the prior year second quarter. The growth in revenue was largely driven by individual marketplace, primarily by TRANZACT, which contributed $160 million to BDA's top line this quarter with its growth in Medicare Advantage products. The Benefit Outsourcing business also contributed to the increase of revenue, which was largely driven by its expanded client base. 
The BDA segment had revenue of $242 million with a negative 4.3% operating margin as compared to revenue of $209 million and a negative operating margin of 4.2% in the prior year second quarter. This nominal margin decline was largely due to our increasing sales capacity ahead of the 2022 annual enrollment period, which will usher in expansion opportunities for both our individual marketplace and our benefits outsourcing lines of business. We continue to feel positive about the momentum of our BDA segment for the remainder of 2021.  
So overall, I'm very pleased with our results this quarter. Thanks to our colleagues' outstanding efforts and our clients' commitment, we delivered strong broad-based overall financial performance across all of our business segments. We saw good top line growth, we saw meaningful margin expansion and we saw EPS growth on top of a solid second quarter in 2020. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Mike."

First, I'd like to extend my appreciation to all our colleagues. We've asked a lot of our teams and our colleagues over the past 16 months, and they have continued to deliver. They remain committed to our vision and upheld our values. They went above and beyond to support our company, our clients and one another. I'm extremely grateful for their patience, commitment and resilience. 
We delivered continued progress for both the quarter and year-to-date period, including 8% revenue growth in Q2. Through the first half of the year, we translated strong organic revenue growth into excellent operating income growth and almost doubled earnings per share, demonstrating the resilience of the Willis Towers Watson business model. We continue to expect mid-single-digit revenue growth for the full year 2021. 
I would note that our reported revenue included the favorable impact from changes in FX rates driven by a weaker U.S. dollar versus most currencies. Our strong revenue growth and ongoing operational discipline, as well as sound cost management, contributed to an adjusted operating income margin growth of 390 basis points in Q2 and 240 basis points through the first half of the year. It should be noted the growth in our margins was driven by the speed of revenue growth, which outpaced our expense growth. 
While we made investments in people, operations and technology to enable long-term growth over the first half,  we expect to increase these investments during the second half of the year. We also anticipate some resumption of T&E cost over the second half of the year as well, though we anticipate continued leverage of technology to conduct much of our business remotely, enabling us to sustain our improved efficiency and reduce carbon footprint. Looking forward, we expect to deliver margin expansion for the full year 2021 and over the long term. 
Moving back to the results for the second quarter, we've translated strong operating income into adjusted EPS growth of 48% in Q2 and 23% year-to-date. Foreign currency changes had a favorable impact to revenue of $87 million or 4% in Q2 versus the prior year and no impact to diluted earnings per share. If currency was to remain stable at today's rates, we'd expect a modest tailwind to adjusted diluted earnings per share for the full year. 
As John mentioned, Aon and WTW mutually agreed to terminate our business combination agreement and move forward independently. In accordance with the business combination agreement, Aon has paid the $1 billion termination fee. 
Free cash flow increased 30% year-to-date when adjusted for the $185 million for the previously announced Stanford and Willis Towers Watson merger settlements and higher incentive comp and benefit related items of $249 million. We expect -- or we continue to expect to drive free cash flow growth over the long term, building on our efforts over the past couple of years. We expect our CapEx expenditures to increase in the second half of the year as we invest in technology to grow our business. 
Given our outlook for long-term free cash flow growth, we see share repurchases as the highest return on capital opportunity for capital allocation. As John noted, we plan to implement an accelerated share repurchase strategy of $500 million in addition to our normal share repurchase plans. We look to execute as much as practical in fiscal year 2021, and we also raised our dividend by 13%. 
Now turning to our balance sheet and debt capacity. We had $2.2 billion of cash on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter. We plan to pay off $450 million of debt outstanding in August 2021. We have no borrowings outstanding under our $1.25 billion credit facility. We remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet and manage liquidity risk through a well-laddered debt maturity profile. And considering our June 30 balance sheet, we have plenty of additional debt capacity for discretionary use in the second half of the year. 
Over the long term, we expect to return to our past practice of growing debt as EBITDA grows. It should be noted that free cash flow generation in the second half of the year is seasonally strong, stronger than in the first half of the year and we will look to allocate cash for our best use based on return on capital. 
In summary, we ended the second quarter in a very strong position as we delivered strong top line and bottom line results. While the termination of our Aon combination -- or combination with Aon was not the outcome we originally intended, the opportunity for WTW as a stand-alone business is strong and exciting. We believe our disciplined approach to return on capital, combined with our continued improved cash flow delivery and increased debt capacity provides flexibility to improve shareholder value creation over the long term. 
It should be noted, our U.S. GAAP tax rate for the second quarter was 33.8% versus 42.2% in the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was 19.3% versus 22.2% rate in the prior year. The current year quarter effective tax rate includes a $40 million deferred tax expense related to the enacted U.K. statutory tax rate change, while the prior year effective tax rate was higher due to additional expense recognized in connection with the temporary provisions of the CARES Act. We anticipate our annual effective adjusted tax rate will be between 20% and 21% for the full year. 
We're very pleased with the second quarter results, and they are a direct reflection of our incredibly talented colleagues and unwavering commitment to client service. Our second result -- our second quarter results were very encouraging. We have momentum, we have solid financial results, a strong balance sheet and an excellent team, which gives me confidence in our ability to continue driving value for all our stakeholders. 
I'll now turn the call back to you, John."

Now we've seen our attrition go up a little bit more in the second quarter than we did before then. But that's actually something that I think has been seen by companies across the board there. 
And -- but the biggest issue we've had is not so much the attrition, although we have lost some value of colleagues, let me be clear about that. But the issue is we -- while we were in the process of the merger, it was harder to hire new people, to bring them on because of the uncertainty of exactly how they would fit into the new organization. 
And I think what we're going to be doing now is going out aggressively recruiting and looking to replace some of the talent we've lost."

So we have had a reinsurance team that's been lost, let's say, in Australia or things. But those -- we're highlighting it because it's in the window of looking at an M&A deal. But that's a normal process that has been happening and maybe slightly accelerated here recently, as John mentioned.

There are some other initiatives that we've continued to pursue even during these 16 months. For example, our leadership on climate change, which we think is important from -- just a perspective of the good work we're doing there, but also we think that will be a very nice business for us going forward."

And we think it will be something that will be, in the words, have been ready for the new CEO to execute on."

Joining me today is Mike Burwell, our Chief Financial Officer. Today, we'll review our results for the second quarter of 2021.
Let me start by thanking our 45,000-plus colleagues for their resilience, their commitment and their focus on serving clients with excellence. At Willis Towers Watson, our colleagues have persisted through an unprecedented global pandemic while simultaneously preparing for a proposed integration and for potential divestitures. What our teams have accomplished is nothing short of extraordinary. We're now moving forward with clarity. Today, I'm going to share some observations on the termination of our proposed combination -- business combination agreement with Aon. But I really want to focus on our strong second quarter results and excellent return to shareholders.
In Q2, our team delivered outstanding results, with organic revenue increasing by 8% compared to the second quarter of 2020. All our business segments contributed meaningfully to this result. Our adjusted operating margin improved by 390 basis points. This translates into 48% adjusted EPS growth rate in Q2 and 30% free cash flow improvement when normalized for onetime items. Our 6% organic revenue growth for the first half reflects mid-single-digit or greater organic growth in 3 of our 4 segments.
Turning now to the termination of our proposed business combination with Aon. We recently announced our mutual agreement to move forward independently. On behalf of Willis Towers Watson, I'd like to thank our counterparts at Aon for their professionalism over the past 16-plus months since we announced the transaction. I again would also like to thank our Willis Towers Watson colleagues for all of their efforts as well as our clients for their continued support throughout this process.
The proposed combination had significant regulatory momentum. A notable exception was the United States, where the parties reached an impasse with the Department of Justice. In the end, working closely with Aon, we decided to terminate our agreement. We're confident this is the right decision for Willis Towers Watson, for our colleagues, for our clients and for all of our stakeholders, including our shareholders. Aon has already paid the $1 billion termination fee.
We now move forward with confidence and from a position of strength. As we look to the future, we will build on our successes, which have been significant, as evidenced by our performance over the last several quarters. We will also leverage our formidable resources, including our durable client relationships, our talented colleagues and our healthy financial position. It's worth noting that our client retention rates have remained at the same level as prior years. Regarding colleagues, while we're disappointed that we've lost some valued colleagues in what has become a hot talent market, our top leadership ranks remain intact, and our ability to compete continues unabated.
We were pleased to announce last week that we would be reinstating our share buyback program, which had been suspended to comply with the terms of the agreement with Aon. Our announcement noted that we would be increasing the share repurchase program by $1 billion. This will include $500 million in accelerated share repurchases and $500 million in our normal program. Subject to market conditions and other factors, we believe we should be able to execute a majority, if not all, of the repurchases by the end of 2021.
Our Board of Directors has authorized a 13% increase in our quarterly dividend payment given our continued improvement in free cash flow. We've been paying down debt, and we expect to have retired almost $1 billion in total by the end of the year. This, together with the significant capacity we've generated, provides us with plenty of capacity to invest in both organic and inorganic growth going forward. We intend to use this capacity to make investments in our businesses so that we're well positioned to address evolving client needs. We're excited about the significant opportunities across our whole portfolio of businesses, both brokerage and consulting.
As a result, we've asked each of our business segment leaders to look at potential areas of growth for investment. We look forward to providing you with more details about this as well as an update on the overall company at our upcoming Investor Day on September 9, 2021.
I'd also like to announce today that we're conducting a review of strategic alternatives for Willis Re, our reinsurance operations. The Board has authorized us and our advisers to initiate such a process. While we highly value the Willis Re platform and our colleagues who contribute to its success, we believe now is an appropriate time to explore strategic alternatives for this business. There can be no assurance the strategic alternatives review process will result in a sale of Willis Re or other strategic change or outcome.
One other question that has been raised about how we will move forward independently is what is my transition plan. As part of our ongoing planning process, the Board of Directors has been working with me on CEO succession. I still intend to retire, and I will continue to work with the Board to ensure a smooth transition of the CEO role. This will require an announcement of my replacement in an adequate time frame to ensure this is accomplished.
Now let's move on to our second quarter results. Reported revenue for the second quarter was $2.3 billion, up 8% as compared to the prior year second quarter, up 4% on a constant currency basis and up 8% on an organic basis. In Q2, we experienced clear improvement in areas where revenue is tied to discretionary project spending as the economy continued to recover.
Net income was $186 million. That's up 82% for the second quarter as compared to $102 million of net income in the prior year second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $557 million or 24.4% of revenue for the second quarter as compared to $441 million or 20.9% of revenue for the same period last year. That represents a 26% increase on an adjusted EBITDA dollar basis and 350 basis points of margin improvement.
For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $1.41, an increase of 96% as compared to the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.66 for the second quarter, reflecting an increase of 48% compared to the prior year. Overall, it was a very strong quarter. We grew revenue, we enhanced margin performance, and we increased earnings per share.
So now we'll look at each of the segments in more detail. To provide clear comparability with prior periods, all commentary regarding the results of our segments will be on an organic basis, unless specifically stated otherwise. Segment margins are calculated using segment revenue and exclude unallocated corporate costs such as amortization of intangibles, certain transaction and integration expenses resulting from mergers and acquisitions as well as other items which we consider noncore to our operating results. The segment results do include discretionary compensation.
The Human Capital & Benefits, or HCB, segment revenue was up 5% on an organic basis and 4% on a constant currency basis compared to the second quarter of the prior year. This result represents a strong return to revenue growth, which was driven by increased demand for advisory services across various lines of business.
Talent and Rewards revenue increased 22%, with a major uptick in executive compensation and reward strategy work. We anticipate continued strong demand for broad-based rewards and transaction projects in the second half of the year, with demand evident across all geographies. We are also experiencing strong participation rates across various data survey products in the midst of the tight labor markets and companies looking to attract and retain talent, which should fuel growth in the second half of the year.
Our Health and Benefits revenue increased 1% for the quarter on top of similar growth in the second quarter of 2021. We continue to grow revenue from our advisory work in North America and global benefits management and local brokerage appointments outside of North America. However, this growth was partially offset by lower commission-based revenue, which was tied to prior year book sales. In this business, we anticipate a stronger second half performance driven by U.S. legislative changes alongside pent-up demand for strategic benefits reviews.
Retirement revenue was up 3% compared to the prior year driven primarily by funding and Guaranteed Minimum Pension equalization, or GMP, work in Great Britain. We expect high demand for GMP work to continue through the remainder of 2021 and into 2022 and 2023.
Technology and Administration Solutions revenue grew 2% primarily due to increased project work and new business activity in Great Britain. We're optimistic about growth opportunities for this business as clients are engaging with us to deliver more high-touch solutions with higher-end service levels to support their employee base.
HCB's operating margin increased by 210 basis points compared to the prior year second quarter as a result of continued expense reduction efforts. We're very pleased with HCB's sequential improvement and margin growth. Our long-term outlook on HCB remains positive.
Now let's look at Corporate Risk & Broking, or CRB, which had a revenue increase of 8% on an organic and constant currency basis as compared to the prior year second quarter. North America's revenue was up 13% in the second quarter, driven by gains on book of business sales alongside new business across all regions, particularly in the FINEX and marine lines. Revenue for Western Europe increased 3% due to new business and renewal expansion, particularly in retail and FINEX.
Great Britain and International's revenue increased 2% and 9%, respectively, for the second quarter. The revenue increases were primarily driven by new business wins across multiple lines, including FINEX, aerospace, construction, marine and retail insurance lines.
CRB revenue was $788 million for the quarter with an operating margin of 22.9% compared to $701 million of revenue with an operating margin of 19.2% in the prior year second quarter. That's up 15% from 2019. The 370 basis point margin improvement contributes to a 2-year increase of 770 basis points and reflects the continuation of effective cost containment.
Consistent with last quarter, CRB once again delivered strong top line growth and improved profitability. CRB's second quarter performance is encouraging as we look toward the future. As the economic outlook improves, we believe our Corporate Risk & Broking segment will see the demand for mitigating asset exposures and other insurance and risk mitigation strategies increase, set against the backdrop of a firm market. We expect to see investment in large-scale infrastructure projects building volumes in transportation and increasing deal volume in M&A.
Our CRB segment is focused on delivering industry and product expertise and has a mature strategy in place across all its global lines of business. We believe that the depth of our talent in these global communities, coupled with our connected broking and risk and analytics strategies, continue to enable us to deliver innovative solutions to both existing and prospective clients.
Turning to Investment, Risk & Reinsurance, or IRR. Revenue for the second quarter was $400 million, an increase of 15% on an organic basis and a decrease of 7% on a constant currency basis as compared to the prior year second quarter. This organic growth is on top of 3% revenue growth in the 2020 second quarter. The constant currency change reflects the divestitures of our wholesale subsidiary, Miller, and our Max Matthiessen business.
The Investment business, with revenue growth of 44%, led the segment's growth with new business and higher fees. Investment's growth was aided further by increased performance fees. Insurance Consulting and Technology revenue was up 13% compared to the second quarter of the prior year when revenue growth was modest. This business benefited from increased demand for advisory work.
Reinsurance revenue grew 4% through a combination of net new business and favorable renewal factors. Revenue growth was partially offset by a decline in investment income due to lower interest rates. IRR had an operating margin of 33.3%, up 460 basis points as compared to 28.7% for the prior year second quarter. The strong margin expansion was a result of careful cost containment efforts, coupled with solid top line growth. Our Investment Risk & Reinsurance segment is seeing strong demand from insurers for technology, advice and analytics, driving new business across our Insurance Consulting and Technology and Reinsurance businesses. We believe we're well positioned to provide leading advice and innovative solutions to our clients in the transition to a low-carbon future.
IRR's powerful combination of advisory services, technology solutions and analytical capabilities continues to create value for companies as they reevaluate risk and reinforce resilience post pandemic. We believe this unique combination enables us to deliver industry-leading expertise and innovative solutions to help our clients navigate challenges and leverage opportunities as the socioeconomic legacy of the pandemic continues to evolve and the world adapts to meet the increasing challenge of climate change events.
Revenue for the Benefits Delivery & Administration, or BDA, segment increased by 14% on an organic basis and 16% on a constant currency basis from the prior year second quarter. The growth in revenue was largely driven by Individual Marketplace, primarily by TRANZACT, which contributed $160 million to BDA's top line this quarter, with its growth in Medicare Advantage products. The Benefit Outsourcing business also contributed to the increase of revenue, which was largely driven by its expanded client base.
The BDA segment had revenue of $242 million with a negative 4.3% operating margin as compared to revenue of $209 million and a negative operating margin of 4.2% in the prior year second quarter. This nominal margin decline was largely due to our increasing sales capacity ahead of the 2022 annual enrollment period, which will usher in expansion opportunities for both our Individual Marketplace and our Benefits Outsourcing lines of business. We continue to feel positive about the momentum of our BDA segment for the remainder of 2021.
So overall, I'm very pleased with our results this quarter. Thanks to our colleagues' outstanding efforts and our clients' commitment, we delivered strong broad-based overall financial performance across all of our business segments. We saw good top line growth, we saw meaningful margin expansion, and we saw EPS growth on top of a solid second quarter in 2020. Now I'll turn the call over to Mike."

First, I'd like to extend my appreciation to all our colleagues. We've asked a lot of our teams and our colleagues over the past 16 months, and they have continued to deliver. They remain committed to our vision and upheld our values. They went above and beyond to support our company, our clients and one another. I'm extremely grateful for their patience, commitment and resilience.
We delivered continued progress for both the quarter and year-to-date period, including 8% revenue growth in Q2. Through the first half of the year, we translated strong organic revenue growth into excellent operating income growth and almost doubled earnings per share, demonstrating the resilience of the Willis Towers Watson business model. We continue to expect mid-single-digit revenue growth for the full year 2021.
I would note that our reported revenue included the favorable impact from changes in FX rates driven by a weaker U.S. dollar versus most currencies. Our strong revenue growth and ongoing operational discipline as well as sound cost management contributed to an adjusted operating income margin growth of 390 basis points in Q2 and 240 basis points through the first half of the year. It should be noted the growth in our margins was driven by the speed of revenue growth, which outpaced our expense growth.
While we made investments in people, operations and technology to enable long-term growth over the first half, we expect to increase these investments during the second half of the year. We also anticipate some resumption of T&E cost over the second half of the year as well, though we anticipate continued leverage of technology to conduct much of our business remotely, enabling us to sustain our improved efficiency and reduce carbon footprint. Looking forward, we expect to deliver margin expansion for the full year 2021 and over the long term.
Moving back to the results for the second quarter. We've translated strong operating income into adjusted EPS growth of 48% in Q2 and 23% year-to-date. Foreign currency changes had a favorable impact to revenue of $87 million or 4% in Q2 versus the prior year and no impact to diluted earnings per share. If currency was to remain stable at today's rates, we'd expect a modest tailwind to adjusted diluted earnings per share for the full year.
As John mentioned, Aon and WTW mutually agreed to terminate our business combination agreement and move forward independently. In accordance with the business combination agreement, Aon has paid the $1 billion termination fee.
Free cash flow increased 30% year-to-date when adjusted for the $185 million for the previously announced Stanford and Willis Towers Watson merger settlements and higher incentive comp and benefit related items of $249 million. We expect -- or we continue to expect to drive free cash flow growth over the long term, building on our efforts over the past couple of years. We expect our CapEx expenditures to increase in the second half of the year as we invest in technology to grow our business.
Given our outlook for the long-term free cash flow growth, we see share repurchases as the highest return on capital opportunity for capital allocation. As John noted, we plan to implement an accelerated share repurchase strategy of $500 million in addition to our normal share repurchase plans. We look to execute as much as practical in fiscal year 2021, and we also raised our dividend by 13%.
Now turning to our balance sheet and debt capacity. We had $2.2 billion of cash on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter. We plan to pay off $450 million of debt outstanding in August 2021. We have no borrowings outstanding under our $1.25 billion credit facility. We remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet and manage liquidity risk through a well-laddered debt maturity profile. And considering our June 30 balance sheet, we have plenty of additional debt capacity for discretionary use in the second half of the year.
Over the long term, we expect to return to our past practice of growing debt as EBITDA grows. It should be noted that free cash flow generation in the second half of the year is seasonally strong, stronger than in the first half of the year, and we will look to allocate cash for our best use based on return on capital.
In summary, we ended the second quarter in a very strong position as we delivered strong top line and bottom line results. While the termination of our Aon -- or combination with Aon was not the outcome we originally intended, the opportunity for WTW as a stand-alone business is strong and exciting. We believe our disciplined approach to return on capital, combined with our continued improved cash flow delivery and increased debt capacity, provides flexibility to improve shareholder value creation over the long term.
It should be noted, our U.S. GAAP tax rate for the second quarter was 33.8% versus 42.2% in the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was 19.3% versus 22.2% rate in the prior year. The current year quarter effective tax rate includes a $40 million deferred tax expense related to the enacted U.K. statutory tax rate change, while the prior year effective tax rate was higher due to additional expense recognized in connection with the temporary provisions of the CARES Act. We anticipate our annual effective adjusted tax rate will be between 20% and 21% for the full year.
We're very pleased with the second quarter results, and they are a direct reflection of our incredibly talented colleagues and unwavering commitment to client service. Our second quarter results were very encouraging. We have momentum, we have solid financial results, a strong balance sheet and an excellent team, which gives me confidence in our ability to continue driving value for all our stakeholders. I'll now turn the call back to you, John."

And -- but the biggest issue we've had is not so much the attrition, although we have lost some valuable colleagues, let me be clear about that. But the issue is we -- while we were in the process of the merger, it was harder to hire new people, to bring them on because of the uncertainty of exactly how they would fit into the new organization. And I think what we're going to be doing now is going out aggressively recruiting and looking to replace some of the talent we've lost."

So we have had a reinsurance team that's been lost, let's say, in Australia or things. But those -- we're highlighting it because it's in the window of looking at an M&A deal.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2021 earnings call. Joining me today are Andrew Krasner, our Chief Financial Officer; and Carl Hess, our President and our future Chief Executive Officer. 
Today's call will be my last earnings call as CEO of this great company. Willis Towers Watson looks remarkably different than it did 22 years ago when I first started as CEO of Watson Wyatt and even more so than when I started at the Wyatt Company 44 years ago. It's been an amazing journey, and it underscores the resilience of this extraordinary organization. The combination of our exceptional people and strong value has enabled this company to reinvent itself and to continually evolve. Our history has been defined by constant innovation and change. Together, we forged the legacy of quality service and solutions with strong client relationships and have built a Willis Towers Watson culture of resilience, inclusion and client focus. 
I'm proud of what we have achieved, and I feel fortunate to have had the opportunity to take the company this far with all of you. At the end of this year, I'll officially pass the baton to Carl Hess. Now is a time of reinvigoration for Willis Towers Watson. Carl is a great leader, focused on driving results and accountability by engaging colleagues. He has a wealth of knowledge and experience, and he has the skills to best lead the company during this transformative time. I have every confidence that Carl will be successfully in creating a new way forward and leading Willis Towers Watson and our top talent to an even brighter future. 
As we bring our new leadership team into place, we're also building One Willis Towers Watson. One WTW is about working across businesses, geographies and functions to achieve more and to be better. We're starting from a position of strength and recognize our potential. We're executing on our plan. We're focused on a bold new vision to be the best company in the business. We plan to drive change through new priorities to grow, simplify and transform. We'll grow by investing in talent, by capturing market share, by innovating, by expediting capabilities in evolving markets and by bringing curated solutions to clients. 
We'll simplify by delivering more efficiently through technology and through standardization. For example, we've already begun by developing a plan to streamline to 2 business segments and 3 geographies at the beginning of 2022 and appointing a new global leadership team. We'll transform colleague and client experiences by streamlining our infrastructure, by fortifying our operations and by evaluating our real estate needs. While there's no doubt work ahead of us, we have confidence in our plan, One WTW, and most importantly, in our colleagues. 
As we continue to look ahead, I'm especially excited about the industry-leading work we've done and will continue to do in addressing climate risk. We recently launched climate transition pathways, an accreditation framework that provides insurance companies and financial institutions with a consistent approach to identifying which organizations have robust transition plans, transition plans that are aligned to the Paris Agreement. And it supports the role as stewards and transition to a low-carbon economy. 
We also partnered with Contigo to launch an innovative family of climate transition indices driven by a next-generation methodology that directly quantifies the impact of the Paris-aligned climate transition on equity valuations. 
We intend to continue this momentum. Next week, we'll probably participate in the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP26. COP26 will bring together world leaders, government representatives, businesses and citizens to collaborate on how to tackle the many facets of climate change and plan for action. 
Now let's move to our third quarter results. Please note that all metrics referenced are on a continuing operations basis, except where specifically stated otherwise. Reported revenue for the third quarter was $2 billion, up 4% as compared to the prior year third quarter, up 3% on a constant currency basis and up 7% on an organic basis. 
Net income, which includes discontinued operations, was $919 million, up 672% for the third quarter as compared to $119 million of net income in the prior year third quarter. It should be noted that GAAP profitability measures include the $1 billion in proceeds received in connection with the termination of the proposed business combination with Aon. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $427 million or 21.6% of revenue for the third quarter as compared to $372 million or 19.6% of revenue for the same period last year, representing a 15% increase on an adjusted EBITDA dollar basis and 200 basis points of margin improvement. 
For the quarter, diluted earnings per share, which include discontinued operations, were $6.99, an increase of 140% as compared to the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.73 for the third quarter, reflecting an increase of 32% compared to $1.31 in the prior year. Overall, it was a strong quarter. We grew revenue, we enhanced margin and we increased earnings per share. 
Now let's look at each of the segments in some more detail. To provide clear comparability with prior periods, all commentary regarding the results of our segments will be on an organic basis, unless specifically stated otherwise. Segment margins are calculated using segment revenue and exclude unallocated corporate costs, such as amortization of intangibles, certain transaction and integration expenses resulting from mergers and acquisitions as well as other items which we consider noncore to our operating results. The segment results do include discretionary compensation. 
The Human Capital & Benefits or HCB segment revenue was up 6% on an organic basis and 5% on a constant currency basis compared to the third quarter of the prior year. This result represented sequential revenue improvement compared to our prior quarter, which was driven by continued increased demand for advisory services. 
Talent and Rewards revenue increased 22%, driven by strong market demand for broad-based rewards advisory work, coupled with talent and compensation products inclusive of compensation surveys, hiring assessments and employee listing and engagement offerings. 
Our Health and Benefits revenue increased 5% for the quarter. We continue to grow revenue from advisory work in North America, driven by U.S. legislative changes and strategic benefit reviews. Revenue also grew outside of North America as a result of global benefit management and local brokerage appointments. 
Retirement revenue was flat compared to the prior year, with funding and guaranteed minimum pension equalization work in Great Britain, offset by declines in North America as less favorable market conditions for derisking work drove lower demand for bulk lump sum work. 
Technology and Administration Solutions revenue grew 9%, primarily due to increased project work and new business activity in Great Britain. HCB's operating margin increased by 210 basis points compared to the prior year third quarter as a result of continued sustainable expense reduction efforts. We're pleased with HCB's sequential improvement and with their margin growth. Historically, HCB has had industry-leading margins, and we believe that trend will continue. HCB's talent base remains stable, and overall market tailwinds should continue to drive organic growth momentum for HCB. Both our near-term and long-term outlook on HCB remain positive. 
Now let's look at Corporate Risk & Broking, or CRB, which had a revenue increase of 6% on an organic and constant currency basis as compared to the prior year third quarter. North America's revenue was up by 12% in the third quarter, driven by new business, particularly in M&A, FINEX, construction and aerospace lines. International and Great Britain revenues increased 4% and 2%, respectively, for the third quarter. The revenue increases were primarily driven by growth in the retail and FINEX insurance lines. 
Revenue for Western Europe was up nominally due to growth in Poland and Sweden being largely offset by the departure of senior staff, which pressured business in certain geographies. CRB's revenue was $697 million for the quarter with an operating margin of 16.3% compared to $647 million of revenue with an operating margin of 12.5% in the prior year third quarter. The 380 basis point margin improvement mainly reflects the continuation of effective cost containment and, to a lesser degree, the benefit of gains from book of business sales and settlements. 
From time to time, colleagues who manage client relationships leave the company. When we lose colleagues such as those, it may result in them joining competitors. The impact of this on revenue may be delayed. This dynamic, which was most pronounced in our Corporate Risk & Broking segment in the second and third quarters of 2021, has caused CRB's organic growth to trail industry expected averages so far in 2021, and we expect the gap to narrow by the end of the first half of 2022. 
During the third quarter, we focused on stemming attrition and hiring health. On a net basis, core CRB headcount is down about 100 colleagues or just under 1% as compared to the third quarter of last year. We have executed on our incentive plans, which provide both short-term and long-term retention benefits, and we believe attrition rates have already peaked for CRB. So while we may have some transitory headwinds ahead of us, we expect that the worst of the business disruption is behind us and our longer-term outlook for CRB remains. 
Now turning to investment risk and reinsurance or IRR. Revenue for the third quarter was $172 million, an increase of 10% on an organic basis and a decrease of 24% on a constant currency basis as compared to the prior year third quarter. IRR revenue excludes the reinsurance line of business, which has been reported as discontinued operations. It also excludes revenue from Max Mathisen, which was sold in September of 2020; and Miller, IRR's wholesale broking subsidiary, which was sold in March of 2021. 
The Insurance Consulting and Technology business, with revenue growth of 18%, led the segment's growth with increased demand for advisory work alongside technology sales. The Investment business grew by 6% from performance-based new business and growth in delegated assets under management. IRR had an operating margin of 12.9%, up 360 basis points as compared to 9.3% for the prior year third quarter. The strong margin expansion was a result of careful cost containment efforts, coupled with solid top line growth. 
Revenue for the Benefits Delivery & Administration, or BDA segment, increased by 7% on an organic basis and constant currency basis from the prior year third quarter. The growth in revenue was largely driven by Individual Marketplace, primarily by TRANZACT, which contributed $111 million to BDA's top line this quarter with growth in Medicare Advantage and Life products. The Benefits Outsourcing business also contributed to the increase in revenue, which was largely driven by its expanded client base. 
The BDA segment had revenue of $242 million with a minus 7.9% operating margin as compared to revenue of $226 million and an operating margin of minus 5.3% in the prior year third quarter. The margin decline was largely due to our increase in sales capacity ahead of the 2022 annual enrollment period, which will usher in expansion opportunities for both our Individual Marketplace and Benefits Outsourcing lines of business. We continue to feel positive about the momentum of our BDA business going into the fourth quarter, which is our seasonally strongest quarter. 
So in conclusion, overall, I'm very pleased with our results this quarter. We delivered strong overall financial performance with top line growth, margin expansion and EPS growth all while undergoing a massive shift in our go-forward strategy. In closing, I'd like to express my deepest gratitude to our colleagues, our clients and our shareholders for their trust in Willis Towers Watson and for the opportunity to be CEO of this extraordinary organization. I believe the company is well positioned to meet the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead, and it's been a privilege to serve you. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Andrew."

First, I'd like to extend my appreciation to all of our colleagues. We have asked a lot of our teams, and our colleagues continue to pull together and deliver. I'm proud of all the work they have done to continue supporting our clients, each other and the communities in which we work and live. 
As John noted, we continue to make progress in the third quarter, highlighted by another quarter of strong organic revenue growth, continued operational improvement and effective capital management. We are reassured by the continued improved demand for our discretionary services and solutions and by our ability to generate profitable growth. 
Moreover, we feel we are well positioned to execute on the long-term goals we announced during the Investor Day meeting that we hosted last month. We are excited about the early progress we are making with our transformation efforts. The investments we're making to transform our operations will create better scalability, more flexibility and enhanced colleague and client experience. Through streamlining global platforms, right-shoring operations, rationalizing real estate and modernizing IT, we expect to deliver $300 million in expected cost reductions and contribute 300 basis points of margin improvement toward our fiscal year 2024 adjusted operating margin target of 24% to 25%. 
Now I'll turn to the overall detailed financial results. As a reminder, you can see the detailed quarterly continuing operations results for 2020 and 2021 year-to-date on Page 9 of the supplemental materials. 
Income from continuing operations for the third quarter, which included the $1 billion termination fee, was $1.1 billion or 57.3% of revenue, up from the prior year third quarter income from operations of $66 million or 3.5% of revenue. Adjusted operating income for the third quarter was $264 million or 13.4% of revenue, up 120 basis points from $231 million or 12.2% of revenue in the prior year third quarter. 
For the third quarters of 2021 and 2020, our diluted EPS from continuing operations were $7.8 and $0.91 respectively, and that 2021 figure includes the $1 billion termination fee. For the third quarter of 2021, our adjusted EPS was up 32% to $1.73 per share as compared to $1.31 per share in the prior year third quarter. Further, discontinued operations represented a $0.09 loss on a diluted EPS basis for the third quarter of 2021 and $0.02 of diluted EPS basis for the third quarter of 2020. Total diluted EPS, including both continued and discontinued operations, increased to $6.99 for the third quarter of 2021 compared to the prior year third quarter of $0.93. 
Foreign currency rate changes caused an increase in our consolidated revenue of $27 million or 1% of revenue for the quarter compared to the prior year third quarter, with negative $0.01 headwind to adjusted diluted earnings per share this quarter. 
Our U.S. GAAP tax rate for the third quarter was 22.5% versus 26.6% in the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 23.3%, down from 29.3% in the prior year, which was elevated due to the unfavorable impact of nonrecurring discrete items. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with a strong capital and liquidity position, with cash and cash equivalents of $2.2 billion and full capacity on our undrawn $1.5 billion revolving credit facility. We also successfully reduced our leverage profile by repaying $450 million of bonds outstanding during the quarter. Willis Towers Watson remains well positioned from a liquidity perspective. We aim to continue to maintain a strong and durable balance sheet and believe we have significant financial flexibility. 
Free cash flow, which includes discontinued operations, was $1.7 billion in the first 9 months of 2021 compared to $1 billion in the same period of the prior year. The increase in year-over-year free cash flow was due to the receipt of the termination fee, net of increased transaction and integration fees of $942 million. This was partially offset by net legal settlement payments of approximately $185 million for the previously announced Stanford and Willis Towers Watson merger settlements and higher incentive compensation of approximately $189 million. Absent these items, free cash flow would have been $1.2 billion or up 17.3% versus the prior year. 
In terms of capital allocation, we paid $275 million in dividends for the 9 months ended September 30 and repurchased 4.5 million shares for $1 billion. At our recent Investor Day, we communicated that we expect to generate $10 billion to $11 billion of cash through 2024. We remain committed to deploying net capital into share repurchases to capitalize on short-term price weakness. At current price levels, Willis Towers Watson stock continues to be our highest return opportunity, and we have significant resources to capitalize upon that. 
As part of our Investor Day discussion, we communicated approximately $4 billion of near-term share repurchase activity. With the first $1 billion completed, we will commence repurchases with the remaining component of that in 2021 and expect to conclude that during 2022. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter and full year, we recognize that the company's recent strategic shifts, alongside unique macroeconomic factors, have created complexity in setting expectations for our performance for the year. This year, our core performance metrics have been clouded by discontinued operations reporting a onetime $1 billion termination fee, divestitures and a still evolving economic recovery. So we would like to clarify and say that for the full year 2021, we expect to produce around 6% organic revenue growth and an adjusted operating margin of 19.5%, 20% on a continuing operations basis. We expect this to be the new baseline to begin the path to our fiscal year-end 2024 goal of 24% to 25% adjusted operating margin. 
Please note that the 2021 margin guide includes the negative impact of stranded costs from the sale of Willis Re, which we intend to rightsize during the period in which we received cost relief under a transition services agreement. Going forward, we prefer to keep the focus on long-term value drivers of the business and will not continue providing quarterly or annual guidance. 
We are very pleased with these third quarter results, and they are a direct reflection of our resilience and our focus on strategic priorities. We have strong momentum, solid financial results, a robust balance sheet and an excellent team, which gives me confidence in our ability to continue driving value for all our stakeholders. As I think about our future, I'm excited to continue to work with Carl and the rest of the leadership team to drive the company forward and explore the opportunities ahead. I have confidence in our leadership team, Willis Towers Watson's talented colleagues and in our strong culture. 
And now I'll turn the call back to John."

With respect to sort of the outlook for CRB on the revenue side, we have seen a mitigation of the departures we talked about at Analyst Day, and we're getting back on the front foot with respect to hiring. There have been some encouraging trends in the business as we look toward new hires, less terminations where we've actually in Q3 now seen higher exceeding terminations for the organization. As we know that hiring proceeds revenue when it comes to people, but that will help us going into '22 and forward. 
We look -- new business results for CRB have remained strong and are up on last year, thanks to a strong client and sales management discipline and I think a validation of our global light of business model. While we have seen some revenue gains that are through book sales that have impacted the business, those are a continuation of last year. It's on a new phenomenon. And in general, it leads us to thinking that our CRB is going to continue to grow, but probably be at the lower end of the industry averages through the first half of 2022."

As you pointed out, it is a bit of a stand-alone that's got a different buyer hub than most of the rest of the company. We talked earlier about sort of cost pressures, right? One of the major -- in fact, the major cost in our reinsurance business is the people. And this is an area where compensation costs have been increasing much faster than the rest of the industry. It's very possible to look to a future where those margins are significantly eroded due to higher compensation costs, and that's a problem that will no longer be ours. 
In addition, at this point in time, right, $1 of every $6 or $7 in the reinsurance market is provided by the capital markets, not traditional reinsurance. Our margins and everybody else's margins for providing services through the capital markets are much lower than they are through traditional reinsurance brokerage.

We, to a certain extent, can control our destiny in terms of how big we want this to be. And as Gene Wick said during Analyst Day, it is about making sure that we sort of make sure what the picture we have for growth makes financial sense for the enterprise. And we work with Gene to make sure that we maximize the potential of that."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2021 earnings call.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2021 earnings call. Joining me today are Andrew Krasner, our Chief Financial Officer; and Carl Hess, our President and our future Chief Executive Officer.  
Today's call will be my last earnings call as CEO of this great company. Willis Towers Watson looks remarkably different than it did 22 years ago when I first started as CEO of Watson Wyatt and even more so than when I started at the Wyatt Company 44 years ago. It's been an amazing journey, and it underscores the resilience of this extraordinary organization. The combination of our exceptional people and strong value has enabled this company to reinvent itself and to continually evolve. Our history has been defined by constant innovation and change. Together, we forged the legacy of quality service and solutions with strong client relationships and have built a Willis Towers Watson culture of resilience, inclusion and client focus.  
I'm proud of what we have achieved, and I feel fortunate to have had the opportunity to take the company this far with all of you. At the end of this year, I'll officially pass the baton to Carl Hess. Now is a time of reinvigoration for Willis Towers Watson. Carl is a great leader, focused on driving results and accountability by engaging colleagues. He has a wealth of knowledge and experience, and he has the skills to best lead the company during this transformative time. I have every confidence that Carl will be successfully creating a new way forward and leading Willis Towers Watson and our top talent to an even brighter future.  
As we bring our new leadership team into place, we're also building One Willis Towers Watson. One WTW is about working across businesses, geographies and functions to achieve more and to be better. We're starting from a position of strength and recognize our potential. We're executing on our plan. We're focused on a bold new vision to be the best company in the business. We plan to drive change through new priorities to grow, simplify and transform. We'll grow by investing in talent, by capturing market share, by innovating, by expediting capabilities in evolving markets and by bringing curated solutions to clients.  
We'll simplify by delivering more efficiently through technology and through standardization. For example, we've already begun by developing a plan to streamline to 2 business segments and 3 geographies at the beginning of 2022 and appointing a new global leadership team. We'll transform colleague and client experiences by streamlining our infrastructure, by fortifying our operations and by evaluating our real estate needs. While there's no doubt work ahead of us, we have confidence in our plan, One WTW, and most importantly, in our colleagues.  
As we continue to look ahead, I'm especially excited about the industry-leading work we've done and will continue to do in addressing climate risk. We recently launched climate transition pathways, an accreditation framework that provides insurance companies and financial institutions with a consistent approach to identifying which organizations have robust transition plans, transition plans that are aligned to the Paris Agreement. And it supports the role as stewards and transition to a low-carbon economy.  
We also partnered with Contigo to launch an innovative family of climate transition indices, driven by a next-generation methodology that directly quantifies the impact of the Paris-aligned climate transition on equity valuations.  
We intend to continue this momentum. Next week, we'll probably participate in the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP26. COP26 will bring together world leaders, government representatives, businesses and citizens to collaborate on how to tackle the many facets of climate change and plan for action.  
Now let's move to our third quarter results. Please note that all metrics referenced are on a continuing operations basis, except where specifically stated otherwise. Reported revenue for the third quarter was $2 billion, up 4% as compared to the prior year third quarter, up 3% on a constant currency basis and up 7% on an organic basis.  
Net income, which includes discontinued operations, was $919 million, up 672% for the third quarter as compared to $119 million of net income in the prior year third quarter. It should be noted that GAAP profitability measures include the $1 billion in proceeds received in connection with the termination of the proposed business combination with Aon.  
Adjusted EBITDA was $427 million or 21.6% of revenue for the third quarter as compared to $372 million or 19.6% of revenue for the same period last year, representing a 15% increase on an adjusted EBITDA dollar basis and 200 basis points of margin improvement.  
For the quarter, diluted earnings per share, which include discontinued operations, were $6.99, an increase of 140% as compared to the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.73 for the third quarter, reflecting an increase of 32% compared to $1.31 in the prior year. Overall, it was a strong quarter. We grew revenue. We enhanced margin, and we increased earnings per share.  
Now let's look at each of the segments in some more detail. To provide clear comparability with prior periods, all commentary regarding results of our segments will be on an organic basis, unless specifically stated otherwise. Segment margins are calculated using segment revenue and exclude unallocated corporate costs, such as amortization of intangibles, certain transaction and integration expenses resulting from mergers and acquisitions as well as other items, which we consider noncore to our operating results. The segment results do include discretionary compensation.  
The Human Capital & Benefits or HCB segment revenue was up 6% on an organic basis and 5% on a constant currency basis compared to the third quarter of the prior year. This result represented sequential revenue improvement compared to our prior quarter, which was driven by continued increased demand for advisory services.  
Talent and Rewards revenue increased 22%, driven by strong market demand for broad-based rewards advisory work, coupled with talent and compensation products inclusive of compensation surveys, hiring assessments and employee listing and engagement offerings.  
Our Health and Benefits revenue increased 5% for the quarter. We continue to grow revenue from advisory work in North America, driven by U.S. legislative changes and strategic benefit reviews. Revenue also grew outside of North America as a result of global benefit management and local brokerage appointments.  
Retirement revenue was flat compared to the prior year, with funding and guaranteed minimum pension equalization work in Great Britain, offset by declines in North America as less favorable market conditions for derisking work drove lower demand for bulk lump sum work.  
Technology and Administration Solutions revenue grew 9%, primarily due to increased project work and new business activity in Great Britain. 
HCB's operating margin increased by 210 basis points compared to the prior year third quarter as a result of continued sustainable expense reduction efforts. We're pleased with HCB's sequential improvement and with their margin growth. Historically, HCB has had industry-leading margins, and we believe that trend will continue. HCB's talent base remains stable, and overall market tailwinds should continue to drive organic growth momentum for HCB. Both our near-term and long-term outlook on HCB remain positive.  
Now let's look at Corporate Risk & Broking, or CRB, which had a revenue increase of 6% on an organic and constant currency basis as compared to the prior year third quarter. North America's revenue was up by 12% in the third quarter, driven by new business, particularly in M&A, FINEX, Construction and Aerospace lines. International and Great Britain's revenues increased 4% and 2%, respectively, for the third quarter. The revenue increases were primarily driven by growth in the retail and FINEX insurance lines.  
Revenue for Western Europe was up nominally due to growth in Poland and Sweden being largely offset by the departure of senior staff, which pressured business in certain geographies. CRB's revenue was $697 million for the quarter, with an operating margin of 16.3% compared to $647 million of revenue with an operating margin of 12.5% in the prior year third quarter. The 380 basis point margin improvement mainly reflects the continuation of effective cost containment and, to a lesser degree, the benefit of gains from book of business sales and settlements.  
From time to time, colleagues who manage client relationships leave the company. When we lose colleagues such as those, it may result in them joining competitors. The impact of this on revenue may be delayed. This dynamic, which was most pronounced in our Corporate Risk & Broking segment in the second and third quarters of 2021, has caused CRB's organic growth to trail industry expected averages so far in 2021, and we expect the gap to narrow by the end of the first half of 2022.  
During the third quarter, we focused on stemming attrition and hiring health. On a net basis, core CRB headcount is down about 100 colleagues or just under 1% as compared to the third quarter of last year. We have executed on our incentive plans, which provide both short-term and long-term retention benefits, and we believe attrition rates have already peaked for CRB. So while we may have some transitory headwinds ahead of us, we expect that the worst of the business disruption is behind us, and our longer-term outlook for CRB remains positive.
Now turning to Investment, Risk & Reinsurance, or IRR. Revenue for the third quarter was $172 million, an increase of 10% on an organic basis and a decrease of 24% on a constant currency basis as compared to the prior year third quarter. IRR revenue excludes the reinsurance line of business, which has been reported as discontinued operations. It also excludes revenue from Max Matthiessen, which was sold in September of 2020; and Miller, IRR's wholesale broking subsidiary, which was sold in March of 2021.  
The Insurance Consulting and Technology business, with revenue growth of 18%, led the segment's growth, with increased demand for advisory work alongside technology sales. The Investment business grew by 6% from performance-based new business and growth in delegated assets under management. IRR had an operating margin of 12.9%, up 360 basis points as compared to 9.3% for the prior year third quarter. The strong margin expansion was a result of careful cost containment efforts, coupled with solid top line growth.  
Revenue for the Benefits Delivery & Administration, or BDA, segment, increased by 7% on an organic basis and constant currency basis from the prior year third quarter. The growth in revenue was largely driven by Individual Marketplace, primarily by TRANZACT, which contributed $111 million to BDA's top line this quarter, with growth in Medicare Advantage and Life products.  
The Benefits Outsourcing business also contributed to the increase in revenue, which was largely driven by its expanded client base.  
The BDA segment had revenue of $242 million, with a minus 7.9% operating margin as compared to revenue of $226 million and an operating margin of minus 5.3% in the prior year third quarter. The margin decline was largely due to our increase in sales capacity ahead of the 2022 annual enrollment period, which will usher in expansion opportunities for both our Individual Marketplace and Benefits Outsourcing lines of business. We continue to feel positive about the momentum of our BDA business going into the fourth quarter, which is our seasonally strongest quarter.  
So in conclusion, overall, I'm very pleased with our results this quarter. We delivered strong overall financial performance with top line growth, margin expansion and EPS growth, all while undergoing a massive shift in our go-forward strategy. In closing, I'd like to express my deepest gratitude to our colleagues, our clients and our shareholders for their trust in Willis Towers Watson and for the opportunity to be CEO of this extraordinary organization. I believe the company is well positioned to meet the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead, and it's been a privilege to serve you.  
Now I'll turn the call over to Andrew."

First, I'd like to extend my appreciation to all of our colleagues. We have asked a lot of our teams, and our colleagues continue to pull together and deliver. I'm proud of all the work they have done to continue supporting our clients, each other and the communities in which we work and live.  
As John noted, we continue to make progress in the third quarter, highlighted by another quarter of strong organic revenue growth, continued operational improvement and effective capital management. We are reassured by the continued improved demand for our discretionary services and solutions and by our ability to generate profitable growth.  
Moreover, we feel we are well positioned to execute on the long-term goals we announced during the Investor Day meeting that we hosted last month. We are excited about the early progress we are making with our transformation efforts. The investments we're making to transform our operations will create better scalability, more flexibility and enhanced colleague and client experience. Through streamlining global platforms, right-shoring operations, rationalizing real estate and modernizing IT, we expect to deliver $300 million in expected cost reductions and contribute 300 basis points of margin improvement toward our fiscal year 2024 adjusted operating margin target of 24% to 25%.  
Now I'll turn to the overall detailed financial results. As a reminder, you can see the detailed quarterly continuing operations results for 2020 and 2021 year-to-date on Page 9 of the supplemental materials.  
Income from continuing operations for the third quarter, which included the $1 billion termination fee, was $1.1 billion or 57.3% of revenue, up from the prior year third quarter income from operations of $66 million or 3.5% of revenue. Adjusted operating income for the third quarter was $264 million or 13.4% of revenue, up 120 basis points from $231 million or 12.2% of revenue in the prior year third quarter.  
For the third quarters of 2021 and 2020, our diluted EPS from continuing operations were $7.8 and $0.91 respectively, and that 2021 figure includes the $1 billion termination fee. 
For the third quarter of 2021, our adjusted EPS was up 32% to $1.73 per share as compared to $1.31 per share in the prior year third quarter. Further, discontinued operations represented a $0.09 loss on a diluted EPS basis for the third quarter of 2021 and $0.02 of diluted EPS basis for the third quarter of 2020. Total diluted EPS, including both continued and discontinued operations, increased to $6.99 for the third quarter of 2021 compared to the prior year third quarter of $0.93.  
Foreign currency rate changes caused an increase in our consolidated revenue of $27 million or 1% of revenue for the quarter compared to the prior year third quarter, with negative $0.01 headwind to adjusted diluted earnings per share this quarter.  
Our U.S. GAAP tax rate for the third quarter was 22.5% versus 26.6% in the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 23.3%, down from 29.3% in the prior year, which was elevated due to the unfavorable impact of nonrecurring discrete items.  
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with a strong capital and liquidity position, with cash and cash equivalents of $2.2 billion and full capacity on our undrawn $1.5 billion revolving credit facility. We also successfully reduced our leverage profile by repaying $450 million of bonds outstanding during the quarter.  
Willis Towers Watson remains well positioned from a liquidity perspective. We aim to continue to maintain a strong and durable balance sheet and believe we have significant financial flexibility. 
Free cash flow, which includes discontinued operations, was $1.7 billion in the first 9 months of 2021 compared to $1 billion in the same period of the prior year. The increase in year-over-year free cash flow was due to the receipt of the termination fee, net of increased transaction and integration fees of $942 million. This was partially offset by net legal settlement payments of approximately $185 million for the previously announced Stanford and Willis Towers Watson merger settlements and higher incentive compensation of approximately $189 million. Absent these items, free cash flow would have been $1.2 billion or up 17.3% versus the prior year. 
In terms of capital allocation, we paid $275 million in dividends for the 9 months ended September 30 and repurchased 4.5 million shares for $1 billion. At our recent Investor Day, we communicated that we expect to generate $10 billion to $11 billion of cash through 2024. We remain committed to deploying net capital into share repurchases to capitalize on short-term price weakness. At current price levels, Willis Towers Watson stock continues to be our highest return opportunity, and we have significant resources to capitalize upon that. 
As part of our Investor Day discussion, we communicated approximately $4 billion of near-term share repurchase activity. With the first $1 billion completed, we will commence repurchases with the remaining component of that in 2021 and expect to conclude that during 2022. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter and full year, we recognize that the company's recent strategic shifts, alongside unique macroeconomic factors, have created complexity in setting expectations for our performance for the year. This year, our core performance metrics have been clouded by discontinued operations reporting a onetime $1 billion termination fee, divestitures and a still evolving economic recovery. So we would like to clarify and say that for the full year 2021, we expect to produce around 6% organic revenue growth and an adjusted operating margin of 19.5%, 20% on a continuing operations basis. We expect this to be the new baseline to begin the path to our fiscal year-end 2024 goal of 24% to 25% adjusted operating margin. 
Please note that the 2021 margin guide includes the negative impact of stranded costs from the sale of Willis Re, which we intend to rightsize during the period in which we received cost relief under a transition services agreement. Going forward, we prefer to keep the focus on long-term value drivers of the business and will not continue providing quarterly or annual guidance. 
We are very pleased with these third quarter results, and they are a direct reflection of our resilience and our focus on strategic priorities. We have strong momentum, solid financial results, a robust balance sheet and an excellent team, which gives me confidence in our ability to continue driving value for all our stakeholders. As I think about our future, I'm excited to continue to work with Carl and the rest of the leadership team to drive the company forward and explore the opportunities ahead. I have confidence in our leadership team, Willis Towers Watson's talented colleagues and in our strong culture. 
And now I'll turn the call back to John."

With respect to sort of the outlook for CRB on the revenue side, we have seen a mitigation of the departures we talked about at Analyst Day, and we're getting back on the front foot with respect to hiring. There have been some encouraging trends in the business as we look toward new hires, less terminations where we've actually in Q3 now seen hiring exceeding terminations for the organization. As we know that hiring precedes revenue when it comes to people, but that will help us going into '22 and forward. 
We look -- new business results for CRB have remained strong and are up on last year, thanks to a strong client and sales management discipline and I think a validation of our global light of business model. While we have seen some revenue gains that are through book sales that have impacted the business, those are a continuation of last year. It's on a new phenomenon. And in general, it leads us to thinking that our CRB is going to continue to grow, but probably be at the lower end of the industry averages through the first half of 2022."

In addition, at this point in time, right, $1 of every $6 or $7 in the reinsurance market is provided by the capital markets, not traditional reinsurance.

One is we have begun staffing a bit earlier this year in our TRANZACT business to make sure we're fully staffed for the ramp-up for the '22 annual enrollment period to capitalize on market demand. We also acquired Omni Direct, which is a full-service direct response media agency focusing on the Hispanic market in July of last year, and that's driven higher growth revenue -- revenue growth opportunities in TRANZACT, although it's somewhat lower margin. 
Q4 is the seasonally highest quarter for our revenue there, right? Revenue is close to 50% for the year. And our revenue growth is tied to the lead acquisition cost, so that operating income dollars will grow commensurate to the revenue dollars growth. But overall, operating margin should remain about constant. 
If you sort of look back, right, our year-to-date growth has -- was materially impacted by our strong Medicare Advantage open enrollment period in the first quarter. That was highly correlated to the 2021 a year ago, right, fourth quarter '20 annual enrollment period. We had significantly higher Medicare Advantage revenue growth in the annual enrollment period last year, plus 57%, and that led to strong revenue growth in the open enrollment period in the fourth quarter, plus 65%. We anticipate continued strong double-digit growth in Q4, but note that we have a strong comparable from last year with a higher base of revenues we're building off. And the annual enrollment period in Q4 this year is not correlated to the first quarter open enrollment period."
