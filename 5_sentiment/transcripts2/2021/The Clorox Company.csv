We hope you and your families are continuing to stay safe and well. On the call with me today are Linda Rendle, our CEO; and Kevin Jacobsen, our CFO. Now a few reminders before we go into the results. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet, and a replay of the call will be available for 7 days at our website, thecloroxcompany.com. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including statements related to the expected or potential impact of COVID-19. These statements are based on management's current expectations but may differ from actual results or outcomes. In addition, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the forward-looking statements section, which identifies various factors that could affect such forward-looking statements and the non-GAAP financial information section, including the tables that reconcile non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, both of which are located at the end of today's earnings release, which has also been posted on our website and filed with the SEC. 
I'll start by covering our top line commentary with highlights from each of our segments. Kevin will then address our total company results as well as our FY '21 outlook. Finally, Linda will offer her perspective, and we'll close with Q&A. 
For the total company, Q2 sales increased 27%, with growth in every reportable segment. It reflects about 1 point of net benefit from the July acquisition that gives us a majority share in our Saudi Arabia joint venture and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. On an organic basis, Q2 sales grew 26%. I will now go through our results by segment. In our health and wellness segment, Q2 sales were up 42%, reflecting double-digit increases in 2 of 3 businesses. Our cleaning business had double-digit sales growth behind strong ongoing demand across our portfolio. Consumption remains high, and importantly, we're continuing to see increases in household penetration and repeat rates among existing and new users, driven by new routines developed from the prolonged pandemic as well as strategic brand investments. While we expect tough comparisons as we lap these very high-growth rates, we'll continue to work to retain the larger base of loyal consumers we've built for our cleaning and disinfecting products even after a critical mass of the population has been vaccinated. 
We're continuing to make progress on our supply expansion, including a new line of wipes plant coming online this quarter. We're also continuing to identify new sources of supply for other products experiencing constraints, including our disinfecting spray products. As we're able to better meet consumer demand for our base products, we're looking forward to bringing back our Clorox compostable wipes, along with a stream of exciting innovation in the coming months. Our professional products business had another quarter of double-digit sales growth behind continued high demand for our cleaning and disinfecting products. It's worth noting, though, that while demand from businesses such as health care facilities has remained high, we've seen softer demand from businesses negatively impacted by ongoing mobility restrictions like commercial cleaning and foodservice institutions. That's why we're leaning into other out-of-home spaces through strategic alliances, and are encouraged by our progress. 
While not yet a meaningful contributor in Q2, our out-of-home partnerships are expanding. We're excited to announce a new multiyear deal with the NBA, an existing partner. Lastly, within this segment, our sales in vitamins, minerals and supplements business decreased in Q2. This is a business where results have not been consistent, and we clearly have more work to do. As you remember, we relaunched Renew Life last fall. While we've seen improvements in all outlet consumption, it is not yet delivering the consistent results we want. With more than half American consumers saying they intend to continue taking vitamins and supplements, we continue to believe in the attractiveness of this category. 
Now turning to Household segment. Quarterly sales were up 20%, with growth in all 3 businesses for a third consecutive quarter. Grilling sales were up double digits, driven by continued strong consumption, which reflects the dramatic rise in home meal occasion as people continue to spend more time at home. Behind our strategic collaboration with retailers, we've been able to grow household penetration for a third consecutive quarter, including among millennials and low-income consumers. As we begin planning for the next growing season, we're building on our innovation through expanded distribution of our new Kingsford pellets and bringing new flavors to our Kingsford product lineup. With consumer spending more on their backyard and growth, we feel optimistic about the future of this business. Cat litter sales were up by double digits in Q2, supported by innovation and continued strong performance online. Our fresh step with gain original scented litter with the paws for Breeze as well as our fresh step clean pause litter continued to perform very well, and we're supporting them through a new advertising campaign. A record number of people have become pet parents since the onset of the pandemic in 2020, making this yet another example of how our diverse portfolio is particularly suited to the times. 
Glad sales increased in Q2 behind strong demand across our portfolio of trash bags, wraps and food bags as people continue to spend more time at home. Our latest innovation, Glad ForceFlex with Clorox trash bags, launched in September and is building distribution quickly, earning positive reviews. In our Lifestyle segment, Q2 sales were up 9%, with double-digit growth in 2 of 3 businesses. Brita sales were up by double digits for a fourth consecutive quarter behind continued strong shipments of pitchers as well as filters. Just as with wipes and sprays, we're continuing to work through supply chain constraints in our Brita business, which has been impacting our shares. We feel good about the long-term prospects of this business, especially since once people buy Brita Pitcher, they tend to stay in our franchise with continued purchases of filters. Importantly, as household penetration for Brita keeps growing, we're building brand loyalty among these consumers. 
The food business had double-digit sales increase for a third straight quarter behind ongoing strong consumption of our Hidden Valley Ranch products, particularly dry seasoning and bottle dressings. With more and more people eating at home during the pandemic, household penetration has grown to an all-time high, including above-average growth among millennials. We're building on this momentum with a stream of innovation, including Hidden Valley secret sauces, and most recently, Hidden Valley plant-based ranch dressing, which is being supported by strong advertising investments. Burt's Bees sales decreased by double digits as the business continued to be impacted by mobility restrictions as well as changes to consumer shopping and usage habits as a result of the pandemic. This quarter, unseasonably warm weather also impacted lip balm sales. Despite these challenges, we're making progress in the fast-growing online channel, where the brand had double-digit growth in Q2, and we remain confident in the long-term trajectory of this business. 
Lastly, in international. Q2 sales grew 23%, driven by double-digit shipment growth in all major regions. The growth reflects about 9 points of benefit from the Saudi acquisition and about 4 points of unfavorable foreign currency headwinds. Organic sales grew 18%. The recent investment we made to create a dedicated international supply chain for Clorox Disinfecting Wipes is starting to pay off, giving us the ability to not only meet ongoing elevated demand in existing markets, but also to expand to new countries. This is a strategic growth platform for the company, and we're supporting it through additional advertising investments. 
Now I'll turn it over to Kevin, who will discuss Q2 results as well as updated outlook for FY '21."
89450,700178901,2192204,"The Clorox Company, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2021",2021-02-04,"Earnings Calls","The Clorox Company","Executives","Thank you, Lisa, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today.

We hope you and your families are well. Our sales growth for the second quarter was broad-based, resulting in double-digit growth in each reporting segment for the first half of our fiscal year. Additionally, this led to profitable growth for the first half, which enables us to capitalize on momentum and continue investing behind our global portfolio to strengthen our competitive advantage. As you saw in our press release, we've raised our fiscal year '21 outlook, given the strength of our first half results, and our expectation for continued strong demand across our global portfolio over the balance of the year. 
Turning to our second quarter results. Second quarter sales were up 27%, driven by 23 points of organic volume growth, 3 points of favorable price/mix and 1 point of net benefit from acquiring majority control of our Saudi joint venture, partially offset by FX headwinds. On an organic basis, sales grew 26%. Gross margin for the quarter increased 130 basis points to 45.4% compared to 44.1% in the year ago quarter. Second quarter gross margin included the benefit of strong volume growth as well as 160 basis points of cost savings and 140 basis points of favorable price/mix. These factors were partially offset by 420 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs, which similar to last quarter, included temporary COVID-19 spending. Second quarter gross margin results also reflect about 50 basis points of negative impact from higher commodity costs, primarily from resin. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales came in at 14.6% and compared to 14.5% in the year ago quarter. Advertising and sales promotion investment levels as a percentage of sales came in at about 10%. We're spending for our U.S. retail business coming in at about 11% of sales. This reflects higher investments across our portfolio, strengthening our value proposition to support higher levels of household penetration and lasting brand loyalty among new and existing consumers. Our second quarter effective tax rate was 21%, which was equal to the year ago quarter. 
Net of these factors, we delivered diluted net earnings per share of $2.03 versus $1.46 in the year ago quarter, an increase of 39%. As you also saw in our press release, year-to-date net cash provided by operations was $629 million versus $498 million in the year ago period, an increase of 26%. 
Turning to our updated fiscal year outlook. We now anticipate fiscal year sales to grow between 10% to 13%, reflecting the strength of our first half results and higher expectations for the back half. With our overall demand for our products remaining quite strong, we now expect back half sales to be about flat on top of 19% growth in the year ago period. We also anticipate about 1 point of contribution from our Saudi joint venture, offset by 1 point of foreign exchange headwinds. 
On an organic sales basis, our outlook assumes 10% to 13% growth. We now expect fiscal year gross margin to be down slightly, reflecting higher commodity and manufacturing and logistics costs as well as temporary costs related to COVID-19. These factors are expected to be partially offset by higher sales. As a reminder, we expect gross margin contraction over the balance of the fiscal year, primarily from 2 factors: first, we are lapping very strong operating leverage from robust shipment growth during the initial phase of the pandemic. And second, we're facing commodity headwinds this year versus last year's commodity tailwinds. As a reminder, our gross margin expanded 250 basis points in the back half of fiscal year '20. We continue to expect fiscal year selling and administrative expenses to be about 14% of sales. Reflecting ongoing aggressive investments and long-term profitable growth initiatives and incentive compensation costs, consistent with our pay-for-performance philosophy. Additionally, we continue to anticipate fiscal year advertising spending to be about 11% of sales. We spent about 10% in the front half of the year and continue to anticipate about 12% in the back half in support of our robust innovation program. We continue to expect our fiscal year tax rate to be between 21% to 22%. Net of these factors, we now expect fiscal year '21 diluted EPS to increase between $8.05 and $8.25 or 9% to 12% growth, reflecting strong top line performance, partially offset by a rising cost environment. We now anticipate fiscal year diluted EPS outlook to include a contribution of $0.45 to $0.50 from our increased stake in our Saudi Arabia joint venture, primarily driven by a onetime noncash gain. 
I'm pleased we've raised our fiscal year '21 outlook. Of course, it's important to note, we continue to operate in a highly dynamic environment and are monitoring headwinds that could result in impacts moving forward. In closing, I'm also pleased with our broad-based strong results in the first half, which enables us to continue investing in our brands, capabilities and new growth opportunities, all in support of our ambition to accelerate long-term profitable growth for our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn it over to Linda."
89450,700178901,2192204,"The Clorox Company, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2021",2021-02-04,"Earnings Calls","The Clorox Company","Executives","Thanks, Kevin.

My messages this quarter largely reinforced what we d",1099,"Thanks, Kevin. Hello, everyone, and thank you for being with us today. I hope you and your families are well. It's great to be here today showing Clorox's results for the first half of our fiscal year. My messages this quarter largely reinforced what we discussed in Q1, with the most important point being that our global portfolio of leading brands continues to play a critical role in people's everyday lives. My first message is that our first half results are rooted in purpose-driven growth. Our purpose as a company is to champion people to be well and thrive every single day. And our portfolio of leading brands is the bedrock of our ability to deliver on that promise. Our first half results reinforce the important role our brands play in addressing people's everyday needs. We continue to see broad-based strength in our portfolio. With double-digit sales growth for most of our businesses. Clorox disinfecting products continue to be in high demand among consumers, businesses and health care settings. And as people spend more time at home, we're continuing to see strong performance in other parts of our portfolio. Kingsford is a great example. 
As Lisa mentioned, our grilling business delivered double-digit sales growth in the quarter. And with a recharge strategy emphasizing innovation, I'm optimistic about the long-term prospects of this business. Before I move on to my second message, I want to thank the Clorox team around the world who shows up every day to live our purpose. They understand that more than ever, people and communities need us. I'm so grateful for their passion and commitment. 
My second message is that Clorox will stay in the driver seat, continuing our posture of 100% offense to make the most of the opportunities in front of us while navigating an ongoing dynamic environment. There's no question, Clorox has built significant momentum over the last year, and we have every intention of extending that longer term. Our brand portfolio is especially relevant for this environment and for the consumer trends I mentioned last quarter, which we expect to persist beyond the pandemic, prioritizing hygiene and health and wellness, caring for pets and accelerating digital behaviors related to practically every aspect of their lives. 
More than ever, as home is where the heart is, it's also where consumers are directing their investments with spending across many categories to support quality of in-home experiences. This certainly bodes well for our portfolio. We continue to see strong levels of household penetration. Importantly, what we mentioned last quarter about repeat rates across our portfolio is playing out. We're accelerating purchase frequency. And repeat users are the source of most of our sales growth across our portfolio. In addition, our strategic investments are creating a virtuous cycle around engaging and retaining new and existing users, resulting in a consumer retention rate of nearly 90%. As I mentioned, 100% offense will help us extend this momentum, which, as a reminder, includes investing more across our portfolio to retain the millions of people buying our brands. Expanding our public health support to more out-of-home spaces, increasing capital spending for immediate and future production capacity, including wipes expansion in international and partnering with our retailers to grow our categories. 
Given the dynamic environment we continue to face, 100% offense also means actively planning for challenges and disruptions in the near and long term, including an inflationary cost environment, elevated competition in light of category tailwinds. And  accelerating advancements in digital technology that we expect to impact all areas of our business. What's important is we'll continue to make strategic choices that position us to achieve our ambition to accelerate long-term profitable growth. And finally, my third message is this. As we continue to address immediate priorities related to unprecedented demand, we're also accelerating our progress against our strategy to deliver long-term shareholder value. Our Ignite strategy continues to put people at the center of everything we do and helps us make the most of our strategic advantage in the near and long term. Addressing unprecedented consumer demand for much of our portfolio continues to be an immediate priority. We continue to make progress on a number of businesses. We're bringing in more third-party supply sources and launching our new white line in our Atlanta facility in the third quarter. 
Importantly, simplification is our mantra, and we're seeing the benefit of focusing on fewer SKUs, which we expect to continue beyond the pandemic. As I mentioned earlier, we're growing Clorox Disinfecting Wipes international, supported by a dedicated supply chain. Our expansion plans are going very well, and we expect to double the number of countries where Clorox Wipes are sold. Another immediate priority is to continue supporting people's safety when they're outside their homes through strategic alliances to support public health. We're expanding our programs with Uber Technologies and Enterprise Holdings. We recently established a multiyear deal with the NBA and look forward to pursuing similar opportunities with other organizations. 
And as the pandemic continues to take a toll in the economy, we know that far too many people feel financial pressure from unemployment and less discretionary spending. We're mindful of the role we can play to support those who are particularly value-sensitive, and we'll continue to deliver superior value through meaningful innovation. Importantly, we're also making progress in laying the foundation for long-term growth. We will continue to invest strongly in our global portfolio of leading brands, particularly behind robust innovation that differentiates our products and deliver superior value. 
We will continue to reimagine how we work to ensure a strong culture with a highly engaged team that works simpler and faster on strategic priorities. I'm proud of how we've been operating during the pandemic, including accelerating our speed to market. And finally, as we've said before, we view ESG as a contributor to competitive advantage, which is why it's embedded in our business. 
Achievements this quarter include being included in the 2021 Bloomberg Gender Equality index; achieving 100% renewable electricity in the U.S. and Canada 4 years early; signing on to the energy buyer, Federal clean energy policy statement, which calls for a 100% clean energy power sector. And donating $1 million to Cleveland clinic to establish the Clorox Public health research grant in support of science-based public health research. We are grateful to play a role in supporting people and communities as we continue to navigate the global pandemic. It only strengthens our resolve in pursuing purpose-driven growth, ensuring a strategic link between our impact on the world and long-term value creation for our shareholders."

I remember, Linda, you mentioned that in the last call. And asking in a different way, how much more capacity, including third-parties you mentioned in the call, have you added in the second half against the second half of the last fiscal? So it seems around 25% by my math in the U.S., which implies that you could still grow volumes in the low single digits in this upcoming second half of fiscal, if demand remains strong. I understand that obviously, you're giving us a flat top line for the second half because you're embedding some deceleration. So how we should be thinking of that? And conversely, if you're regaining share because you lost some share, given the stock outs, how we should be thinking of your capacity? and fulfillment into the second half?"

Maybe I'll start with the question on retail inventory levels. And I might broaden it to talk about both inventory levels in the extended supply chain, both in our warehouse as well as retailers. What I'd tell you is, we think we've made pretty good progress over the first half of this fiscal year. And I'd say, by and large, we feel pretty good about retail inventory levels with some notable exceptions. There are still portions of our home care portfolio, particularly our disinfecting wipes and portions of our a disinfecting spray trigger products that were still not at a point where we can fully meet demand. And then the other area, we still have work to do to catch-up is in Brita. That business continues to perform quite well. We've had 4 straight quarters of double-digit growth. And so we're still not in a position where we can fully support demand on that product. But with the exception of those businesses, I'd say, generally feel pretty good about retail inventory levels and additionally, feel pretty good about the inventory levels in our facilities. I would say on Brita, I think we've got a couple more quarters before we think we can catch up. I think by the end of this fiscal year, we'll be in a better position in terms of meeting retail demand. And then I think, particularly on our wipes business, it's going to take a while likely the end of this calendar year, we will be in a position to fully service demand. And then on capacity, you had a question on capacity, Andrea, as Linda said in her prepared remarks, we are starting up our second line at our Georgia wipes facility, and that's happening this quarter, and you'll see that start to ramp up over the next several quarters. Our expectation is by the end of this fiscal year, we'll have more than doubled our wipes capacity from where we were before the pandemic started. And that's a combination of bringing on our facility that's happening now as well as we continue to bring on additional contract manufacturers. And in Q2, we added more contract manufacturers as well. So we're working both with self-manufacturing as well as third-party manufacturing that work will continue well past this fiscal year."

You started to see our share improvement in quarter 2. So we're up as a total company, 0.8 points. That's up from 52-week share being up 0.5 points. But what's really encouraging to us is if we dive deeper into the businesses that we have gotten back to an in-stock position on so starting outside of cleaning, if you look at our Hidden Valley Ranch business, cat litter and Kingsford, all of them growing share as we've gotten supply back up to a place where we can meet demand. And then really encouragingly, if you look at our cleaning business, although we have a ways to go until we can fully meet demand in places where we've been able to improve, we're seeing significant share gains so our Clorox cleanup business, which is a spray is up 8 share points in the spray business in Q2. Clorox manual toilet bowl cleaner, up 4 points. Our Pinesol business up 2.5 points. And that corresponds with strong plans we have in place, but also our ability to supply."

They're really in 2 buckets. We continue to expedite transportation, and that comes at a higher cost as we're trying to fulfill retail orders as quickly as we can in our supply-challenged environment. So there's some increased cost there as well as the increased spending we're doing with our production team to make sure we're keeping folks safe with increased hygiene activity as well as enhanced benefits. I think over time, as we get through the pandemic, and that may push into fiscal year '22 for us. But as we move through the pandemic, we'll be able to step out of a good portion of those charges going forward."

I'll just start with, and you said it, our results have been inconsistent, and I'm not satisfied with that, and that is full stop. But if you look at the thesis, and you started to talk about this, we really do see these categories being a long-term growth runway for us. And that's why we got into these businesses to start because we see a nice fit in our overall journey to help people be well and thrive. What we've learned over the last few years as we've operated these is we made the choice to buy some small brands in a very large $12 billion space. And it's certainly been a hotbed for competition. And the lesson we've learned is the ramp-up for the brands is just longer than we thought it was going to be. We see pockets of encouraging results in our Renew Life relaunch, for example, in our magnesium supplement business. But there are other places where we're not as satisfied. 
So if I take a long-term view to this, we still think these categories are attractive. We still see our ability to innovate, brand build really meaningful in a slew of a lot of things that are going on there, good claims, good science. But I think the perspective is VMS still only represents about 4% of our business, and it's going to take a while before it's a meaningful contributor, and we're going to be patient. But I still feel conviction that these are attractive categories to compete in."

If you could just kind of give us the state of the union in terms of what's going on in terms of shelf space, and I understand there's been some pricing taken in the category. And when the last quarter, you indicated you were hesitant to take pricing during a pandemic, but just wanted to get a sense of how you're thinking about it now given you're starting to see inflation happen at a much more meaningful rate. Nit, thanks for the question. So Q2 was another strong quarter for Glad. It grew nicely behind continued strong demand from consumers. We're seeing really good signs of brand health. So our household penetration, up almost 1.5 points increased bio retention rate, we're growing repeat rates on the Glad business. So the fundamentals of that business continue to be very strong. You're seeing price gaps where we want them to be. And I think what continues to be the differentiator for Glad is innovation. It's working really well in the market for us, whether that be our experiential trash bag, or if that is our new SKU glad with Clorox, are all doing really well. And so as we've said, this is a business where you have to innovate or you have to bring new benefits to the category, and that continues to work well for us. I think if you take a step back, and maybe this is a comment agnostic of glad, if you just take your pricing comment in total, you're right, we had said we would not take pricing in the height of a pandemic, and I still believe that was the right call as we got through the height of it. 
But as we look forward and as we see the pressure from the cost environment and we see pressure on gross margin, we're going to look to the broad tool packs that we have against our long-term goal of growing EBIT margin. And that toolbox includes things like on the revenue side, managing promotion. I'm ensuring that we can add value through innovation and premiumization. But we will also consider pricing as part of that. And as we look forward, we will see what the right mix is by brands. And we feel given the fact that our portfolio has very high consumer value, the highest we have on record, that we're in a good position if we need to take pricing to do just that."

So right, like you've lost about 1,200 basis points of market share there since over the past year. And all that has effectively come from Lysol and other manufacturers who have seen big increases in market share. And I guess the question is, you've obviously been underperforming a category that has delivered really significant growth. And  shelf is now occupied by a litany of other brands. And so how sticky do you think that shelf space is in wipes from those new entrants? Maybe said another way, do you think you can get back this share that you've lost in the business? Because if so, if you have the manufacturing capacity coming online, that would imply that you might, but maybe these shelf gains from other competitors are going to last indefinitely. So I wonder if you could just comment on that."

I think maybe it would be good to take a broader view of wipes because we're looking at a narrow universe of tracked channels. But if you look more broadly, the share loss that you're seeing in tracked channels is not reflective of the fact that we've prioritized our health care business to ensure that we have the right supply there. And that our professional business has always had a strong wipes business as well as untracked channels that are very strong. So the broader perspective, to be clear, we don't like to move share anywhere, and our goal is to always be growing it over the long term. But the broader perspective was there watch business is in better shape than you might see in track data. But then even if you look at track data, the only people growing share right now are nonbranded or new entrant competitors that are very small. There is no major manufacturers as we all try to ramp up the support. And I think what's going to happen is we're already seeing retailers think about simplification as we move forward. And there's going to be no desire on their part to add 10, 12, whatever a brand sit on the shelf right now that are filling the need. They're going to want to make sure that they're with leading brands who are innovating, and we know that will be with Clorox. We feel great about the innovation pipeline we have on the business. Feel great about the fact that our supply is ramping up, and we're getting a place where we'll have double the supply by the end of the year. So I think you're going to start to see as we bring supply back on, share will go in the other direction. Similar to how I highlighted in other businesses, Clorox cleanup up 8 share points once we brought that back on from a supply perspective, time sell up 2.5 share points. So this is very much correlated to supply. We think the long-term trends are behind us. And I think the most important part is we have not let up on the innovation and investments so that as we bring that supply up, we'll be in a terrific place to get back to growing share."

It would imply that you're going to start lapping that in the June quarter of this year. But obviously, we've seen manufacturing and logistics inflation accelerate in recent months. So do you expect that to remain as significant an impact as we get through the entire year? Or is there any phasing that we should be keeping in mind there? Yes, Chris. As it relates to phasing, as we update our expectations for gross margin, as you heard, we now think we're going to be down slightly. One of the biggest changes we're seeing is our expectations for commodities, and we've talked about it. We're clearly in an inflationary cycle. If you go back to November, we had anticipated about 100 basis points of cost headwinds throughout the back half of this fiscal year. We've updated that expectation now we going to be closer to 150 basis points hit, primarily driven by increasing cost of resin. And I expect that to be pretty consistent through the back half of the year."

So can you just talk about how your perspective on that part of the question because the white form is something that others can do under different brand names in international markets.

In the case of International, we were pleased to see the strong volume-driven organic sales growth, which was really broad-based across the portfolio, including cleaning and disinfecting: Glad, Brita, litter. And what was encouraging is the early contribution from our wipes expansion. It was about 20% of the growth we experienced in the quarter. So good early signals that it's working. If we think about the countries, we compete in over 100 countries around the world today broadly with our portfolio. And the very first priority we have is to expand our presence in our cleaning and disinfecting portfolio in more of those countries. So to your good point, not having to introduce them to the brand in a brand-new fashion, but actually just expanding the portfolio we have with those consumers to offer them the benefit that a white brings them. And we've seen that successful so far, and early consumption looks good in those markets. And then as we think about more broadly, the avenues that we have to introduce our brands to consumers have expanded. E-com is now a way that you can enter into a market, learn more about the consumer in a low cost way. That allows us to get early insights and decide if we want to build more of an infrastructure behind an international business to expand. So I think what, Lauren, you're going to see from us is a very disciplined approach in this. We want to be fast, which is why we stood up that dedicated supply chain. But we want to continue to be disciplined, and we want to see a strong return on the markets that we enter. And the very first proof points are the fact that we're entering markets we are already in with an expanded portfolio."

And Steve, you'll recall, back in November, our expectation was in the back half, we'd see our sales decline mid-single digits. With our update outlook today, it implies our expectation that the back half will be flattish. And if I think about our portfolio in 3 buckets, I can kind of talk about how we see this playing out. If you think about our U.S. cleaning business, which includes both our retail and our B2B business. We now think that business is going to continue to grow in the back half of this fiscal year, low single digits. Back in November, our expectation was it would be about flat. And keep in mind, we're lapping about 40% growth in the back half of last year, so a really strong prior period, and we think that business will continue to grow for all the reasons we've been talking about today. On our international business, back in November, we thought that business would grow low single digits. We're now taking that expectation up. We now think we'll grow high single digits in the back half of the year. Where we're seeing really good results for some of the work we're doing on extending our life business, and that will continue to add value over the back half of the year. And then what we call our Home Essentials business, which is a little less than 50% of our total sales. We've updated our assumption there as well. Originally, we thought that business would decline high single digits. We now think it will grow -- or excuse me, will decline mid-single digits. And in all cases, those 3 segments all grew double digits in the prior period. And so if you do that math, that gets us to about flat year-over-year in the back half. I'd say importantly, though, if you take a longer-term perspective and you look at our performance, say, versus FY '19, a pre pandemic environment, that would suggest we'll grow somewhere in the 15% to 20% range in the back half of this year. And so I think the takeaway, Steve, I just -- I'd offer is, this is not just about increasing strength within our disinfecting portfolio. We're seeing performance broadly across our portfolio. We saw that in Q1 and Q2, and it's our expectation going forward, we'll continue to see broad strength across the portfolio."

We don't want to take pricing over short-term inflationary, and we use trade funds, and we have for Glad, in particular, over a number of years to manage through those short-term impacts. But as we see a progressing cost environment coming up here, pricing is something we absolutely will consider across our portfolio where it makes sense. And I think it's safe to say pricing isn't something that is an easy thing to go execute. It takes a lot to do with excellence. And it comes with ensuring that we partner with retailers to have plans that grow their categories. And I feel like we are better positioned than we have been in a very long time on that. We have a terrific slate of innovation across our portfolio and particularly for Glad. We are spending against our brands, which retailers appreciate in an incredible way right now because we're bringing people to the physical or digital shelf. And our portfolio is at the best place it's ever been from a consumer value measure perspective. So more people deem our portfolio or percentage of our portfolio is superior than ever before. So I think with all of that, we're well positioned to do it. And what I wouldn't say is I don't have a perfect crystal ball, pricing is always something that we have to go out and we're dedicated to executing with excellence but we would expect there are little bumps here and there, but we'll manage through them. And over the long term, we know that it's a good thing for us to do, and it's right for the category. So again, no plans at this point on any of our brands, but we'll look at it as we head into the remainder of the year and next year as an option for us to expand margins."

I do expect the industry will move back to a more normalized level of promotional spending as everyone gets more back in supply. I think that's to be expected. And then it's the same issue for us. Our promotional spending is down specifically to Clorox, not necessarily the industry because many products we just can't promote right now because of the limited supply capacity we have. So I expect to see increased promotional spending for Clorox when we get back to promoting some of these products that we just haven't been able to promote for the last 6 months."

We're not ready to talk about plants beyond FY '21. We're in the process of developing those plans right now. But maybe just big picture, what I'd leave you what to think about is our intent is to accelerate the profitable growth rate of this company. As a result of the pandemic, we've talked -- we have millions of new consumers coming to our franchise, using our products. We're investing behind that. We have a number of new growth runways we talked about, both in out-of-home as well as international expansion. And so we see these as long-term opportunities for the company that we're clearly investing in this year that we think generate long-term value. So again, we won't talk about our specific growth rates going forward, but we believe that sets us up nicely to be able to accelerate the long-term growth rate of the company. But in the near term, there's going to be a lot of noise as you compare quarters pre or post dynamic. There's going to be a lot of noise for a number of quarters. I think when you get past all that, there's a long-term opportunity for the company, and we're investing behind that."

The first one is going to be for Linda on pricing. I wanted to revisit that. Second oen for Kevin on capital deployment and share buybacks. 
So first one, Linda, just given the importance of pricing here, not just for Clorox, but of course, more broadly for consumer staples with commodity inflation. So the willingness to take pricing, I think, is going to be well received and welcome, given past commentary that the company was not going to do that during a pandemic. So I think folks would generally agree that that's certainly a good thing. But a couple of questions here. A, can you give us a sense of retailers' receptivity to price increases at this point based on current commodity environment and state of consumer? I mean from a Clorox perspective, one could take the view that some of your categories have arguably never been more important to them than they are right now? And then secondarily, you touched on this, but I want to see if we can get a little bit more specific, how quickly can you put through the price increases? Is -- I guess, what would be the hesitancy, excuse me, to doing that? Are you looking for more permanence in commodity cost inflation? Is it just to an earlier question, maybe a little bit of uncertainty in terms of what the competition is going to do. I guess what would be the hesitancy now based on what you're staring down, which is pretty significant commodity cost inflation to taking pricing? And then I have a follow-up for Kevin on buybacks."

Again, let's maybe step back and talk about pricing as a strategic lever and really what we're trying to do overall. And as you know, we're trying to expand our EBIT margins 25 to 50 basis points over the long run. And what we always look at is the broad set of tools that we have in our toolbox to manage cost wherever they may be. And one critical element of how we've done that over the short-term is cost savings, for example. And we had another robust savings this quarter, and we expect to continue that. And I think you know, as part of our Ignite strategy, we put additional levers in place, thinking about the role of technology and the role sustainability could play in helping us do that over the long term. So we're very much focused on managing as many of the short-term cost inflation, increases that we see through those types of levers. What we're looking at right now is over the mid to long term, based off of the outlook, what role could pricing play? And that has to play a broader role in the category plans that we have. It's not something in isolation. So what we're focused on right now is strong innovation, strong brand investment, ensuring that we have the right assortment on shelves with retailers to match the fact that consumers' behaviors and needs have changed. And that is really the single highest priority we've had in addition to supply over the last many months and continues to be over the next few months. So that would be why I would answer -- we're not ready to announce any type of pricing action at this moment because what we're focused on is serving consumers, what we're focused on is growing our categories, getting back to supply. And we're focused on a terrific innovation agenda we have for the back half. And if we can do that with excellence, we will get to a place where, as Kevin said, it's a very nice back half as you look back and take a broader view compared to FY '19. What gives us conviction, though, in the strategic -- our strategic ability to take pricing again is the health of our brands and the fact that we have been investing, the fact that we do have an innovation portfolio that's strong. The fact that we have been partnering openly and transparently with retailers on how we get through the last 9 to 10 months together. So as we make those decisions, we feel confident in that overall suite of activity that we have that can help the categories. We'll continue to evaluate when the right time might be to do that. But for now, we are really focused on investing in those brands, getting capacity back to 100% in innovation."

For us as it relates to our capital deployment priorities, as you know, Kevin, no change in the priorities we've talked about for quite a while. Now we'll continue to prioritize investing in our base business, and you folks see us doing this year. Kevin, as you mentioned, we're increasing capital spending to increase our production capacity. We're also increasing investments in our brands in terms of advertising, R&D and technology. So that will continue to be job one. We'll also continue to pursue strategic M&A. We want to expand our portfolio, particularly in the health and wellness space. We have a number of areas we're interested in. So we'll continue to evaluate those and look for opportunities to do that. And as you mentioned, we have a very strong balance sheet right now. We're carrying a little under $800 million in the balance sheet that is elevated. And so as we've said, if we don't have a need for that cash, we will look for ways to get back to our shareholders. If you think about this year, I expect over the balance of the year, we're going to return about $1 billion to our shareholders, about half of that through our dividend, the other half through share repurchases. That's up pretty significantly. We were somewhere around $780 million or so of return last year. So we've stepped it up this year. 
And then as we develop our plans for fiscal year '22 and beyond, we'll continue to evaluate the best opportunity to invest that cash. And as I said, again, if we don't have a good use for it, we're not going to keep it on the balance sheet, and we'll look for ways to get that back to focus."

You're hitting on exactly what we're talking to retailers about right now, and we're partnering with them on is what is the long-term for these categories as we get through what's been an incredibly unprecedented. I think we can never underestimate or overuse that word, unprecedented, and we're really turning to what does the future look like? What will the habits and behaviors that have started today that we believe will be very sticky in the future mean for the assortment that's needed for the type of promotion that's needed, for the shelf space. And what I would say is that varies depending on the category. And our categories have always been different at shelf. What's required from an assortment perspective, how much is merchandise, et cetera. So we are working with them on those individual plans we're bringing them consumer insights and what we're seeing in the changing behaviors. So for example, the fact that people are cleaning and disinfecting more, and we expect that to continue. They're cleaning different surfaces. They're thinking about the fact that when they leave their house, they're thinking about those surfaces around them in a different way, and we're helping them to plan for that. 
And then I think really importantly, what we've talked to them about is the innovation needed in order to address those needs and how we ensure we introduce that innovation in a quick manner. That we get it on the physical or digital shelf and that we get the right trial behind that. And retailers are really receptive to hearing that right now. And in fact, are loving the fact that we're coming with so much innovation despite all of the craziness over the last 9 months. So without getting into specific category details, that's exactly what we're doing. And retailers will begin to make those first moves as supply gets to the place where we're able to fully meet it, and you'll start to see what it looks like online. I think a couple of themes. The first is simplification. We've taken the opportunity to simplify our portfolio to help us run faster in many of our businesses, and that's panned out really well for us. Actually, really well for retailers. And so they're going to continue to drive simplification. We win in that environment being a #1 and #2 share brand. And then the second thing is omni-channel, making sure that a consumer has access to the right products depending on where they are and where they're shopping. And we're focused on that with retailers and ensuring that they have all of those right levers in place depending on where consumers are entering into their store."

Now a few reminders before we go into the results. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet, and a replay of the call will be available for 7 days at our website, thecloroxcompany.com. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including statements related to the expected or potential impact of COVID-19. These statements are based on management's current expectations, but may differ from actual results or outcomes. 
In addition, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the forward-looking statements section, which identifies various factors that could affect such forward-looking statements, and the non-GAAP financial information section, including the tables that reconcile non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, both of which are located at the end of today's earnings release, which has also been posted on our website and filed with the SEC. 
I'll start by covering our top line commentary, with highlights from each of our segments. Kevin will then address our total company results as well as our FY '21 outlook. Finally, Linda will offer her perspective, and we'll close with Q&A. 
For the total company, Q2 sales increased 27%, with growth in every reportable segment. It reflects about 1 point of net benefit from the July acquisition that gives us a majority share in our Saudi Arabia joint venture and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. On an organic basis, Q2 sales grew 26%. 
I will now go through our results by segment. In our Health and Wellness segment, Q2 sales were up 42%, reflecting double digits increases in 2 of 3 businesses. Our Cleaning business had double-digit sales growth behind strong ongoing demand across our portfolio. 
Consumption remains high and, importantly, we're continuing to see increases in household penetration and repeat rates among existing and new users, driven by new routines developed from the prolonged pandemic as well as strategic brand investments. While we expect tough comparisons as we lap these very high growth rates, we'll continue to work to retain the larger base of loyal consumers we've built for our cleaning and disinfecting products even after a critical mass of the population has been vaccinated. 
We're continuing to make progress on our supply expansion, including a new line of wipes plant coming online this quarter. We're also continuing to identify new sources of supply for other products experiencing constraints, including our disinfecting spray products. As we're able to better meet consumer demand for our base products, we're looking forward to bringing back our Clorox compostable wipes, along with a stream of exciting innovation in the coming months. 
Our Professional Products business had another quarter of double-digit sales growth behind continued high demand for our cleaning and disinfecting products. It's worth noting, though, that while demand from businesses such as health care facilities has remained high, we've seen softer demand from businesses negatively impacted by ongoing mobility restrictions, like commercial cleaning and foodservice institutions. That's why we're leaning into other out-of-home spaces through strategic alliances, and are encouraged by our progress. 
While not yet a meaningful contributor in Q2, our out-of-home partnerships are expanding. We're excited to announce a new multi-year deal with the NBA, an existing partner. Lastly, within this segment, our sales in Vitamins, Minerals and Supplements business decreased in Q2. This is a business where results have not been consistent, and we clearly have more work to do. 
As you remember, we relaunched RenewLife last fall. While we've seen improvements in all outlet consumption, it is not yet delivering the consistent results we want. With more than half American consumers saying they intend to continue taking vitamins and supplements, we continue to believe in the attractiveness of this category. 
Now turning to Household segment. Quarterly sales were up 20%, with growth in all 3 businesses for a third consecutive quarter. Grilling sales were up double digits, driven by continued strong consumption, which reflects the dramatic rise in in-home meal occasion as people continue to spend more time at home. Behind our strategic collaboration with retailers, we've been able to grow household penetration for a third consecutive quarter, including among millennials and low-income consumers. 
As we begin planning for the next growing season, we're building on our innovation through expanded distribution of our new Kingsford pellets and bringing new flavors to our Kingsford product lineup. With consumer spending more on their backyard and growth, we feel optimistic about the future of this business. 
Cat Litter sales were up by double digits in Q2, supported by innovation and continued strong performance online. Our Fresh Step with Gain Original Scented Litter with the power of Febreze as well as our Fresh Step Clean Paws litter continued to perform very well, and we're supporting them through a new advertising campaign. A record number of people have become pet parents since the onset of the pandemic in 2020, making this yet another example of how our diverse portfolio is particularly suited to the times. 
Glad sales increased in Q2 behind strong demands across our portfolio of trash bags, wraps and food bags as people continue to spend more time at home. Our latest innovation, Glad ForceFlex with Clorox trash bags, launched in September and is building distribution quickly, earning positive reviews. 
In our Lifestyle segment, Q2 sales were up 9%, with double-digit growth in 2 of 3 businesses. Brita sales were up by double digits for a fourth consecutive quarter behind continued strong shipments of pitchers as well as filters. Just as with wipes and sprays, we're continuing to work through supply chain constraints in our Brita business, which has been impacting our shares. 
We feel good about the long-term prospects of this business, especially since once people buy a Brita pitcher, they tend to stay in our franchise with continued purchases of filters. Importantly, as household penetration for Brita keeps growing, we're building brand loyalty among these consumers. 
The Food business had double-digit sales increase for a third straight quarter behind ongoing strong consumption of our Hidden Valley Ranch products, particularly dry seasonings and bottled dressings. With more and more people eating at home during the pandemic, household penetration has grown to an all-time high, including above-average growth among millennials. We're building on this momentum with a stream of innovation, including Hidden Valley Secret Sauces and, most recently, Hidden Valley plant-based ranch dressing, which is being supported by strong advertising investments. 
Burt's Bees sales decreased by double digits as the business continued to be impacted by mobility restrictions as well as changes to consumer shopping and usage habits as a result of the pandemic. This quarter, unseasonably warm weather also impacted lip balm sales. Despite these challenges, we're making progress in the fast-growing online channel, where the brand had double-digit growth in Q2, and we remain confident in the long-term trajectory of this business. 
Lastly, in International. Q2 sales grew 23%, driven by double-digit shipment growth in all major regions. The growth reflects about 9 points of benefit from the Saudi acquisition and about 4 points of unfavorable foreign currency headwinds. Organic sales grew 18%. 
The recent investment we made to create a dedicated international supply chain for Clorox disinfecting wipes is starting to pay off, giving us the ability to not only meet ongoing elevated demand in existing markets, but also to expand to new countries. This is a strategic growth platform for the company, and we're supporting it through additional advertising investments. 
Now I'll turn it over to Kevin, who will discuss Q2 results as well as updated outlook for FY '21."

We hope you and your families are well. 
Our sales growth for the second quarter was broad-based, resulting in double-digit growth in each reporting segment for the first half of our fiscal year. Additionally, this led to profitable growth for the first half, which enables us to capitalize on our momentum and continue investing behind our global portfolio to strengthen our competitive advantage. As you saw in our press release, we've raised our fiscal year '21 outlook, given the strength of our first half results and our expectation for continued strong demand across our global portfolio over the balance of the year. 
Turning to our second quarter results. Second quarter sales were up 27%, driven by 23 points of organic volume growth, 3 points of favorable price/mix and 1 point of net benefit from acquiring majority control of our Saudi joint venture, partially offset by FX headwinds. On an organic basis, sales grew 26%. 
Gross margin for the quarter increased 130 basis points to 45.4% compared to 44.1% in the year ago quarter. Second quarter gross margin included the benefit of strong volume growth as well as 160 basis points of cost savings and 140 basis points of favorable price/mix. These factors were partially offset by 420 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs, which, similar to last quarter, included temporary COVID-19 spending. Second quarter gross margin results also reflect about 50 basis points of negative impact from higher commodity costs, primarily from resin. 
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales came in at 14.6% compared to 14.5% in the year ago quarter. Advertising and sales promotion investment levels as a percentage of sales came in at about 10%, where spending for our U.S. retail business coming in at about 11% of sales. This reflects higher investments across our portfolio, strengthening our value proposition to support higher levels of household penetration and lasting brand loyalty among new and existing consumers. 
Our second quarter effective tax rate was 21%, which was equal to the year ago quarter. Net of these factors, we delivered diluted net earnings per share of $2.03 versus $1.46 in the year ago quarter, an increase of 39%. As you also saw in our press release, year-to-date net cash provided by operations was $629 million versus $498 million in the year ago period, an increase of 26%. 
Turning to our updated fiscal year outlook. We now anticipate fiscal year sales to grow between 10% to 13%, reflecting the strength of our first half results and higher expectations for the back half. With our overall demand for our products remaining quite strong, we now expect back half sales to be about flat, on top of 19% growth in the year ago period. We also anticipate about 1 point of contribution from our Saudi joint venture, offset by 1 point of foreign exchange headwinds. 
On an organic sales basis, our outlook assumes 10% to 13% growth. We now expect fiscal year gross margin to be down slightly, reflecting higher commodity and manufacturing and logistics costs as well as temporary costs related to COVID-19. These factors are expected to be partially offset by higher sales. 
As a reminder, we expect gross margin contraction over the balance of the fiscal year, primarily from 2 factors: first, we are lapping very strong operating leverage from robust shipment growth during the initial phase of the pandemic; and second, we're facing commodity headwinds this year versus last year's commodity tailwinds. As a reminder, our gross margin expanded 250 basis points in the back half of fiscal year '20. 
We continue to expect fiscal year selling and administrative expenses to be about 14% of sales, reflecting ongoing aggressive investments and long-term profitable growth initiatives and incentive compensation costs, consistent with our pay-for-performance philosophy. Additionally, we continue to anticipate fiscal year advertising spending to be about 11% of sales. We spent about 10% in the front half of the year and continue to anticipate about 12% in the back half in support of our robust innovation program. 
We continue to expect our fiscal year tax rate to be between 21% to 22%. Net of these factors, we now expect fiscal year '21 diluted EPS to increase between $8.05 and $8.25 or 9% to 12% growth, reflecting strong top line performance, partially offset by a rising cost environment. We now anticipate fiscal year diluted EPS outlook to include a contribution of $0.45 to $0.50 from our increased stake in our Saudi Arabia joint venture, primarily driven by a onetime noncash gain. 
I'm pleased we've raised our fiscal year '21 outlook. Of course, it's important to note, we continue to operate in a highly dynamic environment and are monitoring headwinds that could result in impacts moving forward. In closing, I'm also pleased with our broad-based strong results in the first half, which enables us to continue investing in our brands, capabilities and new growth opportunities, all in support of our ambition to accelerate long-term profitable growth for our shareholders. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Linda."

Hello, everyone, and thank you for being with us today. I hope you and your families are well. It's great to be here today showing Clorox's results for the first half of our fiscal year. My messages this quarter largely reinforce what we",1107,"Thanks, Kevin. Hello, everyone, and thank you for being with us today. I hope you and your families are well. 
It's great to be here today showing Clorox's results for the first half of our fiscal year. My messages this quarter largely reinforce what we discussed in Q1, with the most important point being that our global portfolio of leading brands continues to play a critical role in people's everyday lives. 
My first message is that our first half results are rooted in purpose-driven growth. Our purpose as a company is to champion people to be well and thrive every single day. And our portfolio of leading brands is the bedrock of our ability to deliver on that promise. 
Our first half results reinforce the important role our brands play in addressing people's everyday needs. We continue to see broad-based strength in our portfolio, with double-digit sales growth for most of our businesses. Clorox disinfecting products continue to be in high demand among consumers, businesses and health care settings. And as people spend more time at home, we're continuing to see strong performance in other parts of our portfolio. Kingsford is a great example. 
As Lisah mentioned, our Grilling business delivered double-digit sales growth in the quarter. And with a recharge strategy emphasizing innovation, I'm optimistic about the long-term prospects of this business. 
Before I move on to my second message, I want to thank the Clorox team around the world who shows up every day to live our purpose. They understand that, more than ever, people and communities need us. I'm so grateful for their passion and commitment. 
My second message is that Clorox will stay in the driver seat, continuing our posture of 100% offense to make the most of the opportunities in front of us while navigating an ongoing dynamic environment. There's no question, Clorox has built significant momentum over the last year, and we have every intention of extending that longer term. 
Our brand portfolio is especially relevant for this environment and for the consumer trends I mentioned last quarter, which we expect to persist beyond the pandemic, prioritizing hygiene and health and wellness, caring for pets and accelerating digital behaviors related to practically every aspect of their lives. More than ever, as home is where the heart is, it's also where consumers are directing their investments with spending across many categories to support quality of in-home experiences. This certainly bodes well for our portfolio. 
We continue to see strong levels of household penetration. Importantly, what we mentioned last quarter about repeat rates across our portfolio is playing out. We're accelerating purchase frequency. And repeat users are the source of most of our sales growth across our portfolio. 
In addition, our strategic investments are creating a virtuous cycle around engaging and retaining new and existing users, resulting in a consumer retention rate of nearly 90%. As I mentioned, 100% offense will help us extend this momentum, which, as a reminder, includes: investing more across our portfolio to retain the millions of people buying our brands; expanding our public health support to more out-of-home spaces; increasing capital spending for immediate and future production capacity, including wipes expansion in international; and partnering with our retailers to grow our categories. 
Given the dynamic environment we continue to face, 100% offense also means actively planning for challenges and disruptions in the near and long term, including an inflationary cost environment, elevated competition in light of category tailwinds and accelerating advancements in digital technology that we expect to impact all areas of our business. What's important is we'll continue to make strategic choices that position us to achieve our ambition to accelerate long-term profitable growth. 
And finally, my third message is this. As we continue to address immediate priorities related to unprecedented demand, we're also accelerating our progress against our strategy to deliver long-term shareholder value. Our IGNITE Strategy continues to put people at the center of everything we do and helps us make the most of our strategic advantage in the near and long term. 
Addressing unprecedented consumer demand for much of our portfolio continues to be an immediate priority. We continue to make progress on a number of businesses. We're bringing in more third-party supply sources and launching our new wipes line in our Atlanta facility in the third quarter. 
Importantly, simplification is our mantra, and we're seeing the benefit of focusing on fewer SKUs, which we expect to continue beyond the pandemic. As I mentioned earlier, we're growing Clorox Disinfecting Wipes international, supported by a dedicated supply chain. Our expansion plans are going very well, and we expect to double the number of countries where Clorox wipes are sold. 
Another immediate priority is to continue supporting people's safety when they're outside their homes through strategic alliances to support public health. We're expanding our programs with Uber Technologies and Enterprise Holdings. We recently established a multi-year deal with the NBA and look forward to pursuing similar opportunities with other organizations. 
And as the pandemic continues to take a toll in the economy, we know that far too many people feel financial pressure from unemployment and less discretionary spending. We're mindful of the role we can play to support those who are particularly value-sensitive, and we'll continue to deliver superior value through meaningful innovation. 
Importantly, we're also making progress in laying the foundation for long-term growth. We will continue to invest strongly in our global portfolio of leading brands, particularly behind robust innovation that differentiates our products and deliver superior value. 
We will continue to reimagine how we work to ensure a strong culture, with a highly engaged team that works simpler and faster on strategic priorities. I'm proud of how we've been operating during the pandemic, including accelerating our speed to market. 
And finally, as we've said before, we view ESG as a contributor to competitive advantage, which is why it's embedded in our business. Achievements this quarter include: being included in the 2021 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index; achieving 100% renewable electricity in the U.S. and Canada 4 years early; signing on to the Energy Buyer Federal Clean Energy Policy statement, which calls for a 100% clean energy power sector; and donating $1 million to Cleveland Clinic to establish the Clorox public health research grant in support of science-based public health research. 
We are grateful to play a role in supporting people and communities as we continue to navigate the global pandemic. It only strengthens our resolve in pursuing purpose-driven growth, ensuring a strategic link between our impact on the world and long-term value creation for our shareholders.

I remember, Linda, you mentioned that in the last call. And asking in a different way, how much more capacity, including third-parties you mentioned in the call, have you added in the second half against the second half of the last fiscal? 
So it seems around 25% by my math, in the U.S., which implies that you could still grow volumes in the low single digits in this upcoming second half of, fiscal, if demand remains strong. I understand that obviously, you're giving us a flat top line for the second half because you're embedding some deceleration. So how we should be thinking of that? And conversely, if you're regaining share because you lost some share, given the stock outs, how we should be thinking of your capacity and fulfillment into the second half?"

Maybe I'll start with the question on retail inventory levels. And I might broaden it to talk about both inventory levels in the extended supply chain, both in our warehouse as well as retailers. 
What I'd tell you is, we think we've made pretty good progress over the first half of this fiscal year. And I'd say, by and large, we feel pretty good about retail inventory levels, with some notable exceptions. There are still portions of our home care portfolio, particularly our disinfecting wipes and portions of our a disinfecting spray, trigger products that were still not at a point where we can fully meet demand. 
And then the other area we still have work to do to catch-up is in Brita. That business continues to perform quite well. We've had 4 straight quarters of double-digit growth. And so we're still not in a position where we can fully support the demand on that product. But with the exception of those businesses, I'd say, generally, we feel pretty good about retail inventory levels and, additionally, feel pretty good about inventory levels in our facilities. 
I would say, on Brita, I think we've got a couple more quarters before we think we can catch up. I think by the end of this fiscal year, we'll be in a better position in terms of meeting retail demand. And then I think, particularly on our Wipes business, it's going to take a while, likely the end of this calendar year, we will be in a position to fully service demand. 
And then on capacity, you had a question on capacity, Andrea. As Linda said in her prepared remarks, we are starting up our second line at our Georgia wipes facility, and that's happening this quarter. And you'll see that start to ramp up over the next several quarters. Our expectation is by the end of this fiscal year, we'll have more than doubled our wipes capacity from where we were before the pandemic started. 
And that's a combination of bringing on our facility that's happening now as well as we continue to bring on additional contract manufacturers. And in Q2, we added more contract manufacturers as well. So we're working both with self-manufacturing as well as third-party manufacturing. That work will continue well past this fiscal year."

You started to see our share improvement in quarter 2, so we're up as a total company 0.8 points. That's up from 52-week share of being up 0.5 points. 
But what's really encouraging to us is if we dive deeper into the businesses that we have gotten back to an in-stock position on, so starting outside of Cleaning, if you look at our Hidden Valley Ranch business, Cat Litter and Kingsford, all of them growing share as we've gotten supply back up to a place where we can meet demand. And then really, encouragingly, if you look at our Cleaning business, although we have a ways to go until we can fully meet demand in places where we've been able to improve, we're seeing significant share gains. 
We saw our Clorox Clean-Up business, which is a spray, is up 8 share points in the spray business in Q2; Clorox manual toilet bowl cleaner, up 4 points; our Pine-Sol business, up 2.5 points. And that corresponds with strong plans we have in place, but also our ability to supply."

They're really in 2 buckets. 
We continue to expedite transportation, and that comes at a higher cost as we're trying to fulfill retail orders as quickly as we can in our supply-challenged environment. So there's some increased cost there. As well as the increased spending we're doing with our production team to make sure we're keeping folks safe with increased hygiene activity as well as enhanced benefits. I think over time, as we get through the pandemic, and that may push into fiscal year '22 for us, but as we move through the pandemic, we'll be able to step out of a good portion of those charges going forward."

And that's why we got into these businesses to start because we see a nice fit in our overall journey to help people be well and thrive. 
What we've learned over the last few years as we've operated these is we made the choice to buy some small brands in a very large $12 billion space. And it's certainly been a hotbed for competition. And the lesson we've learned is the ramp-up for the brands is just longer than we thought it was going to be. We see pockets of encouraging results in our RenewLife relaunch, for example, in our magnesium supplement business. But there are other places where we're not as satisfied. 
So if I take a long-term view to this, we still think these categories are attractive. We still see our ability to innovate, brand build really meaningful and a slew of a lot of things that are going on there, good claims, good science. But I think the perspective is VMS still only represents about 4% of our business, and it's going to take a while before it's a meaningful contributor, and we're going to be patient.

It grew nicely behind continued strong demand from consumers. We're seeing really good signs of brand health. So our household penetration, up almost 1.5 points, increased bio retention rate. We're growing repeat rates on the Glad business. So the fundamentals of that business continue to be very strong. 
You're seeing price gaps where we want them to be. And I think what continues to be the differentiator for Glad is innovation. It's working really well in the market for us, whether that be our experiential trash bag, or if that is our new, SKU Glad ForceFlex with Clorox, are all doing really well. And so as we've said, this is a business where you have to innovate or you have to bring new benefits to the category, and that continues to work well for us. 
I think if you take a step back, and maybe this is a comment agnostic of Glad, if you just take your pricing comment in total, you're right, we had said we would not take pricing in the height of a pandemic. And I still believe that was the right call as we got through the height of it. 
But as we look forward and as we see the pressure from the cost environment and we see pressure on gross margin, we're going to look to the broad toolbox that we have against our long-term goal of growing EBIT margin. And that toolbox includes things like, on the revenue side, managing promotion, ensuring that we can add value through innovation and premiumization. 
But we will also consider pricing as part of that. And as we look forward, we will see what the right mix is by brands. And we feel, given the fact that our portfolio has very high consumer value, the highest we have on record, that we're in a good position if we need to take pricing to do just that."

And all that has effectively come from Lysol and other manufacturers who have seen big increases in market share. And I guess the question is, you've obviously been underperforming a category that has delivered really significant growth. 
And shelf is now occupied by a litany of other brands. And so how sticky do you think that shelf spaces in wipes from those new entrants? Maybe said another way, do you think you can get back this share that you've lost in the business? Because if so, if you have the manufacturing capacity coming online, that would imply that you might, but maybe these shelf gains from other competitors are going to last indefinitely.

Wipes is obviously a very important and strategic business for us, 1 category that we created 20 years ago, and we'll continue to be aggressive as we think about expanding this business and helping to serve consumers. I think maybe it would be good to take a broader view of wipes because we're looking at a narrow universe of tracked channels. But if you look more broadly, the share loss that you're seeing in tracked channels is not reflective of the fact that we've prioritized our health care business to ensure that we have the right supply there, and that our professional businesses has always had a strong Wipes business as well as untracked channels that are very strong. 
So the broader perspective, to be clear, we don't like to lose share anywhere, and our goal is to always be growing it over the long term. But the broader perspective with Therawipes business is in better shape than you might see in track data. But then even if you look at track data, the only people growing share right now are nonbranded or new entry competitors that are very small. There is no major manufacturers as we all try to ramp up the support. 
And I think what's going to happen is we're already seeing retailers think about simplification as we move forward. And there's going to be no desire on their part to add 10, 12, whatever a brand sit on the shelf right now that are filling the need. They're going to want to make sure that they're with leading brands who are innovating, and we know that will be with Clorox. 
We feel great about the innovation pipeline we have on the business. Feel great about the fact that our supply is ramping up, and we're getting supplies, where we'll have double the supply by the end of the year. So I think you're going to start to see as we bring supply back on, share will go in the other direction. 
Similar to how I highlighted in other businesses, Clorox Clean-Up, up 8 share points, once we brought that back on from a supply perspective; Pine-Sol up to 2.5 share points. So this is very much correlated to supply. We think the long-term trends are behind us. And I think the most important part is we have not let up on the innovation and investments so that as we bring that supply up, we'll be in a terrific place to get back to growing share."

If you go back to November, we had anticipated about 100 basis points of cost headwinds throughout the back half of this fiscal year. We've updated that expectation. Now we going to be closer to 150 basis points hit, primarily driven by increasing cost of resin. And I expect that to be pretty consistent through the back half of the year."

And then secondly, I think, just historically, Clorox has kind of been, I guess, maybe I can take in and out of ""International"" with sort of some changes in this going back over 20-plus years of making a go-forward in Brazil as an example or debating, should we really go try to do something in China or not? And the impediment has often been the question of how do you establish the Clorox brand to mean something with consumers that just may not be familiar with it, the way that it dominates here in the U.S.? 
So can you just talk about how your perspective on that part of the question because the white form is something that others can do under different brand names in international markets. And so I'm just curious why -- what you're going to do to really drive that Clorox brand, in particular, to make this a more successful endeavor than kind of been the case in the past?"
89450,700178901,2192415,"The Clorox Company, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2021",2021-02-04,"Earnings Calls","The Clorox Company","Executives","Sure. Thanks, Lauren. In the case of International, we were pleased to see the strong volume-driven organic sales growth, which was really broad-based across the portfolio, including cleaning and disinfecting: Glad, Brita, Litter. And what was encouraging",304,"Sure. Thanks, Lauren. In the case of International, we were pleased to see the strong volume-driven organic sales growth, which was really broad-based across the portfolio, including cleaning and disinfecting: Glad, Brita, Litter. And what was encouraging is the early contribution from our wipes expansion. It was about 20% of the growth we experienced in the quarter. So good early signals that it's working. 
If we think about the countries, and we compete in over 100 countries around the world today broadly with our portfolio, and the very first priority we have is to expand our presence in our cleaning and disinfecting portfolio in more of those countries. So to your good point, not having to introduce them to the brand in a brand-new fashion, but actually just expanding the portfolio we have with those consumers. So to offer them the benefit that a wipes brings them, and we've seen that successful so far. And early consumption looks good in those markets. 
And then as we think about more broadly, the avenues that we have to introduce our brands to consumers have expanded. E-com is now a way that you can enter into a market, learn more about the consumer in a low-cost way. That allows us to get early insights and decide if we want to build more of an infrastructure behind an International business to expand. 
So I think what, Lauren, you're going to see from us is a very disciplined approach in this. We want to be fast, which is why we stood up that dedicated supply chain. But we want to continue to be disciplined, and we want to see a strong return on the markets that we enter. And the very first proof points are the fact that we're entering markets, we are already in with an expanded portfolio."

And we really see the opportunity to introduce consumers to that innovation to drive trial and then to benefit from the fact that we have very strong repeats right now -- repeat rates right now across the portfolio. 
So we think about, as you know, A&SP as a strategic long-term investment, we're always looking at what do we think the right level is. But we are not hesitant to invest when we see strong returns, and we're seeing that right now on the base business, and strong returns as we start to spend behind innovation.

And what I can share with you is our perspective on the back half. And Steve, you'll recall, back in November, our expectation was, in the back half, we'd see our sales decline mid-single digits. With our update outlook",419,"Yes. Steve, I can answer that one. And what I can share with you is our perspective on the back half. And Steve, you'll recall, back in November, our expectation was, in the back half, we'd see our sales decline mid-single digits. With our update outlook today, it implies our expectation that the back half will be flattish. 
And if I think about our portfolio in 3 buckets, I can kind of talk about how we see this playing out. If you think about our U.S. cleaning business, which includes both our retail and our B2B business, we now think that business is going to continue to grow in the back half of this fiscal year, low single digits. Back in November, our expectation was it would be about flat. And keep in mind, we're lapping about 40% growth in the back half of last year, so a really strong prior period. And we think that business will continue to grow for all the reasons we've been talking about today. 
On our International business, back in November we thought that business would grow low single digits. We're now taking that expectation up. We now think we'll grow high single digits in the back half of the year. Where we're seeing really good results for some of the work we're doing on extending our life business, and that will continue to add value over the back half of the year. 
And then what we call our Home Essentials business, which is a little less than 50% of our total sales, we've updated our assumption there as well. Originally, we thought that business would decline high single digits. We now think it will grow -- or excuse me, will decline mid-single digits. And in all cases, those 3 segments all grew double digits in the prior period. And so if you do that math, that gets us to about flat year-over-year in the back half. 
I'd say importantly, though, if you take a longer-term perspective and you look at our performance, say, versus fiscal year '19, a pre-pandemic environment, that would suggest we'll grow somewhere in the 15% to 20% range in the back half of this year. And so I think the takeaway, Steve, I just -- I'd offer is, this is not just about increasing strength within our disinfecting portfolio. We're seeing performance broadly across our portfolio. We saw that in Q1 and Q2, and it's our expectation going forward, we'll continue to see broad strength across the portfolio."

But just as Linda, you talked about pricing as a potential lever, specifically. I think it's specifically I'm glad, just given the resin inflation that you pointed out. 
In the past, that's been a point of volatility for Clorox. You've gotten the pricing through, but it's often come with volatility in market share and volume as competitors respond or don't respond to various degrees. I guess, can you just frame your relative confidence going into this inflationary cycle? Around how -- just around your confidence taking that pricing and avoiding that volatility this time around?"

It's really about managing over the long -- mid- to long term. We don't want to take pricing over short-term inflationary, and we use trade funds. And we have for Glad, in particular, over a number of years to manage through those short-term impacts. But as we see a progressing cost environment coming up here, pricing is something we absolutely will consider across our portfolio, where it makes sense. 
And I think it's safe to say pricing isn't something that is an easy thing to go execute. It takes a lot to do with excellence. And it comes with ensuring that we partner with retailers to have plans that grow their categories. And I feel like we are better positioned than we have been in a very long time on that. We have a terrific slate of innovation across our portfolio and particularly for Glad. We are spending against our brands, which retailers appreciate in an incredible way right now because we're bringing people to the physical or digital shelf. 
And our portfolio is at the best place it's ever been from a consumer value measure perspective. So more people deem our portfolio or percentage of our portfolio was superior than ever before. So I think with all of that, we're well positioned to do it. 
And what I wouldn't say is I don't have a perfect crystal ball. Pricing is always something that we have to go out and we're dedicated to executing with excellence. But we would expect there are little bumps here and there, but we'll manage through them. And over the long term, we know that it's a good thing for us to do, and it's right for the category. So again, no plans at this point on any of our brands, but we'll look at it as we head into the remainder of the year and next year as an option for us to expand margins."

And I think a couple of things jump out, Steve, and you've touched on a couple of them. The first is accelerating our progress in e-commerce, and we have done that and leaned in over the last couple of quarters with very good results from the Burt's Bees business. 
The second is innovation and innovating in spaces where the consumer is particularly apt to be transitioning today. So we're seeing that in skin care. We're seeing that in the health care space general. And with that, we have launched a new line of naturally clean hand products that help meet that need. And then obviously, very strong conviction in -- continued conviction in our lip care business. 
We're still the market share leader in lip balm. And although we've had some weather issues that have impacted the overall category I feel really good about that business and our ability to innovate there. So overall, from a birth's perspective, we'll continue to make tweaks as we learn from the consumer.

We have a number of new growth runways we've talked about, both in out-of-home as well as international expansion. And so we see these as long-term opportunities for the company that we're clearly investing in this year that we think generate long-term value. So again, we won't talk about our specific growth rates going forward, but we believe that sets us up nicely to be able to accelerate the long-term growth rate of the company.

So first one, Linda, just given the importance of pricing here, not just for Clorox, but of course, more broadly for consumer staples with commodity inflation. So the willingness to take pricing, I think, is going to be well received and welcome, given past commentary that the company was not going to do that during a pandemic. So I'd think that folks would generally agree that that's certainly a good thing. 
But a couple of questions here. A, can you give us a sense of retailers' receptivity to price increases at this point based on current commodity environment and state of the consumer? I mean from a Clorox perspective, one could take the view that some of your categories have arguably never been more important to them than they are right now? 
And then secondarily, you touched on this, but I want to see if we can get a little bit more specific. How quickly can you put through the price increases? Is -- I guess, what would be the hesitancy, excuse me, to doing that? Are you looking for more permanence in commodity cost inflation? Is it just -- to an earlier question, maybe a little bit of uncertainty in terms of what the competition is going to do. 
I guess what would be the hesitancy now based on what you're staring down, which is pretty significant commodity cost inflation to taking pricing? And then I have a follow-up for Kevin on buybacks."

Again, let's maybe step back and talk about pricing as a strategic lever and really what we're trying to do overall. And as you know, we're trying to expand our EBIT margins 25 to 50 basis points over the long run. And what we always look at is the broad set of tools that we have in our toolbox to manage cost wherever they may be. And one critical element of how we've done that over the short-term is cost savings, for example. And we had another robust savings this quarter, and we expect to continue that. 
And I think you know, as part of our IGNITE Strategy, we put additional levers in place thinking about the role of technology and the role sustainability could play in helping us do that over the long term. So we're very much focused on managing as many of the short-term cost inflation, increases that we see through those types of levers. 
What we're looking at right now is, over the mid to long term, based off of the outlook, what role could pricing play? And that has to play a broader role in the category plans that we have. It's not something in isolation. So what we're focused on right now is strong innovation, strong brand investment, ensuring that we have the right assortment on shelves with retailers to match the fact that consumers' behaviors and needs have changed. And that is really the single-highest priority we've had, in addition to supply over the last many months and continues to be over the next few months. 
So that would be why I would answer we're not ready to announce any type of pricing action at this moment because what we're focused on is serving consumers, what we're focused on is growing our categories, getting back to supply. And we're focused on a terrific innovation agenda we have for the back half. And if we can do that with excellence, we will get to a place where, as Kevin said, it's a very nice back half as you look back and take a broader view compared to FY '19. 
What gives us conviction, though, in the strategic -- our strategic ability to take pricing again is the health of our brands and the fact that we have been investing, the fact that we do have an innovation portfolio that's strong, the fact that we have been partnering openly and transparently with retailers on how we get through the last 9 to 10 months together. So as we make those decisions, we feel confident in that overall suite of activity that we have that can help the categories. We'll continue to evaluate when the right time might be to do that. But for now, we are really focused on investing in those brands, getting capacity back to 100% in innovation."

And as you mentioned, we have a very strong balance sheet right now. We're carrying a little under $800 million in the balance sheet that is elevated. And so as we've said, if we don't have a need for that cash, we will look for ways to get back to our shareholders.

And then as we develop our plans for fiscal year '22 and beyond, we'll continue to evaluate the best opportunity to invest that cash. And as I said, again, if we don't have a good use for it, we're not going to keep it on the balance sheet. We'll look for ways to get that back to focus."

Not necessarily just now or even 6, 12 months from now, but how they're thinking about shelf space allocation, level of promotion necessary to drive the category in cleaning -- not only just in cleaning and disinfecting, but also your other big categories. And again, this is sort of thinking 2 to 3 years down the line with allocation to shelf space and how to think about running the categories post pandemic?"
89450,700178901,2192415,"The Clorox Company, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2021",2021-02-04,"Earnings Calls","The Clorox Company","Executives","Thanks, Olivia. You're hitting on exactly what we're talking to retailers about right now, and we're partnering with them on is what is the long-term for these categories as we get through what's been an incredibly unprecedented. I think we can never unde",452,"Thanks, Olivia. You're hitting on exactly what we're talking to retailers about right now, and we're partnering with them on is what is the long-term for these categories as we get through what's been an incredibly unprecedented. I think we can never underestimate or overuse that word unprecedented. 
And we're really turning to what does the future look like? What will the habits and behaviors that have started today that we believe will be very sticky in the future mean for the assortment that's needed, for the type of promotion that's needed, for the shelf space. And what I would say is that varies depending on the category. 
And our categories have always been different at shelf. What's required from an assortment perspective, how much is merchandise, et cetera. So we are working with them on those individual plans. We're bringing them consumer insights and what we're seeing in the changing behaviors. So for example, the fact that people are cleaning and disinfecting more, and we expect that to continue. 
They're cleaning different surfaces. They're thinking about the fact that when they leave their house, they're thinking about those surfaces around them in a different way, and we're helping them to plan for that. 
And then I think, really importantly, what we've talked to them about is the innovation needed in order to address those needs and how we ensure we introduce that innovation in a quick manner. That we get it on the physical or digital shelf and that we get the right trial behind that. And retailers are really receptive to hearing that right now. And in fact, are loving the fact that we're coming with so much innovation despite all of the craziness over the last 9 months. 
So without getting into specific category details, that's exactly what we're doing. And retailers will begin to make those first moves as supply gets to the place where we're able to fully meet it, and you'll start to see what it looks like online. I think a couple of themes. The first is simplification. We've taken the opportunity to simplify our portfolio, to help us run faster in many of our businesses, and that's panned out really well for us. Actually, really well for retailers. And so they're going to continue to drive simplification. We win in that environment, being a #1 and #2 share brand. 
And then the second thing is omni-channel, making sure that a consumer has access to the right products depending on where they are and where they're shopping. And we're focused on that with retailers and ensuring that they have all of those right levers in place depending on where consumers are entering into their store."

We hope you and your families are continuing to stay safe and well. 
I'll start by providing some context to this quarter to give you an understanding of the dynamic environment we're seeing as we begin to emerge from this pandemic. Then I'll have my usual top line commentary with highlights from each of our segments. Kevin will then address our total company results as well as our FY '21 outlook. Finally, Linda will offer her perspective, and we'll close with Q&A. 
A few reminders before we go into results. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet, and a replay of the call will be available for 7 days at our website at cloroxcompany.com. 
Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including statements related to the expected or potential impact of COVID-19. These statements are based on management's current expectations but may differ from actual results or outcome. 
In addition, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the forward-looking statements section, which identifies various factors that could affect such forward-looking statements and the non-GAAP financial information section, which include tables that reconcile non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, both of which are located at the end of today's earnings release, which has also been posted on our website and filed with the SEC. 
To help cut through some of the complexities this quarter, I'd like to share what we see as 3 important key takeaways. First, we're on track for another strong year. Our FY '21 outlook continues to project double-digit sales growth. On a 2-year stack basis, we're also positioned to deliver about 19% sales growth. 
Second, we continue to see opportunity to accelerate our long-term financial performance. For example, many consumer behaviors that have changed during the pandemic are expected to stick, including enhanced hygiene practices. We're leaning into these changes through new growth runways to help Clorox develop into a global disinfecting brand. 
And third, the pandemic has only reinforced the relevance of our IGNITE strategy priorities, which center around people and innovation, leveraging technology as a critical enabler. 
Now turning to our third quarter results. Our strategy has enabled us to deliver flat sales in Q3 on top of 15% growth in the year-ago quarter. Q3 sales reflected about 1 point of net benefit from July 2020 acquisition that gave us a majority share in our joint venture in Saudi Arabia. 
On an organic basis, sales were down 1%. In our Health and Wellness segment, sales were down 8%, reflecting declines in Cleaning and PPD. Sales in Cleaning business declined this quarter from lower shipments in a number of our cleaning and disinfecting products. The lower shipments are a result of demand normalization in bleach and Pine-Sol relative to the year-ago period when consumers turned to these products, given the persistent out of stocks in wipes and sprays at the onset of the pandemic. 
Segment results also reflect ongoing supply constraints in our wipes and sprays. Nonetheless, 2-year stack growth remains very strong, reflecting a much higher level of consumer demand and household penetration than prepandemic even as we begin to see a return to new normal in the U.S., with a growing percentage of the population vaccinated. As we continue to increase supply in our wipes and sprays, product availability and assortment will improve, which, in turn, should lead to improvements in shares. We're also excited to be bringing back some of the innovation we've had to pause during the pandemic, including Clorox compostable wipes and Clorox Scentiva disinfecting sprays and wipes. 
Sales in our Professional Products business were down by double digits this quarter due to lower shipments of cleaning and disinfecting products as many businesses remain close during the third quarter relative to the year-ago period. Similar to the trends in cleaning, demand for our consumer-preferred disinfectants like wipes and sprays remain elevated, and consumption continues to be limited by our ability to supply. And as expected, consumption of bleach and other cleaning and disinfecting products has normalized. 
With continuing category tailwinds, progress in our out-of-home partnerships and a strong innovation pipeline, PPD fundamentals remain healthy. Importantly, we feel good about the prospects of this business. 
Lastly within this segment, sales in our Vitamins, Minerals and Supplements business were up in the third quarter driven by higher shipments of our strategic brands and lower trade spending. Notably, we were lapping a double-digit decrease from the year-ago period driven by a disruption in our supply chain-related to COVID-19. 
As noted in today's press release, we recorded a $267 million net noncash impairment charge related to this business, which Kevin will address in more detail shortly. Despite the setback, we're moving forward focused on implementing a refreshed portfolio strategy and incorporating what we've learned since acquiring these brands. 
There continue to be strong tailwinds in the VMS space. And we have clarity on the path of this business becoming a more meaningful contributor in the long term. 
Again, just some brief context before I get into the results in our other businesses. Similar to cleaning, inventory levels in the year-ago period impacted Q3 results, especially in Brita, where we remain supply constrained. With continued elevated demand and supply challenges, several of our businesses in these segments have gone back on allocation. 
In Household and Lifestyle, consumers continuing to stay at home as well as business closures impact our businesses differently, benefiting some and challenging others. Nonetheless, our 2-year stack growth across our segments remain very strong and well above our long-term sales growth targets. 
Turning to the Household segment. Quarterly sales were up 6% with growth recorded in all 3 businesses for a fourth consecutive quarter. Grilling sales were up by double digits in what was a record-setting quarter of shipments for the business. 
Through strategic collaborations with our retail partners, we've been able to continue to grow household penetration and share. In the past year, we've introduced Kingsford products -- Kingsford's products to more than 1 million new households. And they've invested in their backyard, including buying new charcoal and pellet growth, which will create a lasting tailwind for this business. 
Our pricing strategy has also led to a less promotional environment, which will reduce pantry loading going forward. And we've improved our product lineup and distribution, making it easier for consumers to find our Kingsford pellet innovation and new flavors of our Kingsford product lineup at even more locations nationwide. All these goodness is helping us build a healthy momentum for this business, which is especially important as we head into peak -- the peak of the grilling season and tough comparable periods. 
Cat Litter sales increased this quarter despite lapping consumer stockpiling in the year-ago period. The driving forces behind the business strong performance have been its success in the e-commerce channel and innovation. 
Fresh Step with Gain continues to do well and build distribution with more innovation planned for Q4. Additionally, the record number of pet adoptions that has occurred during the past year will resonate for years to come as cat parents continue to purchase necessities like litter long after the pandemic has ended. 
Glad sales increased in Q3, mainly behind lower trade promotion. As a reminder, while we began to see elevated demand at the tail end of the year-ago quarter, heavy consumption didn't occur until late in FY '20. So Q4 will be a more challenging comparison than Q3. 
In recent months, we've also seen a significant resin price inflation. To manage those rising costs, we have announced a pricing action on this brand effective in July. As we've mentioned, we'll manage inflationary pressures holistically using all the tools in our toolbox. This approach will allow us to continue introducing innovation that resonates with consumers, which has driven profitable growth for the category for a long time. 
For example, over the past decade, we've started using higher-quality resin that has allowed us to reduce overall use by 20%, resulting in a stronger bag with a reduced environmental footprint, all while improving our cost structure over time. Our latest innovation Glad ForceFlex with Clorox trash bags has been performing well since its fall 2020 launch. 
In Lifestyle segment, Q3 sales were flat. The Food business had a double-digit sales increase for a fourth straight quarter behind continued consumption growth of our Hidden Valley Ranch bottle dressings and dry seasonings. This growth was on top of high single-digit growth in the year-ago period. The ongoing trend of at-home meals has driven household penetration to another record high. Our optimism for this business is further fueled by the success of our latest innovation, Hidden Valley Secret Sauces and Hidden Valley plant right-based ranch dressing, which has both -- have both been performing well. 
Brita sales in Q3 were down by double digits as the category consumption decelerated from its COVID-related buying spikes in the year-ago period. Despite these results, consumption level has remained much higher than prepandemic, partly fueled by strong filter replacement. As with wipes and sprays, our supply chains have not caught up with demand in Brita, particularly for filters and impacting our shares and sales. On a positive note, we're continuing to make progress in addressing these supply issues, which has already helped us begin to recover share. 
Burt’s Bees sales also decreased by double digits due to the changes in shopping and usage behavior that have occurred during the pandemic. The business was also lapping the effect of pantry loading in the year-ago period. Mask wearing and decreased mobility have created headwinds in both the lip care and face care segments. 
Still, the brand has not only maintained but fortified its position as the #1 lip balm. As we prepare this business for improving consumer mobility and consumers returning to cosmetics and colors, we'll be launching towelette innovation in value sizes and the new watermelon scent. These bright spots, combined with the continued growth in online channels, contribute to our confidence in the long-term growth prospects of this business. 
Lastly, International has its own unique dynamics that sets us apart from our other segments. Unlike the U.S., most international markets where we operate don't yet have high vaccination rates. As a result, demand for cleaning and disinfecting products remain elevated. The 2-year stack growth rate for this business is about 22%. 
In our International segment, Q3 sales grew 9%. These results, which reflect the combined impact of about 7 points of benefit from the Saudi JV acquisition and about 2 points from foreign currency headwinds, are on top of 11% growth in the year-ago period. Excluding the impact of Saudi acquisition, half of all sales growth was driven by the introduction of a new line of Clorox disinfecting wipes, mainly flat packs innovation sourced from our dedicated international supply chain and launched in more than 30 countries this fiscal year. With strong innovation like this and differentiation of our brands in their respective categories, we feel good about the growth runway of this business. 
Now I'll turn it over to Kevin, who will discuss our Q3 performance as well as our updated outlook for FY '21."
89450,709670568,2265499,"The Clorox Company, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2021",2021-04-30,"Earnings Calls","The Clorox Company","Executives","Thank you, Lisah, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We hope you and your families are well. Before I review our third quarter results, let me first address the noncash impairment charge we reported today. The Better Health Vitamins, Mineral",1479,"Thank you, Lisah, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We hope you and your families are well. 
Before I review our third quarter results, let me first address the noncash impairment charge we reported today. The Better Health Vitamins, Minerals and Supplements business represents about 4% of total company sales, comprising several small brands we acquired in 2 separate transactions. Performance on this business has not delivered on our expectations. The impairment was a result of our updated valuation, which assumes lower sales and profit projections versus our initial expectations at the time of the acquisition primarily driven by an increased level of competitive activity and the need for more investments to scale these small brands. 
As a result of our updated valuation, we record a pretax noncash impairment charge of $329 to lower the carrying values of goodwill, trademarks and other assets of the Vitamin, Mineral and Supplement business unit. Net of a deferred tax benefit of $62 million associated with this impairment, we recorded a $267 million charge to net income or $2.11 per share. This represents about 27% of its initial purchase price. 
Going forward, we are implementing our refreshed portfolio strategy. We continue to believe in the attractiveness of the VMS space driven by strong consumer tailwinds and the strategic fit, given our focus on health and wellness. Importantly, we fully expect that our VMS business will be a meaningful contributor to our company results over time. 
To ensure clarity around the underlying operating performance of our overall business, my comments on the third quarter results will exclude the impact of this noncash impairment. In addition, my comments will exclude the impact of a onetime noncash gain related to our Saudi joint venture acquisition. 
It's important to note that while the Saudi joint venture is expected to contribute $0.45 to $0.50 to our reported EPS, it includes a $0.60 noncash gain that we're excluding from our adjusted EPS outlook. Moving forward, in our fiscal year adjusted EPS '21 outlook, we are continuing to include $0.10 to $0.15 charge, primarily from an ongoing intangible amortization related to the acquisition. 
Before I review our third quarter results, I'll comment briefly on our fiscal year outlook. As you saw in our press release, we've confirmed our fiscal year sales outlook and provided an adjusted EPS outlook, which excludes a noncash impact from the VMS impairment in the third quarter as well as a onetime noncash gain of the Saudi joint venture acquisition in the first quarter. For perspective, excluding these items help provide clarity around our underlying operational performance, which is unchanged from our previous outlook. Importantly, I'm pleased we're on track to deliver another strong year for our shareholders, targeting a 2-year stack of about 19% sales growth, well above our historical financial performance. 
Now turning to our third quarter results. Third quarter sales were flat in comparison to 15% growth in the year-ago quarter when we saw the initial spike from COVID-19. Our sales results reflect a 5-point decline in organic volume, offset by 4 points of favorable price/mix and 1 point benefit from our Saudi joint venture acquisition. On an organic basis, third quarter sales declined 1%. 
Our sales results came in largely as expected although there's certainly variability across our portfolio, which reflects a very dynamic environment we continue to navigate. Importantly, we grew sales in 6 out of our 10 businesses. 
Gross margin for the quarter decreased 320 basis points to 43.5% compared to 46.7% for the year-ago quarter. Gross margin results reflect a pronounced inflationary environment, resulting in 360 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs, including temporary COVID-19 spending as well as 170 basis points of higher commodity costs, primarily related to the rising cost of resin, partially impacted by the extreme weather events we experienced in the Southern U.S. earlier this quarter. 
Gross margin also reflects 100 basis points of negative impact from lower volume in the quarter. These factors are partially offset by 140 basis points of favorable trade promotion and 110 basis points of cost savings. 
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales came in at 13.3% compared to 15.1% in the year-ago quarter, reflecting lower incentive compensation expenses, primarily related to the noncash impairment on the VMS business. Advertising and sales promotion investment levels as a percentage of sales came in at 11%, reflecting continued strong investments across our portfolio, with U.S. spending at about 12% of sales to support a robust innovation program in the back half of the fiscal year. 
Our third quarter effective tax rate was negative 1.4% driven by the impairment charge we took on our VMS business. Excluding the impairment charge, our third quarter tax rate was 23% compared to 19% in the year-ago quarter as we lap excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation. Net of all these factors, adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter came in at $1.62 versus $1.89 in the year-ago quarter, a decline of 14%. 
As you also saw in our press release, year-to-date, net cash provided by operations was $893 million versus $806 million in the year-ago period, an increase of 11%. Our strong cash flow was due to profitable sales growth, partially offset by higher tax payments and higher employee incentive compensation payments. 
Turning to our updated fiscal year outlook. We continue to anticipate fiscal year sales to grow between 10% to 13%, reflecting the strength of our first half results and our ongoing assumptions for moderating demand over the balance of the fiscal year as we move beyond the peak of the pandemic in the U.S. and lap exceptional prior year comparisons. Our assumptions for 1 point of contribution from our Saudi joint venture, offset by 1 point of foreign exchange headwinds remain the same. 
On an organic sales basis, our outlook continues to assume 10% to 13% growth. We now expect fiscal year gross margin to be down due to a more pronounced headwinds from elevated commodity and transportation costs. We now expect fiscal year selling and administrative expenses to come in below 14% of sales, reflecting lower incentive compensation costs primarily due to our third quarter noncash impairment on our VMS business. 
Additionally, we continue to anticipate fiscal year advertising spending to be about 11% of sales, reflecting our ongoing assumption to spend about 12% in the back half to support our innovation program. For perspective, this fiscal year, we're planning to spend about $125 million more versus a year ago to ensure we're leaning into engaging consumers to build lifetime loyalty to our brands. 
We continue to expect our fiscal year tax rate on a reported and adjusted basis to be between 21% and 22%. Net of these factors, we anticipate fiscal year adjusted EPS to be between $7.45 and $7.65 or 1% to 4% growth, reflecting the continued assumptions I mentioned last quarter, including strong top line performance, partially offset by an increasingly elevated cost environment. 
In closing, I'd like to note that as we transition from the peak of the pandemic in the U.S., we're navigating a highly dynamic operating environment with the following factors that can influence our results in the near to medium term. First, category dynamics and consumption trends. As more people get vaccinated and become increasingly mobile in the U.S., although we recognize different markets are in varying stages of pandemic, we're keeping an eye on short-term changes in these trends as they could cause variability in our top line. That said, longer term, we believe our portfolio will continue to play a meaningful role in addressing consumer megatrends that have accelerated over the last 12 months, which will contribute to higher demand for our products relative to demand levels prior to the pandemic. 
Second, more pronounced cost headwinds, which we'll plan to navigate with all the tools in our toolkit, including opportunities for pricing in key areas of our portfolio. 
And third, increased production capacity to support ongoing elevated demand. This remains a key priority for us as our teams continue to look for every opportunity to expand our production capacity while recognizing the ongoing volatility this creates on our extended supply chain. 
And finally, I'll reinforce that we're on track to deliver another strong year for our shareholders while keeping our sights set on the long term. As you saw in February, we raised our long-term annual sales target to 3% to 5%. Based on the early success of our IGNITE strategy and our continued plans to lean in even further with strong investments behind our brands, people, technology, production capacity and of course, our new growth opportunities, where we believe we have a right to win. These efforts are all in service of our broader ambition to accelerate profitable growth to create long-term value for our shareholders. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Linda."
89450,709670568,2265499,"The Clorox Company, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2021",2021-04-30,"Earnings Calls","The Clorox Company","Executives","Thanks, Kevin. Hello, everyone, and thank you for being with us today. I hope you are all well. A year ago, around this time when the pandemic spiked in the U.S., we knew we were facing unchartered territory. And as I look back at how we've managed our",1196,"Thanks, Kevin. Hello, everyone, and thank you for being with us today. I hope you are all well. 
A year ago, around this time when the pandemic spiked in the U.S., we knew we were facing unchartered territory. And as I look back at how we've managed our business to support our consumers, retail partners and communities over the last 12 months, what makes me proud is that we stayed true to 3 things. We embraced our role as a health and wellness company, which helped us prioritize our actions, including ensuring the safety of our people and emphasizing our support for health care workers. 
We put people at the center, taking care of our teammates around the world and staying the course in doing everything we could to serve public health and consumer needs. We were led by our values, with our commitment to do the right thing guiding our strategic choices and actions. Out of all of this, our purpose became clearer. We champion people to be well and thrive every single day. 
With this in mind, here's what's important for you to take away from today's call. First, our business is well positioned for the future. I'm grateful our consumers have rewarded our team's dedication to serving people and communities around the world. 
Our business is significantly larger than it was before the pandemic. People have turned to our trusted brands for support during an incredibly tough year, and Clorox has the most trusted brands in many categories. We see this play out in strong household penetration across our portfolio with our brands in 90% of U.S. households. We continue to see strong repeat rates across our brands among core and new users versus last year. And as Lisah mentioned, we continue to focus on retaining this larger base of loyal consumers. 
And of course, this is showing up in our results, including flat sales in comparison to a very strong base in the year-ago quarter. For perspective, it's worth noting that we delivered a 2-year stack of 15% total company sales growth in the third quarter. And as Kevin mentioned, we're on track to hit a 2-year stack of about 19% sales growth for the fiscal year. 
My second message is that we have strategic plans in place to address near-term priorities as we continue to navigate in a very dynamic environment. First, there's more work to be done on improving supply especially after weather-related disruptions in the third quarter and higher-than-anticipated demand in certain parts of our portfolio. We're pulling every lever available to us to improve supply, including working with third-party supply sources as we continue to run flat out. I'm encouraged by our progress, but our overall supply chain remains a top priority focus for us. 
Next, we fully acknowledge that market shares for key brands are not where we want them to be. That said, share declines are primarily driven by recent supply challenges. And as we continue to improve supply capacity, we expect to recover market share. We feel good about seeing continued strong consumption and demand across our portfolio relative to prepandemic levels. 
And as Kevin discussed, we're facing stronger cost pressures from critical input costs and a tightening transportation market. One of the 4 key choices in our IGNITE strategy is to generate fuel to support growth and mitigate inflation. We're taking a holistic approach to address these cost pressures by leveraging a number of tools to support our margins, including margin accretive innovation, net revenue management, pricing through trade reduction and less price increases and as always, a relentless focus on cost savings. 
My last message is this. With conviction in our purpose and guided by a strategy that makes the most of our strength, we continue to have our sights set on our ambition to accelerate long-term profitable growth. In the past year, we learned that by putting people at the center, our IGNITE strategy has helped us to do what we do best, serve people who count on our brands. And we continue to have an opportunity to serve even more people around the world. 
And as we think about our future, our strategy is proving to be particularly relevant as it leverages significant consumer megatrends that have accelerated because of the pandemic. The latest research still tells us that consumer routines and behaviors formed during the pandemic are expected to persist, including prioritizing health and hygiene, drinking more water, taking vitamins and supplements and spending more time online. 
What's more, the role of home has changed. With many companies pursuing hybrid models for their workforce, we expect more cleaning, more meal occasions and more trash to be generated at home. 
Our portfolio continues to be in a unique position to play a meaningful role in people's lives, and we have every intention of accelerating new growth opportunities to support these trends. Moving forward, we're leaning into our IGNITE strategy with innovation remaining core to our key areas of strength. That means innovating in our products, especially larger, stickier innovation platforms that deliver superior consumer value and multiyear growth for our business; innovating in consumer and shopper engagement; personalizing experiences for consumers so that we get to know 100 million people by the year 2025; and partnering with our retailers on category vision and leadership to support healthy and profitable categories. The turnaround of our Kingsford business is a great example of how our focus on innovation is contributing significantly to strong category and brand growth. 
Innovating how we work across the organization through technology that makes us smarter, work faster and in the case of our supply chain, enables us to respond more quickly to future demand spikes. And finally, innovating through an ESG lens because we believe in the strategic link between our societal impact and long-term value creation. 
Here are some highlights in the last quarter. We're 21% of the way toward our goal to reduce virgin plastic and fiber packaging by 50% by 2030. We've achieved 76% of our 100% goal for recyclable, reusable or compostable packaging by 2025. We're introducing a company-wide learning and development program focused on sustainability because ESG integration in our business not only means embedding it in every brand, but also rallying every person behind our efforts. 
And with ESG embedded into our operations, our brands are not only contributing to our corporate ESG goals, but they're also pursuing meaningful goals that matter to their consumers. As an example, by 2030, Brita has a goal to provide clean water access to 0.5 million people in the U.S. facing poor-quality tap water. This speaks to the heart of Brita's brand purpose. 
Before I open it up for questions, I'd like to echo the important takeaways Lisah mentioned at the beginning of the call. First, we're on track for another strong year. Second, we'll seize the opportunity before us to accelerate long-term profitable growth. Third, our IGNITE strategy has proven its relevance in the face of the pandemic by putting people at the center, emphasizing innovation and leveraging technology to lay the groundwork for the future. 
Operator, you may now open the line for questions."

First, one, just can you clarify the 3% to 5% long-term top line growth range from down in CAGNY, can you just clarify specifically what time period is that over? Is that a post fiscal '22 range? Does it include fiscal '21, '22? Just tr",252,"Two things for me. First, one, just can you clarify the 3% to 5% long-term top line growth range from down in CAGNY, can you just clarify specifically what time period is that over? Is that a post fiscal '22 range? Does it include fiscal '21, '22? Just trying to understand that? 
And then second, there are a lot of sort of puts and takes as we think about the next few quarters here from a top line standpoint. In theory, more difficult comparisons, COVID cases are dropping off. Vaccine counts are going up. Those are some headwinds, but you mentioned some of the supply chain challenges that you're working on. And you've talked about the greater opportunity in professional and international longer term, which drove that higher long-term top line growth guidance down at CAGNY. 
So I was just hoping you could give us a bit of context as you look out here over the next few quarters in terms of some of those headwinds versus tailwinds. Could the business potentially decelerate with the comparisons you're facing? Or do some of those positive areas more than offset it as you think about the business over the next few quarters here? I know you're not going to give a specific number, but just trying to think how you guys think through that, particularly with some of those longer-term positive top line tailwinds you're thinking of? Does that play out in the near term? Or how long does that take to play out?"

And let me start with your first question or as you mentioned, we raised our long-term sales goal of 3% to 5% back in February. In terms of the timing, that's part of our IGNITE strategy, which runs through 2025. 
And Dara, how I see that playing out, as we talked back in February, and we have the same point of view, we expect our sales to be roughly flat in the back half of the year. And that's consistent with Q3. And as we get into FY '22, our expectation is we're going to be by the back half of the year back to our long-term raised sales outlook at 3% to 5%. 
So as you know, we've got some tough comps here for the next 3 quarters. But as we get through those comps by January, we were at this new elevated level. And that's really as we work through the next phase of this pandemic as we see higher vaccination rates, more mobility, we fully expect that we'll see a slowdown in demand for products that's expected. When we get to sort of that new normalized level, we think we're back at this 3% to 5% rate going forward."

I'll start maybe with the big picture on what we're seeing as definitely tailwinds for us, and we mentioned some of this in the script but with a little bit more color.

I'll start maybe with the big picture on what we're seeing as definitely tailwinds for us, and we mentioned some of this in the script but with a little bit more color. We're definitely seeing consumer behavior trend sticky as we look over the mid to long term. We're seeing hygiene continue to be that cornerstone of health for folks. And even as people are getting vaccinated and mobility is starting to increase, we're seeing people embrace those new cleaning behaviors as new routines. And they're both doing that inside and out of the home. 
In the business case, we're still seeing the need for higher disinfection as they welcome people back. But the issue has been depending on the market you're in, and certainly, we're seeing that in the U.S., mobility has not really increased the point where businesses are fully at capacity yet or even open in many cases. So we're seeing that both as a long-term headwind, but as a short-term impact definitely to Q3. And we're looking to the future quarters to see how mobility will improve. 
I think the other things that we continue to see around people taking care of their health and wellness are persisting. We have a new installed base, for example, with Brita with a lot of people who purchased pitchers over the last period, and we're seeing them continue with filter sales in their quest to be healthier and you take on good habits. 
Digital continues to persist, and we think that will be a tailwind for our business as we've invested, as you well know, more in digital marketing than the average in our industry leaning into that trend already. And then, of course, our strong position in e-comm that we've built over many years, and we continue to see that accelerate. And that's up to 14% of our business year-to-date. 
And then the role of home continues to be a tailwind, and that was above our expectations in quarter 3 for sure. But we're seeing people persist even as people have more mobility, people are eating more at home. And that what hasn't really changed at all as people who were working from home during the pandemic are continuing to work from home. So we see that in our impact whether that be on our Kingsford business, on our Hidden Valley Ranch business or our trash business, there's definitely positivity to that stay-at-home trend. So I think all of those are going to be tailwinds as we look to the coming months and in the long term. 
From a headwind perspective, supply chain has continued to be a challenge. And what we've done is gone after a tremendous amount of sales. We're a much bigger company than we were prepandemic, and that means that we have increased the complexity in our supply chain. We have a lot more nodes. We have a lot more third parties helping us. 
And then what didn't help this quarter, of course, were the weather disruptions that we experienced that caused quite a few force majeures in our products. And although we were managed -- able to manage through it and deliver our overall commitment from a quarter 3 perspective, it's something we're watching really closely to see any volatility we have. But the supply chain being more expanded continues to be something that we're watching, continues to be something that could be a help or a hinder as we look forward."

So as Kevin highlighted and Lisah highlighted in their scripts, absolutely seeing the inflationary pressure as I think the entire ecosystem is now across our industry and from a retailer perspective as well. And what we have our sights set on is how do we get to that long-term EBIT margin goal we have of 25 to 50 basis points from an accretion perspective. 
And the way we approach it is very holistic. We're looking across a robust toolbox to address this, things like margin accretive innovation. And we have a terrific innovation program that started at the beginning of this year and is continuing as we launch incremental innovations in Q4, net revenue management, pricing and that will include both list price increases and trade reductions and then, of course, our relentless focus on cost savings. So we're employing that entire toolbox right now across all of our businesses. And we're coming from a place of strength in this. 
Our brands are strong right now. We have never had a higher consumer value measure. Household penetration is strong. We're seeing strong repeats. So we're feeling confident in that. And we're evaluating our ability to take price across all businesses. But I'll tell you, we will be very surgical and targeted in this. We're going category by category because we're -- of course, we're weighing the broader environment, and we want to be measured in that. But I -- the message I want you to hear is we're looking at it very broadly across our portfolio, and what we're really focused on is executing by category with excellence."

And then related to the pricing, you did mention that lower promotions, I think, are going to be a part of how you're getting some net pricing. I think that's what you said. But promos are already at a pretty low level. And so do you anticipate your promotional levels going below peers? 
And then I have a second question. But the general framework there is just Glad pricing risk and just -- did I hear that right that you think promo can actually be a source of pricing, basically implying that maybe you're not looking at list prices in the rest of the portfolio just yet until we get well into fiscal '22? And then I have a follow-up."

So we have confidence in our brands and the strength right now, and that is absolutely inclusive of Glad. And all of the investment that we put in, in terms of incremental advertising, what we put in from an innovation perspective and how consumers have turned to our brands during this time continue to give us confidence in our ability to take pricing. 
I think what we're also seeing this time versus what we saw last time is a broader inflationary environment that really is pretty systemic throughout the industry and what everyone is experiencing. So as you mentioned, we've seen competitors move in categories like Glad. 
I think Glad, in particular, I'll just highlight, we have already come up with that price increase that's effective in July. But given the volatility and the increases we're seeing in the resin market, we are looking at will we take even additional pricing in Glad based on what we've seen. So again, we want to be -- let the cost pressures guide us. We're doing this for the mid- to long term, but we're seeing extraordinary circumstances in resin right now that are helping us to go faster on Glad. 
What you should take away on the other brands is not that we are not looking at with price increases. We look at that -- first of all, we do that annually as a company to understand our position. But right at this moment, we're looking at that. But what I want you to hear is the way that we do that across the brands needs to be holistic. So some will include those price increases, others will not. 
And what you'll hear us apply to every business is cost savings. You'll hear us think about how we can have margin accretive innovation across every business but less price increases we'll be very targeted on, but again, evaluating across our entire portfolio. 
And I think from an on-shelf and a retailer perspective, we're working on category growth plans with them. And we're lapping a very strong period of growth. And as you think about the lower promotion question, what we're trying to do is get to a more normalized state of promotion. And it's still, although accelerated versus where it was in Q2, it's still well below prepandemic levels. And as we lap that growth, there's little incentive to put a bunch of deep discounting out in the system, and we're working on growth plans. So that's how we're thinking about the lower promotions in the context of the environment is that we all have strong growth to lap. 
And of course, we want to make sure that consumers, that we continue to lean into them and invest behind the tailwinds. And that could mean a lower promotional environment. But we're watching that closely, and again, it will depend on the category. But the overall sentiment would be keeping it as rational as we can and using promotion for what it's intended for, to drive trial and to get consumers to keep [indiscernible]."

And then the second question is just I think if there was one area which surprised, certainly relative to our model, this quarter was the decline in professional and certainly on a sequential basis. Like I appreciate the cyclicality of the business, but there's also this underlying -- we've heard about all these partnerships that you're signing. And I guess also, international came in a little bit light just relative to what we've seen from a lot of other staples companies this quarter. 
And so maybe I think underlying the question is just the confidence that these 2 businesses can be contributors to your 3% to 5% longer-term growth outlook. Just maybe any puts and takes that you saw this quarter, which give you confidence that those businesses can be bigger growth drivers going forward?"

On your first question in regard to the impact of pricing, I'd tell you, it's too early for us to start providing perspective. We're right in the middle right now of building our plans for fiscal year '22. And as Linda said, we're going to be looking at a number of different levers in terms of how we're going to work to offset the transportation and commodity cost increases we're seeing. Pricing will certainly be one of those levers, but we'll be looking at a number of others as well. So we'll update you on that one as we get further along with our plans in August. 
In regard to International, just a perspective of International, as you may have seen, volume was down. I think it's worth noting, we feel very good about the progress we're making on our cleaning and disinfecting work. And as Lisah mentioned in her prepared remarks, we continue to expand the number of countries we're introducing wipes into, and we've added 30 countries now. 
Specifically though in the third quarter, one of the challenges we had was in Canada. While we saw growth pretty broadly across our portfolio in Canada, and if you're tracking that region, you may know, they are now in their third lockdown. And in the Canadian market, it's a little different than the U.S. in their lockdowns for items that are deemed nonessential. If you go into a retail outlet, in many cases, those aisles are blocked off where you can't shop them. And so as an example, in third quarter, we grew our cleaning and disinfecting business in Canada, but we saw pretty significant declines in other parts of our business. 
Our Brita business was down over 30%. Our Burt's Bees business is also down by a similar amount because consumers are not able to shop those aisles. Now right now, the lockdown they've announced goes through May 20. So that has some knock-on effect as we move into our fourth quarter. But we expect as we get out of that lockdown, those businesses will rebound. But by and large, we feel very good about the progress on our cleaning and disinfecting portfolio internationally. And then Linda will talk a little bit about our professional business."

And if you think about this, it has to really do with the comparison period. 
So last quarter 3, businesses hadn't shut down by the -- in that point, even though we saw consumer takeaway in the retail side, for the most part, businesses were open. So we had a very strong comparison period to lap. And in contrast to that, this quarter, most businesses continue to remain closed. 
And you have to recall, too, we have a very established business when it comes to professional. This is not just about the new opportunities, but we've been cleaning these businesses for years and years. It's about 7% of the company before this growing strongly, mid-single to high single digits. And so that really had an impact. 
And I think if you look broader across the professional space, not just ours, they're seeing the same trends broadly in that industry. But if you take a step back, the trends continue. The partners that we've had as we brought on in the new out-of-home space continue to see the benefits of offering their guests a clean and disinfected space branded by Clorox. And we continue to expand those partnerships and bring new ones on. 
The 2-year stack on this business is up 17%, so very strong growth on top of strong growth for many years. And we continue to have conviction in the long term. The reality is consumers need that reassurance that spaces are clean. We know businesses want to provide that to them so they can get back to growing again. And we have a terrific new suite of innovation that we're excited about that's coming in quarter 4, including expanding our electrostatic sprayer business with both new forms and chemistries. 
So feel really good about the long term of this business. There's a lot of noise in the short term as most of the professional spaces out there have encountered, but no change to our outlook for the future."

And then secondly, on market share, given this has been a supply-related issue, I mean, what's the case that you can make to retailers to get back the space at a point where you feel like the supply problem no longer exists? I mean, is it going to be about marketing support, brand loyalty or basket size, basket size place? So any thoughts around that would be helpful."

But we did anticipate to experience as people became vaccinated, behavior is changing. And we did see that curve move up slightly. So as people got vaccinated, it just happened a little earlier. And frankly, vaccines happened earlier than we had anticipated. So that's normal. We expected that as we go forward. 
But the key takeaway is versus prepandemic levels, cleaning behaviors are still significantly elevated. And we continue to expect them to be into the future. And we're hearing that from consumers. We're seeing that in their buying habits and continue to feel confident about our ability to -- for these growth areas in cleaning and disinfecting to get us to our 3% to 5% growth rate moving forward. 
I think as it particularly comes to market share, just to be really clear, we are not happy. Whether it be supply related, et cetera, we want to grow share. And that is our goal, and we want to do that over the mid- to long term. 
This really does have -- it's primarily driven with supply, particularly in cleaning and disinfecting. Not only did we have the weather-related issues. But as we talked about, the more that we expand our supply chain, the more nodes that it has, the more risk it introduces. And that really impacted our ability to lap a very, very strong period that, of course, included the depletion of all the inventory across the system last quarter 3. 
As we look forward to supply though, we're optimistic. We've made good progress, and we anticipate substantial improvement in the next 4 months. And we plan to be in stock on most businesses in cleaning, including wipes by the end of Q1. And what consumers are already experiencing is better than what they've experienced for the months premium to that. They're going to the shelf and they're finding something from Clorox, which is good to see. 
And then we anticipate being fully in stock across our Cleaning business by the end of Q2. So that includes some things like sprays and some of the other items that are still supply constrained. 
When it comes to market share moving forward, supply is going to help, but the other thing is innovation. And we have a terrific suite of innovation in quarter 4 that retailers are really excited about. And that includes reintroducing things that we had to put on pause. Scentiva, that was a large growth platform for us prior to the pandemic, we are starting to ship that again. Compostable wipes are also back in market again. And we know they had a strong start prior to the pandemic, and we'd expect them to continue. 
And then we're also going to be expanding our disinfecting floor mopping business that we had started right at the beginning of the pandemic. And we expect broad distribution on that. In addition, we're launching brand-new to the space innovations, including paper towel wipes, a brand-new Clorox nonbleach all-purpose cleaner and then building off of our electrostatic business that's already at over $100 million in sales and launching new forms and new chemistries kind of brand-new to the market. So a great suite of innovation that we're working with retailers on, and that's what we're focused on: innovation and growing the category. And that's resonated really well."

Nik, why don't I give a little bit of background, too? I think that would be helpful then to talk about what we're planning to do just as a backdrop. As Kevin mentioned in his remarks, we bought a bunch of small brands through 2 acquisitions 3 to 5",484,"Yes. Nik, why don't I give a little bit of background, too? I think that would be helpful then to talk about what we're planning to do just as a backdrop. 
As Kevin mentioned in his remarks, we bought a bunch of small brands through 2 acquisitions 3 to 5 years ago. These were small brands, very strong in the then fast-growing natural channel. And we expected them to grow consistent with what we're seeing in that broader category, high single digits to low double-digit growth and of course, getting a shorter time to synergies. 
The underperformance is related to what we bought. So channel headwinds have been a big component of that. Natural went from plus 8% at the time we bought it to a headwind at negative 5%. And that's only accelerated, given the pandemic and what we're seeing in retail consolidation. 
We're also very heavily weighted in probiotics, and that category has been fragmented. It slowed down, given the massive amount of people who've been launching probiotics in other forms, in food, et cetera, and then certainly higher competition as people have entered that attractive space. And then just given the size of the brands that we bought, we realize it's going to take a longer time and more investment to get there. 
So what do we do looking to the future? It starts with the fact that we have really good conviction in the strength of the category and the tailwinds that we see from a consumer perspective. Those remain very strong. People are continuing to do things to take care of their health and wellness, and vitamins and supplements are absolutely part of that. 
So with that, I'll give you what I can talk about in the strategy at a high level, and we'll welcome talking about more detail coming up in the future. But what we're really focused on is first, making sure that we have the right category knowledge, and we feel great about that. We have a better understanding of how the category works and how we need to operate with those small brands in it. We've hired new industry talent that has a lot of experience in this space, and they've helped us to get clear on that. And we've refreshed our strategy and particularly around our portfolio and how we win with those brands moving forward. 
And so with that, and I know, Nik, you probably want more details on that, but we'll have more to share later. We fully expect to be able to get to company accretive sales and profit over the long term. But we've built in a slow ramp-up period as we think about that because it's going to take some time to do what we plan to do on these brands and get to a place where they're delivering that type of accretive growth for us as a company."

I'm assuming that's fiscal '22 consideration at this point. I'm curious because, as you know, it will mark about 6 months that your large competitor took pricing from what I understand. Is that the strategy now to recover some of that share? And any other categories that -- I appreciate that you don't want to come across as being opportunistic. And I know knowing from the benefit that you had from your strong brands and everything to come across as taking price in the middle of pandemic, but now that we are hopefully coming through high vaccination rates, so when do you think is the time to actually take some of the other categories that are also impacted by transportation cost pressures and commodities to be considered to be taking pricing? 
And one -- also before you can answer. But just so before, the -- as far as I understood, like you think that commentary about having the supply chain normalized and having the cleaning products by -- fully on shelf by the end of the calendar second quarter, would we expect also that international and professional, the professional business will be normalized? So that's only the cleaning and you still have the work to do to recover share and capacity on these other segments?"

And that we're still contemplating, and we don't have news to share on timing on that. But the round that we just announced will be effective in July, and then it will pass through. And we'll see retailers change prices on shelf as they do that. 
As it relates to your broader comment on pricing, that really is category specific, and it has to do with the timing. These businesses have different seasonal aspects to them. They have different promotional plans. They have different innovation plans. And so I don't have any more to share on timing on any of those categories, but I just want you to take away that we are looking at it across every category. We -- but we will be doing this category by category, and it really has to do with those dynamics that we're experiencing and of course, the broader plan. 
And I also want you to take away what we are absolutely doing on every category right now is cost savings, and we're going back. We're pleased to be on track to deliver our cost savings target for the year. And we're looking at what other places could we plus that up across all of our businesses. And then, of course, innovation is the same. 
But as we have more news on pricing, we'll share it. But at this point, it's Glad and news that we're looking at, would there be additional action we'd want to take on Glad, given what we're seeing in resin. 
And then as your question on supply chain, professional has some shared supply chain as does a small portion of international with our U.S. retail cleaning business, but they also have components that are completely separate. But they are largely expected to recover on the same timing that we have from retail. Although international, I would say, at this point, particularly with wipes, given we have a dedicated supply chain, we're not at a point that we're constrained in the vast majority of our International businesses because of that dedicated supply chain."

When we look at the strength of our brands, we always focus on consumer value as the measure we look at to determine the strength of our brands and our ability to take pricing because, of course, consumer value is composed of the strength of the brand that we have. It's comprised of the product and how people experience that versus competitive products. And of course, pricing is a function of that as well. 
And we're looking at that triangle that, that forms to say what is the right mix by category, by subsegment to deliver that right value for consumers. And we're always trying to optimize that. So we take that into account as we think about it. 
Given the fact that we have higher consumer value than we've ever had since we began measuring it, that implies the strength of our brands that they have ability to take price. And as we strengthen our innovation program, as we've leaned in to spend 11% behind our brands this year and keep them strong, that was one of the questions we've got a lot of is why would you invest during a time when people want your brands already? And it was about building that brand strength and equity over the long term so that we have ability to introduce them to new products as they demand it and of course, take pricing as we need to. 
So we're taking that into account. I would say, regardless of pricing, these consumer behaviors are here to stay. Consumers have absolutely shown a willingness to pay during this time to keep themselves safe and well through all of their behaviors, whether that be cleaning, drinking more water, et cetera. And also as they start to eat at home, we've seen lots of trends around consumers having meal experiences. They've invested in grills, and they've invested in that long-term behavior. So we feel really good about our ability to do both, which is continue to take advantage of the trends that we're seeing, but also price where it's appropriate to recover margin."

If you take a step back and look at our retail cleaning business, prepandemic, that was a place of strength for us. We were growing mid-single digits in both top line and bottom line in the retail cleaning business for a number of years. So if you look at the 5-year CAGR prepandemic, that was mid-single digits. So we were starting from a place of strength. And we see that continuing as we move to the future, and we see -- building off of that. 
So if that gives you an idea of what we're thinking about, it will be above the company average is what we're anticipating, given the fact that it's a place where consumer tailwinds are working where we think innovation is going to play a really big role because consumer needs have changed.

On Q4, we don't provide quarterly guidance, but what I can share with you is as we said, for the full year, we expect our gross margin to be down. For me, that's likely about 100 bps on the full year basis. 
And as we mentioned, back in February, my expectation is it would be down to a lesser degree. As we've highlighted, what's really changed for us is, while transportation continues to be a challenging market for us, it's really resin that had the biggest impact really driven by the ice storm we saw back in February. 
When we talked back in February during our previous earnings call, I had anticipated about 150 bps headwind from commodities in the back half of the year. I think that's going to be closer to 200 bps now in the back half. And you saw in Q3 in our attachments we provided, about 170 bps in Q3. I think it will be higher in Q4. And I think it will probably peak in the front half of fiscal year '22, and then we'll start to see some softening. And so I think that's how it's going to play out this year in the near term. 
And then your longer-term question on margin recovery, Linda just mentioned it. We are committed to growing EBIT margins 25 to 50 bps over the long term. And so we're going to continue to aggressively work towards that goal. And as part of that is the actions we're talking about now as it relates to recovering these cost increases, pricing being one element of that, but we're going to be leaning into cost savings in many other areas as well. We'll work to recover margin. 
And then maybe last comment, Steve, that might be helpful. If I provide a broader perspective, if you think about our financial performance, where we were before the pandemic at the end of fiscal year '19 and where we're likely in this year, on a 2-year stack basis, that's about a 100 bps increase in gross margin. And so we'll certainly be challenged this quarter and next quarter. 
If I take a long-term view, we've improved the margins of the company about 100 bps over the last 2 years. And then as I said earlier, our goal is by the time we get to the back half of fiscal year '22, we are delivering 3% to 5% sales growth. We're expanding margins. We're delivering earnings growth. So hopefully, that gives you some perspective on our desire to quickly move through this challenging environment, but make sure we're taking the necessary actions to put us on track for our long-term sales and profit goals in the back half of '22."

And I know that Nielsen is far from perfect, particularly with your strong shares in club and the quick gains you've made in e-commerce over time. But Nielsen does measure something. 
And when we look at Nielsen, it looks like your share in spray cleaners and in wipes is not just down this year, but is down -- if I looked back prepandemic, that your shares were down pretty considerably, particularly in the spray cleaning category. So I just would like some further perspective there on whether or not there's been some channel prioritization dynamics, whether or not in hindsight, there's a sense that maybe you could have invested more and been more proactive in cleaning historically? Because it feels to me like, again, just looking at the Nielsen and knowing it's imprecise, there's a bit of a hole to dig out of on share that's not really related to during the pandemic supply constraints."

Thanks for the question and try to provide some clarity on this one because I know it's really complex. Maybe taking a step back would help on this one just to get clear on what we experienced in cleaning and what we think we drove prepandemic, what we're seeing now, which again we're not satisfied with and then how we see this playing out over the coming months and years as we get to a more normalized state. 
So first, big picture, if we step back and look at our retail cleaning business, it's actually been a great area of strength for us. I mentioned a little earlier that we had strong growth. So if you look at the 5-year CAGR prepandemic, we grew that business mid-single digits, both top and bottom line. And that corresponded to an overall share increase in home care of 2 points from fiscal year '13 through '19. So that was something that we've been investing in. 
We had been really trying to expand the Clorox brand. We had a strong focus on innovation. We have launched Scentiva during that time. We had done improvements on a broad range of our portfolio. So it's been a nice area of strength for us. 
I think as you dive into the individual segments, Lauren, you do get to what you said, which is there are ups and downs. And sprays is an incredibly complex, fragmented category. So while we were winning in a lot of the particular segments that we are strong in, it could be true that in other ones, we weren't. And we have a very strong spray business, to your point, outside of track channels, which is about 50% of our business. So -- in aggregate. 
So we -- I feel like we walked into this pandemic in a strong way from a Clorox perspective. There's always work to be done in individual segments, as you highlighted. But overall, we were winning in Home Care. And as we look to the future, I think a lot of those elements are going to continue to resonate, but we're going to ramp them up. 
One, the strength of that Clorox brand. It's why we've invested so much this year behind that and increased the spending. We're on track to spend across the company another $125 million in advertising and sales promotion this year, why we've ramped up innovation. And I mentioned the innovations that are worth repeating, reintroducing Scentiva, compostable wipes are back on shelf, disinfecting floor mop costs, which is a brand-new incremental category for us to compete in, having new offerings in Clorox sprays that aren't bleach, and that's a first for us as well as paper towel wipes and then broadly expanding against our new electrostatic business that we really created from nothing a number of years ago with some partnership. 
So I feel terrific about what we have in place to continue to meet consumer needs. I am not happy, Lauren, with where we are share-wise. None of us are, but we feel confident in our ability to get back into that share growth as supply continues, again, which is the majority of the issue. But we're laser-focused on that consumer value metric, innovation and investing behind the Clorox brand."

But -- so for your outlook now, specifically, advertising and marketing, still 11% of sales, including 12% in the back half of the year. I think as you guys are well aware, both of those are historical highs as far as I have going back, this is a decade. So on a full year basis, on a 6-month basis, was there any thought at all about pulling back as commodity costs move higher? I suspect the answer is not a lot, given a lot of the discussion around market share, but maybe you can comment on that. 
And then just confidence on ROI behind the spend, given a lot of the volatility that exists around consumption, et cetera. The context here, understanding supply chain constraints have been a problem and one that you're trying to address, but I'm sure the hope would be in principle, that market share would be in a better place with advertising and marketing your historical levels. That's probably not going out of much of a limb. 
And then maybe just sort of tying this up, longer term, is 11% the right number? We don't have to go back very far. And it was 9% of sales. Is it possible this comes in, it comes back to 9%, which is not sort of permanently in the P&L. So maybe some comments there, which I suspect you're not making that sort of decision in a vacuum. It's going to be where is market share and whether you're satisfied with it. But not to belabor this because I feel like we've spoken on a lot of it, but anything you feel in that would be incremental would be helpful."

And we wanted to create that loyal consumer base moving forward. And we wanted to give them the right",427,"Sure, Kevin. 11% for this year was something we had a lot of passion and conviction on, given the fact that we're seeing so many people enter our brands. And we wanted to create that loyal consumer base moving forward. And we wanted to give them the right product information that they needed during such a trying time for everybody, but also give them new solutions as people had different challenges to solve. And innovation and advertising play a really important role in that. 
So for this year, we are on track to spend 11% as you highlighted, and we have a strong spend coming up here in Q4. And that is behind the new innovations that we've launched. And I think you'll recall probably from previous conversations that our goal was to double the amount of advertising we spent on innovation this year to welcome people into those new product experiences and create loyalty and trial. 
As we look forward -- and let me comment on ROI before I say we move forward. That's something that we're tracking realtime and getting information and insights on. And what I can say is the ROI continues to be very strong, and that's why we continue to spend, and we're seeing it translate into results from a consumer-metric perspective. So continue to have incredibly high household penetration. We have household penetration gains across a number of our categories. 
We're seeing loyalty strengthen. So retention rates growing, repeat rates growing on both core users and new users. We're seeing consumers buying larger quantities more often. So all of the things that we would attribute to, to long-term consumer metrics that show the health of the brand, the advertising drives, we're seeing that, not only just the strong ROI, but those metrics increase that are important to us to talk about loyalty. 
As we move forward, we don't have a prescribed number, whether it be 10%, 11%. But what I can say is we're committed to investing in our brands. And we'll continue to optimize what that right level of spending is depending on exactly like you highlighted, market shares, depending on the innovation programs we have. 
But what you should hear from us is we will continue to invest in our brands. And we'll -- as we update and give you a perspective for '22 and beyond, we'll communicate what that exact number looks like. But you heard our continued commitment to advertising as a strong lever to help us get to our 3% to 5% over the long term."

We hope you and your families are continuing to stay safe and well. 
I'll start by providing some context to this quarter to give you an understanding of the dynamic environment we're seeing as we begin to emerge from this pandemic. Then I'll have my usual top line commentary with highlights from each of our segments. Kevin will then address our total company results as well as our FY '21 outlook. Finally, Linda will offer her perspective, and we'll close with Q&A. 
A few reminders before we go into results. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet, and a replay of the call will be available for 7 days at our website at cloroxcompany.com. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including statements related to the expected or potential impact of COVID-19. These statements are based on management's current expectations but may differ from actual results or outcome. 
In addition, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the forward-looking statements section, which identifies various factors that could affect such forward-looking statements and the non-GAAP financial information section, which include tables that reconcile non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, both of which are located at the end of today's earnings release, which has also been posted on our website and filed with the SEC. 
To help cut through some of the complexities this quarter, I'd like to share what we see as 3 important key takeaways. First, we're on track for another strong year. Our FY '21 outlook continues to project double-digit sales growth. On a 2-year stack basis, we're also positioned to deliver about 19% sales growth. 
Second, we continue to see opportunity to accelerate our long-term financial performance. For example, many consumer behaviors that have changed during the pandemic are expected to stick, including enhanced hygiene practices. We're leaning into these changes through new growth runways to help Clorox develop into a global disinfecting brand. And third, the pandemic has only reinforced the relevance of our IGNITE Strategy priorities, which center around people and innovation, leveraging technology as a critical enabler. 
Now turning to our third quarter results. Our strategy has enabled us to deliver flat sales in Q3 on top of 15% growth in the year-ago quarter. Q3 sales reflected about 1 point of net benefit from July 2020 acquisition that gave us a majority share in our joint venture in Saudi Arabia. On an organic basis, sales were down 1%. In our Health and Wellness segment, sales were down 8%, reflecting declines in Cleaning and PPD. Sales in Cleaning business declined this quarter from lower shipments in a number of our cleaning and disinfecting products. The lower shipments are a result of demand normalization in bleach and Pine-Sol relative to the year-ago period when consumers turned to these products, given the persistent out of stocks in wipes and sprays at the onset of the pandemic. 
Segment results also reflect ongoing supply constraints in our wipes and sprays. Nonetheless, 2-year stack growth remains very strong, reflecting a much higher level of consumer demand and household penetration than pre-pandemic even as we begin to see a return to new normal in the U.S., with a growing percentage of the population vaccinated. As we continue to increase supply in our wipes and sprays, product availability and assortment will improve, which, in turn, should lead to improvements in shares. We're also excited to be bringing back some of the innovation we've had to pause during the pandemic, including Clorox Compostable Wipes and Clorox Scentiva disinfecting sprays and wipes. 
Sales in our Professional Products business were down by double digits this quarter due to lower shipments of cleaning and disinfecting products as many businesses remain close during the third quarter relative to the year-ago period. Similar to the trends in cleaning, demand for our consumer-preferred disinfectants like wipes and sprays remain elevated, and consumption continues to be limited by our ability to supply. And as expected, consumption of bleach and other cleaning and disinfecting products has normalized. With continuing category tailwinds, progress in our out-of-home partnerships and a strong innovation pipeline, PPD fundamentals remain healthy. Importantly, we feel good about the prospects of this business. 
Lastly within this segment, sales in our Vitamins, Minerals and Supplements business were up in the third quarter driven by higher shipments of our strategic brands and lower trade spending. Notably, we were lapping a double-digit decrease from the year-ago period driven by a disruption in our supply chain-related to COVID-19. 
As noted in today's press release, we recorded a $267 million net noncash impairment charge related to this business, which Kevin will address in more detail shortly. Despite the setback, we're moving forward focused on implementing a refreshed portfolio strategy and incorporating what we've learned since acquiring these brands. There continue to be strong tailwinds in the VMS space. And we have clarity on the path of this business becoming a more meaningful contributor in the long term. 
Again, just some brief context before I get into the results in our other businesses. Similar to cleaning, inventory levels in the year-ago period impacted Q3 results, especially in Brita, where we remain supply constrained. With continued elevated demand and supply challenges, several of our businesses in these segments have gone back on allocation. 
In Household and Lifestyle, consumers continuing to stay at home as well as business closures impact our businesses differently, benefiting some and challenging others. Nonetheless, our 2-year stack growth across our segments remain very strong and well above our long-term sales growth targets. 
Turning to the Household segment. Quarterly sales were up 6% with growth recorded in all 3 businesses for a fourth consecutive quarter. Grilling sales were up by double digits in what was a record-setting quarter of shipments for the business. Through strategic collaborations with our retail partners, we've been able to continue to grow household penetration and share. In the past year, we've introduced Kingsford products -- Kingsford's products to more than 1 million new households. And they've invested in their backyard, including buying new charcoal and pellet growth, which will create a lasting tailwind for this business. 
Our pricing strategy has also led to a less promotional environment, which will reduce pantry loading going forward. And we've improved our product lineup and distribution, making it easier for consumers to find our Kingsford pellet innovation and new flavors of our Kingsford product lineup at even more locations nationwide. All these goodness is helping us build a healthy momentum for this business, which is especially important as we head into peak -- the peak of the Grilling season and tough comparable periods. 
Cat Litter sales increased this quarter despite lapping consumer stockpiling in the year-ago period. The driving forces behind the business strong performance have been its success in the e-commerce channel and innovation. 
Fresh Step with gain continues to do well and build distribution with more innovation planned for Q4. Additionally, the record number of pet adoptions that has occurred during the past year will resonate for years to come as cat parents continue to purchase necessities like litter long after the pandemic has ended. 
Glad sales increased in Q3, mainly behind lower trade promotion. As a reminder, while we began to see elevated demand at the tail end of the year-ago quarter, heavy consumption didn't occur until late in FY '20. So Q4 will be a more challenging comparison than Q3. 
In recent months, we've also seen a significant resin price inflation. To manage those rising costs, we have announced a pricing action on this brand effective in July. As we've mentioned, we'll manage inflationary pressures holistically using all the tools in our toolbox. This approach will allow us to continue introducing innovation that resonates with consumers, which has driven profitable growth for the category for a long time. For example, over the past decade, we've started using higher-quality resin that has allowed us to reduce overall use by 20%, resulting in a stronger bag with a reduced environmental footprint, all while improving our cost structure over time. Our latest innovation Glad ForceFlex with Clorox trash bags has been performing well since its fall 2020 launch. 
In Lifestyle segment, Q3 sales were flat. The Food business had a double-digit sales increase for a fourth straight quarter behind continued consumption growth of our Hidden Valley Ranch bottle dressings and dry seasonings. This growth was on top of high single-digit growth in the year-ago period. The ongoing trend of at-home meals has driven household penetration to another record high. Our optimism for this business is further fueled by the success of our latest innovation, Hidden Valley Secret Sauces and Hidden Valley plant rice-based ranch dressing, which has both -- have both been performing well. 
Brita sales in Q3 were down by double digits as the category consumption decelerated from its COVID-related buying spikes in the year-ago period. Despite these results, consumption level has remained much higher than pre-pandemic, partly fueled by strong filter replacement. As with wipes and sprays, our supply chains have not caught up with demand in Brita, particularly for filters and impacting our shares and sales. On a positive note, we're continuing to make progress in addressing these supply issues, which has already helped us begin to recover share. 
Burt’s Bees sales also decreased by double digits due to the changes in shopping and usage behavior that have occurred during the pandemic. The business was also lapping the effect of pantry loading in the year-ago period. Mask wearing and decreased mobility have created headwinds in both the lip care and face care segments. Still, the brand has not only maintained but fortified its position as the #1 lip balm. As we prepare this business for improving consumer mobility and consumers returning to cosmetics and colors, we'll be launching towelette innovation in value sizes and the new watermelon scent. These bright spots, combined with the continued growth in online channels, contribute to our confidence in the long-term growth prospects of this business. 
Lastly, International has its own unique dynamics that sets us apart from our other segments. Unlike the U.S., most international markets where we operate don't yet have high vaccination rates. As a result, demand for cleaning and disinfecting products remain elevated. The 2-year stack growth rate for this business is about 22%. 
In our International segment, Q3 sales grew 9%. These results, which reflect the combined impact of about 7 points of benefit from the Saudi JV acquisition and about 2 points from foreign currency headwinds, are on top of 11% growth in the year-ago period. Excluding the impact of Saudi acquisition, half of all sales growth was driven by the introduction of a new line of Clorox disinfecting wipes, mainly flat packs innovation sourced from our dedicated international supply chain and launched in more than 30 countries this fiscal year. With strong innovation like this and differentiation of our brands in their respective categories, we feel good about the growth runway of this business. 
Now I'll turn it over to Kevin, who will discuss our Q3 performance as well as our updated outlook for FY '21."
89450,709670568,2265864,"The Clorox Company, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2021",2021-04-30,"Earnings Calls","The Clorox Company","Executives","Thank you, Lisah, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We hope you and your families are well. Before I review our third quarter results, let me first address the noncash impairment charge we reported today. The Better Health Vitamins, Mineral",1478,"Thank you, Lisah, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We hope you and your families are well. 
Before I review our third quarter results, let me first address the noncash impairment charge we reported today. The Better Health Vitamins, Minerals and Supplements business represents about 4% of total company sales, comprising several small brands we acquired in 2 separate transactions. Performance on this business has not delivered on our expectations. The impairment was a result of our updated valuation, which assumes lower sales and profit projections versus our initial expectations at the time of the acquisition primarily driven by an increased level of competitive activity and the need for more investments to scale these small brands. 
As a result of our updated valuation, we record a pretax noncash impairment charge of $329 to lower the carrying values of goodwill, trademarks and other assets of the Vitamin, Mineral and Supplement business unit. Net of a deferred tax benefit of $62 million associated with this impairment, we recorded a $267 million charge to net income or $2.11 per share. This represents about 27% of its initial purchase price. 
Going forward, we are implementing our refreshed portfolio strategy. We continue to believe in the attractiveness of the VMS space driven by strong consumer tailwinds and the strategic fit, given our focus on health and wellness. Importantly, we fully expect that our VMS business will be a meaningful contributor to our company results over time. 
To ensure clarity around the underlying operating performance of our overall business, my comments on the third quarter results will exclude the impact of this noncash impairment. In addition, my comments will exclude the impact of a onetime noncash gain related to our Saudi joint venture acquisition. 
It's important to note that while the Saudi joint venture is expected to contribute $0.45 to $0.50 to our reported EPS, it includes a $0.60 noncash gain that we're excluding from our adjusted EPS outlook. Moving forward, in our fiscal year adjusted EPS '21 outlook, we are continuing to include $0.10 to $0.15 charge, primarily from an ongoing intangible amortization related to the acquisition. 
Before I review our third quarter results, I'll comment briefly on our fiscal year outlook. As you saw in our press release, we've confirmed our fiscal year sales outlook and provided an adjusted EPS outlook, which excludes a noncash impact from the VMS impairment in the third quarter as well as a onetime noncash gain of the Saudi joint venture acquisition in the first quarter. For perspective, excluding these items help provide clarity around our underlying operational performance, which is unchanged from our previous outlook. Importantly, I'm pleased we're on track to deliver another strong year for our shareholders, targeting a 2-year stack of about 19% sales growth, well above our historical financial performance. 
Now turning to our third quarter results. Third quarter sales were flat in comparison to 15% growth in the year-ago quarter when we saw the initial spike from COVID-19. Our sales results reflect a 5-point decline in organic volume, offset by 4 points of favorable price/mix and 1-point benefit from our Saudi joint venture acquisition. On an organic basis, third quarter sales declined 1%. 
Our sales results came in largely as expected although there's certainly variability across our portfolio, which reflects a very dynamic environment we continue to navigate. Importantly, we grew sales in 6 out of our 10 businesses. 
Gross margin for the quarter decreased 320 basis points to 43.5% compared to 46.7% for the year-ago quarter. Gross margin results reflect a pronounced inflationary environment, resulting in 360 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs, including temporary COVID-19 spending as well as 170 basis points of higher commodity costs, primarily related to the rising cost of resin, partially impacted by the extreme weather events we experienced in the Southern U.S. earlier this quarter. 
Gross margin also reflects 100 basis points of negative impact from lower volume in the quarter. These factors are partially offset by 140 basis points of favorable trade promotion and 110 basis points of cost savings. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales came in at 13.3% compared to 15.1% in the year-ago quarter, reflecting lower incentive compensation expenses, primarily related to the noncash impairment on the VMS business. Advertising and sales promotion investment levels as a percentage of sales came in at 11%, reflecting continued strong investments across our portfolio, with U.S. spending at about 12% of sales to support a robust innovation program in the back half of the fiscal year. 
Our third quarter effective tax rate was negative 1.4% driven by the impairment charge we took on our VMS business. Excluding the impairment charge, our third quarter tax rate was 23% compared to 19% in the year-ago quarter as we lap excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation. Net of all these factors, adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter came in at $1.62 versus $1.89 in the year-ago quarter, a decline of 14%. 
As you also saw in our press release, year-to-date, net cash provided by operations was $893 million versus $806 million in the year-ago period, an increase of 11%. Our strong cash flow was due to profitable sales growth, partially offset by higher tax payments and higher employee incentive compensation payments. 
Turning to our updated fiscal year outlook. We continue to anticipate fiscal year sales to grow between 10% to 13%, reflecting the strength of our first half results and our ongoing assumptions for moderating demand over the balance of the fiscal year as we move beyond the peak of the pandemic in the U.S. and lap exceptional prior year comparisons. Our assumptions for 1 point of contribution from our Saudi joint venture, offset by 1 point of foreign exchange headwinds remain the same. 
On an organic sales basis, our outlook continues to assume 10% to 13% growth. We now expect fiscal year gross margin to be down due to a more pronounced headwinds from elevated commodity and transportation costs. We now expect fiscal year selling and administrative expenses to come in below 14% of sales, reflecting lower incentive compensation costs primarily due to our third quarter noncash impairment on our VMS business. 
Additionally, we continue to anticipate fiscal year advertising spending to be about 11% of sales, reflecting our ongoing assumption to spend about 12% in the back half to support our innovation program. For perspective, this fiscal year, we're planning to spend about $125 million more versus a year ago to ensure we're leaning into engaging consumers to build lifetime loyalty to our brands. 
We continue to expect our fiscal year tax rate on a reported and adjusted basis to be between 21% and 22%. Net of these factors, we anticipate fiscal year adjusted EPS to be between $7.45 and $7.65 or 1% to 4% growth, reflecting the continued assumptions I mentioned last quarter, including strong top line performance, partially offset by an increasingly elevated cost environment. 
In closing, I'd like to note that as we transition from the peak of the pandemic in the U.S., we're navigating a highly dynamic operating environment with the following factors that can influence our results in the near to medium term. First, category dynamics and consumption trends. As more people get vaccinated and become increasingly mobile in the U.S., although we recognize different markets are in varying stages of pandemic, we're keeping an eye on short-term changes in these trends as they could cause variability in our top line. That said, longer term, we believe our portfolio will continue to play a meaningful role in addressing consumer megatrends that have accelerated over the last 12 months, which will contribute to higher demand for our products relative to demand levels prior to the pandemic. 
Second, more pronounced cost headwinds, which we'll plan to navigate with all the tools in our toolkit, including opportunities for pricing in key areas of our portfolio. And third, increased production capacity to support ongoing elevated demand. This remains a key priority for us as our teams continue to look for every opportunity to expand our production capacity while recognizing the ongoing volatility this creates on our extended supply chain. 
And finally, I'll reinforce that we're on track to deliver another strong year for our shareholders while keeping our sights set on the long term. As you saw in February, we raised our long-term annual sales target to 3% to 5%. Based on the early success of our IGNITE Strategy and our continued plans to lean in even further with strong investments behind our brands, people, technology, production capacity and of course, our new growth opportunities, where we believe we have a right to win. These efforts are all in service of our broader ambition to accelerate profitable growth to create long-term value for our shareholders. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Linda."
89450,709670568,2265864,"The Clorox Company, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2021",2021-04-30,"Earnings Calls","The Clorox Company","Executives","Thanks, Kevin. Hello, everyone, and thank you for being with us today. I hope you are all well. A year ago, around this time when the pandemic spiked in the U.S., we knew we were facing unchartered territory. And as I look back at how we've managed our",1196,"Thanks, Kevin. Hello, everyone, and thank you for being with us today. I hope you are all well. 
A year ago, around this time when the pandemic spiked in the U.S., we knew we were facing unchartered territory. And as I look back at how we've managed our business to support our consumers, retail partners and communities over the last 12 months, what makes me proud is that we stayed true to 3 things. We embraced our role as a health and wellness company, which helped us prioritize our actions, including ensuring the safety of our people and emphasizing our support for health care workers. We put people at the center, taking care of our teammates around the world and staying the course in doing everything we could to serve public health and consumer needs. We were led by our values, with our commitment to do the right thing guiding our strategic choices and actions. Out of all of this, our purpose became clearer. We champion people to be well and thrive every single day. 
With this in mind, here's what's important for you to take away from today's call. First, our business is well positioned for the future. I'm grateful our consumers have rewarded our team's dedication to serving people and communities around the world. 
Our business is significantly larger than it was before the pandemic. People have turned to our trusted brands for support during an incredibly tough year, and Clorox has the most trusted brands in many categories. We see this play out in strong household penetration across our portfolio with our brands in 90% of U.S. households. We continue to see strong repeat rates across our brands among core and new users versus last year. And as Lisah mentioned, we continue to focus on retaining this larger base of loyal consumers. And of course, this is showing up in our results, including flat sales in comparison to a very strong base in the year-ago quarter. 
For perspective, it's worth noting that we delivered a 2-year stack of 15% total company sales growth in the third quarter. And as Kevin mentioned, we're on track to hit a 2-year stack of about 19% sales growth for the fiscal year. 
My second message is that we have strategic plans in place to address near-term priorities as we continue to navigate in a very dynamic environment. First, there's more work to be done on improving supply especially after weather-related disruptions in the third quarter and higher-than-anticipated demand in certain parts of our portfolio. We're pulling every lever available to us to improve supply, including working with third-party supply sources as we continue to run flat out. I'm encouraged by our progress, but our overall supply chain remains a top priority focus for us. 
Next, we fully acknowledge that market shares for key brands are not where we want them to be. That said, share declines are primarily driven by recent supply challenges. And as we continue to improve supply capacity, we expect to recover market share. We feel good about seeing continued strong consumption and demand across our portfolio relative to pre-pandemic levels. 
And as Kevin discussed, we're facing stronger cost pressures from critical input costs and a tightening transportation market. One of the 4 key choices in our IGNITE Strategy is to generate fuel to support growth and mitigate inflation. We're taking a holistic approach to address these cost pressures by leveraging a number of tools to support our margins, including margin accretive innovation, net revenue management, pricing through trade reduction and less price increases and as always, a relentless focus on cost savings. 
My last message is this. With conviction in our purpose and guided by a strategy that makes the most of our strength, we continue to have our sights set on our ambition to accelerate long-term profitable growth. In the past year, we learned that by putting people at the center, our IGNITE Strategy has helped us to do what we do best, serve people who count on our brands. And we continue to have an opportunity to serve even more people around the world. And as we think about our future, our strategy is proving to be particularly relevant as it leverages significant consumer megatrends that have accelerated because of the pandemic. The latest research still tells us that consumer routines and behaviors formed during the pandemic are expected to persist, including prioritizing health and hygiene, drinking more water, taking vitamins and supplements and spending more time online. 
What's more, the role of home has changed. With many companies pursuing hybrid models for their workforce, we expect more cleaning, more meal occasions and more trash to be generated at home. 
Our portfolio continues to be in a unique position to play a meaningful role in people's lives, and we have every intention of accelerating new growth opportunities to support these trends. Moving forward, we're leaning into our IGNITE Strategy with innovation remaining core to our key areas of strength. That means innovating in our products, especially larger, stickier innovation platforms that deliver superior consumer value and multiyear growth for our business; innovating in consumer and shopper engagement; personalizing experiences for consumers so that we get to know 100 million people by the year 2025; and partnering with our retailers on category vision and leadership to support healthy and profitable categories. The turnaround of our Kingsford business is a great example of how our focus on innovation is contributing significantly to strong category and brand growth. 
Innovating how we work across the organization through technology that makes us smarter, work faster and in the case of our supply chain, enables us to respond more quickly to future demand spikes. And finally, innovating through an ESG lens because we believe in the strategic link between our societal impact and long-term value creation. 
Here are some highlights in the last quarter. We're 21% of the way toward our goal to reduce virgin plastic and fiber packaging by 50% by 2030. We've achieved 76% of our 100% goal for recyclable, reusable or compostable packaging by 2025. We're introducing a company-wide learning and development program focused on sustainability because ESG integration in our business not only means embedding it in every brand, but also rallying every person behind our efforts. 
And with ESG embedded into our operations, our brands are not only contributing to our corporate ESG goals, but they're also pursuing meaningful goals that matter to their consumers. As an example, by 2030, Brita has a goal to provide clean water access to 0.5 million people in the U.S. facing poor-quality tap water. This speaks to the heart of Brita's brand purpose. 
Before I open it up for questions, I'd like to echo the important takeaways Lisah mentioned at the beginning of the call. First, we're on track for another strong year. Second, we'll seize the opportunity before us to accelerate long-term profitable growth. Third, our IGNITE Strategy has proven its relevance in the face of the pandemic by putting people at the center, emphasizing innovation and leveraging technology to lay the groundwork for the future.

First, one, just can you clarify the 3% to 5% long-term top line growth range from down in CAGNY, can you just clarify specifically what time period is that over? Is that a post fiscal '22 range?

First, one, just can you clarify the 3% to 5% long-term top line growth range from down in CAGNY, can you just clarify specifically what time period is that over? Is that a post fiscal '22 range? Does it include fiscal '21, '22? Just trying to understand that? 
And then second, there are a lot of sort of puts and takes as we think about the next few quarters here from a top line standpoint. In theory, more difficult comparisons, COVID cases are dropping off. Vaccine counts are going up. Those are some headwinds, but you mentioned some of the supply chain challenges that you're working on. And you've talked about the greater opportunity in professional and international longer term, which drove that higher long-term top line growth guidance down at CAGNY. 
So I was just hoping you could give us a bit of context as you look out here over the next few quarters in terms of some of those headwinds versus tailwinds. Could the business potentially decelerate with the comparisons you're facing? Or do some of those positive areas more than offset it as you think about the business over the next few quarters here? I know you're not going to give a specific number, but just trying to think how you guys think through that, particularly with some of those longer-term positive top line tailwinds you're thinking of? Does that play out in the near term? Or how long does that take to play out?"

And let me start with your first question or as you mentioned, we raised our long-term sales goal of 3% to 5% back in February. In terms of the timing, that's part of our IGNITE Strategy, which runs through 2025. And Dara, how I see that playing out, as we talked back in February, and we have the same point of view, we expect our sales to be roughly flat in the back half of the year. And that's consistent in Q3. And as we get into FY '22, our expectation is we're going to be by the back half of the year back to our long-term raised sales outlook at 3% to 5%. 
So as you know, we've got some tough comps here for the next 3 quarters. But as we get through those comps by January, we were at this new elevated level. And that's really as we work through the next phase of this pandemic as we see higher vaccination rates, more mobility, we fully expect that we'll see a slowdown in demand for products that's expected. When we get to sort of that new normalized level, we think we're back at this 3% to 5% rate going forward."

I'll start maybe with the big picture on what we're seeing as definitely tailwinds for us, and we mentioned some of this in the script but with a little bit more color.

I'll start maybe with the big picture on what we're seeing as definitely tailwinds for us, and we mentioned some of this in the script but with a little bit more color. We're definitely seeing consumer behavior trend sticky as we look over the mid to long term. We're seeing hygiene continue to be that cornerstone of health for folks. And even as people are getting vaccinated and mobility is starting to increase, we're seeing people embrace those new cleaning behaviors as new routines. And they're both doing that inside and out of the home. 
In the business case, we're still seeing the need for higher disinfection as they welcome people back. But the issue has been depending on the market you're in, and certainly, we're seeing that in the U.S., mobility has not really increased the point where businesses are fully at capacity yet or even open in many cases. So we're seeing that both as a long-term headwind, but as a short-term impact definitely to Q3. And we're looking to the future quarters to see how mobility will improve. 
I think the other things that we continue to see around people taking care of their health and wellness are persisting. We have a new installed base, for example, with Brita with a lot of people who purchased pitchers over the last period, and we're seeing them continue with filter sales in their quest to be healthier and you take on good habits. 
Digital continues to persist, and we think that will be a tailwind for our business as we've invested, as you well know, more in digital marketing than the average in our industry leaning into that trend already. And then, of course, our strong position in e-comm that we've built over many years, and we continue to see that accelerate. And that's up to 14% of our business year-to-date. 
And then the role of home continues to be a tailwind, and that was above our expectations in quarter 3 for sure. But we're seeing people persist even as people have more mobility, people are eating more at home. And that what hasn't really changed at all as people who were working from home during the pandemic are continuing to work from home. So we see that in our impact whether that be on our Kingsford business, on our Hidden Valley Ranch business or our trash business, there's definitely positivity to that stay-at-home trend. So I think all of those are going to be tailwinds as we look to the coming months and in the long term. 
From a headwind perspective, supply chain has continued to be a challenge. And what we've done is gone after a tremendous amount of sales. We're a much bigger company than we were pre-pandemic, and that means that we have increased the complexity in our supply chain. We have a lot more nodes. We have a lot more third parties helping us. 
And then what didn't help this quarter, of course, were the weather disruptions that we experienced that caused quite a few force majeures in our products. And although we were managed -- able to manage through it and deliver our overall commitment from a quarter 3 perspective, it's something we're watching really closely to see any volatility we have. But the supply chain being more expanded continues to be something that we're watching, continues to be something that could be a help or a hinder as we look forward."

So as Kevin highlighted and Lisah highlighted in their scripts, absolutely seeing the inflationary pressure as I think the entire ecosystem is now across our industry and from a retailer perspective as well. And what we have our sights set on is how do we get to that long-term EBIT margin goal we have of 25 to 50 basis points from an accretion perspective. And the way we approach it is very holistic. We're looking across a robust toolbox to address this, things like margin accretive innovation. And we have a terrific innovation program that started at the beginning of this year and is continuing as we launch incremental innovations in Q4, net revenue management, pricing and that will include both list price increases and trade reductions and then, of course, our relentless focus on cost savings. So we're employing that entire toolbox right now across all of our businesses. And we're coming from a place of strength in this. 
Our brands are strong right now. We have never had a higher consumer value measure. Household penetration is strong. We're seeing strong repeats. So we're feeling confident in that. And we're evaluating our ability to take price across all businesses. But I'll tell you, we will be very surgical and targeted in this. We're going category by category because we're -- of course, we're weighing the broader environment, and we want to be measured in that. But I -- the message I want you to hear is we're looking at it very broadly across our portfolio, and what we're really focused on is executing by category with excellence."

And then related to the pricing, you did mention that lower promotions, I think, are going to be a part of how you're getting some net pricing. I think that's what you said. But promos are already at a pretty low level. And so do you anticipate your promotional levels going below peers? 
And then I have a second question. But the general framework there is just Glad pricing risk and just -- did I hear that right that you think promo can actually be a source of pricing, basically implying that maybe you're not looking at list prices in the rest of the portfolio just yet until we get well into fiscal '22? And then I have a follow-up."

So we have confidence in our brands and the strength right now, and that is absolutely inclusive of Glad. And all of the investment that we put in, in terms of incremental advertising, what we put in from an innovation perspective and how consumers have turned to our brands during this time continue to give us confidence in our ability to take pricing. 
I think what we're also seeing this time versus what we saw last time is a broader inflationary environment that really is pretty systemic throughout the industry and what everyone is experiencing. So as you mentioned, we've seen competitors move in categories like Glad. 
I think Glad, in particular, I'll just highlight, we have already come up with that price increase that's effective in July. But given the volatility and the increases we're seeing in the resin market, we are looking at. We'll take even additional pricing in Glad based on what we've seen. So again, we want to be -- let the cost pressures guide us. We're doing this for the mid- to long term, but we're seeing extraordinary circumstances in resin right now that are helping us to go faster on Glad. 
What you should take away on the other brands is not that we are not looking at with price increases. We look at that -- first of all, we do that annually as a company to understand our position. But right at this moment, we're looking at that. But what I want you to hear is the way that we do that across the brands needs to be holistic. So some will include those price increases, others will not. And what you'll hear us apply to every business is cost savings. You'll hear us think about how we can have margin accretive innovation across every business but less price increases will be very targeted on, but again, evaluating across our entire portfolio. 
And I think from an on-shelf and a retailer perspective, we're working on category growth plans with them. And we're lapping a very strong period of growth. And as you think about the lower promotion question, what we're trying to do is get to a more normalized state of promotion. And it's still, although accelerated versus where it was in Q2, it's still well below pre-pandemic levels. And as we lap that growth, there's little incentive to put a bunch of deep discounting out in the system, and we're working on growth plans. So that's how we're thinking about the lower promotions in the context of the environment is that we all have strong growth to lap. And of course, we want to make sure that consumers, that we continue to lean into them and invest behind the tailwinds. And that could mean a lower promotional environment. But we're watching that closely, and again, it will depend on the category. But the overall sentiment would be keeping it as rational as we can and using promotion for what it's intended for, to drive trial and to get consumers to keep updated."

And then the second question is just I think if there was one area which surprised, certainly relative to our model, this quarter was the decline in professional and certainly on a sequential basis. Like I appreciate the cyclicality of the business, but there's also this underlying -- we've heard about all these partnerships that you're signing. And I guess also, International came in a little bit light just relative to what we've seen from a lot of other staples companies this quarter. And so maybe I think underlying the question is just the confidence that these 2 businesses can be contributors to your 3% to 5% longer-term growth outlook. Just maybe any puts and takes that you saw this quarter, which give you confidence that those businesses can be bigger growth drivers going forward?"

On your first question in regard to the impact of pricing, I'd tell you, it's too early for us to start providing perspective. We're right in the middle right now of building our plans for fiscal year '22. And as Linda said, we're going to be looking at a number of different levers in terms of how we're going to work to offset the transportation and commodity cost increases we're seeing. Pricing will certainly be one of those levers, but we'll be looking at a number of others as well. So we'll update you on that one as we get further along with our plans in August. 
In regard to International, just a perspective of International, as you may have seen, volume was down. I think it's worth noting, we feel very good about the progress we're making on our cleaning and disinfecting work. And as Lisah mentioned in her prepared remarks, we continue to expand the number of countries we're introducing wipes into, and we've added 30 countries now. 
Specifically though in the third quarter, one of the challenges we had was in Canada. While we saw growth pretty broadly across our portfolio in Canada, and if you're tracking that region, you may know, they are now in their third lockdown. And in the Canadian market, it's a little different than the U.S., in their lockdowns for items that are deemed nonessential. If you go into a retail outlet, in many cases, those aisles are blocked off where you can't shop them. And so as an example, in third quarter, we grew our cleaning and disinfecting business in Canada, but we saw pretty significant declines in other parts of our business. 
Our Brita business was down over 40%. Our Burt's Bees business is also down by a similar amount because consumers are not able to shop those aisles. Now right now, the lockdown they've announced goes through May 20. So that has some knock-on effect as we move into our fourth quarter. But we expect as we get out of that lockdown, those businesses will rebound. But by and large, we feel very good about the progress on our cleaning and disinfecting portfolio internationally. And then Linda will talk a little bit about our professional business."

And if you think about this, it has to really do with the comparison period. 
So last quarter 3, businesses hadn't shut down by the -- in that point, even though we saw consumer takeaway in the retail side, for the most part, businesses were open. So we had a very strong comparison period to lap. And in contrast to that, this quarter, most businesses continue to remain closed. And you have to recall, too, we have a very established business when it comes to professional. This is not just about the new opportunities, but we've been cleaning these businesses for years and years. It's about 7% of the company before this growing strongly, mid-single to high single digits. And so that really had an impact. 
And I think if you look broader across the professional space, not just ours, they're seeing the same trends broadly in that industry. But if you take a step back, the trends continue. The partners that we've had as we brought on in the new out-of-home space continue to see the benefits of offering their guests a clean and disinfected space branded by Clorox. And we continue to expand those partnerships and bring new ones on. 
The 2-year stack on this business is up 17%, so very strong growth on top of strong growth for many years. And we continue to have conviction in the long term. The reality is consumers need that reassurance that spaces are clean. We know businesses want to provide that to them so they can get back to growing again. And we have a terrific new suite of innovation that we're excited about that's coming in quarter 4, including expanding our electrostatic sprayer business with both new forms and chemistries. So feel really good about the long term of this business. There's a lot of noise in the short term as most of the professional spaces out there have encountered, but no change to our outlook for the future."

And then secondly, on market share, given this has been a supply-related issue, I mean, what's the case that you can make to retailers to get back the space at a point where you feel like the supply problem no longer exists? I mean, is it going to be about marketing support, brand loyalty or basket size, basket size place? So any thoughts around that would be helpful."

But we did anticipate to experience as people became vaccinated, behavior is changing. And we did see that curve move up slightly. So as people got vaccinated, it just happened a little earlier. And frankly, vaccines happened earlier than we had anticipated. So that's normal. We expected that as we go forward. 
But the key takeaway is versus pre-pandemic levels, cleaning behaviors are still significantly elevated. And we continue to expect them to be into the future. And we're hearing that from consumers. We're seeing that in their buying habits and continue to feel confident about our ability to -- for these growth areas in cleaning and disinfecting to get us to our 3% to 5% growth rate moving forward. 
I think as it particularly comes to market share, just to be really clear, we are not happy. Whether it be supply related, et cetera, we want to grow share. And that is our goal, and we want to do that over the mid- to long term. This really does have -- it's primarily driven with supply, particularly in cleaning and disinfecting. Not only did we have the weather-related issues. But as we talked about, the more that we expand our supply chain, the more nodes that it has, the more risk it introduces. And that really impacted our ability to lap a very, very strong period that, of course, included the depletion of all the inventory across the system last quarter 3. 
As we look forward to supply though, we're optimistic. We've made good progress, and we anticipate substantial improvement in the next 4 months. And we plan to be in stock on most businesses in cleaning, including wipes by the end of Q1. And what consumers are already experiencing is better than what they've experienced for the months' premium to that. They're going to the shelf and they're finding something from Clorox, which is good to see.  And then we anticipate being fully in stock across our Cleaning business by the end of Q2. So that includes some things like sprays and some of the other items that are still supply constrained.  When it comes to market share moving forward, supply is going to help, but the other thing is innovation. And we have a terrific suite of innovation in quarter 4 that retailers are really excited about. And that includes reintroducing things that we had to put on pause. Scentiva, that was a large growth platform for us prior to the pandemic, we are starting to ship that again. Compostable wipes are also back in market again. And we know they had a strong start prior to the pandemic, and we'd expect them to continue. 
And then we're also going to be expanding our disinfecting floor mopping business that we had started right at the beginning of the pandemic. And we expect broad distribution on that. In addition, we're launching brand-new to the space innovations, including paper towel wipes, a brand-new Clorox non-bleach all-purpose cleaner and then building off of our electrostatic business that's already at over $100 million in sales and launching new forms and new chemistries kind of brand-new to the market. So a great suite of innovation that we're working with retailers on, and that's what we're focused on: innovation and growing the category, and that's resonated really well."

The underperformance is related to what we bought. So channel headwinds have been a big component of that. Natural went from plus 8% at the time we bought it to a headwind at negative 5%. And that's only accelerated, given the pandemic and what we're seeing in retail consolidation. 
We're also very heavily weighted in probiotics, and that category has been fragmented. It slowed down, given the massive amount of people who've been launching probiotics in other forms, in food, et cetera, and then certainly higher competition as people have entered that attractive space. And then just given the size of the brands that we bought, we realize it's going to take a longer time and more investment to get there. 
So what do we do looking to the future? It starts with the fact that we have really good conviction in the strength of the category and the tailwinds that we see from a consumer perspective. Those remain very strong. People are continuing to do things to take care of their health and wellness, and vitamins and supplements are absolutely part of that. 
So with that, I'll give you what I can talk about in the strategy at a high level, and we'll welcome talking about more detail coming up in the future. But what we're really focused on is first, making sure that we have the right category knowledge, and we feel great about that. We have a better understanding of how the category works and how we need to operate with those small brands in it. We've hired new industry talent that has a lot of experience in this space, and they've helped us to get clear on that. And we've refreshed our strategy and particularly around our portfolio and how we win with those brands moving forward. 
And so with that, and I know, Nik, you probably want more details on that, but we'll have more to share later. We fully expect to be able to get to company accretive sales and profit over the long term. But we've built in a slow ramp-up period as we think about that because it's going to take some time to do what we plan to do on these brands and get to a place where they're delivering that type of accretive growth for us as a company."

I'm assuming that's fiscal '22 consideration at this point. I'm curious because, as you know, it will mark about 6 months that your large competitor took pricing from what I understand. Is that the strategy now to recover some of that share? And any other categories that -- I appreciate that you don't want to come across as being opportunistic. And I know knowing from the benefit that you had from your strong brands and everything to come across as taking price in the middle of pandemic, but now that we are hopefully coming through high vaccination rates, so when do you think is the time to actually take some of the other categories that are also impacted by transportation cost pressures and commodities to be considered to be taking pricing. 
And one -- also before you can answer. But just so before, the -- as far as I understood, like you think that commentary about having the supply chain normalized and having the cleaning products by -- fully on shelf by the end of the calendar second quarter, would we expect also that international and professional, the professional business will be normalized? So that's only the cleaning and you still have the work to do to recover share and capacity on these other segments?"

And that we're still contemplating, and we don't have news to share on timing on that. But the round that we just announced will be effective in July, and then it will pass through. And we'll see retailers change prices on shelf as they do that. 
As it relates to your broader comment on pricing, that really is category specific, and it has to do with the timing. These businesses have different seasonal aspects to them. They have different promotional plans. They have different innovation plans. And so I don't have any more to share on timing on any of those categories, but I just want you to take away that we are looking at it across every category. We -- but we will be doing this category by category, and it really has to do with those dynamics that we're experiencing and of course, the broader plan. 
And I also want you to take away what we are absolutely doing on every category right now is cost savings, and we're going back. We're pleased to be on track to deliver our cost savings target for the year. And we're looking at what other places could we plus that up across all of our businesses. And then, of course, innovation is the same. But as we have more news on pricing, we'll share it. But at this point, it's Glad and news that we're looking at, would there be additional action we'd want to take on Glad, given what we're seeing in resin. 
And then as your question on supply chain, professional has some shared supply chain as does a small portion of international with our U.S. retail cleaning business, but they also have components that are completely separate. But they are largely expected to recover on the same timing that we have from retail. Although international, I would say, at this point, particularly with wipes, given we have a dedicated supply chain, we're not at a point that we're constrained in the vast majority of our International businesses because of that dedicated supply chain."

To what degree are you worried about the risk of breaking that trend? Or do you feel like you have to be careful about maybe there's an opportunity that can be lost if too much pricing is taken?

When we look at the strength of our brands, we always focus on consumer value as the measure we look at to determine the strength of our brands and our ability to take pricing because, of course, consumer value is composed of the strength of the brand that we have. It's comprised of the product and how people experience that versus competitive products. And of course, pricing is a function of that as well. And we're looking at that triangle that, that forms to say what is the right mix by category, by subsegment to deliver that right value for consumers. And we're always trying to optimize that. So we take that into account as we think about it. 
Given the fact that we have higher consumer value than we've ever had since we began measuring it, that implies the strength of our brands that they have ability to take price. And as we strengthen our innovation program, as we've leaned in to spend 11% behind our brands this year and keep them strong, that was one of the questions we got a lot of is why would you invest during a time when people want your brands already. And it was about building that brand strength and equity over the long term so that we have ability to introduce them to new products as they demand it and of course, take pricing as we need to. 
So we're taking that into account. I would say, regardless of pricing, these consumer behaviors are here to stay. Consumers have absolutely shown a willingness to pay during this time to keep themselves safe and well through all of their behaviors, whether that be cleaning, drinking more water, et cetera. And also as they start to eat at home, we've seen lots of trends around consumers having meal experiences. They've invested in grills, and they've invested in that long-term behavior. So we feel really good about our ability to do both, which is continue to take advantage of the trends that we're seeing, but also price where it's appropriate to recover margin."

I think if you look -- if you -- maybe I'll take a step back and talk about what we're seeing overall and what we've seen in the past because I think we're operating from a really strong base. I'm not sure how clear this was in the past. If you take a step back and look at our retail Cleaning business, pre-pandemic, that was a place of strength for us. We were growing mid-single digits in both top line and bottom line in the retail cleaning business for a number of years. So if you look at the 5-year CAGR pre-pandemic, that was mid-single digits. So we were starting from a place of strength. And we see that continuing as we move to the future, and we see building off of that. 
So if that gives you an idea of what we're thinking about, it will be above the company average is what we're anticipating, given the fact that it's a place where consumer tailwinds are working where we think innovation is going to play a really big role because consumer needs have changed.

On Q4, we don't provide quarterly guidance, but what I can share with you is as we said, for the full year, we expect our gross margin to be down. For me, that's likely about 100 bps on the full year basis. And as we mentioned, back in February, my expectation is it would be down to a lesser degree. As we've highlighted, what's really changed for us is, while transportation continues to be a challenging market for us, it's really resin that had the biggest impact really driven by the ice storm we saw back in February. 
When we talked back in February during our previous earnings call, I had anticipated about 150 bps headwind from commodities in the back half of the year. I think that's going to be closer to 200 bps now in the back half. And you saw in Q3 in our attachments we provided, about 170 bps in Q3. I think it will be higher in Q4. And I think it will probably peak in the front half of fiscal year '22, and then we'll start to see some softening. And so I think that's how it's going to play out this year in the near term. 
And then your longer-term question on margin recovery, Linda just mentioned it. We are committed to growing EBIT margins 25 to 50 bps over the long term. And so we're going to continue to aggressively work towards that goal. And as part of that is the actions we're talking about now as it relates to recovering these cost increases. Pricing being one element of that but we're going to be leaning into cost savings in many other areas as well. We'll work to recover margin. 
And then maybe last comment, Steve, that might be helpful. If I provide a broader perspective, if you think about our financial performance, where we were before the pandemic at the end of fiscal year '19 and where we're likely in this year, on a 2-year stack basis, that's about a 100 bps increase in gross margin. And so we'll certainly be challenged this quarter and next quarter. 
If I take a long-term view, we've improved the margins of the company about 100 bps over the last 2 years. And then as I said earlier, our goal is by the time we get to the back half of fiscal year '22, we are delivering 3% to 5% sales growth. We're expanding margins. We're delivering earnings growth. So hopefully, that gives you some perspective on our desire to quickly move through this challenging environment, but make sure we're taking the necessary actions to put us on track for our long-term sales and profit goals in the back half of '22."

And then I did just want to follow-up one more question on market shares. And I know that Nielsen is far from perfect, particularly with your strong shares in club and the quick gains you've made in e-commerce over time. But Nielsen does measure something. 
And when we look at Nielsen, it looks like your share in spray cleaners and in wipes is not just down this year, but is down -- if I looked back pre-pandemic, that your shares were down pretty considerably, particularly in the spray cleaning category. So I just would like some further perspective there on whether or not there's been some channel prioritization dynamics, whether or not in hindsight, there's a sense that maybe you could have invested more and been more proactive in cleaning historically? Because it feels to me like, again, just looking at the Nielsen and knowing it's imprecise, there's a bit of a hole to dig out of on share that's not really related to during the pandemic supply constraints."

Thanks for the question and try to provide some clarity on this one because I know it's really complex. Maybe taking a step back would help on this one just to get clear on what we experienced in cleaning and what we think",554,"Hey, Lauren, I'll take that one. Thanks for the question and try to provide some clarity on this one because I know it's really complex. Maybe taking a step back would help on this one just to get clear on what we experienced in cleaning and what we think we drove pre-pandemic, what we're seeing now, which again we're not satisfied with and then how we see this playing out over the coming months and years as we get to a more normalized state. 
So first, big picture, if we step back and look at our retail Cleaning business, it's actually been a great area of strength for us. I mentioned a little earlier that we had strong growth. So if you look at the 5-year CAGR pre-pandemic, we grew that business mid-single digits, both top and bottom line. And that corresponded to an overall share increase in home care of 2 points from fiscal year '13 through '19. So that was something that we've been investing in. 
We had been really trying to expand the Clorox brand. We had a strong focus on innovation. We have launched Scentiva during that time. We had done improvements on a broad range of our portfolio. So it's been a nice area of strength for us. I think as you dive into the individual segments, Lauren, you do get to what you said, which is there are ups and downs. And sprays is an incredibly complex, fragmented category. So while we were winning in a lot of the particular segments that we are strong in, it could be true that in other ones, we weren't. And we have a very strong spray business, to your point, outside of track channels, which is about 50% of our business. So -- in aggregate. 
So we -- I feel like we walked into this pandemic in a strong way from a Clorox perspective. There's always work to be done in individual segments, as you highlighted. But overall, we were winning in Home Care. And as we look to the future, I think a lot of those elements are going to continue to resonate, but we're going to ramp them up. 
One, the strength of that Clorox brand. It's why we've invested so much this year behind that and increased the spending. We're on track to spend across the company another $125 million in advertising and sales promotion this year, why we've ramped up innovation. And I mentioned the innovations that are worth repeating, reintroducing Scentiva, compostable wipes are back on shelf, disinfecting floor mop costs, which is a brand-new incremental category for us to compete in, having new offerings in Clorox sprays that aren't bleach, and that's a first for us as well as paper towel wipes and then broadly expanding against our new electrostatic business that we really created from nothing a number of years ago with some partnership. 
So I feel terrific about what we have in place to continue to meet consumer needs. I am not happy, Lauren, with where we are share-wise. None of us are, but we feel confident in our ability to get back into that share growth as supply continues, again, which is the majority of the issue. But we're laser-focused on that consumer value metric, innovation and investing behind the Clorox brand."

But -- so for your outlook now, specifically, advertising and marketing, still 11% of sales, including 12% in the back half of the year. I think as you guys are well aware, both of those are historical highs as far as I have going back, this is a decade. So on a full year basis, on a 6-month basis, was there any thought at all about pulling back as commodity costs move higher? I suspect the answer is not a lot, given a lot of the discussion around market share, but maybe you can comment on that. 
And then just confidence on ROI behind the spend, given a lot of the volatility that exists around consumption, et cetera. The context here, understanding supply chain constraints have been a problem and one that you're trying to address, but I'm sure the hope would be in principle, that market share would be in a better place with advertising and marketing your historical levels. That's probably not going out of much of a limb. 
And then maybe just sort of tying this up, longer term, is 11% the right number? We don't have to go back very far. And it was 9% of sales. Is it possible this comes in, it comes back to 9%, which is not sort of permanently in the P&L. So maybe some comments there, which I suspect you're not making that sort of decision in a vacuum. It's going to be where is market share and whether you're satisfied with it. But not to belabor this because I feel like we've spoken on a lot of it, but anything you feel in that would be incremental would be helpful."

And we wanted to create that loyal consumer base moving forward. And we wanted to give them the right product information that they needed during such a trying time for everybody, but also give them new solutions as people had different challenges to solve. And innovation and advertising play a really important role in that. 
So for this year, we are on track to spend 11% as you highlighted, and we have a strong spend coming up here in Q4. And that is behind the new innovations that we've launched. And I think you'll recall probably from previous conversations that our goal was to double the amount of advertising we spent on innovation this year to welcome people into those new product experiences and create loyalty and trial. 
As we look forward -- and let me comment on ROI before I say we move forward. That's something that we're tracking real time and getting information and insights on. And what I can say is the ROI continues to be very strong, and that's why we continue to spend, and we're seeing it translate into results from a consumer-metric perspective. So continue to have incredibly high household penetration. We have household penetration gains across a number of our categories. 
We're seeing loyalty strengthen. So retention rates growing, repeat rates growing on both core users and new users. We're seeing consumers buying larger quantities more often. So all of the things that we would attribute to, to long-term consumer metrics that show the health of the brand, the advertising drives, we're seeing that, not only just the strong ROI, but those metrics increase that are important to us to talk about loyalty. 
As we move forward, we don't have a prescribed number, whether it be 10%, 11%. But what I can say is we're committed to investing in our brands. And we'll continue to optimize what that right level of spending is depending on exactly like you highlighted, market shares, depending on the innovation programs we have. But what you should hear from us is we will continue to invest in our brands. And we'll -- as we update and give you a perspective for '22 and beyond, we'll communicate what that exact number looks like. But you heard our continued commitment to advertising as a strong lever to help us get to our 3% to 5% over the long term."

Thank you for joining us. Fiscal '21 was an extraordinary year for Clorox, with the pandemic putting us through the ultimate test of volatility, including rapid changes in consumer demand and significant cost inflation",1591,"Thank you, Lisah. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us. 
Fiscal '21 was an extraordinary year for Clorox, with the pandemic putting us through the ultimate test of volatility, including rapid changes in consumer demand and significant cost inflation, which was reflected in our Q4 results. Despite the complexities we faced, we delivered 9% sales growth for the fiscal year on a reported and organic basis, reflecting growth in all 4 reportable segments. This was on top of the reported 8% increase we delivered in fiscal '20. On a 2-year stack basis, we delivered 17% sales growth. 
With rising cost pressures, we experienced declines in gross margin, particularly in Q4, resulting in a decrease of 200 basis points for the fiscal year, which we will discuss in more detail. 
Fiscal year '21 adjusted EPS decreased 2% to $7.25. Recognizing the immediate priorities before us, I'd like to reinforce what matters most: long-term profitable growth. With a business that's significantly larger than before the pandemic and a portfolio of trusted brands exposed to more tailwinds, we have clarity in our strategic imperatives, and I have every confidence in our ability to continue delivering long-term value creation for our shareholders. 
When I look at fiscal '21, our performance has shown the strength of our people, brands and products as well as the resilience of our category as we work tirelessly to supply consumers with products across our portfolio. As a result, we experienced significant growth in demand and strengthened our position amongst global consumers, with strong household penetration supported by higher repeat rates across new and existing users. 
The last 12 months have also demonstrated the need to accelerate our IGNITE Strategy to address near-term headwinds and capitalize on long-term opportunities. The industry environment remains dynamic with significant inflationary pressure and continuing uncertainty. In the face of these conditions, our top priority is strong execution to mitigate the impact of elevated cost headwinds and continue to improve market share. 
The pandemic has also highlighted areas where additional investments can help us be as agile as possible in the future. We are clear on the opportunities ahead of us to differentiate Clorox and build a stronger, more resilient and more profitable company. This includes driving our growth runways and making investments to enhance our digital capabilities and drive productivity improvements, which I will discuss shortly. We are confident that strong execution of our IGNITE Strategy will enable us to achieve our 3% to 5% long-term sales target and deliver long-term shareholder value. 
Before I discuss Q4 and our progress against our strategy, I'd like to thank our Clorox teammates around the world for everything they've accomplished over the past year as well as their commitment and dedication to serving people and communities around the world. 
For Q4, faster-than-expected moderating demand for cleaning and disinfecting products had a pronounced impact on sales growth as we move through the peak of the pandemic and lapped the unprecedented demand we experienced last year. The magnitude of this quarter's gross margin contraction was a result of faster-than-expected sales moderation, acceleration of inflationary headwinds and improvements in supply, which led to broader product assortment, including the reintroduction of value packs. I'll discuss shortly the actions we're taking to address these headwinds. 
Now let me share a few highlights of our progress on our IGNITE Strategy. First, with fuel growth being a critical focus to help address elevated cost pressures and ensure the long-term health of our brands, I'm pleased we delivered over $120 million in cost savings in the fiscal year, surpassing our annual target. 
Second, we made strong progress on our 2025 goal to now 100 million people, crossing the halfway mark to our goal this fiscal year. Our higher investment in personalization has led to significantly improved ROI. It has been one of the contributors to increasingly strong payouts, driving our confidence and continued investments in our brands. 
Third, with innovation at the heart of our strategy, we doubled our innovation investments in fiscal '21, and new products were a bigger contributor to our top line, which we expect to continue in fiscal '22. 
Next, as consumers have increased their digital usage during the pandemic, we leaned into digital marketing and commerce, resulting in our e-commerce business nearly doubling in the last 2 years, which today represents about 13% of total company sales. 
Finally, we continue to make progress on our ESG goals. For example, we advanced our commitment to climate action and submitted our proposal on science-based targets for our operations and Scope 3 emissions to the science-based target initiative in June. And as a people-centric company, we continue to focus on the well-being of our teammates and our values-based inclusive culture. I'm particularly proud that during this trying year, we achieved our best safety score in recorded history with a recordable incident rate of 0.26, significantly lower than the 3.3 industry average. 
I'm also pleased that in fiscal '21, we continue to have high employee engagement of 87%, putting us at the top quartile of Fortune 500 companies. 
Now let me turn to fiscal '22. We expect inflationary pressure to persist, along with continued moderating demand as we lap COVID-19-related demand surges in the first half of fiscal '21. While this is reflected in our fiscal '22 outlook, which Kevin will discuss, by the second half of the year, we expect to be within the lower end of the range of our long-term sales targets. Like others in our industry and beyond, we are experiencing significant increases in input and transportation costs across all categories in our portfolio, which have accelerated since Q3. And we're holistically and dynamically managing this with a laser focus on [indiscernible]. We implemented pricing on Glad and announced actions on our Food, Cleaning and International businesses. This represents about 50% of our portfolio. 
We're also pursuing pricing in additional parts of our portfolio, which we'll communicate at the right time. Based on the constructive conversations we're having with our retail partners and importantly, the strength of our brands, we feel confident about our ability to execute our pricing plans. In addition, we will continue to drive our hallmark cost savings program. We expect sequential gross margin improvements as we progress through fiscal '22, with our assumption for gross margin expansion by Q4. 
In terms of market share, as we've discussed previously, we have experienced some declines due to supply challenges, but have made notable progress. With strong investments in internal and external production capacity, including additional manufacturing lines and a significant expansion of our production team, in June, we achieved our highest case fill rates since the start of the pandemic. I'm pleased to see that in the latest 13-week data ending July 17, we saw market share gains in 7 out of 9 businesses. Certainly, we recognize there's more work to do in parts of the portfolio, such as Glad Trash, and we have adjusted our plans to drive market share improvements over time. Despite these near-term headwinds, we remain focused on our long-term priorities rooted in our IGNITE Strategy to deliver our long-term growth aspirations. 
While some pandemic-related behaviors may revert over the next 12 months, we continue to believe there's been a shift in behaviors that will advantage Clorox longer term, including a focus on health, wellness and hygiene, more time at home, as well as increased adoption of e-commerce and digital platforms. 
The pandemic also revealed the urgency to upgrade our digital infrastructure and capabilities. Last year, I brought in Chief Information and Enterprise Analytics Officer, Chao Banks, who has extensive experience in business-driven digital transformation, to conduct a fresh assessment of our own program that was already underway before the pandemic. With that assessment now complete, we are accelerating our transformation through planned investments of about $500 million over the next 5 years to enhance our digital capabilities and drive productivity improvements, including replacing our ERP. This will enhance our supply chain to better position Clorox to meet customer needs, yield efficiencies and support our digital commerce, innovation and brand-building efforts. 
Prior to the pandemic, we were already adapting our business to differentiate Clorox from a digital perspective. We'll continue to invest in e-commerce and digital marketing across our portfolio, leveraging data-driven insights to engage with consumers in more relevant ways. 
Moving to innovation. Innovation continues to be a key focus area for me and our new Chief Growth Officer, Tony Matta, who joined last October. Tony has more than 20 years of brand-building experience with leading consumer companies. Ensuring we have stickier innovation, delivering multiyear value, we're driving lasting new product platforms, such as Fresh Step Clean Paws and SenTiva, which continue to grow. In addition, we're extending innovation by leveraging external partners to create new revenue streams. 
We're continuing to support our brands, especially margin-accretive innovation with disciplined high ROI advertising and sales promotion investments to build and strengthen consumer loyalty. We also remain very focused on driving our growth runways to build Clorox into a global cleaning and disinfecting brand. We are still in the early stages of a multiyear journey, but continue to believe they can become a meaningful contributor to growth longer term. 
And as we execute on all these initiatives, we will continue to drive the strategic link between our societal impacts and long-term value creation as we live our purpose and keep our ESG commitments front and center in our decision-making every day. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Lisah to review our business unit performance."

In Health and Wellness, Q4 sales decreased 17% for the quarter, while full year sales were up 8%, with growth across all businesses. On a 2-year stack basis, Q4 sales grew 16% and full year sales grew 22%. 
In Cleaning, sales were down by double digits compared to double-digit growth in the year-ago quarter, primarily due to the deceleration of demand across various cleaning and disinfecting products. On a full year basis, Cleaning sales grew behind a strong front half performance. While demand fell faster than anticipated, it remains higher than it was pre-pandemic with strong repeat rates among new buyers. Importantly, our supply and product assortment are almost fully restored, which is reflected in our market share improvement, especially in wipes and sprays. 
As consumer demand migrated to more preferred forms and value packs, we also saw a negative impact to price/mix, which we expect to continue over the next few quarters. Going forward, we'll be focused on strengthening our merchandising activities, especially for the back-to-school period. 
Sales in Professional Products were down by double digits versus year-ago period when we experienced double-digit growth. For the full year, Professional Products sales were up by double digits, fueled by an exceptional front-half performance. Demand started moderating in Q3 and continued into Q4 as customers work through high inventory levels, especially of Clorox T 360 electrostatic sprayers. In the short term, we expect results will continue to be volatile as we lap periods with unprecedented demand. Longer term, this business continues to be a strategic growth area for the company. 
As part of our initiative to expand into new channels, we continue to add to our roster of Autohome partnerships, including Live Nation, the world's leading live events company. 
Lastly, within the Health and Wellness segment, our Vitamins, Minerals and Supplements business increased by double digits this quarter, after lapping a double-digit decrease caused by a supply disruption related to COVID-19. 
For the full year, sales were up as well. Sales growth for the quarter was driven by a strong performance in the food, drug and mass channel and e-commerce. 
Turning to the Household segment. Q4 sales were down 8%. Full year sales grew 10%, with growth across all 3 businesses. On a 2-year stack basis, Q4 sales grew 8%, and full year sales grew 12%. Glad sales decreased by double digits in Q4, lapping strong double-digit growth in the year-ago quarter, which was impacted by initial stockpiling. For the full year, sales were up. Our efforts going forward are focused on managing base with strong inflationary headwinds we're facing. And as Linda mentioned, we still have more work to do in this business to restore market share. 
Growing sales decreased by double digits in Q4 as demand started moderating after 4 consecutive quarters of strong double-digit growth. For the full year, sales grew by double digits, fueled by very strong consumption overall. Our focus on expanding distribution of our latest innovation, Kingsford Pellets, continued with a nationwide launch, building on the product's initial success, while we're also introducing signature flavors made with 100% real spices that will be available in select retailers before Labor Day as we gear up for the 2022 [ grilling ] season. This innovation is intended to help our business continue building consumption among multi-collateral millennials and other heavy growers. 
Cat Litter sales grew by double digits in Q4, driven by continued strong consumption. For the full year, litter sales also grew. The result reflected strength in e-commerce, with Fresh Step becoming the #1 brand online for the first time and positive overall category trends, boosted by record pet adoptions during the pandemic. Going forward, we're excited about our latest innovation, Fresh Step Outstretch Litter, which lasts 50% longer than regular litter, thanks to patent-pending technology. 
In our Lifestyle segment, sales were down 3% and full year sales grew 6%. On a 2-year stack basis, Q4 sales grew 13%, and full year sales grew 16%. Brita sales were down as demand continued to moderate from an extended period of elevated consumption. Full year sales grew on top of double-digit growth in the prior year. Despite the deceleration in Q4, business fundamentals are strong, especially now that our supply is mostly restored. We're excited about the strong merchandising program we've put in place this year, including the largest back-to-college event ever for the brand. 
The Food business was down, primarily due to lower shipments of Hidden Valley Ranch bottle dressings, with consumption moderating as consumer mobility improved. Full year sales were up by double digits, on top of double-digit growth in the prior year. The consumer fundamentals for this business are strong with the brand growing market share and household penetration. 
Bert's feed sales increased by double digits this quarter as overall category consumption begin to recover. Full year sales were down as category consumption was negatively impacted by store closures, mask mandate and stay-at-home measures. We expect this business to continue to recover as people begin returning to their pre-pandemic shopping patterns and consumer mobility keeps improving. We'll build on that momentum with our new Lips To Love campaign supported by a strong innovation pipeline. 
Lastly, turning to International. Q4 sales grew 5%, reflecting the combined impact of the Saudi JV acquisition and benefit of price increases, partially offset by lower shipments due to the moderating demand after a period of elevated consumption. Extended lockdowns in Canada also contributed to the decrease in shipments. The results are on top of 12% growth in the year-ago period when we saw elevated consumption across our portfolio during the early stages of the pandemic. 
Importantly, we continue to expand our global disinfecting wipes business, building on the dedicated international supply chain that was developed in 5 months and are making progress launching our Clorox Expert disinfecting wipes in existing countries as well as new markets. For the full year, sales increased 14%, reflecting very strong growth for the majority of the year before moderating in Q4. On a 2-year stack basis, Q4 sales grew 17%, and full year sales grew 19%. 
Now I'll turn it over to Kevin, who will discuss Q4 and full year financial results for FY '21 as well as our outlook for FY '22."
89450,1672644685,2360995,"The Clorox Company, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2021",2021-08-03,"Earnings Calls","The Clorox Company","Executives","Thank you, Lisah, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As Linda mentioned, for fiscal year '21, we delivered 9% sales growth on top of 8% sales growth in fiscal year '20. While this is lower than we anticipated in our outlook, we feel good about",1490,"Thank you, Lisah, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As Linda mentioned, for fiscal year '21, we delivered 9% sales growth on top of 8% sales growth in fiscal year '20. While this is lower than we anticipated in our outlook, we feel good about delivering another strong sales year. Of course, we continue to manage through an extremely challenging cost environment, which impacted our fiscal year margins and earnings. Importantly, we delivered another year of strong cash flow, which came in at $1.3 billion compared to a record $1.5 billion for fiscal year '20. I'm pleased our strong cash flow allowed us to return almost $1.5 billion to our shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase program, representing an increase of about 90% in cash returned to shareholders versus fiscal year '20. 
Before I review our Q4 results, I wanted to highlight a $28 million noncash charge we booked in Q4 related to a third-party supplier for our Professional Products business. As we have shared previously, during the height of the pandemic, we worked with a number of third-party suppliers to support us in addressing unprecedented demand in the consumer and professional spaces. We are reducing our reliance on 1 of these suppliers. And as a result, we took a charge in the fourth quarter. Important to note, this noncash charge is included in our reported EPS and excluded from our Q4 adjusted EPS as it represents a nonrecurring item. 
Turning to our fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter sales decreased 9% in comparison to a 22% increase in the year-ago quarter, delivering a 2-year stack of 13% sales growth. Our sales results reflect an 8% decline in organic volume and 2 points of unfavorable price/mix, primarily in our Health and Wellness segment, as supply improvements resulted in a broader product assortment, including the reintroduction of value packs. On an organic basis, fourth quarter sales declined 10%. Fourth quarter sales were lower than expected, primarily in our Health and Wellness segment, as demand for cleaning and disinfecting products moderated more rapidly than we had previously anticipated. While the cleaning and disinfecting category continues to moderate, we're pleased to see improving share as we've increased our ability to supply. 
Gross margin for the quarter decreased 970 basis points to 37.1% compared to 46.8% in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin results were lower than anticipated, largely driven by higher input costs and lower sales. The year-over-year change in Q4 gross margin was primarily driven by lower sales, resulting in lower manufacturing fixed cost absorption as well as a significant cost headwinds, driving about 290 basis points of higher commodity costs, 180 basis points of increased transportation costs as well as 130 basis points of unfavorable mix. Our fourth quarter gross margin also includes about 70 basis points of negative impact from the noncash charge I just mentioned. These margin headwinds were partially offset by about 90 basis points of cost savings and 50 basis points of benefit from our pricing actions in our International division. 
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales came in at 14.4% compared to 14.1% in the year-ago quarter. Advertising and sales promotion investment levels as a percentage of sales came in at about 12%, with U.S. spending at about 14% of sales. Strong investments in Q4 supported our back-half innovation program and reflected our continued focus on building loyalty among new consumers. 
Our fourth quarter effective tax rate was 0%, primarily driven by a tax benefit from exiting of a small foreign subsidiary, which was mostly offset by the charge we took to pretax book income associated with this decision as well as favorable return to provision adjustments. On a full year basis, our effective tax rate was 20%. Net of all these factors, adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter came in at $0.95 versus $2.41 in the year-ago quarter, a decline of 61%. 
Before I review the details of our outlook, let me provide perspective on the strategic investment Linda discussed. We are planning to invest about $500 million over the next 5 years to enhance our digital capabilities and drive productivity improvements, including the replacement of our ERP. In fiscal year '22, we plan to invest about $90 million in operating and capital expenditures, with about $55 million impacting our P&L and the remainder reflected in our balance sheet. Beginning in Q1 and going forward, our adjusted EPS will exclude the portion of the $500 million investment that flows through our P&L to provide better insights into our underlying operating performance of our business. 
Now turning to our fiscal year '22 outlook. We anticipate fiscal year sales to be down 2% to 6%, reflecting ongoing demand moderation, primarily in our cleaning and disinfecting products in the front half of the fiscal year, in addition to the unfavorable mix and higher trade spending as we move to a more normalized supply and promotional environment. We assume these factors will be partially offset by the pricing actions we're taking broadly across our portfolio. 
Organic sales are expected to be down 2% to 6% as well. We expect front half sales to decline high single to low double digits as we lap 27% growth in the front half of fiscal year '21, during the height of the pandemic. Additionally, we expect Q1 sales to decline low double digits. As we move to the back half of the year, we expect to return to the lower end of our long-term sales growth target. Of course, we continue to operate in a dynamic and uncertain environment, which could impact our outlook. 
We anticipate fiscal year gross margin to be down 300 to 400 basis points due to our assumption for significant ongoing headwinds from elevated commodity and transportation costs, which represent nearly $300 million in year-over-year cost increases. We expect these headwinds to be more pronounced in the front half of the year, particularly in Q1, as we expect key commodity cost increases to reduce gross margin by about 500 basis points, driving our assumption for Q1 gross margin to decline 1,100 to 1,300 basis points. 
For perspective, in Q1, we are lapping a modern gross margin [ of 48% ], reflecting over 400 basis points of favorable operating leverage on 27% sales growth in the year-ago quarter. As we mentioned in our press release, we expect sequential improvement for gross margin over the course of fiscal year '22, with the assumption for gross margin expansion in Q4. This is based on our assumption that cost inflation will begin to moderate, and it will see the benefits from mitigating actions flow more fully through our P&L. 
We expect fiscal year selling and administrative expenses to be about 15% of sales, which includes about 1 point of impact related to our investment to enhance our digital capabilities. Additionally, we anticipate fiscal year advertising spending to be about 10% of sales, reflecting our ongoing commitment to invest buying our brands and build market share. We expect our fiscal year tax rate to be about 22% to 23%. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects lapping several onetime benefits in the prior fiscal year. Net of these factors, we anticipate fiscal year adjusted EPS to be between $5.40 to $5.70. 
As we start fiscal year '22, I'd like to emphasize our priority to address elevated cost pressures from both commodities and transportation throughout the fiscal year. We are focused on executing the pricing actions we discussed today. We've implemented our announced price increase on our bags and wraps and are taking pricing on our Food, Cleaning and International businesses. This represents about 50% of our portfolio. 
We are also pursuing pricing in additional parts of our portfolio, which we'll announce at a later date. While it's still early, we are confident in our ability to price, given the strength of our brand and the constructive conversations we're having with retailers. 
Consistent with our next strategy, we're addressing short-term headwinds head-on, with an eye on the long-term health of our business. We will continue to invest in our brands, including meaningful innovation to drive differentiation, which will help us continue to drive superior consumer value. We are leaning into our cost savings program and productivity initiatives to help address ongoing cost pressures. And we're accelerating investments in our digital transformation to drive increased capabilities, lower costs across our supply chain and improve innovation efforts and our brand engagement activities. 
And finally, as Linda mentioned, our business is significantly larger than before the pandemic, and we're well positioned for the future. Our global portfolio of trusted brands is more relevant than ever, and we're positioning ourselves to make the most of the changing consumer trends we see. We have confidence in our strategic plans and our ability to execute to enable us to continue to create long-term value for our shareholders. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Linda."

We've heard the IGNITE Strategy has been working in the last couple of years. We've heard historically that you're ahead of the curve and competition on the e-commerce side from you guys and happy with innovation progress. So it sounds like there was a review when you took over, Linda, and obviously Chao Ming's appointment. But I'm sure you were focused on these areas before also. So was this a surprise? How did it develop, particularly given it's such a large amount? And then as we think about the payback, is this what's necessary to get back to long-term goals at some point? In theory, sometimes a big spending program can yield payback above and beyond prior goals. I'm assuming at this point, it's more to help return to prior long-term goals. And then I also have a second question on gross margins, if I can come back."

So why don't we start with your first question, why necessary now? And what's clear is the pandemic has absolutely accelerated consumer digital behaviors in a way that we never contemplated during our IGNITE Strategy. And certainly, we saw that as a key consumer tailwind for us as we pend that strategy, but we've seen such a rapid movement online by consumers, both in the e-commerce space and it's certainly in the marketing consumption space, that we really knew we needed to take a step back and look at the program that we had in place and ensure that it was sufficient for us to deliver as we move forward and what we look to as across the entire operation. 
And I think the other thing that I would note is our challenges in fiscal year '21, managing the type of volatility that we haven't been exposed to in the past, underscore the urgency to upgrade that digital infrastructure and capabilities. But what I want to make clear is this is really not about today. This is about maintaining momentum as we come out of our IGNITE Strategy period. And you'll see the bulk of the value of this comes after our IGNITE Strategy period, so 2025 and beyond. This will allow us to have really real-time access to data and information that will help our entire operation move more efficiently and better serve consumer and customer needs. 
So we're making first investment in our ERP, which is the foundation and infrastructure of all of these changes, and that's needed and accelerated to build these digital capabilities. We'll have better supply chain visibility across all parts of the supply chain with real-time data, which will improve things like procurement and supply planning. It will further enhance the work that you already referenced that we've done on digital and e-commerce and further enhance our ability to do personalization and get more out of that goal and will help us on innovation. 
So really what this was about was the change in circumstances in the environment, a rapid change in consumer behavior that couldn't have been predicted before the pandemic. And we're leaning in. And this is really about building a stronger company with more momentum coming out of the strategy period."

How we should think about that in terms of timing and magnitude over time? And then second, Kevin, on gross margins, when you include the guidance for fiscal 2020, you're obviously experiencing a lot of gross margin compression over a 2-year period, probably a record amount of compression. So I'm just trying to understand your focus on pricing. It seems like the magnitude and timing of the pricing is less than what we've seen in the past versus these unprecedented cost pressure. So I just want to understand why we're not seeing a greater offset through pricing. Is pricing more difficult in this environment from a retailer or a competitive perspective? Is it more some of the pressure was unexpected? Are there other pressure points on gross margin? How do you sort of think about and help us understand why we're not seeing more of an offset to those outsized cost pressures like we're seeing at some of your peers?"

And let me share a perspective on gross margin. If I think about where we were before the pandemic, our gross margin was just below 44%, about 43.9%.

If I think about where we were before the pandemic, our gross margin was just below 44%, about 43.9%. As we moved through the pandemic over the last couple of years, we ended this year about 43.6%. So just a little below where we were before the pandemic began. 
As we go forward, as both Linda and I talked about in our prepared remarks, we are facing what we're describing as unprecedented cost environment in terms of inflation. 
Just for perspective, as I mentioned before, we're going to experience, we think, about $300 million of cost increases this year between both commodities and transportation. That's about a 400 basis point hit to gross margin this year. 
Now from the pricing actions we're taking, we think we can offset about 2/3 of those this year with the pricing actions we've announced plus more we'll announce at a later date. And then we expect to fully offset the cost increase going forward, but that will extend beyond fiscal year '22, just based on the phasing of these actions we're taking. And so I feel confident we'll recover these, but that will take a little longer beyond '22. 
And then the other items, Dara, I'd point out you'd be aware of as you think about our margin in fiscal year '22, there's 2 other items. We had a temporary benefit during the pandemic as it relates to mix as well as trade spending. As I think you know, for many of our categories, there's very limited promotional activity because of the lack of supply. We expected that as temporary and expect that to reverse out as we get back to a more normalized promotional environment. So if you think about fiscal year '22, I expect about 50 bps of headwind from higher trade spending. 
And then also on mix, when the pandemic hit and we rationalized our production, try to get as much probably doubt as possible, we ran [ 35 count ] canister as an example on wipe because we did run the most of those. As we introduce larger sizes, as we introduce multipacks, which is very good for consumption and trial, that will come in as a lower margin as well. So you'll see that positive mix turn negative as we get back into a more normal level of SKU offerings. And so that's about another 100 basis point hit we're going to see in '22. 
Now both of those are temporary benefits as a result of the pandemic that we expect to unwind, and they will unwind this year and get back to a more normalized level. And so I think what's important as we go through the year and you think about the phasing of our margins, the biggest challenge we're going to face is in the front half. When you think about the cost environment I highlighted, we expect to take about 75% of those cost increases in the front half of the year. And then you'll see sequential improvements as we move through the year and turn back to margin expansion. 
I expect, Dara, as we get to Q4 and we start recovering some of these costs, that you should see our gross margins back in the low 40s, and we're committed to rebuilding it back to where we were before the pandemic begin. Let me stop there and happy to take any follow-ups."

I would say that's certainly true in the front half of '22. And then our hope is we'll start to see it level out a bit in the back half and get to a more normalized environment. And so you should expect ongoing volatility in the front half. The way, Peter, we try to account for that is we provide a bit of a wider range in our outlook than what we would normally provide at this time of the year.

Because I know your leverage is still really low compared to your peers. But then, Linda, kind of stepping back aside from near term, the guidance for 2022 gross margin, I mean, I've covered this out for 20 years, and I have to go back literally 20 years to find a 40% gross margin for the company. And I totally get that we're in a weird period with COVID, and you made a commitment to not raise prices. And I think that's great. But I do beg -- I think it begs the question, if there's something structural in the business. When you mentioned higher promotional spending, I mean, this does not seem like the time to be in promotional spending when you're also raising prices and you've got so much commodity inflation. So sort of a year into your job as the new CEO, do you think a mid-40s gross margin is the right number, and this really is a temporary blip? Or is this a sort of, ""Hey, we were maybe over-earning on the gross margin line, and low 40s or even high 30s is really where we're sort of more normally positioned."" I'm sorry for the long question, but the guidance for a 40% gross margin just seems crazy to me."

I'll start with the second part of the question, and I'll hand it over to Kevin to talk a bit more about capital allocation on your first question. 
So what we're seeing, and you said it, it's absolutely an extraordinary environment. And if you look at all of the factors combined and what's contributing to our gross margin, I hate to serve a little bit, but it's really the perfect storm where we're lapping incredible sales growth and things like operating leverage. We are lapping promotional levels being down, and I would argue promotional levels for us are strategic. We've always viewed that investment just like we do our marketing dollars. It helps us build trial. It helps us expose consumers to things like innovation, and that's going to continue to be important in the future. And it's why we want to put that money back in the system to ensure, as we have record-setting innovation coming into the marketplace, from a top line perspective that we're able to support it with those dollars. And then, of course, the cost environment, which I think we're seeing broadly. And it's not just a Clorox issue, but certainly an industry problem. So all of that is happening at once.  
What that leads me to is this is not a structural issue. This is a temporary issue, albeit an extraordinary one. And we're managing with discipline. And I think the good news for us is we've managed, albeit not this deep, but certainly environments that have happened like this over time. And what we do is go to work and execute. And we're going to do it just like that in the past. We're going to take pricing, and you're going to see much more pricing come from us now as it starts to pick up. And we've improved supply, as we've spoken about. We're going to put our cost savings machine to work with the mandate to our team to remove any costs that are possible in the system, and that's what they are focused on every single day right now. And we're going to take it 1 day at a time and execute it. But I feel confident in our ability to get back to what Kevin spoke about and get back to those margins. It's just not going to happen this year. Again, we'll see improvement in Q4 and continued improvement as we move through fiscal '23, but we do view this as a temporary issue."

And as you know, our first priority will continue to be invest in our base business, and that includes our digital investments, both Linda and I spoke about that today. 
And so if you think about where we were last year, we ramped up investments in our base business, both investing in innovation, investing in brand building as well as investing in increasing production capacity within our supply network, primarily focused on increasing our wipes capacity. 
And so as we move into fiscal year '22, as we've gotten through some of those investments in our facilities, you should see our capital spending return down more in our normalized range of 3% to 4% of sales where we typically operate. You should expect that this year. And then we will deploy a certain amount of capital towards this technology investment. The way I see this $500 million playing out is about 60% of it will flow through our P&L, and about 40% of that will flow through our balance sheet. And if you think specifically about fiscal year '22, we're going to invest about $90 million with about $35 million flowing through our balance sheet, where we'll will deploy cash. And then after we invest in the base business, we'll continue to look for ways to return excess cash to shareholders. 
Last year, we generated tremendous amount of cash to the pandemic, and we returned almost $1.5 billion. I suspect this year, because of the challenging cost environment and the reduced profitability, we'll return closer to somewhere between $700 million and $900 million between our dividend and our share buyback program. 
But I'd also highlight, if you look at our dividend program, with our recent increase we announced back in June, we now have an average annual increase of a little over 7% for the last 5 years, and that puts us in the top 1/3 of our peer group. So I think we have committed to continually returning excess cash to our shareholders, and we've operated fairly high levels in our peer set, and you should expect us to do that going forward."

But that business could grow from that over time. And I'm curious your thoughts on time line of that trajectory from where we are today, what you think is going to be developing over that time period, whether that's professional getting back in stock in some of your businesses, the promotional spending or the pricing. 
And I guess underlying that question as well, I'm conscious, of course, that the Health and Wellness business has really tough comps in the first half. But the Household business also has pretty difficult comps, and the Grilling business is normalizing. And just trying to get a sense of if this trajectory is playing out in Health and Wellness, what you'd kind of see in your household business for the first half of the year. I guess back to the envelope math, would just suggest that you kind of need to see some improvement on a stack basis there, and whether I'm thinking about that correctly? And then I just have a quick follow-up."

And I think this is absolutely a dynamic time for Cleaning given all of the volatility. But there were 2 things that we said at the beginning. We believe that this was a change in consumer behavior that would be long term, and the evidence continues to support that, that is absolutely the case. 
So if you just look at some of the consumption numbers, even though it did decelerate faster than we expected, as vaccination rates picked up, at least until we got to the point we are today, you still see a very strong 2-year stack of growth. So in Q4, that was over 20% for our Cleaning business. 
But also if you look at consumption, that's been up in the range from 25% to 30% versus pre-pandemic levels. So we really are seeing that behavior be sticky with consumers. Of course, we're lapping incredible growth in those businesses and frankly, demand that we couldn't supply early in the pandemic. So what you're seeing is a normalization, but as we said, a significantly higher run rate moving forward, and we expect that to continue. Exactly where that will net out is still unknown, and I think there's a lot of unknowns moving forward. Delta certainly is an unknown, cold and flu season, et cetera. But we have continued confidence that this will be a long-term trend that we can grow off and will provide us the opportunity to accelerate profitable growth and, as we talked about raising our sales target to 3% to 5%, this is a portion of that. So continued confidence there. 
Again, I would say though, as we look to the first half and as we lap 27% sales growth overall for the company for our Cleaning and Disinfecting and for our Household business, we won't expect to deliver accelerated results versus that period. But as we start to lap in the back half is when we get to the low end of our sales algorithm and seeing both Cleaning and Disinfecting and our Household business contributing positively to that."

And then also keep in mind, we are lapping 85% growth in the Q4 prior year. So we're lapping a big year-over-year number as well as we're dealing with increased costs. So I think it goes back to what we're talking about we're dealing with a very challenging cost environment in the very near term, and that's going to pressure margins. But we do think this is short term. We continue to have tremendous confidence that we're going to be able to expand margins as we get to the back half of fiscal year '22 and then on into '23. But we have to recognize it in the very near term, it's going to challenge margins. You saw that in the fourth quarter, and you'll see that in the first half of fiscal year '22."

I would say this year, given the challenges on the cost environment, I expect we're going to be at the low end of that range.

I would say I'm very pleased with our share results given the environment that we have. We're seeing significant increased competition, and we had supply challenges given the unprecedented demand, and we're making, in my view, great progress. 
So share up in 7 of 9 businesses. If you look at the latest 13 weeks, we widened our share gap in wipes back to double digits and growing, and that's with significantly new competitive entries in the category. We grew [indiscernible] [ 8 ] share points. We have a very strong start to back-to-school and that program is working well. Continued strong Kingsford share growth after many quarters in a row of share growth in Kingsford. 
And you've heard my commitment, and I continue to stand by it. We remain committed to growing share, and we're focused on that in fiscal '22 and headed it in absolutely the right direction. And I've also called out places where I'm not as happy. I'm still not happy on where we are in Glad. We have work to do there. We're focused on the fundamentals and executing. And this really is completely unrelated to pricing, Jason. Pricing really has to do from a timing perspective with ensuring that we have the supply and then going back and working with our retail partners to ensure that we could implement the new plans in place. That really is the only reason why we've delayed that. We will, of course, do the very important work you call out on price gaps as we move forward, and that will be important. But given the incredible cost environment we see across the industry, we would expect to see categories move, and we'll move along with them. And then we'll do the work to go back and ensure that we're in those right gaps. 
The other piece I would add, Jason, is our brands have never been stronger, and that was our goal exiting fiscal year '21 was to be in a stronger position to grow off of this new significantly higher base. If you look at our Household penetration, repeat rates, our consumer value. And as you know, we measure the percent of our portfolio that is deemed superior by consumers, that's at a record high at 70%. So we feel fully confident in our ability to take pricing with the consumer. And then, of course, they'll be met with great marketing spend and innovation to continue to support that demand."

And then a little bit longer term, I don't want to belabor this, but maybe I'll just kind of play it back, and you tell me if I'm hearing this sort of correctly. The longer-term margin restoration now for this company, Linda, I think to an earlier question, you said you don't see this as a structurally lower margin business. Kevin, I think you kind of alluded to this as probably a multiyear journey, though, to get back. So down materially this year. Some improvement in fiscal '23, but probably not getting back to what would be ""normal sort of margins for this business until fiscal '24, '25"". Maybe you could just confirm that.

On organic sales growth, our assumption in the minus 6 to minus 2 is that we'll see modest category decline as we see demand moderate coming out of the pandemic, and then that will be partially offset by share",339,"Kevin, thanks for the question. So on the 2. On organic sales growth, our assumption in the minus 6 to minus 2 is that we'll see modest category decline as we see demand moderate coming out of the pandemic, and then that will be partially offset by share growth broadly across our portfolio. And so that's embedded in our assumptions for organic sales growth. 
And then on margin restoration, what I'd tell you is we are committed to recovering the cost inflation we're experiencing this year. And as I said, between our cost savings program and the pricing actions we're taking and the phasing of those pricing actions, we think that will extend beyond this fiscal year. And so I see this more as a short-term issue. But medium to long term, I have confidence in our ability to get back to that mid gross margin number. 
I'm going to resist providing a gross margin outlook for fiscal year '23. It's just too early to do that, and there's a lot of moving parts. But embedded in our assumptions right now is we will see a moderation in the commodity environment as we get through the end of this calendar year. And as that commodity environment moderates as we anticipate, plus the pricing actions we're taking, you'll see us start to rebuild margins and then continue into fiscal year. 
And Kevin, I'm sure you've seen this before, but if you go back and you look at some of our previous pricing actions over the last decade, we've done this 3 other times. And in all cases, what you saw was a margin decline in the year when the commodity costs spiked. And then we went on to rebuild margins in subsequent years. And most recently, in fiscal year '18, if you recall, we had 9 straight quarters of gross margin expansion following our pricing actions. And so my expectation is you'll see something similar where we'll start in Q4, and then that will continue on into fiscal year '23."

On the 50%, as we said, I think in an earlier answer and in our prepared remarks, it means we've announced pricing of about 50% to date. And we are planning additional pricing that we'll speak a little bit more once the details are in market. And really, there were considerations across how we would do that at what categories and what time, and we really took it category by category. It started with that first principle that I spoke about, which is we had to ensure we were in the right supply position as a starting place before we did that. And as we've brought supply back online, we've opened more and more of our categories to looking at that. And then, of course, we're doing the really important work to look at each category, look at the dynamics, our position in that, what our innovation and marketing plans look like and balancing that across every 1 of the categories, because what we're really here to do is maximize the long term on this. 
And what we want to ensure is that pricing is a part of that way that we restore margins, but also that we don't give up the opportunities we see in front of us to accelerate overall long-term profitable growth. And that's the balance we've gone through in every category. But I think what you're going to see from us as this all nets out is that we're taking a very prudent stance on pricing. It will be a meaningful contributor to gross margin expansion as we move through the year. And as Kevin said, we have all confidence that as we move beyond that, we'll be able to restore margins with pricing as an important part of that."

Broadly, as we look across retail inventories, given the good supply progress that we made in Q4, we have largely restored inventories across the bulk of our portfolio. We do have some additional work to do on the broader assortment of few packs and cleaning and disinfecting here and there and still have some work to do on Kingsford and Food. But largely, I would say on the retail side, inventories are restored. We'll see how that plays out, of course, as Delta takes on, et cetera, in how those inventories continue to progress as we go through the first half of the year, but largely in a good spot now. 
In the Professional business, it is different. So if you look at the front half of fiscal year '21, we had a 70% increase in sales for our Professional Products business. And then we had a big drop off of that in our back half as we've talked about in both sets of results. And what we've uncovered is they're just -- look like there's a lot of inventory in the Professional channel, given that front half that we experienced. And it's not just our inventory. It's actually inventory across all manufacturers. And that network is primarily supplied by distributors. And so having visibility into each point of that supply, we do now, and we realize there's more inventory there. 
So that means, as we lap that 70% growth in the front half of fiscal '22, and we start to read down that inventory, it is going to be bumpy in the short term, continue to have strong confidence in our ability to grow PPD. You look at the 2-year stack growth, it's 35% sales growth, but I think it is going to be bumpy here as we lap this front half, having the inventory in the system and then lapping an incredibly strong first half of last year."

So as we mentioned, $500 million over 5 years is a big investment for us. The vast majority of that investment will go towards replacing our ERP system. So I think it's pretty typical for large ERP investments that you typically do only once every 20 years or so to isolate that, so people can understand the investments we're making there versus the underlying performance of the business. 
And then the other aspect on this investment, and Linda mentioned it, is this investment really is about the future of the company, much more so than what it's going to do to benefit our IGNITE Strategy through 2025. And so we're making some pretty significant investments here, both in replacing our ERP as well as upscaling our digital capabilities that really will start to benefit us as we move beyond 2025, our IGNITE Strategy. So we thought it's appropriate to be able to isolate these and help folks understand our underlying operating performance, which has been pretty volatile as well, as the investments we're making really to set the company up for the long term."

So if you think about the top line, the front half of the year, we said it's going to be much more challenged. A big portion of that is we're lapping 27% growth.

So we had record growth in the back half -- or excuse me, the front half of fiscal year '21, we've got to lap. And so as a result of that, we expect our business to be down high single, low double digits. 
I think as would get into the back half of the year and we get back to more normalized comps, and we think we've gotten through the bulk of the demand moderation that we expect in the front half of the year, that gives us more confidence that we're going to be in a more normalized operating environment with more normalized comparison period that we should be back in that 3% range or so. 
Linda and I continue to have tremendous confidence in the opportunity for the extra point of growth. I think a little bit of that is getting hidden by the comps we're going through and the normalization. And so that's really a short-term issue for us that we think plays out over the next 6 months. But as we look to the back half of the year, and we think we get to a more normalized environment, then I think you'll start to see the benefits we've been talking about that we continue to see going forward that we think is really a medium to long-term opportunity."

And that mix was, I'd say, twofold, Steve. Certainly, as we talked about reintroducing additional SKUs. But the other item that we're seeing is as we now have wipes back in supply, consumers are changing in more convenient forms. So during the high of the pandemic, when we couldn't supply wipes, it increased our bleach sales in less convenient form. And now that we can produce wipes, consumers are moving back in the more convenient form of wipes versus using bleach. Ultimately, that's good for consumers. It gives them a more preferred solution, but that comes at a slightly lower mix for us. So a combination of the conversion within the product families as well as introducing additional SKUs as we get to a more normalized environment."

I was hoping if you can comment on why it's taking so long to recover even after your main competitor has been narrowing the price gaps and leading in prices increasing, I believe, twice already.

And following up on an over question, you had committed to keep prices intact during the pandemic. But what do you need to see now that your capacity is back on track and approximations are up?

And we had a 2-year stack of Glad on -- of 9% sales growth, and the fiscal year was up low single digits. So overall, from a sales perspective, we were happy with where we landed. 
Really, it's a share disappointment that I continue to have. We want to grow market share and particularly in a category like trash. We all see the share trends improving. So we were down about 0.9 points in the latest 52 weeks, down 0.5 points in the latest 13 and down 0.4 in the latest [ 4 5 ]. So definitely trending in the right direction behind improving distribution, getting the fundamentals right, et cetera. 
When it came to pricing, again, we announced pricing back in the fourth quarter as being implemented now. So -- and we took a larger first round than what we saw in the marketplace to take into account what we saw from the category. And we're evaluating that again if an additional price increase is warranted. But we feel like we've made the right move on Glad. And again, we'll continue to watch that innovation continues to work incredibly well in Glad, and we're committed to that program moving forward to differentiate our bags. But what we're really focused on right now is in market execution, ensuring we have the right distribution at every retailer implementing pricing flawlessly and then getting back to merchandising, which will be important in this category. So again, this is less of a comment overall in terms of sales, but more around winning in the market and ensuring that we have plans to grow share in the future."

As it relates to how we thought about commodity forecast, we have projected out what we believe is a commodity environment over the course of the year. So we are not using a spot rate. And our fundamental assumption is we will see commodity costs continue to increase. 
In fact, we think this quarter, we'll see that peak and then begin to moderate in the fall, late calendar year. Commodity costs will start to moderate and continue in the back half of the year. And so this is -- and I think I mentioned on one of the earlier questions, we anticipate about 75% of the commodity cost increases we're projecting for the year, we're going to see in the front half of the year. This is going to be the most extreme comparison period. 
And just to give you maybe a little bit of additional information, help dimensionalize it. When you think about resin, we're projecting over a 100% increase in the cost of resin in the front half of the year. So that's the type of environment we're dealing with. And so that's in a difficult environment to recover that type of margin compression in the time that it's rising, but we do think we're positioned well to recover that over time. But right now, we're projecting for the full year what we think where commodities will land. So any change in that, we'll certainly update you as we learn more."

Thank you for joining us.Fiscal '21 was an extraordinary year for Clorox, with the pandemic putting us through the ultimate test of volatility, including rapid changes in consumer demand and significant cost inflation,",1593,"Thank you, Lisah. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us.
Fiscal '21 was an extraordinary year for Clorox, with the pandemic putting us through the ultimate test of volatility, including rapid changes in consumer demand and significant cost inflation, which was reflected in our Q4 results. Despite the complexities we faced, we delivered 9% sales growth for the fiscal year on a reported and organic basis, reflecting growth in all 4 reportable segments. This was on top of the reported 8% increase we delivered in fiscal '20. On a 2-year stack basis, we delivered 17% sales growth.
With rising cost pressures, we experienced declines in gross margin, particularly in Q4, resulting in a decrease of 200 basis points for the fiscal year, which we will discuss in more detail.
Fiscal year '21 adjusted EPS decreased 2% to $7.25. Recognizing the immediate priorities before us, I would like to reinforce what matters most: long-term profitable growth. With a business that's significantly larger than before the pandemic and a portfolio of trusted brands exposed to more tailwinds, we have clarity in our strategic imperatives, and I have every confidence in our ability to continue delivering long-term value creation for our shareholders.
When I look at fiscal '21, our performance has shown the strength of our people, brands and products as well as the resilience of our category as we work tirelessly to supply consumers with products across our portfolio. As a result, we experienced significant growth in demand and strengthened our position amongst global consumers, with strong household penetration, supported by higher repeat rates across new and existing users.
The last 12 months have also demonstrated the need to accelerate our IGNITE Strategy to address near-term headwinds and capitalize on long-term opportunities. The industry environment remains dynamic, with significant inflationary pressure and continuing uncertainty. In the face of these conditions, our top priority is strong execution to mitigate the impact of elevated cost headwinds and continue to improve market share.
The pandemic has also highlighted areas where additional investments can help us be as agile as possible in the future. We are clear on the opportunities ahead of us to differentiate Clorox and build a stronger, more resilient and more profitable company. This includes driving our growth runways and making investments to enhance our digital capabilities and drive productivity improvements, which I will discuss shortly. We are confident that strong execution of our IGNITE Strategy will enable us to achieve our 3% to 5% long-term sales target and deliver long-term shareholder value.
Before I discuss Q4 and our progress against our strategy, I would like to thank our Clorox teammates around the world for everything they have accomplished over the past year as well as their commitment and dedication to serving people and communities around the world.
For Q4, faster-than-expected moderating demand for cleaning and disinfecting products had a pronounced impact on sales growth as we moved through the peak of the pandemic and lapped the unprecedented demand we experienced last year. The magnitude of this quarter's gross margin contraction was a result of faster-than-expected sales moderation, acceleration of inflationary headwinds and improvements in supply, which led to broader product assortment, including the reintroduction of value packs. I'll discuss shortly the actions we're taking to address these headwinds.
Now let me share a few highlights of our progress on our IGNITE Strategy. First, with fuel growth being a critical focus to help address elevated cost pressures and ensure the long-term health of our brands, I'm pleased we delivered over $120 million in cost savings in the fiscal year, surpassing our annual target.
Second, we made strong progress on our 2025 goal to know 100 million people, crossing the halfway mark to our goal this fiscal year. Our higher investment in personalization has led to significantly improved ROI. It has been one of the contributors to increasingly strong payouts, driving our confidence in continued investments in our brands.
Third, with innovation at the heart of our strategy, we doubled our innovation investments in fiscal '21, and new products were a bigger contributor to our top line, which we expect to continue in fiscal '22. Next, as consumers have increased their digital usage during the pandemic, we leaned into digital marketing and commerce, resulting in our e-commerce business nearly doubling in the last 2 years, which today represents about 13% of total company sales.
Finally, we continue to make progress on our ESG goals. For example, we advanced our commitment to climate action and submitted our proposal on science-based targets for our operations and Scope 3 emissions to the Science Based Targets initiative in June. And as a people-centric company, we continue to focus on the wellbeing of our teammates and our values-based inclusive culture. I'm particularly proud that during this trying year, we achieved our best safety score in recorded history, with a recordable incident rate of 0.26, significantly lower than the 3.3 industry average. I'm also pleased that in fiscal '21, we continued to have high employee engagement of 87%, putting us at the top quartile of Fortune 500 companies.
Now let me turn to fiscal '22. We expect inflationary pressure to persist, along with continued moderating demand as we lap COVID-19-related demand surges in the first half of fiscal '21. While this is reflected in our fiscal '22 outlook, which Kevin will discuss, by the second half of the year, we expect to be within the lower end of the range of our long-term sales targets. Like others in our industry and beyond, we are experiencing significant increases in input and transportation costs across all categories in our portfolio, which have accelerated since Q3. And we're holistically and dynamically managing this with a laser focus on rebuilding margin. We implemented pricing on Glad and announced actions on our Food, Cleaning and International businesses. This represents about 50% of our portfolio.
We're also pursuing pricing in additional parts of our portfolio, which we'll communicate at the right time. Based on the constructive conversations we're having with our retail partners and importantly, the strength of our brands, we feel confident about our ability to execute our pricing plans. In addition, we will continue to drive our hallmark cost savings program. We expect sequential gross margin improvements as we progress through fiscal '22, with our assumption for gross margin expansion by Q4.
In terms of market share, as we've discussed previously, we have experienced some declines due to supply challenges, but have made notable progress. With strong investments in internal and external production capacity, including additional manufacturing lines and a significant expansion of our production team, in June, we achieved our highest case fill rate since the start of the pandemic. I'm pleased to see that in the latest 13-week data, ending July 17, we saw market share gains in 7 out of 9 businesses. Certainly, we recognize there's more work to do in parts of the portfolio, such as Glad Trash, and we have adjusted our plans to drive market share improvements over time. Despite these near-term headwinds, we remain focused on our long-term priorities rooted in our IGNITE Strategy to deliver our long-term growth aspirations.
While some pandemic-related behaviors may revert over the next 12 months, we continue to believe there's been a shift in behaviors that will advantage Clorox longer-term, including a focus on health, wellness and hygiene, more time at home as well as increased adoption of e-commerce and digital platforms.
The pandemic also revealed the urgency to upgrade our digital infrastructure and capabilities. Last year, I brought in Chief Information and Enterprise Analytics Officer, Chau Banks, who has extensive experience in business-driven digital transformation, to conduct a fresh assessment of our own program that was already underway before the pandemic. With that assessment now complete, we are accelerating our transformation through planned investments of about $500 million over the next 5 years to enhance our digital capabilities and drive productivity improvements, including replacing our ERP. This will enhance our supply chain to better position Clorox to meet customer needs, yield efficiencies and support our digital commerce, innovation and brand-building efforts.
Prior to the pandemic, we were already adapting our business to differentiate Clorox from a digital perspective. We'll continue to invest in e-commerce and digital marketing across our portfolio, leveraging data-driven insights to engage with consumers in more relevant ways.
Moving to innovation. Innovation continues to be a key focus area for me and our new Chief Growth Officer, Tony Matta, who joined last October. Tony has more than 20 years of brand-building experience with leading consumer companies. Ensuring we have stickier innovation delivering multiyear value, we're driving lasting new product platforms, such as Fresh Step Clean Paws and Scentiva, which continue to grow. In addition, we're extending innovation by leveraging external partners to create new revenue streams.
We're continuing to support our brands, especially margin-accretive innovation, with disciplined high-ROI advertising and sales promotion investments to build and strengthen consumer loyalty. We also remain very focused on driving our growth runways to build Clorox into a global cleaning and disinfecting brand. We are still in the early stages of a multiyear journey, but continue to believe they can become a meaningful contributor to growth longer-term.
And as we execute on all these initiatives, we will continue to drive the strategic link between our societal impacts and long-term value creation as we live our purpose and keep our ESG commitments front and center in our decision-making every day.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Lisah to review our business unit performance."

In Health and Wellness, Q4 sales decreased 17% for the quarter, while full year sales were up 8%, with growth across all businesses. On a 2-year stack basis, Q4 sales grew 16% and full year sales grew 22%.
In Cleaning, sales were down by double digits compared to double-digit growth in the year ago quarter, primarily due to the deceleration of demand across various cleaning and disinfecting products. On a full year basis, Cleaning sales grew behind a strong front half performance. While demand fell faster than anticipated, it remains higher than it was pre-pandemic, with strong repeat rates among new buyers. Importantly, our supply and product assortment are almost fully restored, which is reflected in our market share improvement, especially in wipes and sprays.
As consumer demand migrated to more preferred forms and value packs, we also saw a negative impact to price mix, which we expect to continue over the next few quarters. Going forward, we'll be focused on strengthening our merchandising activities, especially for the back-to-school period.
Sales in Professional Products were down by double digits versus year ago period, when we experienced double-digit growth. For the full year, Professional Products sales were up by double digits, fueled by an exceptional front half performance. Demand started moderating in Q3 and continued into Q4 as customers worked through high inventory levels, especially of Clorox T 360 electrostatic sprayers. In the short term, we expect results will continue to be volatile as we lap periods with unprecedented demand. Longer-term, this business continues to be a strategic growth area for the company.
As part of our initiative to expand into new channels, we continue to add to our roster of out-of-home partnerships, including Live Nation, the world's leading live events company.
Lastly, within the Health and Wellness segment, our Vitamins, Minerals and Supplements business increased by double digits this quarter after lapping a double-digit decrease caused by a supply disruption related to COVID-19.
For the full year, sales were up as well. Sales growth for the quarter was driven by a strong performance in the food, drug and mass channel and e-commerce.
Turning to the Household segment. Q4 sales were down 8%. Full year sales grew 10%, with growth across all 3 businesses. On a 2-year stack basis, Q4 sales grew 8% and full year sales grew 12%. Glad sales decreased by double digits in Q4, lapping strong double-digit growth in the year ago quarter, which was impacted by initial stockpiling. For the full year, sales were up. Our efforts going forward are focused on managing base with the strong inflationary headwinds we're facing. And as Linda mentioned, we still have more work to do in this business to restore market share.
Grilling sales decreased by double digits in Q4 as demand started moderating after 4 consecutive quarters of strong double-digit growth. For the full year, sales grew by double digits, fueled by very strong consumption overall. Our focus on expanding distribution of our latest innovation, Kingsford Pellets, continued with a nationwide launch, building on the product's initial success, while we're also introducing signature flavors made with 100% real spices that will be available in select retailers before Labor Day as we gear up for the 2022 grilling season. This innovation is intended to help our business continue building consumption among multicultural millennials and other heavy grillers.
Cat Litter sales grew by double digits in Q4 driven by continued strong consumption. For the full year, Litter sales also grew. The result reflected strength in e-commerce, with Fresh Step becoming the #1 brand online for the first time and positive overall category trends, boosted by record pet adoptions during the pandemic. Going forward, we're excited about our latest innovation, Fresh Step Outstretch Litter, which lasts 50% longer than regular litter thanks to patent-pending technology.
In our Lifestyle segment, sales were down 3% and full year sales grew 6%. On a 2-year stack basis, Q4 sales grew 13% and full year sales grew 16%. Brita sales were down as demand continued to moderate from an extended period of elevated consumption. Full year sales grew on top of double-digit growth in the prior year. Despite the deceleration in Q4, business fundamentals are strong, especially now that our supply is mostly restored. We're excited about the strong merchandising program we've put in place this year, including the largest back-to-college event ever for the brand.
The Food business was down, primarily due to lower shipments of Hidden Valley Ranch bottle dressings, with consumption moderating as consumer mobility improved. Full year sales were up by double digits, on top of double-digit growth in the prior year. The consumer fundamentals for this business are strong, with the brand growing market share and household penetration.
Burt's Bees sales increased by double digits this quarter as overall category consumption begin to recover. Full year sales were down as category consumption was negatively impacted by store closures, mask mandates and stay-at-home measures. We expect this business to continue to recover as people begin returning to their pre-pandemic shopping patterns and consumer mobility keeps improving. We'll build on that momentum with our new ""Lips To Love"" campaign, supported by a strong innovation pipeline.
Lastly, turning to International. Q4 sales grew 5%, reflecting the combined impact of the Saudi JV acquisition and benefit of price increases, partially offset by lower shipments due to the moderating demand after a period of elevated consumption. Extended lockdowns in Canada also contributed to the decrease in shipments. The results are on top of 12% growth in the year ago period, when we saw elevated consumption across our portfolio during the early stages of the pandemic.
Importantly, we continue to expand our global Disinfecting Wipes business, building on the dedicated international supply chain that was developed in 5 months and are making progress launching our Clorox Expert Disinfecting Wipes in existing countries as well as new markets. For the full year, sales increased 14%, reflecting very strong growth for the majority of the year before moderating in Q4. On a 2-year stack basis, Q4 sales grew 17% and full year sales grew 19%.
Now I'll turn it over to Kevin, who will discuss Q4 and full year financial results for FY '21 as well as our outlook for FY '22."
89450,1672644685,2361468,"The Clorox Company, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2021",2021-08-03,"Earnings Calls","The Clorox Company","Executives","Thank you, Lisah, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As Linda mentioned, for fiscal year '21, we delivered 9% sales growth on top of 8% sales growth in fiscal year '20. While this is lower than we anticipated in our outlook, we feel good about",1498,"Thank you, Lisah, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As Linda mentioned, for fiscal year '21, we delivered 9% sales growth on top of 8% sales growth in fiscal year '20. While this is lower than we anticipated in our outlook, we feel good about delivering another strong sales year. Of course, we continue to manage through an extremely challenging cost environment, which impacted our fiscal year margins and earnings. Importantly, we delivered another year of strong cash flow, which came in at $1.3 billion compared to a record $1.5 billion for fiscal year '20. I'm pleased our strong cash flow allowed us to return almost $1.5 billion to our shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase program, representing an increase of about 90% in cash returned to shareholders versus fiscal year '20.
Before I review our Q4 results, I wanted to highlight a $28 million noncash charge we booked in Q4 related to a third-party supplier for our Professional Products business. As we have shared previously, during the height of the pandemic, we worked with a number of third-party suppliers to support us in addressing unprecedented demand in the consumer and professional spaces. We are reducing our reliance on one of these suppliers, and as a result, we took a charge in the fourth quarter. Important to note, this noncash charge is included in our reported EPS and excluded from our Q4 adjusted EPS as it represents a nonrecurring item.
Turning to our fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter sales decreased 9% in comparison to a 22% increase in the year ago quarter, delivering a 2-year stack of 13% sales growth. Our sales results reflect an 8% decline in organic volume and 2 points of unfavorable price mix, primarily in our Health and Wellness segment, as supply improvements resulted in a broader product assortment, including the reintroduction of value packs. On an organic basis, fourth quarter sales declined 10%. Fourth quarter sales were lower than expected, primarily in our Health and Wellness segment, as demand for cleaning and disinfecting products moderated more rapidly than we had previously anticipated. While the cleaning and disinfecting category continues to moderate, we're pleased to see improving share as we've increased our ability to supply.
Gross margin for the quarter decreased 970 basis points to 37.1% compared to 46.8% in the year ago quarter. Gross margin results were lower than anticipated, largely driven by higher input costs and lower sales. The year-over-year change in Q4 gross margin was primarily driven by lower sales, resulting in lower manufacturing fixed cost absorption as well as significant cost headwinds, driving about 290 basis points of higher commodity costs, 180 basis points of increased transportation costs as well as 130 basis points of unfavorable mix. Our fourth quarter gross margin also includes about 70 basis points of negative impact from the noncash charge I just mentioned. These margin headwinds were partially offset by about 90 basis points of cost savings and 50 basis points of benefit from our pricing actions in our International division.
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales came in at 14.4% compared to 14.1% in the year ago quarter. Advertising and sales promotion investment levels as a percentage of sales came in at about 12%, with U.S. spending at about 14% of sales. Strong investments in Q4 supported our back half innovation program and reflected our continued focus on building loyalty among new consumers.
Our fourth quarter effective tax rate was 0%, primarily driven by a tax benefit from the exiting of a small foreign subsidiary, which was mostly offset by the charge we took to pretax book income associated with this decision as well as favorable return to provision adjustments. On a full year basis, our effective tax rate was 20%. Net of all these factors, adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter came in at $0.95 versus $2.41 in the year ago quarter, a decline of 61%.
Before I review the details of our outlook, let me provide perspective on the strategic investment Linda discussed. We are planning to invest about $500 million over the next 5 years to enhance our digital capabilities and drive productivity improvements, including the replacement of our ERP. In fiscal year '22, we plan to invest about $90 million in operating and capital expenditures, with about $55 million impacting our P&L and the remainder reflected in our balance sheet. Beginning in Q1 and going forward, our adjusted EPS will exclude the portion of the $500 million investment that flows through our P&L to provide better insights into our underlying operating performance of our business.
Now turning to our fiscal year '22 outlook. We anticipate fiscal year sales to be down 2% to 6%, reflecting ongoing demand moderation, primarily in our cleaning and disinfecting products in the front half of the fiscal year, in addition to the unfavorable mix and higher trade spending as we move to a more normalized supply and promotional environment. We assume these factors will be partially offset by the pricing actions we're taking broadly across our portfolio.
Organic sales are expected to be down 2% to 6% as well. We expect front half sales to decline high single to low double digits as we lap 27% growth in the front half of fiscal year '21, during the height of the pandemic. Additionally, we expect Q1 sales to decline low double digits. As we move to the back half of the year, we expect to return to the lower end of our long-term sales growth target. Of course, we continue to operate in a dynamic and uncertain environment, which could impact our outlook.
We anticipate fiscal year gross margin to be down 300 to 400 basis points due to our assumption for significant ongoing headwinds from elevated commodity and transportation costs, which represent nearly $300 million in year-over-year cost increases. We expect these headwinds to be more pronounced in the front half of the year, particularly in Q1, as we expect key commodity cost increases to reduce gross margin by about 500 basis points, driving our assumption for Q1 gross margin to decline 1,100 to 1,300 basis points.
For perspective, in Q1, we are lapping a modern gross margin record of 48%, reflecting over 400 basis points of favorable operating leverage on 27% sales growth in the year ago quarter. As we mentioned in our press release, we expect sequential improvement for gross margin over the course of fiscal year '22, with the assumption for gross margin expansion in Q4. This is based on our assumption that cost inflation will begin to moderate, and it will see the benefits from mitigating actions flow more fully through our P&L.
We expect fiscal year selling and administrative expenses to be about 15% of sales, which includes about 1 point of impact related to our investment to enhance our digital capabilities. Additionally, we anticipate fiscal year advertising spending to be about 10% of sales, reflecting our ongoing commitment to invest behind our brands and build market share. We expect our fiscal year tax rate to be about 22% to 23%. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects lapping several onetime benefits in the prior fiscal year. Net of these factors, we anticipate fiscal year adjusted EPS to be between $5.40 to $5.70.
As we start fiscal year '22, I would like to emphasize our priority to address elevated cost pressures from both commodities and transportation throughout the fiscal year. We are focused on executing the pricing actions we discussed today. We have implemented our announced price increase on our Bags and Wraps and are taking pricing on our Food, Cleaning and International businesses. This represents about 50% of our portfolio.
We are also pursuing pricing in additional parts of our portfolio, which we'll announce at a later date. While it's still early, we are confident in our ability to price given the strength of our brand and the constructive conversations we're having with retailers.
Consistent with our IGNITE Strategy, we're addressing short-term headwinds head-on, with an eye on the long-term health of our business. We will continue to invest in our brands, including meaningful innovation to drive differentiation, which will help us continue to drive superior consumer value. We are leaning into our cost savings program and productivity initiatives to help address ongoing cost pressures. And we're accelerating investments in our digital transformation to drive increased capabilities, lower costs across our supply chain and improve innovation efforts and our brand engagement activities.
And finally, as Linda mentioned, our business is significantly larger than before the pandemic, and we're well positioned for the future. Our global portfolio of trusted brands is more relevant than ever, and we're positioning ourselves to make the most of the changing consumer trends we see. We have confidence in our strategic plans and our ability to execute to enable us to continue to create long-term value for our shareholders.
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Linda."

We've heard the IGNITE Strategy has been working in the last couple of years. We've heard historically that you're ahead of the curve and competition on the e-commerce side from you guys and happy with the innovation progress. So it sounds like there was a review when you took over, Linda, and obviously Chau Banks appointment. But I'm sure you were focused on these areas before also. So was this a surprise? How did it develop, particularly given it's such a large amount?
And then as we think about the payback, is this what's necessary to get back to long-term goals at some point? In theory, sometimes a big spending program can yield payback above and beyond prior goals. I'm assuming, at this point, it's more to help return to prior long-term goals. And then I also have a second question on gross margins, if I can come back."
89450,1672644685,2361468,"The Clorox Company, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2021",2021-08-03,"Earnings Calls","The Clorox Company","Executives","Sure, Dara. Thank you. So why don't we start with your first question, why necessary now, and what's clear is the pandemic has absolutely accelerated consumer digital behaviors in a way that we never contemplated during our IGNITE Strategy. And certainly,",385,"Sure, Dara. Thank you. So why don't we start with your first question, why necessary now, and what's clear is the pandemic has absolutely accelerated consumer digital behaviors in a way that we never contemplated during our IGNITE Strategy. And certainly, we saw that as a key consumer tailwind for us as we penned that strategy, but we've seen such a rapid movement online by consumers, both in the e-commerce space and certainly in the marketing consumption space, that we really knew we needed to take a step back and look at the program that we had in place and ensure that it was sufficient for us to deliver as we move forward and what we look to as across the entire operation.
And I think the other thing that I would note is our challenges in fiscal year '21, managing the type of volatility that we haven't been exposed to in the past, underscore the urgency to upgrade that digital infrastructure and capabilities. And what I want to make clear is this is really not about today. This is about maintaining momentum as we come out of our IGNITE Strategy period. And you'll see the bulk of the value of this comes after our IGNITE Strategy period, so 2025 and beyond. This will allow us to have really real-time access to data and information that will help our entire operation move more efficiently and better serve consumer and customer needs.
So we're making, first, an investment in our ERP, which is the foundation and infrastructure of all of these changes, and that's needed and accelerated to build these digital capabilities. We'll have better supply chain visibility across all parts of the supply chain with real-time data, which will improve things like procurement and supply planning. It will further enhance the work that you already referenced, that we've done on digital and e-commerce, and further enhance our ability to do personalization and get more out of that goal and will help us on innovation.
So really what this was about was the change in circumstances in the environment, a rapid change in consumer behavior that we couldn't have been predicted before the pandemic. And we're leaning in, and this is really about building a stronger company with more momentum coming out of the strategy period."

And then can you just talk a little bit about the yield from this, how we should think about that in terms of timing and magnitude over time? And then second, Kevin, on gross margins, when you include the guidance for fiscal 2022, you're obviously experiencing a lot of gross margin compression over a 2-year period, probably a record amount of compression. So I'm just trying to understand your focus on pricing. It seems like the magnitude and timing of the pricing is less than what we've seen in the past versus these unprecedented cost pressures.
So I just want to understand why we're not seeing a greater offset through pricing. Is pricing more difficult in this environment from a retailer or a competitive perspective? Is it more some of the pressure was unexpected? Are there other pressure points on gross margin? How do you sort of think about and help us understand why we're not seeing more of an offset to those outsized cost pressures like we're seeing at some of your peers?"

And let me share a perspective on gross margin. If I think about where we were before the pandemic, our gross margin was just below 44%, about 43.9%. As we moved through the pandemic, over the last couple of years, we e",585,"Yes, Dara, thanks for the question. And let me share a perspective on gross margin. If I think about where we were before the pandemic, our gross margin was just below 44%, about 43.9%. As we moved through the pandemic, over the last couple of years, we ended this year about 43.6%, so just a little below where we were before the pandemic began. As we go forward, as both Linda and I talked about in our prepared remarks, we are facing what we're describing as an unprecedented cost environment in terms of inflation.
Just, Dara, for perspective, as I mentioned before, we're going to experience, we think, about $300 million of cost increases this year between both commodities and transportation. That's about a 400 basis point hit to gross margin this year. Now from the pricing actions we're taking, we think we can offset about 2/3 of those this year with the pricing actions we've announced, plus some more we'll announce at a later date. And then we expect to fully offset the cost increase going forward, but that will extend beyond fiscal year '22, just based on the phasing of these actions we're taking. And so I feel confident we'll recover these, but that will take a little longer beyond '22.
And then the other items, Dara, I would point out you should be aware of, as you think about our margin in fiscal year '22, there's 2 other items. We had a temporary benefit during the pandemic as it relates to mix as well as trade spending. As I think you know, for many of our categories, there's very limited promotional activity because of the lack of supply. We expected that as temporary and expect that to reverse out as we get back to a more normalized promotional environment. So if you think about fiscal year '22, I expect about 50 bps of headwind from higher trade spending.
And then also, on mix, when the pandemic hit and we rationalized our production, try to get as much probably out as possible, we ran 35-count canisters as an example on wipe because we could run the most of those. As we introduce larger sizes, as we introduce multipacks, which is very good for consumption and trial, that will come in as a lower margin as well. So you'll see that positive mix turn negative as we get back into a more normal level of SKU offerings. And so that's about another 100 basis point hit we're going to see in '22.
Now both of those are temporary benefits as a result of the pandemic that we expect to unwind, and they will unwind this year and get back to a more normalized level. And so I think what's important as we go through the year and you think about the phasing of our margins, the biggest challenge we're going to face is in the front half. When you think about the cost environment I highlighted, we expect to take about 75% of those cost increases in the front half of the year. And then you'll see sequential improvements as we move through the year and turn back to margin expansion.
I expect, Dara, as we get to Q4 and we start recovering some of these costs, that you should see our gross margins back in the low 40s and we're committed to rebuilding it back to where we were before the pandemic began. Let me stop there and happy to take any follow-ups."

Clearly, we're going to need to pull that lever, and we are, with about 50% announced to date and plans to take additional pricing that we'll communicate more details around coming up in the future.

I would say that's certainly true in the front half of '22. And then our hope is we'll start to see it level out a bit in the back half and get to a more normalized environment. And so you should expect ongoing volatility in the front half. The way, Peter, we try to account for that is we provide a bit of a wider range in our outlook than what we would normally provide at this time of the year.

But then, Linda, kind of stepping back aside from near term, the guidance for 2022 gross margin, I mean, I've covered this stock for 20 years, and I have to go back literally 20 years to find a 40% gross margin for the company. And I totally get that we're in a weird period with COVID, and you made a commitment to not raise prices and I think that's great. But I do beg -- I think it begs the question, is there's something structural in the business?
When you mentioned higher promotional spending, I mean, this does not seem like the time to be investing in promotional spending, when you're also raising prices and you've got so much commodity inflation. So sort of a year into your job as the new CEO, do you think a mid-40s gross margin is the right number and this really is a temporary blip? Or is this a sort of, ""Hey, we were maybe over-earning on the gross margin line and low 40s or even high 30s is really where we're sort of more normally positioned.""

I'll start with the second part of the question, and then I'll hand it over to Kevin to talk a bit more about capital allocation on your first question. So what we're seeing, and you said it, it's absolutely an extraordinary environment. And if you look at all of the factors combined and what's contributing to our gross margin, I hate this term a little bit, but it's really the perfect storm, where we're lapping incredible sales growth and things like operating leverage.
We are lapping promotional levels being down, and I would argue promotional levels for us are strategic. We've always viewed that investment, just like we do our marketing dollars, it helps us build trial. It helps us expose consumers to things like innovation. And that's going to continue to be important in the future. And it's why we want to put that money back in the system to ensure as we have record-setting innovation coming into the marketplace, from a top line perspective, that we're able to support it with those dollars. And then, of course, the cost environment, which I think we're seeing broadly, and it's not just a Clorox issue, but certainly an industry problem. So all of that is happening at once.
What that leads me to is this is not a structural issue. This is a temporary issue, albeit an extraordinary one. And we're managing with discipline. And I think the good news for us is we've managed, albeit not this deep, but certainly environments that have happened like this over time. And what we do is go to work and execute. And we're going to do it just like that in the past. We're going to take pricing, and you're going to see much more pricing come from us now as it starts to pick up. And we've improved supply, as we've spoken about.
We're going to put our cost savings machine to work, with the mandate to our team to remove any costs that are possible in the system, and that's what they are focused on every single day right now. And we're going to take it one day at a time and execute it. But I feel confident in our ability to get back to what Kevin spoke about and get back to those margins. It's just not going to happen this year. Again, we'll see improvement in Q4 and continued improvement as we move through fiscal '23, but we do view this as a temporary issue."

And as you know, our first priority will continue to be invest in our base business, and that includes our digital investments. Both Linda and I spoke about that today.
And so if you think about where we were last year, we ramped up investments in our base business, both investing in innovation, investing in brand-building as well as investing in increasing production capacity within our supply network, primarily focused on increasing our wipes capacity.
And so as we move into fiscal year '22, as we've gotten through some of those investments in our facilities, you should see our capital spending return down more in our normalized range of 3% to 4% of sales where we typically operate. You should expect that this year. And then we will deploy a certain amount of capital towards this technology investment. The way I see this $500 million playing out is about 60% of it will flow through our P&L, and about 40% of that will flow through our balance sheet. And if you think specifically about fiscal year '22, we're going to invest about $90 million with about $35 million flowing through our balance sheet, where we'll deploy cash. And then after we invest in the base business, we'll continue to look for ways to return excess cash to shareholders.
Last year, we generated a tremendous amount of cash to the pandemic, and we returned almost $1.5 billion. I suspect this year, because of the challenging cost environment and the reduced profitability, we'll return closer to somewhere between $700 million and $900 million between our dividend and our share buyback program.
But I would also highlight, if you look at our dividend program, with our recent increase we announced back in June, we now have an average annual increase of a little over 7% for the last 5 years, and that puts us in the top 1/3 of our peer group. So I think we have committed to continually returning excess cash to our shareholders, and we've operated fairly high levels in our peer set and you should expect us to do that going forward."

And I guess underlying that question as well, I'm conscious, of course, that the Health and Wellness business has really tough comps in the first half. But the Household business also has pretty difficult comps, and the Grilling business is normalizing. And just trying to get a sense of, if this trajectory is playing out in Health and Wellness, what you kind of see in your Household business for the first half of the year. I guess back-of-the-envelope math would just suggest that you kind of need to see some improvement on a stack basis there and whether I'm thinking about that correctly. And then I just have a quick follow-up."

I think this is absolutely a dynamic time for Cleaning given all of the volatility. But there were 2 things that we said at the beginning. We believe that this was a change in consumer behavior that would be long term, and the evidence continues to support that, that is absolutely the case.
So if you just look at some of the consumption numbers, even though it did decelerate faster than we expected, as vaccination rates picked up, at least until we got to the point we are today, you still see a very strong 2-year stack of growth. So in Q4, that was over 20% for our Cleaning business. 
But also if you look at consumption, that's been up in the range from 25% to 30% versus pre-pandemic levels. So we really are seeing that behavior be sticky with consumers. Of course, we're lapping incredible growth in those businesses and frankly, demand that we couldn't supply early in the pandemic.
So what you're seeing is a normalization, but as we said, a significantly higher run rate moving forward, and we expect that to continue. Exactly where that will net out is still unknown, and I think there's a lot of unknowns moving forward. Delta certainly is an unknown, cold and flu season, et cetera. But we have continued confidence that this will be a long-term trend that we can grow off and will provide us the opportunity to accelerate profitable growth and as we talked about raising our sales target to 3% to 5%, this is a portion of that. So continued confidence there.
Again, I would say though, as we look to the first half and as we lap 27% sales growth overall for the company for our Cleaning and Disinfecting and for our Household business, we won't expect to deliver accelerated results versus that period. But as we start to lap in the back half is when we get to the low end of our sales algorithm and seeing both Cleaning and Disinfecting and our Household business contributing positively to that."

And then also keep in mind, we are lapping 85% growth in the Q4 prior year. So we're lapping a big year-over-year number as well as we're dealing with increased costs. So I think it goes back to what we're talking about, we're dealing with a very challenging cost environment in the very near term, and that's going to pressure margins. But we do think this is short term? We continue to have tremendous confidence that we're going to be able to expand margins as we get to the back half of fiscal year '22 and then on into '23.

I would say, this year, given the challenges on the cost environment, I expect we're going to be at the low end of that range. So I think closer to 11%, if not slightly below that.

Is this the reason that your progress on pricing is so slow? Is it to try to sort of reset some price gaps and become more competitive to correct market share? Or is it, in fact, to be like the service levels you mentioned and really, with the need to restore them first before you're able to start to push to pricing with retailers?"

We're seeing significant increased competition, and we had supply challenges given the unprecedented demand. And we're making, in my view, great progress.
So share up in 7 of 9 businesses. If you look at the latest 13 weeks, we widened our share gap in wipes back to double digits and growing, and that's with significantly new competitive entries in the category. We grew Brita 8 share points. We have a very strong start to back-to-school, and that program is working well. Continued strong Kingsford share growth after many quarters in a row of share growth in Kingsford.
And you've heard my commitment, and I continue to stand by it. We remain committed to growing share, and we're focused on that in fiscal '22 and headed in absolutely the right direction. And I've also called out places where I'm not as happy. I'm still not happy on where we are in Glad. We have work to do there. We're focused on the fundamentals and executing.
And this really is completely unrelated to pricing, Jason. Pricing really has to do, from a timing perspective, with ensuring that we have the supply and then going back and working with our retail partners to ensure that we could implement the new plans in place. That really is the only reason why we've delayed that. We will, of course, do the very important work you call out on price gaps as we move forward, and that will be important. But given the incredible cost environment we see across the industry, we would expect to see categories move, and we'll move along with them. And then we'll do the work to go back and ensure that we're in those right gaps.
And then the other piece I would add, Jason, is our brands have never been stronger, and that was our goal exiting fiscal year '21, was to be in a stronger position to grow off of this new significantly higher base. If you look at our Household penetration, repeat rates, our consumer value, and as you know, we measure the percentage of our portfolio that is deemed superior by consumers. That's at a record high at 70%. So we feel fully confident in our ability to take pricing with the consumer. And then, of course, they will be met with great marketing spend and innovation to continue to support that demand."

The longer-term margin restoration now for this company, Linda, I think to an earlier question, you said you don't see this as a structurally lower margin business. Kevin, I think you kind of alluded to this as probably a multiyear journey, though, to get back.

Thanks for the question. So on the 2. On organic sales growth, our assumption in the minus 6 to minus 2 is that we'll see modest category decline as we see demand moderate coming out of the pandemic, and then that will be partially offset by share growth broadly across our portfolio. And so that's embedded in our assumptions for organic sales growth.
And then on margin restoration, what I would tell you is we are committed to recovering the cost inflation we're experiencing this year. And as I said, between our cost savings program and the pricing actions we're taking and the phasing of those pricing actions, we think that will extend beyond this fiscal year. And so I see this more as a short-term issue. But medium to long term, I have confidence in our ability to get back to that mid-gross margin number.
I'm going to resist providing a gross margin outlook for fiscal year '23. It's just too early to do that, and there's a lot of moving parts. But embedded in our assumptions right now is we will see a moderation in the commodity environment as we get through the end of this calendar year. And if that commodity environment moderates as we anticipate, plus the pricing actions we're taking, you'll see us start to rebuild margins and then continue into fiscal year '23.
And Kevin, I'm sure you've seen this before, but if you go back and you look at some of our previous pricing actions over the last decade, we've done this 3 other times. And in all cases, what you saw was a margin decline in the year when the commodity costs spiked. And then we went on to rebuild margins in subsequent years. And most recently, in fiscal year '18, if you recall, we had 9 straight quarters of gross margin expansion following our pricing actions. And so my expectation is you'll see something similar where we'll start Q4, and then that will continue on into fiscal year '23."

On the 50%, as we said, I think, in an earlier answer and in our prepared remarks, it means we've announced pricing of about 50% to date. And we are planning additional pricing that we'll speak a little bit more once the details are in market. And really, there were considerations across how we would do that, at what categories and what time, and we really took it category by category. It started with that first principle that I spoke about, which is we had to ensure we were in the right supply position as a starting place before we did that. And as we've brought supply back online, we've opened more and more of our categories to looking at that.
And then, of course, we're doing the really important work to look at each category, look at the dynamics, our position in that, what our innovation and marketing plans look like and balancing that across every one of the categories, because what we're really here to do is maximize the long term on this.
And what we want to ensure is that pricing is a part of that way that we restore margins, but also that we don't give up the opportunities we see in front of us to accelerate overall long-term profitable growth. And that's the balance we've gone through in every category. But I think what you're going to see from us as this all nets out is that we're taking a very prudent stance on pricing. It will be a meaningful contributor to gross margin expansion as we move through the year. And as Kevin said, we have all confidence that as we move beyond that, we'll be able to restore margins with pricing as an important part of that."

We do have some additional work to do on the broader assortment of a few packs and cleaning and disinfecting here and there and still have some work to do on Kingsford and Food. But largely, I would say, on the retail side, inventories are restored. We'll see how that plays out, of course, as Delta takes on, et cetera, in how those inventories continue to progress as we go through the first half of the year, but largely in a good spot now.
In the Professional business, it is different. So if you look at the front half of fiscal year '21, we had a 70% increase in sales for our Professional Products business. And then we had a big drop off of that in our back half as we've talked about in both sets of results. And what we've uncovered is they're just -- look like there's a lot of inventory in the Professional channel given that front half that we experienced. And it's not just our inventory, it's actually inventory across all manufacturers. And that network is primarily supplied by distributors. And so having visibility into each point of that supply, we do now, and we realize there's more inventory there.
So that means, as we lap that 70% growth in the front half of fiscal '22 and we start to lead down that inventory, it is going to be bumpy in the short term, continue to have strong confidence in our ability to grow PPD. You look at the 2-year stack growth, it's 35% sales growth, but I think it is going to be bumpy here as we lap this front half, having the inventory in the system and then lapping an incredibly strong first half of last year."

You talked about how obviously during the height of the pandemic, to increase throughput, SKU rationalization and the smaller packs in particular are now bringing some of the value packs back in, in larger sizes. Did you consider using this as sort of an opportunity to intentionally kind of streamline mix? Does everyone in the industry have revenue growth management, right, but ways to actually improve the profitability of what you do choose to merchandise? Because I would have thought that, that could also give you a bit more flexibility and particularly as you're going through this cost environment."

We've spoken about adding net revenue management more aggressively to our toolbox to deal with margin moving forward, and that is absolutely the plan. So 2 things. One, as we brought SKUs back into assortment, we did just that, Lauren, we did not bring back the full assortment. We took the opportunity to simplify which helps us in many areas in the cost lines and P&L, but also from a retailer perspective, optimizing their mix and leveraging their store shelf space as well as online mix in the right way. So you will see a smaller assortment. Our goal was to ensure that we had share of assortment, right, but full knowing that distribution points might come down, and we're certainly seeing that play out.
But your point moving forward is exactly right. We intend to use more net revenue management tools, which would include things like assortments and getting the mix right to drive margin over time. And all of our business units are developing plans to use that as a bigger lever moving forward."

And so what we've done now is, as they've done that, they've had some challenges more recently and we've made a decision we're going to move away from them. And so what we're doing here is we wrote off the investments we made in that supplier, which was really done to help scale them back when the pandemic first began. And at this point, we've moved our business away to other suppliers. So we think we're in good shape going forward from a production perspective.

And I know we've talked about this move to adjusted earnings last quarter, and I get the rationale to provide investors clarity. But backing out a onetime gain or a charge or impairment, I think that's different than what I'm hearing, which is backing out strategic investments for a pretty long time, 5 years after years of not doing so.
So I just -- why are these investments different from what -- because I perceive you guys to have been doing proactively for the last several -- any number of years to get you in a position where you are now seems. This seems almost normal course in Evergreen for Clorox. So I guess just more clarity on why these particular investments are unique and different enough for you to consider them nonrecurring and worthy of adjustment.

So as we mentioned, $500 million over 5 years is a big investment for us. The vast majority of that investment will go towards replacing our ERP system. So I think it is pretty typical for large ERP investments, that you typically do only once every 20 years or so to isolate that, so people can understand the investments we're making there versus the underlying performance of the business.
And then the other aspect on this investment, and Linda mentioned it, is this investment really is about the future of the company, much more so than what it's going to do to benefit our IGNITE Strategy through 2025. And so we're making some pretty significant investments here, both in replacing our ERP as well as upscaling our digital capabilities that really will start to benefit us as we move beyond 2025, our IGNITE Strategy. So we thought it's appropriate to be able to isolate these and help folks understand our underlying operating performance, which has been pretty volatile as well as the investments we're making really to set the company up for the long term."

And so as a result of that, we expect our business to be down high-single, low-double digits.
I think when we get into the back half of the year and we get back to more normalized comps, and we think we've gotten through the bulk of the demand moderation that we expect in the front half of the year, that gives us more confidence that we're going to be in a more normalized operating environment with a more normalized comparison period, that we should be back in that 3% range or so.
Linda and I continue to have tremendous confidence in the opportunity for the extra point of growth. I think a little bit of that is getting hidden by the comps we're going through and the normalization. And so that's really a short-term issue for us that we think plays out over the next 6 months. But as we look to the back half of the year, and we think we get to a more normalized environment, then I think you'll start to see the benefits we've been talking about that we continue to see going forward, that we think is really a medium- to long-term opportunity."

So we had about 1 point benefit in price within that price mix as it relates to the International pricing that we're doing. The rest of it was about 3 points of negative mix.
And that mix was, I would say, twofold, Steve, and certainly, as we talked about reintroducing additional SKUs. But the other item that we're seeing is as we now have wipes back in supply, consumers are changing in more convenient forms. So during the height of the pandemic, when we couldn't supply wipes, it increased our bleach sales in less convenient form. And now that we can produce wipes, consumers are moving back in the more convenient form of wipes versus using bleach. Ultimately, that's good for consumers. It gives them a more preferred solution, but that comes at a slightly lower mix for us. So a combination of the conversion within the product families as well as introducing additional SKUs as we get to a more normalized environment."

And following up on an earlier question, you had committed to keep prices intact during the pandemic, but what do you need to see now that your capacity is back on track and vaccinations are up?

And we had a 2-year stack of Glad on -- of 9% sales growth, and the fiscal year was up low single digits. So overall, from a sales perspective, we were happy with where we landed.
Really, it's a share disappointment that I continue to have. We want to grow market share and particularly in a category like Trash. We all see the share trends improving. So we were down about 0.9 points in the latest 52 weeks, down 0.5 points in the latest 13 and down 0.4 in the latest 4 5. So definitely trending in the right direction behind improving distribution, getting the fundamentals right, et cetera.
When it came to pricing, again, we announced pricing back in the fourth quarter, it's being implemented now. So -- and we took a larger first round than what we saw in the marketplace, to take into account what we saw from the category. And we're evaluating that again if an additional price increase is warranted. But we feel like we've made the right move on Glad. And again, we'll continue to watch that.
Innovation continues to work incredibly well in Glad, and we're committed to that program moving forward to differentiate our bags. But what we're really focused on right now is in-market execution, ensuring we have the right distribution at every retailer, implementing pricing flawlessly and then getting back to merchandising, which will be important in this category. So again, this is less of a comment overall in terms of sales, but more around winning in the market and ensuring that we have plans that grow share in the future."

As it relates to how we thought about commodity forecasts, we have projected out what we believe is a commodity environment over the course of the year. So we are not using a spot rate. And our fundamental assumption is we will see commodity costs continue to increase. In fact, we think, this quarter, we'll see them peak and then begin to moderate in the fall, late calendar year. Commodity costs will start to moderate and continue in the back half of the year.
And so this is -- and I think I mentioned on one of the earlier questions, we anticipate about 75% of the commodity cost increases we're projecting for the year, we're going to see in the front half of the year. This is going to be the most extreme comparison period. And just to give you maybe a little bit of additional information, help dimensionalize it, when you think about resin, we're projecting over a 100% increase in the cost of resin in the front half of the year. So that's the type of environment we're dealing with.
And so that's in a difficult environment, to recover that type of margin compression in the time that it's rising, but we do think we're positioned well to recover that over time. But right now, we're projecting for the full year what we think where commodities will land. So any change in that, we'll certainly update you as we learn more."

So on the demand side, as we articulated back in Q4, we definitely expected it to be bumpy this year as it came to consumer behavior, et cetera. But the good news is this quarter, given our strong position on supply, what we saw as a very successful return to merchandising with our back-to-school program and, of course, Delta impacts demand was stronger than we anticipated across the vast majority of our portfolio. So that wasn't just in our cleaning businesses, but really across the board.
We generally saw consumer mobility continue to be strong. So we haven't seen as big of an impact as people were in shelter in place before, Delta really didn't have that same impact and yet we did continue to see strong demand as people chose to stay at home more, are self continuing to work from home and are continuing to prioritize health and wellness habits, whether that be cleaning and disinfecting, taking vitamins, minerals and supplements, drinking water.
We did see a little bit, Andrea, of timing shifts from Q2 when it comes to merch and a little bit of inventory, but that wasn't the majority of what we saw from an improvement perspective, it really was based consumer demand.
I'll switch to pricing now. As we spoke about in the release, we have announced pricing on 50% of our portfolio. That sell-in continues to go well, and we're seeing execution hit market now in many of the businesses. Given the incremental costs that we're experiencing, we're taking additional action and now pricing a total of 70% of the portfolio this year. And we are beginning to implement many of those as we speak with additional actions that we're taking in the back half to be talked about at that time.
And I would say, generally, given the environment that we're experiencing across the industry, the conversations are very productive. People understand the environment and largely our peers are going as well for our categories are increasing in pricing. But no surprises. Our brands are really strong. At this point, we have the strongest consumer value score that we've ever had since we began measuring it. Our household penetration continues to look strong. Increased repeat rates, increased buy rates. So our brands are healthy. Shares are growing as a result of that, and we feel really well positioned to execute pricing on 70% of the portfolio this year."

Transportation continues to be a negative driver for us, and we're seeing that continue throughout the remainder of the fiscal year.
And although there hasn't been a big material impact directly, we're looking at labor closely given what we're seeing on pressures there. So we're taking all of that into account. We have not announced since you asked the question directly, an additional price increase on Glad. We've executed high single digits at this point, but we are evaluating an additional price increase on Glad given what we're seeing in resin. And that's been -- we long follow what happens in resin and are able to move pretty quickly on Glad. And that's something that we're contemplating as another price increase on Glad, in addition to what I talked about in the 70%."

And maybe just a little background and I talked about this in August. We benefited from about 3 to 4 points of favorable price mix through the pandemic, and we know that was temporary, primarily driven by the rationalization of our product offerings. If you recall, to increase supply availability, we produced a lot less products. They tend to be smaller single accounts. And additionally, because of lack of merchandising activity because of the lack of supply, we were generating favorable price mix for about 4 straight quarters, pretty consistently about 3- to 4-point capability.
We fully expect that to unwind as we get back to a more normalized level of supply and we get back to a more normalized level of promotional activity. That started in the fourth quarter. We had about 2 points of unfavorable price mix. It continued this quarter. We had 3 points of unable price mix. I'd expect to see that for 2 more quarters. So we'll see it in the second quarter, third quarter.
And then by the fourth quarter, I would expect to have lapped this temporary benefit. And you also see the full benefit of the pricing actions we're taking. So by the fourth quarter, I'd expect us to return to favorable price mix. And as you probably saw in our prepared remarks. We continue to expect by the back half of the year, we're going to get our sales back into the low end of our long-term sales goal, 3% to 5%. Part of that will be driven by the fact that we'll start generating positive price mix as well in the back half of the year."

And let me give you my perspective on how we see margin phasing out this year. As you recall, back in August, our expectation was that Q1 was going to be our most difficult quarter from a cost input perspective. And then we see sequential improvement in margin throughout the year. And importantly, by the fourth quarter, returning to gross margin expansion, and we identify getting back in the low 40s.
What has changed since that time are 2 things, and Linda mentioned them. We have revised our expectation on cost inputs. We originally had assumed about $300 million worth of cost inputs on commodities and transportation. We have raised that expectation now at about $350 million. As part of that, we now think we will see peak cost inputs in the second quarter versus the first quarter. That's primarily driven by resin. We have shifted out our expectations about 2 months as a result of Hurricane Ida in terms of when we'll see peak resin, so we'll see that in the second quarter.
As a result of that, I would expect this to be our most difficult quarter from a cost input perspective, I would expect our margins to be in the mid-30s. And then I expect when we get to the back half of the year based on the incremental actions we're taking, both on pricing and cost management, we'll see sequential improvements as we move through our Q3 and Q4. And we still expect to get to a point of gross margin expansion in the fourth quarter, and we still expect to be in the low 40s."

All we've done is push out that peak a couple of months this calendar year. And so that's an important assumption for us that resin prices start to go down in the back half of the year.

We thought we were going to be down low double digits for Q1. You obviously saw our results are sort of more mid-single digits. Now some of that, we think, is timing, as Linda mentioned. If you look at our performance through the quarter and primarily as a result of Delta, we saw the business really pick up in the second half of the quarter, and that continued through September. So I think we'll see a little bit of that move between quarters now as there's a little bit of retail and consumer inventory that we worked through. But I don't think that will have any impact on the full year, but you'll see a little bit of timing shifts between quarters.
For us, when we talked in August, we thought the front half would be down high single -- excuse me, low double digits to high single digits. We now think the front half will be down high single digits. So we expect a little bit better performance in the front half of the year on the top line.
And what I'd say, Steve, is I just think it's a little too early to be making any changes to our outlook. We're pleased with the start to the year. we're still only 1 quarter into the year. As you know, there's quite a few things that are outside of our control that we want to see how they play out and they've been fairly volatile. And so I like to start we've got a fairly wide range. I think that's appropriate on the top line for now. I want to get into cold and flu, see how that plays out and I want to see how the pandemic plays out before we make any changes.
As it relates to margin and profit, we did come in a little bit better. But as you said, we see that there's a -- there's more cost headwinds than we initially anticipated, about $50 million. We are taking actions between incremental pricing actions as well as increased cost savings that we think we can offset that. And so that will delay the benefits a little bit to the back half of the year. But we still believe we're on track for both our outlook and our EPS range. And again, I think it's just too early to be guiding to higher low ends or changing those outlooks. I like the start of the year. I like our plans for the balance of the year. And I really like the things we can control. But I also recognize there's a number of areas we don't control, and I want to see how those play out over the next quarter or 2."

Just that it's less conservative than what we've seen from others so far.
So I guess maybe can you -- I get 2 questions really to that. Can you give us a sense of the margin of profitability at risk if prices remain close to where they are today than what you're assuming. Is that -- can you stay within your range in that scenario? Push you to the bottom or below the bottom end of the range, that kind of thing?
And then as I think about the step-up -- the implied step up sequentially between margin and the gross margin in the mid-30s in 2Q and then presumably back up above 40 in 3Q, if my quick math is right, what are the drivers there? How much of that is resin moderating? How much of that is the pricing coming in? How much of that is the top line coming back stronger? Just give us a sense for how that step-up occurs sequentially."

I'd say the profit risk, it's hard to tell exactly what's at risk based on resin because, again, we would take actions. If the resin forecast does not play out like we expect, then we revisit our pricing plans across our portfolio to offset some portion of that. And so it's difficult to put an exact number on if resin doesn't play out to our plan.
What I would tell you, though, in terms of our resin forecast, as you can imagine, we leverage outside experts on this as well. And this is generally in line with what we're seeing from the outside experts. So it doesn't feel like it's an off-market expectation that we'll see resin prices moderate in the back half of the year.
And then a sequential step-up, as you think about what's going to drive that sequential step up in the back half of the year. The first one is commodities. We think this is going to be the most challenging quarter we have from a commodity cost input. If you look at Q1, there's about 550 basis points of headwinds on commodities. I expect Q2 is going to be closer to 600 basis points as we pushed out the resin decline a couple of months. And then you'll see commodities start to drop in the back half of the year. So you'll see some pick up there.
In addition to commodity, input costs starting to moderate, we'll start to see the full benefit of our pricing actions. It's really just in Q2, we're getting the bulk of our price increases in place. And as we talked about, we're pricing an additional 20% of our portfolio, that will be in the back half of the year. And you'll see the benefit of pricing start to step up.
You also see the benefit of our cost savings program ramp up in the back half of the year. So that will create additional benefits. And then finally, on manufacturing and logistics. As I think you folks know, we've talked about this quite a bit. we're incurring quite a bit of additional cost as we build more resiliency into our supply chain. We've increased the number of third-party manufacturers we work with. That's true with raw and packaging material suppliers as well. As demand moderates and we'll be able to take more of that production back in-house, we'll be able to step out of these relationships. That will start in the back half of the year. Now that's probably a 12- to 18-month journey to step out these charges, but you'll start to see us do that in the back half of the year. if demand moderates to the extent we expect it will. And those will be the key drivers that will support margin improvements in the back half of the year."

And that gives us additional confidence in our ability to take price and of course, what we believe will be the consumer reaction in that price increase.
As you also mentioned, we are seeing branded competitors move, and we're generally seeing price gaps in our categories aligned to what they were before pricing action took place. So nothing seems to be out of line. And we're also seeing private label pass-through pricing at this point as well. And so price gaps as it relates to store brand are also maintaining.
If we kind of just take a step back, it's one of the reasons why it's so important for us to continue to invest in our brands as we go through this period. That's why we've continued to lean into advertising spending, why we've kept up on our innovation program. And that's really helping us as we sell through, one, support the consumer as they go through this pricing change but also support us from a retail execution standpoint because there are other ways that we can help grow the category in addition to pricing.
So again, all on track. I would say elasticities will help us. But we've built that into the outlook that we've had. The assumed elasticities on that improvement is already built in, and we'll just continue to monitor it. But no surprises at this point in terms of category, other people following and what we're seeing from a price gap perspective."

So about 5% of our portfolio is on allocation at this point. So we're able to meet consumer demand across the vast majority of our portfolio. And that bodes well for getting distribution back on our core brands, which we purposely narrowed during that pandemic period, but we're beginning to expand that again, and that's going well.
And really, when we think about advertising, we are an ROI-based advertiser. We  belong -- believe in the long term, and we believe in building brands, but we're also very carefully managing how we spend that dollar. So we know the return we get on investing in innovation, the return that we get on investing in the base. And the team is always optimizing that over time. That has led to very strong ROI improvements on our advertising over time using that model. And even though we put significantly more money in and spent about 11% of sales last year, and we plan to spend 10% of sales this year, we've continued to see that ROI go up.
And what we've really been focused on is getting much more out of our digital advertising. And as part of our IGNITE Strategy, we had talked about wanting to get to know about 100 million consumers in the U.S., and that allows us to further drive efficiencies in our digital spending and effectiveness. And that is well on its way. We are halfway to that goal and that has really helped us with the ROI.
So again, it is really about thinking about the long term on the brands. We balance the spending within the brands based off of an ROI model, and we're always able to adjust as we learn more, but it is about building those brands over time and ensuring that we have superior value with consumers."

And I don't think anybody is thinking that this is going to abate or to be to a place where people are starting to think about we're in a full recovery. So I don't anticipate the back half being an issue. I think retailers will appreciate the fact that we're taking a very disciplined approach to this, and continue to partner with them to ensure that we're doing the right things for the categories. And I wouldn't anticipate there being a different environment in the back half given what we're seeing from a cost perspective.
Of course, we're being very thoughtful about that. We're building that into the consideration as we plan when we will announce pricing. But we are doing that knowing full well how our categories behave, consumer trends, key merchandising periods, et cetera. And I would say, given the fact that we continue to invest, and we're bringing retailers really strong innovation plans, they have still been a mode of partnership and continuing to build plans with us to build the categories."

As you know, we're leaning into that as one way to help us address the cost environment. It was a little bit lower in Q1. I expect that to ramp up as we move through the year. So you should expect to see greater value as we go through the year and execute some of the additional cost savings actions we're pursuing.
On the manufacturing up charges, we haven't broken that out specifically. But I can tell you there's a reasonable amount of money that we're incurring as we're leveraging third-party manufacturers and suppliers. I think I've mentioned to you in the past, historically, we have self-manufactured about 80% of our shipments, and we go to contract manufacturers for the remaining 20%. During this pandemic, that mix is more 50-50 right now. So we're relying on contract manufacturers to a much better degree to help us keep up with demand. As demand moderates, we'll be able to pull that back into our facilities and unwind some of these agreements we have in place. And there are some nice savings associated with that. And so you'll see that play out through our P&L.
As I mentioned, we'll have to see how demand plays out with anemic I believe, certainly over the -- starting in the back half of this year and over the next 12 to maybe 24 months, we'll be able to step out of those charges. But we'll get started, I think, in the back half doing that."

It goes beyond just what you'd call the co-pack profit margin, which could be up from 10% to 20% depending on the co-packer. We've had to extend our supply chain not just through contract manufacturers, but we've done that through raw and packaging material suppliers. It's becoming a much more global supply chain to build in the resiliency we need to manage through the disruptions of this environment. So not only do you have the profit margin or the profit up charge from these folks, but you've got an extended supply chain, which means increased transportation as well as we have to bring product in from further distances.
You also have increased warehousing because we're holding more inventory on hand to manage through the disruption. So there is a level of cost that's built up in our supply chain. This part of the resiliency we've built in to ensure that we can supply product we will work, I suspect, over the next 12 to 24 months to be able to pull those costs out of our system. Now a lot of that will be driven on how demand plays out. We assume demand will moderate. 
Keep in mind, our demand was plus 20% during the pandemic. We think long term is 3% to 5%. As that demand moderates, we'll be able to start pulling costs out of our supply chain, and that will happen over time.
I'll just -- I'll give you one example of how this played out, and this has happened last quarter. When we had Hurricane Ida, our largest resin provider in the Gulf region went offline for about 2 months in declare majeure. But because of the great work our product supply team did, we had increased resin inventory on hand. We had alternative suppliers qualified, and we did not miss a beat from a production perspective. And we were able to keep shipping product to our customers in spite of our largest provider going offline for the better part of the quarter. We've had to do that across our entire portfolio, and we recognize that comes with a cost, and that's the cost we're going to be able to go after, which is another reason that gives us confidence we can rebuild margins over time beyond the commodity environment improving. We know we can step out of these charges. And as I said, I think that's a year or 2 process for us to do that."

And Typically, if you look at the cash we generate, it's fairly consistent across the quarters. A little bit of a dip in Q2 because of some seasonality in our Kingsford business. But historically, we generate our cash pretty consistently across the quarters. it's going to look very different this year. In the front half, it's going to be depressed because of the reduction in net earnings. Keep in mind, we're lapping about 50%, 60% growth in net earnings last year. So earnings are down more materially in the front half of the year. That will reduce the cash we generate. And then I expect that to pick up pretty significantly in the back half of the year. In total, before the pandemic, we were generating somewhere between $900 million and $1 billion of cash on an annual basis.
I think we'll be a little bit lower this year, expected to be in the $850 million to $950 million range, primarily driven because of the increased costs will depress our earnings a bit this year. And so it will be a little bit below our normal run rate in terms of cash we generate, and then I expect that to rebound as we move into fiscal year '23."

So we knew there's going to be a tough year on substrate, on soybean oil, on resin, and that was baked into our outlook back in August.
What has changed for us based on our initial assumption is really resin has gotten worse. We think the peak resin price will push out, as we said, a couple of months. But by and large, we think we have gotten the commodity environment mostly right resin is the only one we're updating. And then transportation is the other one. I had assumed that we'd start to see transportation rates come down in the back half of the year.

So on the 30% we're choosing to not price at the moment, we're evaluating category by category, what the cost increases are. We're looking at commodity and cost justification. And there are some of our categories that have not been as impacted that are not as driven by resin and certainly might be impacted by transportation but to a lesser degree, and there's other choices that we can make. And as we've talked about, we're taking a look across the entire P&L to see where we can reduce costs. And so nobody is excluded from that. None of the businesses are excluded from that.
But as it relates to pricing, we're really looking at it category by category, looking at the cost impact and what we think will happen from a consumer standpoint and making that choice. That doesn't mean, though, of course, as we continue to navigate throughout the year, if we were to have additional pressures that we wouldn't consider pricing that additional 30%. But at this point, we think it's the best mix not to.
And then elasticities, I think it is true that consumers have turned to branded solutions during this pandemic. They want trusted solutions, and they certainly turned to our portfolio. And we've spoken about the numerous ways our portfolio has gotten stronger during this time, whether that be household penetration. Again, stronger retention in buy rates, higher repeat rates. And what we deem as the best consumer value we've seen since measuring it with 70% of our portfolio deemed superior by consumers. That has translated into stronger elasticities.
That doesn't mean though there is an elasticity impact, and I just want to make sure that's clear. They've improved, but we certainly do expect a volume impact to taking pricing. It's just to a lesser degree that we would have seen pre-pandemic. And we're watching that closely. And the reason, again, that we continue to invest to keep those elasticities holding as people move through. And just the one caveat I would continue to warn. Consumer behavior has been very difficult to predict during this pandemic. All the fundamentals look good right now, but we'll continue to see, as Kevin has articulated what happens in cold and flu, what happens through the course of the remainder of the pandemic. But at this point, we feel very confident that our brands are strong, we can take this pricing, and if that's -- those lower elasticities will hold."

So hopefully, that helps you think about the second quarter. We're lapping 27% growth again in Q2, which is what we had to lap in Q1. And also, as we mentioned, we think there's a little bit of shift of timing between Q1 and Q2. So we had very strong shipments late in Q1. We think some of that's created some additional inventory with both retailers and consumers that get worked out in the second quarter.
So I think when you consider all those items, you get to down high single digits in the front half which will put a little bit more pressure on Q2 as you have some shifting between quarters."

Thank you for taking the time to listen to our perspectives on Q1 fiscal year '22 results. We delivered solid results in our first quarter, fueled by stronger-than-expected demand for our products in the face of a volatile and challenging",903,"Hello, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to listen to our perspectives on Q1 fiscal year '22 results. We delivered solid results in our first quarter, fueled by stronger-than-expected demand for our products in the face of a volatile and challenging environment. Net sales in the first quarter decreased 6% against a very strong comparable quarter last year when we delivered sales growth of 27%. On a 2-year stack basis, sales increased 21%. Gross margin came in at 37%, reflecting significant cost inflation. Adjusted EPS decreased 54% to $1.21.
During the quarter, we continued to make progress executing our key priorities for the year, including managing inflationary headwinds through productivity improvements and pricing, improving supply, investing in our brands and driving innovation, all while advancing our ESG goals. While we expect the operating environment to remain challenging and volatile and face incremental cost headwinds, we're confident that our plans to rebuild margin, coupled with the advancement of our IGNITE Strategy, will enable us to deliver long-term value creation. With that as a backdrop, I'll share an update on some of the trends we saw in the quarter and our current expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year.
Demand in the first quarter was better than we anticipated across most of our portfolio, driven primarily by the impact of the COVID-19 Delta variant and successful back-to-school merchandising, particularly for cleaning and water filtration. We have made significant progress restoring supply in the quarter, contributing to share improvements in the majority of our portfolio, with double-digit gains in Clorox Disinfecting Wipes and Brita as well as increases in our Glad, Hidden Valley, Kingsford and RenewLife businesses.
On the cost side, we continue to see significant headwinds which impacted our margins. We continue to address these pressures head on through multiple levers, including our hallmark cost savings program and pricing actions. We're on track to implement price increases on 50% of our portfolio, most of which will take effect in November. We're also planning additional pricing actions through the end of fiscal '22, resulting in increases to about 70% of our portfolio. Importantly, we continue to anticipate gross margin expansion in our fourth quarter.
As we address these cost headwinds, we're also prioritizing strong investments behind our brands through innovation and high ROI advertising to drive differentiation and capitalize on the strong loyalty we've built to drive growth. As a result, elasticities have improved, and our household penetration and consumer loyalty remains strong across our portfolio, with higher repeat purchase rates and retained buyers compared to pre-pandemic levels.
For example, double-digit increases in back-to-school marketing spend contributed to strong consumption across Clorox-branded products, particularly wipes as well as double-digit sales growth for Brita. Also, as retail foot traffic started to increase, we leaned in with early investments behind Burt's Bees lip care, driving double-digit sales growth in Natural Personal Care. In addition, we're excited about this fiscal year's innovation program, including Fresh Step Outstretch, Kingsford Signature Flavor pellets and Neocell Collagen Powders and gummies, with more new products to come in the back half. We also continue to see strength from recent innovations, including Clorox Fabric Sanitizer, Glad with Clorox and Fresh up with Gain.
Importantly, with ESG integrated into our IGNITE Strategy, we continue to focus on making progress against our goals. Our team achieved an important milestone with the approval of our science-based targets putting us on path for net zero emissions across scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 2050.
As we think about the balance of the year, our Q1 performance plus the additional actions we're taking put us on track to meet our fiscal '22 outlook. Clearly, the cost environment is more challenging than we projected in August, and consumer demand remains difficult to predict as pandemic conditions evolve. That said, we feel confident in our ability to execute our pricing and productivity plans to mitigate these pressures and grow margin in Q4. From a top line perspective, we are maintaining our outlook given the volatile environment and continue to expect to be in the lower end of our long-term sales growth target in the back half of the fiscal year.
In summary, accelerating our performance and long-term shareholder value is at the core of our strategy. There is no doubt we will continue to face a volatile and challenging environment with elevated cost pressures, consumer demand uncertainty, and supply chain disruption. However, based on the actions we've taken, we're facing these headwinds from a position of strength. Strong investments behind our portfolio have led to superior consumer value of our brands which is evident in continued strength in household penetration, consumer loyalty and improved elasticities, all of which support our efforts to rebuild profitable growth over time.
We have a portfolio of leading brands with long-term macro tailwinds supported by strong demand-building investments that we are confident will drive growth. We also believe our investments to accelerate our digital transformation will position us well longer term by strengthening our supply chain, digital commerce, innovation and brand-building efforts. I'd like to thank my Clorox teammates around the world for their continued dedication to living our purpose and serving our consumers, customers and communities around the world.

We're pleased with our first quarter performance with higher-than-expected consumer demand across our portfolio in the face of a challenging operating environment. Importantly, we grew or held market share across the vast majority of our portfolio, with double-digit increases for Clorox disinfecting wipes and Brita water filters. While we continue to operate in a volatile environment, including significant cost headwinds, we are taking appropriate mitigating actions as we continue to invest in our IGNITE Strategy in support of driving long-term value creation.
Now turning to our first quarter results. First quarter net sales decreased 6% compared to 27% growth in the year ago quarter, delivering a 2-year stack of 21%. Our net sales results reflected a 2-point decline in volume, 3 points of unfavorable price mix and 1 point of unfavorable foreign currencies. Although the impact of pricing was positive, it was more than offset by unfavorable mix primarily in our health and wellness segment as continued supply improvements resulted in a return to more normalized product assortment, including the reintroduction of value packs and a return to merchandising. On an organic basis, first quarter sales declined 5%.
Gross margin for the quarter decreased 1,090 basis points to 37% compared to a record gross margin of 48% in the year ago quarter. when we benefited from 400 basis points of favorable operating leverage. First quarter gross margin was driven primarily by significantly higher cost headwinds, including 550 basis points of higher commodity costs, and 470 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs. Gross margin results also included 260 basis points of unfavorable mix. These factors were partially offset by the benefit of 90 basis points of cost savings.
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales came in at 13% compared to 12% in the year ago quarter, reflecting strategic investments in the long-term enhancements to our digital capabilities and productivity initiatives that we discussed last quarter.
Advertising and sales promotion investment levels as a percentage of net sales came in at about 10% compared to 9% in the year ago quarter, with U.S. retail spending at about 11%. Our first quarter effective tax rate was 23% versus 21% in the year ago quarter. The prior period tax rate of 21% was primarily due to the benefit from a nontaxable portion of the remeasurement gain recognized on our previously held stake in our Saudi joint venture.
Net of these factors, adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter came in at $1.21 versus $2.63 in the year-ago quarter, a decline of 54%. As we noted in our press release, adjusted EPS excludes $0.07 of impact related to the strategic investments we spoke about.
As you saw in our earnings release, net cash provided by operations was $41 million versus $383 million in the year ago quarter, a decrease of 89%, primarily driven by lower first quarter earnings and higher working capital.
Now turning to our FY '22 outlook. As Linda mentioned, we're holding our fiscal year '22 outlook. We're pleased with the strength of our first quarter top line, which was better than our previous assumptions. Importantly, we feel good about our demand-building plans to support our return to the low end of our long-term net sales growth target in the back half of the fiscal year. At the same time, we're facing an even tougher cost environment than previously expected. We have strong cost mitigation plans in place, and we plan to take additional actions, including more pricing, resulting in increases to about 70% of our portfolio. Of course, we continue to operate in a challenging environment that is difficult to predict, which could impact our full year outlook. We continue to anticipate fiscal year net sales to be down 2% to 6%, reflecting ongoing demand moderation in the front half of the fiscal year, in addition to unfavorable price mix as we move to a more normalized supply and promotional environment.
We assume these factors will be partially offset by pricing actions we're taking broadly across our portfolio. Based on the stronger-than-expected start of the fiscal year, we now expect front half net sales to decline high single digits as we lap 27% growth in the front half of fiscal year '21, recognizing some degree of timing from the over-delivery in the first quarter. As I just mentioned, we continue to expect to return to the lower end of our long-term sales growth target in the back half of the fiscal year. On an organic basis, we also continue to expect full year sales to be down 2% to 6%.
We continue to expect fiscal year gross margin to be down 300 to 400 basis points. While we're holding our gross margin outlook, this does reflect our expectation for increased cost headwinds, primarily in resin and transportation. We continue to expect resin cost to moderate in the back half of the year, although later than our previous assumptions due to the impacts from Hurricane Ida. Additionally, we now project transportation costs remain elevated for the majority of the fiscal year. due to the ongoing imbalance of supply and demand in this market.
As a result, we're raising our expected cost increases in commodities and transportation to be about $350 million versus our previous assumption of about $300 million. We continue to expect these headwinds to be more pronounced in the front half of the fiscal year. Importantly, we continue to expect gross margin improvements in the back half of the fiscal year with a return to gross margin expansion in the fourth quarter. This is based on our assumption that commodity costs will begin to moderate, and we'll see the benefits from our mitigating actions, including additional pricing flow more fully through our P&L. We continue to expect fiscal selling and administrative expenses to be about 15% of net sales, which includes about 1 point of impact related to our investments to enhance our digital capabilities.
We continue to anticipate fiscal year advertising spending to be about 10% of net sales, reflecting our ongoing commitment to invest behind our brands and build market share. We continue to expect our fiscal year tax rate to be about 22% to 23%. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects lapping several onetime benefits in the prior fiscal year. Net of these factors, we continue to anticipate fiscal year adjusted EPS to be between $5.40 to $5.70, a decrease between 26% to 21%.
As I mentioned earlier, we continue to operate in a volatile environment with significant cost headwinds that we believe will persist longer than our previous assumptions. We believe the actions we're taking to address these headwinds will keep us on track to begin rebuilding margins in the fourth quarter and deliver our fiscal year '22 outlook.
As we manage through these near-term challenges, we are continuing to invest strongly in our brands, particularly behind a robust innovation program and our efforts to engage consumers to build lifetime loyalty to our brands. Thank you."

Hopefully, you found our prepared remarks and this new earnings format helpful. 
We're off to a solid start to fiscal 2022 with stronger-than-anticipated demand across our portfolio and focused execution in a challenging operating environment. We've made meaningful progress on our strategic priorities this quarter, including restoring supply across much of our portfolio, which has enabled us to hold or gain market share in the vast majority of our businesses. We are proactively addressing the inflationary and cost headwinds that are impacting our margins through pricing and cost reduction initiatives. And at the same time, we're making important investments in our business to strengthen our competitive advantages and position the company for long-term success, including advancing our innovation pipeline, deploying our targeted advertising and sales promotion strategy and investing in critical digital capabilities.
Given our Q1 performance and the actions we are taking, we are reiterating our fiscal '22 outlook. 
With that, Kevin and I would like to open the line for questions."

I'll start with the demand piece, and I'll get into pricing and Kevin can talk about mix. So on the demand side, as we articulated back in Q4, we definitely expected it to be bumpy this year as it came to consumer behavior, et cetera. But the good news is this quarter, given our strong position on supply, what we saw as a very successful return to merchandising with our back-to-school program and, of course, Delta impacts, demand was stronger than we anticipated across the vast majority of our portfolio. So that wasn't just in our cleaning businesses, but really across the board.
We generally saw consumer mobility continue to be strong. So we haven't seen as big of an impact as people were in shelter in place before. Delta really didn't have that same impact and yet we did continue to see strong demand as people chose to stay at home more, are self continuing to work from home and are continuing to prioritize health and wellness habits, whether that be cleaning and disinfecting, taking vitamins, minerals and supplements, drinking water. We did see a little bit, Andrea, of timing shifts from Q2 when it comes to merch and a little bit of inventory, but that wasn't the majority of what we saw from an improvement perspective, it really was based consumer demand.
I'll switch to pricing now. As we spoke about in the release, we have announced pricing on 50% of our portfolio. That sell-in continues to go well, and we're seeing execution hit market now in many of the businesses. Given the incremental costs that we're experiencing, we're taking additional action and now pricing a total of 70% of the portfolio this year. And we are beginning to implement many of those as we speak with additional actions that we're taking in the back half to be talked about at that time.
And I would say, generally, given the environment that we're experiencing across the industry, the conversations are very productive. People understand the environment and largely our peers are going as well for our categories are increasing in pricing. But no surprises. Our brands are really strong. At this point, we have the strongest consumer value score that we've ever had since we began measuring it. Our household penetration continues to look strong. Increased repeat rates, increased buy rates. So our brands are healthy. Shares are growing as a result of that, and we feel really well positioned to execute pricing on 70% of the portfolio this year."

Commodities is one and certainly additional pressure on resin. Hurricane Ida pushed out the resin curve by a month or 2, and so we're seeing a continued impact there. Transportation continues to be a negative driver for us, and we're seeing that continue throughout the remainder of the fiscal year.
And although there hasn't been a big material impact directly, we're looking at labor closely given what we're seeing on pressures there. So we're taking all of that into account. We have not announced since you asked the question directly, an additional price increase on Glad. We've executed high single digits at this point, but we are evaluating an additional price increase on Glad given what we're seeing in resin. And that's been -- we long follow what happens in resin and are able to move pretty quickly on Glad. And that's something that we're contemplating as another price increase on Glad, in addition to what I talked about in the 70%."

We benefited from about 3 to 4 points of favorable price mix through the pandemic, and we know that was temporary primarily driven by the rationalization of our product offerings. If you recall, to increase supply availability, we produced a lot less products. They tend to be smaller single accounts. And additionally, because of lack of merchandising activity because of the lack of supply, we were generating favorable price mix for about 4 straight quarters, pretty consistently about 3- to 4-point capability.
We fully expect that to unwind as we get back to a more normalized level of supply and we get back to a more normalized level of promotional activity. That started in the fourth quarter. We had about 2 points of unfavorable price mix. It continued this quarter. We had 3 points of unfavorable price mix. I'd expect to see that for 2 more quarters. So we'll see it in the second quarter, third quarter. And then by the fourth quarter, I would expect to have lapped this temporary benefit. And you also see the full benefit of the pricing actions we're taking. So by the fourth quarter, I'd expect us to return to favorable price mix. 
And as you probably saw in our prepared remarks. We continue to expect by the back half of the year, we're going to get our sales back into the low end of our long-term sales goal, 3% to 5%. Part of that will be driven by the fact that we'll start generating positive price mix as well in the back half of the year."

Clearly, the first quarter came in slightly better than you had anticipated from at least from a gross margin perspective, and you're expecting sequential improvement. But is there any way to help us maybe quantify that sequential improvement from here as pricing builds? And how much expansion you actually expect in the fourth quarter? I mean, I guess what I'm really trying to get at is how should we really think about the margin recovery, and frankly, how quickly can we get back to the mid-40% range?"

And let me give you my perspective on how we see margin phasing out this year. As you recall, back in August, our expectation was that Q1 was going to be our most difficult quarter from a cost input perspective. And then we see sequential improvement in margin throughout the year. And importantly, by the fourth quarter, returning to gross margin expansion, and we identify getting back in the low 40s.
What has changed since that time are 2 things, and Linda mentioned them. We have revised our expectation on cost inputs. We originally had assumed about $300 million worth of cost inputs on commodities and transportation. We have raised that expectation now at about $350 million. As part of that, we now think we will see peak cost inputs in the second quarter versus the first quarter. That's primarily driven by resin. We have shifted out our expectations about 2 months as a result of Hurricane Ida in terms of when we'll see peak resin, so we'll see that in the second quarter.
As a result of that, I would expect this to be our most difficult quarter from a cost input perspective. I would expect our margins to be in the mid-30s. And then I expect when we get to the back half of the year, based on the incremental actions we're taking, both on pricing and cost management, we'll see sequential improvements as we move through our Q3 and Q4. And we still expect to get to a point of gross margin expansion in the fourth quarter, and we still expect to be in the low 40s."

When we talked back in August, we assume we'd see resin peak in this calendar year and then start to moderate. We still hold that same expectation. All we've done is push out that peak a couple of months this calendar year. And so that's an important assumption for us that resin prices start to go down in the back half of the year. But assuming it plays out like we expect, yes, we expect to see some material margin improvements in the back half of the year."

We thought we were going to be down low double digits for Q1. You obviously saw our results are sort of more mid-single digits. Now some of that, we think, is timing, as Linda mentioned. If you look at our performance through the quarter and primarily as a result of Delta, we saw the business really pick up in the second half of the quarter, and that continued through September. So I think we'll see a little bit of that move between quarters now as there's a little bit of retail and consumer inventory that we worked through. But I don't think that will have any impact on the full year, but you'll see a little bit of timing shifts between quarters.
For us, when we talked in August, we thought the front half would be down high single -- excuse me, low double digits to high single digits. We now think the front half will be down high single digits. So we expect a little bit better performance in the front half of the year on the top line.
And what I'd say, Steve, is I just think it's a little too early to be making any changes to our outlook. We're pleased with the start to the year. We're still only 1 quarter into the year. As you know, there's quite a few things that are outside of our control that we want to see how they play out and they've been fairly volatile. And so I like the start. We've got a fairly wide range. I think that's appropriate on the top line for now. I want to get into cold and flu, see how that plays out and I want to see how the pandemic plays out before we make any changes.
As it relates to margin and profit, we did come in a little bit better. But as you said, we see that there's a -- there's more cost headwinds than we initially anticipated, about $50 million. We are taking actions between incremental pricing actions as well as increased cost savings that we think we can offset that. And so that will delay the benefits a little bit to the back half of the year. But we still believe we're on track for both our outlook and our EPS range. And again, I think it's just too early to be guiding to higher low ends or changing those outlooks. 
I like the start of the year. I like our plans for the balance of the year. And I really like the things we can control. But I also recognize there's a number of areas we don't control, and I want to see how those play out over the next quarter or 2."

And I guess maybe a follow-up on just the resin outlook that you just mentioned earlier. I guess I was a little surprised to see you hold to continued expectation of resins and commodities moderating. I'm not saying it's wrong. I mean who knows. Just that it's less conservative than what we've seen from others so far.
So I guess maybe can you -- I get 2 questions really to that. Can you give us a sense of the margin of profitability at risk if prices remain close to where they are today than what you're assuming? Is that -- can you stay within your range in that scenario? Is it pushing you to the bottom or below the bottom end of the range, that kind of thing?
And then as I think about the step up -- the implied step up sequentially between margin and the gross margin in the mid-30s in 2Q and then presumably back up above 40 in 3Q, if my quick math is right, what are the drivers there? How much of that is resin moderating? How much of that is the pricing coming in? How much of that is the top line coming back stronger? Just give us a sense for how that step-up occurs sequentially."

I'd say the profit risk, it's hard to tell exactly what's at risk based on resin because, again, we would take actions. If the resin forecast does not play out like we expect, then we revisit our pricing plans across our portfolio to offset some portion of that. And so it's difficult to put an exact number on if resin doesn't play out to our plan.
What I would tell you, though, in terms of our resin forecast, as you can imagine, we leverage outside experts on this as well. And this is generally in line with what we're seeing from the outside experts. So it doesn't feel like it's an off-market expectation that we'll see resin prices moderate in the back half of the year. And then a sequential step-up, as you think about what's going to drive that sequential step up in the back half of the year. The first one is commodities. We think this is going to be the most challenging quarter we have from a commodity cost input. If you look at Q1, there's about 550 basis points of headwinds on commodities. I expect Q2 is going to be closer to 600 basis points as we pushed out the resin decline a couple of months. And then you'll see commodities start to drop in the back half of the year. So you'll see some pick up there.
In addition to commodity, input costs starting to moderate. We'll start to see the full benefit of our pricing actions. It's really just in Q2, we're getting the bulk of our price increases in place. And as we talked about, we're pricing an additional 20% of our portfolio, that will be in the back half of the year. And you'll see the benefit of pricing start to step up. You also see the benefit of our cost savings program ramp up in the back half of the year. So that will create additional benefits. 
And then finally, on manufacturing and logistics. As I think you folks know, we've talked about this quite a bit. We're incurring quite a bit of additional cost as we build more resiliency into our supply chain. We've increased the number of third-party manufacturers we work with. That's true with raw and packaging material suppliers as well. As demand moderates and we'll be able to take more of that production back in-house, we'll be able to step out of these relationships. That will start in the back half of the year. Now that's probably a 12- to 18-month journey to step out these charges, but you'll start to see us do that in the back half of the year if demand moderates to the extent we expect it will. And those will be the key drivers that will support margin improvements in the back half of the year."

And that gives us additional confidence in our ability to take price and, of course, what we believe will be the consumer reaction in that price increase. As you also mentioned, we are seeing branded competitors move, and we're generally seeing price gaps in our categories aligned to what they were before pricing action took place. So nothing seems to be out of line. And we're also seeing private label pass-through pricing at this point as well. And so price gaps as it relates to store brand are also maintaining.
If we kind of just take a step back, it's one of the reasons why it's so important for us to continue to invest in our brands as we go through this period. That's why we continue to lean into advertising spending, why we've kept up on our innovation program. And that's really helping us as we sell through, one, support the consumer as they go through this pricing change but also support us from a retail execution standpoint because there are other ways that we can help grow the category in addition to pricing.
So again, all on track. I would say elasticities will help us. But we've built that into the outlook that we've had. The assumed elasticities on that improvement is already built in, and we'll just continue to monitor it. But no surprises at this point in terms of category, other people following and what we're seeing from a price gap perspective."

And that bodes well for getting distribution back on our core brands, which we purposely narrowed during that pandemic period, but we're beginning to expand that again, and that's going well.
And really, when we think about advertising, we are an ROI-based advertiser. We  belong in the -- believe in the long term, and we believe in building brands, but we're also very carefully managing how we spend that dollar. So we know in the return we get on investing in innovation, the return that we get on investing in the base. And the team is always optimizing that over time. That has led to very strong ROI improvements on our advertising over time using that model. And even though we put significantly more money in and spent about 11% of sales last year, and we plan to spend 10% of sales this year, we've continued to see that ROI go up.
And what we've really been focused on is getting much more out of our digital advertising. And as part of our IGNITE Strategy, we had talked about wanting to get to know about 100 million consumers in the U.S., and that allows us to further drive efficiencies in our digital spending and effectiveness. And that is well on its way. We are halfway to that goal and that has really helped us with the ROI.
So again, it is really about thinking about the long term on the brands. We balance the spending within the brands based off of an ROI model, and we're always able to adjust as we learn more, but it is about building those brands over time and ensuring that we have superior value with consumers."

And frankly, we have all of that ready now. We've been evaluating that and would be ready to go if additional increases were warranted.
We'd, of course, want to balance that to ensure that we don't get out of whack with price gaps and to ensure that we continue to support our innovation, et cetera. And then, of course, we're always looking for ways to reduce costs, and we would continue to put focus there through everything that we possibly can do.

And I guess if you put all that together, why would you expect to only be at the low end of your long-term target? I guess is question one.
And then secondly, does that have to do with timing of when the pricing comes into the market? Maybe it's more Q4 weighted. So just any perspective around that? And if it's just ever early, then I suppose that's reasonable. But I just want to make sure I'm not missing something there."

We're continuing to see that cost environment ramp up. And I don't think anybody is thinking that this is going to abate or to be to a place where people are starting to think about we're in a full recovery. So I don't anticipate the back half being an issue. I think retailers will appreciate the fact that we're taking a very disciplined approach to this, and continue to partner with them to ensure that we're doing the right things for the categories. And I wouldn't anticipate there being a different environment in the back half given what we're seeing from a cost perspective.
Of course, we're being very thoughtful about that. We're building that into the consideration as we plan when we will announce pricing. But we are doing that knowing full well how our categories behave, consumer trends, key merchandising periods, et cetera. And I would say, given the fact that we continue to invest, and we're bringing retailers really strong innovation plans, they have still been a mode of partnership and continuing to build plans with us to build the categories."

As you know, we're leaning into that as one way to help us address the cost environment. It was a little bit lower in Q1. I expect that to ramp up as we move through the year. So you should expect to see greater value as we go through the year and execute some of the additional cost savings actions we're pursuing.
On the manufacturing up charges, we haven't broken that out specifically. But I can tell you there's a reasonable amount of money that we're incurring as we're leveraging third-party manufacturers and suppliers. I think I've mentioned to you in the past, historically, we have self-manufactured about 80% of our shipments, and we go to contract manufacturers for the remaining 20%. During this pandemic, that mix is more 50-50 right now. So we're relying on contract manufacturers to a much better degree to help us keep up with demand. As demand moderates, we'll be able to pull that back into our facilities and unwind some of these agreements we have in place. And there are some nice savings associated with that. And so you'll see that play out through our P&L.
As I mentioned, we'll have to see how demand plays out with the pandemic. I believe, certainly over the -- starting in the back half of this year and over the next 12 to maybe 24 months, we'll be able to step out of those charges. But we'll get started, I think, in the back half doing that."

It goes beyond just what you'd call the co-pack profit margin, which could be up from 10% to 20% depending on the co-packer. We've had to extend our supply chain not just through contract manufacturers, but we've done that through raw and packaging material suppliers. It's becoming a much more global supply chain to build in the resiliency we need to manage through the disruptions of this environment. So not only do you have the profit margin or the profit up charge from these folks, but you've got an extended supply chain, which means increased transportation as well as we have to bring product in from further distances.
You also have increased warehousing because we're holding more inventory on hand to manage through the disruption. So there is a level of cost that's built up in our supply chain. This part of the resiliency we've built in to ensure that we can supply product we will work, I suspect, over the next 12 to 24 months to be able to pull those costs out of our system. Now a lot of that will be driven on how the demand plays out. We assume demand will moderate. Keep in mind, our demand was plus 20% during the pandemic. We think long term is 3% to 5%. As that demand moderates, we'll be able to start pulling costs out of our supply chain, and that will happen over time.
I'll just -- I'll give you one example of how this played out, and this has happened last quarter. When we had Hurricane Ida, our largest resin provider in the Gulf region went offline for about 2 months and declared a force majeure. But because of the great work our product supply team did, we had increased resin inventory on hand. We had alternative suppliers qualified, and we did not miss a beat from a production perspective. And we were able to keep shipping product to our customers in spite of our largest provider going offline for the better part of the quarter. We've had to do that across our entire portfolio, and we recognize that comes with a cost, and that's the cost we're going to be able to go after, which is another reason that gives us confidence we can rebuild margins over time beyond the commodity environment improving. We know we can step out of these charges. And as I said, I think that's a year or 2 process for us to do that."

Typically, if you look at the cash we generate, it's fairly consistent across the quarters. A little bit of a dip in Q2 because of some seasonality in our Kingsford business. But historically, we generate our cash pretty consistently across the quarters. It's going to look very different this year. In the front half, it's going to be depressed because of the reduction in net earnings. Keep in mind, we're lapping about 50%, 60% growth in net earnings last year. So earnings are down more materially in the front half of the year. That will reduce the cash we generate. And then I expect that to pick up pretty significantly in the back half of the year. 
In total, before the pandemic, we were generating somewhere between $900 million and $1 billion of cash on an annual basis. I think we'll be a little bit lower this year, expected to be in the $850 million to $950 million range primarily driven because the increased costs will depress our earnings a bit this year. And so it will be a little bit below our normal run rate in terms of cash we generate, and then I expect that to rebound as we move into fiscal year '23."

So we knew there's going to be a tough year on substrate, on soybean oil, on resin, and that was baked into our outlook back in August.
What has changed for us based on our initial assumption is really resin has gotten worse. We think the peak resin price will push out, as we said, a couple of months. But by and large, we think we have gotten the commodity environment mostly right. Resin is the only one we're updating. And then transportation is the other one. I had assumed that we'd start to see transportation rates come down in the back half of the year.

So on the 30% we're choosing to not price at the moment, we're evaluating category by category, what the cost increases are. We're looking at commodity and cost justification. And there are some of our categories that have not been as impacted that are not as driven by resin and certainly might be impacted by transportation but to a lesser degree, and there's other choices that we can make. And as we've talked about, we're taking a look across the entire P&L to see where we can reduce costs. And so nobody is excluded from that. None of the businesses are excluded from that.
But as it relates to pricing, we're really looking at it category by category, looking at the cost impact and what we think will happen from a consumer standpoint and making that choice. That doesn't mean, though, of course, as we continue to navigate throughout the year, if we were to have additional pressures that we wouldn't consider pricing that additional 30%. But at this point, we think it's the best mix not to.
And then elasticities, I think it is true that consumers have turned to branded solutions during this pandemic. They want trusted solutions, and they certainly turned to our portfolio. And we've spoken about the numerous ways our portfolio has gotten stronger during this time, whether that be household penetration. Again, stronger retention in buy rates, higher repeat rates. And what we deem as the best consumer value we've seen since measuring it with 70% of our portfolio deemed superior by consumers. That has translated into stronger elasticities.
That doesn't mean though there is an elasticity impact, and I just want to make sure that's clear. They've improved, but we certainly do expect a volume impact to taking pricing. It's just with a lesser degree that we would have seen prepandemic. And we're watching that closely. And the reason, again, that we continue to invest to keep those elasticities holding as people move through. 
And just the one caveat I would continue to warn. Consumer behavior has been very difficult to predict during this pandemic. All the fundamentals look good right now, but we'll continue to see, as Kevin has articulated what happens in cold and flu, what happens through the course of the remainder of the pandemic. But at this point, we feel very confident that our brands are strong. We can take this pricing, and if that's -- those lower elasticities will hold."

I mean we saw a double-digit growth in a number of our businesses, including our wipes business, Burt's Bees, Cat Litter, and mid-single-digit growth in another of our large businesses, including Glad and Brita. So I feel, overall, very good about international.
Depending on the market, we're seeing significant pricing pass-through in some of markets which -- so we're taking double-digit pricing in places in international, and that's gone well to date. But we're really leaning into those growth levers we have in international. I would say depending on the market is -- to the degree which the pandemic is impacting that, and you can appreciate, given we compete in over 100 markets, it's very different by market. But generally, we're seeing cleaning behaviors continue to persist across the globe where people are cleaning more and more concerned about their health and wellness. And we're taking advantage of that across our portfolio to deliver innovation, to continuing to invest in our brands and expand our distribution. 
So I think to your point, international did perform well. We do have some tough comps coming up here again in Q2. But we have strong plans, and our brands are growing share in the markets that we compete in."

As we've said, we think our sales will be down high single digits in the front half of the year. So hopefully, that helps you think about the second quarter. We're lapping 27% growth again in Q2, which is what we had to lap in Q1. And also, as we mentioned, we think there's a little bit of shift of timing between Q1 and Q2. So we had very strong shipments late in Q1. We think some of that's created some additional inventory with both retailers and consumers that get worked out in the second quarter.
So I think when you consider all those items, you get to down high single digits in the front half which will put a little bit more pressure on Q2 as you have some shifting between quarters."
