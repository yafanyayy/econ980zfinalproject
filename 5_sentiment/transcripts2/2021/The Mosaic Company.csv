Last week, the Department of Commerce announced final duty rates in the CVD case, having adjusted them from the preliminary rates that we announced in November, the final rates are about 20% for OCP, 9% for Phosagro and 47% for Euro count. We really appreciate the work the Department of Commerce has done in this investigation and its efforts to enforce our trade laws. We're closely reviewing their findings to determine whether additional upward adjustments are required. Also last week, the international trade commission held its public full day hearing. The ITC is charged with determining whether the subject imports caused injury to the U.S. phosphate industry. We continue to believe that our injury case is compelling, especially given the undeniable surge in imports during the relevant period. 
The price effects of those imports and the resulting harm to the U.S. industry, which manifests itself in plant curtailments and closures, job losses and reduction in market share, production capacity and revenue. We're thankful for the ITC's work on this case, and we look forward to his vote on or above March 11. 
In terms of the current and expected imports into the U.S., we've seen the expected trade flow shifts, such that the U.S. market continues to be well served with phosphates. Our main concern is that wherever the supply comes from, it needs to be fairly priced and not priced based on highly subsidized production that comes at the expense of a free and fair market."

Maybe I'll start with the second question and then move back to Jonas' question afterwards. So related to the tax benefit associated with the Vale acquisitions, when we acquired the Brazil business in 2018. It came with certain tax assets. That we ended up having to put a valuation allowance against, given the historic profitability of that subsidiary, that just according to GAAP rules. What's now transpired is that, that the profitability of that subsidiary has improved to the point where under GAAP accounting, we can now remove that valuation allowance and affected our GAAP earnings for the year. 
Now to Jonas' question around our effective tax rate for the year, we actually realized some foreign tax benefits in the fourth quarter that we had originally thought would be temporary in nature and reported on the balance sheet. But as we concluded our analysis, we got our opinions and finished our work. It became apparent that those foreign tax benefits were going to be permanent. And when that's the case, you need to take it through the income statement through P&L on the tax line. When we look at where our earnings and earnings mix came out for the year, which provided a lot -- quite a bit of volatility in our rate last year. All of that came out as expected but as we again concluded our work on these foreign tax benefits and recognize that they were going to be eminent, we ended up needing to, again, run that through the tax line, and that's what brought our effective tax rate down to the level that we recorded. 
As we go forward into 2021, a couple of things to keep in mind. First, the foreign tax benefits that we recognized in 2020, we expect that to continue to benefit our rate in future years. The other thing to keep in mind is that the better our phosphate business does, the more income is generated in the United States, which is our lowest tax jurisdiction. So the better that business performs, the lower our rate should go."

Soft commodity prices are at multiyear highs, and the expectation is that these strong ag economics will continue. So what that applies for us is continuing strong demand for fertilizers as farmers seek to maximize their production. Our quarter 4 shipments were definitely strong and they lowered our inventories even further, which means that we will be constrained by production capacity as we move into 2021. That said, our phosphate volumes are expected to include up to 150,000 tonnes from our joint venture, MWSPC, and we will bring to NOLA that as we work to meet the U.S. customer needs. As a result, we expect our quarter 1 shipments to be in line with historical performance as we work to meet what is pretty strong demand despite the strong volumes we saw in quarter 4. 
A few extra things to consider. In both prostates and potash, we will maximize our production at operating facilities, but we don't expect to be able to build our own inventories prior to the North American spring season. We believe channel inventories across products and regions are lower than normal. Which minimizes the potential for deferrals of fertilizer needed for upcoming seasons. We expect to keep more of our U.S. phosphate production here in the U.S. to meet those customer needs."

Look, I think the surprising outcome here is really centered around the India contract, where BPC was the first mover. And as you've heard from other suppliers, including Canpotex, settled at a price that was, what we believe, lower than what market fundamentals were pointing towards. From our perspective, the price doesn't represent the reality we're seeing or the tightness of the market and pricing and other jurisdictions highlights this. I can only speculate as to what motivated BPC to do that. But given the political uncertainty in Belarus over the last year, there may have been nonmarket drivers that played into it. 
In terms of Mosaic, given that we sell internationally through Canpotex, we're going to allow Canpotex to do what it was set up to do. And therefore, we won't be negotiating contracts on our own or on calls like this. But it is important to keep in mind that contracts involve, prices, volumes, grades and durations. Not to mention any number of other terms, which can impact producer economics and which we believe will come into play given how tight the market is. We would expect Canpotex to take a holistic view as it interacts with Chinese and Indian buyers."

From a capacity standpoint, we believe capacity was reduced by -- in 2020 by roughly 1 million tonnes year-over-year, both due to closures and product mix shifting. This was in line with our expectations, and we'd characterize that magnitude is significant. It is expected that in 2021, capacity is going to be stable, but at the same time, domestic demand is likely to increase once again. And our fairly conservative export forecast may be too high. The Chinese government has indicated the desire to increase phosphate operating rates. Our analysis already points to a relatively high operating rate in the Chinese effective capacity. So even if we were to assume a dramatic step higher in Chinese utilization of, say, 5 percentage points. That would increase export availability by no more than 1 million tonnes. And upside growth in domestic demand could easily absorb a portion of those times."

Look, on the U.S. specifically, as we've said before, we do expect the trade flows are going to adjust and find a new normal after the final determination of the CVD petition next month. Now U.S. and international prices will have to be basically at parity adjusted for things like freight differentials. So in other words, if the U.S. prices are high, it will bring in new imports. And if U.S. prices are more parity with the markets, maybe people will be less inclined imports. So prices will take care of it. Trade will work as trade is supposed to work. And we expect that, that convergence will take place somewhere in 2021. More generally on global pricing, markets are efficient at finding equilibrium. It appears that demand is on very solid footing, given the recent commodity ag commodity prices, but a few seasons of above trend yields could calm those markets and slow demand growth. And we can never forget the potential impact of weather on both yields and our ability to apply fertilizers. Now we are expecting current prices to modestly lower demand in India given the current subsidy scheme."

Instead, the government basically shifted their focus to ensure production or production to meet the domestic demand and replacing part of the import as they attempted to in terms of the fertilizer demand implication, based on the academics recommendation, also the recommendation from Ministry of Agriculture there's a very clear indication Potash should be interest in terms of the application in China, along with some of the secondary nutrients and the micronutrient. In terms of the indication to phosphate, there was a very clear indication that the farmer needs to manage their application to phosphate. And we've seen fast speed demand reduced over the last 5 years. However, that responded in 2020. We foresee this is going to continue in 2021 onwards. Basically, the farmers are going to apply phosphate in more appropriate way. Nitrogen is a different story. It's a very clear indication to reduce the supply. Back to the supply situation, China, as a country, they are self-sufficient for the production of phosphate and nitrogen. There, we have not seen policy support to -- from the government to encourage more capacity to be built in these 2 new trends. Potash, China needs to relay on input and they have limited reserve or hard to explore to reserve. So we believe, as a country, they still need to continue to import our potash as they grow the demand and also to support their agriculture production."

So technically, I guess they're not related, but I suppose there's got to be some element of relationship that says, well, if you have subsidized material coming in and it harms you that there's a problem. So technically, I don't believe they're related directly. In terms of the equity loss, most of that is Ma'aden and I think we've talked about before where Ma'aden is delayed by 1 quarter. So we report our equity earnings or losses from Ma'aden a quarter in arrears. And so if you look at the global price of phosphates today, I would expect certainly a much lower equity loss or for that to turn to a gain at some point. But again, that would be my expectation."

In terms of lag and sulfur, there's also a lag for both sulfur, for ammonia. What I would point you to there, I guess, is just the the requirement. Our need for ammonia represents about [indiscernible] tonnes per tonnes of DAT produced. Our use of sulfur represents about 0.4 tonnes of sulfur for every ton of DAT produced. So as you can see what that means, if sulfur moves from the $60 to the $90 some that it's at today, a $30 increase in sulfur is going to add something like a $12 increase to our overall price. So in sulfur, you should be able to take fairly much the Gulf price or our quarterly price and work that in. In terms of ammonia, again, same thing, except that, obviously, we produce 1/3 of our ammonia. So that is at normal cost. 1/3 of our ammonia is 1/3 or so of our ammonia is produced by CF on a long-term contract. And then we only buy about 1/4 to 1/3 of our ammonia on spot.

I guess what I would say is those sales once made are what they are, and they don't affect the other -- the rest of the SMB. So if they have below market sales, and we're seeing this with the India, China, that it really has not impacted other sales because people need the product.

We've talked about this before, where the K3 project has run significantly ahead of schedule. And it looks like, I think we'll be telling you soon probably slightly under budget. So for a 10-year project or an 8-y",330,"Yes. Thanks, Michael. It's a great topic. We've talked about this before, where the K3 project has run significantly ahead of schedule. And it looks like, I think we'll be telling you soon probably slightly under budget. So for a 10-year project or an 8-year project, that's a pretty pleasing outcome. In terms of the design, we expected to produce an extra million tonnes of potash from K3 when it was at full production. That amounts to about 3 million tonnes of incremental ore. So when we say will be up to 3 million tonnes. That means we'll be running virtually the whole incremental capacity of K3. Now what happens after that is K3 slowly takes over all production at the Esterhazy facility over the next couple of years. And what does that do for cost, the cost of, first of all, the cost of production instead of producing it, let's say, at a Colonsay, we have all the fixed costs. This is all coming in as incremental tonnes. And this is a good part of the reason why we believe our cash cost for mining is going -- at Esterhazy is going to end up somewhere below $60 a tonne, probably in that $50 to $60 a tonne range. And that will really drive costs out of our system, and we've talked about $100 million this year from the -- producing tonnes from Esterhazy versus close. [indiscernible] So that will continue. And it will continue to go down slightly from here. The other one, of course, is Brian costs and brine cost I think peaked at $200 some million a year. They will be basically immaterial by the end of 2021. So we think that's another big improvement. And don't forget as well for Clint's comments. By pretty much by the end of 2021, we'll start ramping down the cost -- capital cost of Esterhazy, and that will be another big move towards better cash conversion for the company."

Last week, the Department of Commerce announced final duty rates in the CVD case, having adjusted them from the preliminary rates that we announced in November. The final rates are about 20% for OCP, 9% for PhosAgro and 47% for EuroChem. We really appreciate the work the Department of Commerce has done in this investigation and its efforts to enforce our trade laws. We're closely reviewing their findings to determine whether additional upward adjustments are required. Also last week, the International Trade Commission held its public full day hearing. The ITC is charged with determining whether the subject imports caused injury to the U.S. phosphate industry. We continue to believe that our injury case is compelling, especially given the undeniable surge in imports during the relevant period.
The price effects of those imports and the resulting harm to the U.S. industry, which manifests itself in plant curtailments and closures, job losses and reduction in market share, production capacity and revenue. We're thankful for the ITC's work on this case, and we look forward to its vote on or above March 11.
In terms of the current and expected imports into the U.S., we've seen the expected trade flow shifts, such that the U.S. market continues to be well served with phosphates. Our main concern is that wherever the supply comes from, it needs to be fairly priced and not priced based on highly subsidized production that comes at the expense of a free and fair market."

Maybe I'll start with the second question and then move back to Jonas' question afterwards. So related to the tax benefit associated with the Vale acquisitions, when we acquired the Brazil business in 2018, it came with certain tax assets. That we ended up having to put a valuation allowance against, given the historic profitability of that subsidiary, that just according to GAAP rules. What's now transpired is that, that -- the profitability of that subsidiary has improved to the point where under GAAP accounting, we can now remove that valuation allowance and affected our GAAP earnings for the year.
Now to Jonas' question around our effective tax rate for the year, we actually realized some foreign tax benefits in the fourth quarter that we had originally thought would be temporary in nature and reported on the balance sheet. But as we concluded our analysis, we got our opinions and finished our work, it became apparent that those foreign tax benefits were going to be permanent. And when that's the case, you need to take it through the income statement through P&L on the tax line. When we look at where our earnings and earnings mix came out for the year, which provided a lot -- quite a bit of volatility in our rate last year, all of that came out as expected, but as we again concluded our work on these foreign tax benefits and recognize that they were going to be eminent, we ended up needing to, again, run that through the tax line, and that's what brought our effective tax rate down to the level that we recorded.
As we go forward into 2021, a couple of things to keep in mind. First, the foreign tax benefits that we recognized in 2020, we expect that to continue to benefit our rate in future years. The other thing to keep in mind is that the better our phosphate business does, the more income is generated in the United States, which is our lowest tax jurisdiction. So the better that business performs, the lower our rate should go."

Soft commodity prices are at multiyear highs, and the expectation is that these strong ag economics will continue. So what that applies for us is continuing strong demand for fertilizers as farmers seek to maximize their production. Our quarter 4 shipments were definitely strong and they lowered our inventories even further, which means that we will be constrained by production capacity as we move into 2021. That said, our phosphate volumes are expected to include up to 150,000 tonnes from our joint venture, MWSPC, and we will bring to NOLA that as we work to meet the U.S. customer needs. As a result, we expect our quarter 1 shipments to be in line with historical performance as we work to meet what is pretty strong demand despite the strong volumes we saw in quarter 4.
A few extra things to consider. In both phosphates and potash, we will maximize our production at operating facilities, but we don't expect to be able to build our own inventories prior to the North American spring season. We believe channel inventories across products and regions are lower than normal, which minimizes the potential for deferrals of fertilizer needed for upcoming seasons. We expect to keep more of our U.S. phosphate production here in the U.S. to meet those customer needs."

Look, I think the surprising outcome here is really centered around the Indian contract, where BPC was the first mover. And as you've heard from other suppliers, including Canpotex, settled at a price that was, what we believe, lower than what market fundamentals were pointing towards. From our perspective, the price doesn't represent the reality we're seeing or the tightness of the market and pricing and other jurisdictions highlights this. I can only speculate as to what motivated BPC to do that. But given the political uncertainty in Belarus over the last year, there may have been nonmarket drivers that played into it.
In terms of Mosaic, given that we sell internationally through Canpotex, we're going to allow Canpotex to do what it was set out to do. And therefore, we won't be negotiating contracts on our own or on calls like this. But it is important to keep in mind that contracts involve, prices, volumes, grades and durations. Not to mention any number of other terms, which can impact producer economics and which we believe will come into play given how tight the market is. We would expect Canpotex to take a holistic view as it interacts with Chinese and Indian buyers."

From a capacity standpoint, we believe capacity was reduced by -- in 2020 by roughly 1 million tonnes year-over-year, both due to closures and product mix shifting. This was in line with our expectations, and we'd characterize that magnitude is significant. It is expected that in 2021, capacity is going to be stable, but at the same time, domestic demand is likely to increase once again. And our fairly conservative export forecast may be too high. The Chinese government has indicated the desire to increase phosphate operating rates. Our analysis already points to a relatively high operating rate in the Chinese effective capacity.

Now U.S. and international prices will have to be basically at parity adjusted for things like freight differentials. So in other words, if the U.S. prices are high, it will bring in new imports. And if U.S. prices are more parity with the markets, maybe people will be less inclined to imports. So prices will take care of it. Trade will work as trade is supposed to work. And we expect that, that convergence will take place somewhere in 2021. More generally on global pricing, markets are efficient at finding equilibrium. It appears that demand is on very solid footing, given the recent commodity -- ag commodity prices, but a few seasons of above trend yields could calm those markets and slow demand growth.

Instead, the government basically shifted their focus to ensure production -- crop production to meet the domestic demand and replacing part of the import as they attempted to. In terms of the fertilizer demand implication, based on the [ academic's ] recommendation, also the recommendation from Ministry of Agriculture, there's a very clear indication potash should be interest in terms of the application in China, along with some of the secondary nutrients and the micronutrient. In terms of the indication to phosphate, there was a very clear indication that the farmers need to manage their application to phosphate. And we've seen phosphate demand reduced over the last 5 years.
However, that rebounded in 2020. We foresee this is going to continue in 2021 onwards. Basically, the farmers are going to apply phosphate in more appropriate way. Nitrogen is a different story. It's a very clear indication to reduce the supply. Back to the supply situation, China, as a country, they are self-sufficient for the production of phosphate and nitrogen. Thus, we have not seen policy support to -- from the government to encourage more capacity to be built in these 2 new trends. Potash, China needs to rely on import and they have limited reserve or hard to explore reserve. So we believe, as a country, they still need to continue to import potash as they grow the demand and also to support their agriculture production."

Yes, we've actually had some problems in our Faustina plant with freezing. Louisiana isn't a place that freezes very often.

But again, we kind of look at this as being just normal course of business. These things happen. No different than when you have to slow down for hurricane or anything else. So we're well prepared to deal with weather events. In terms of potash, I guess the good news there is we deal with this every year in Canada with cold weather. And so the railways and everything else, the supply chains are well equipped to deal with this kind of cold weather. Although you will remember a few years ago where snow actually delayed the delivery of potash to the Midwest."

So there really was a big, big [ pull ] particularly in the third and fourth quarter in the country. And so we don't see elevated or above normal elevated inventories right now. In terms of the Belarusians or anyone else selling fertilizer into Brazil, I guess what I would say is those sales once made are what they are, and they don't affect the other -- the rest of the SMB. So if they have below market sales, and we're seeing this with India, China, that it really has not impacted other sales because people need the product. They're willing to pay the market rate for those products. And market rate has moved up. So normal supply and demand is demanding that people pay more for the potash. And particularly, we're seeing that in Brazil, which is almost like a market leader in the potash market."

And it looks like, I think we'll be telling you soon probably slightly under budget. So for a 10-year project or an 8-year project, that's a pretty pleasing outcome. In terms of the design, we expected to produce an extra million tonnes of potash from K3 when it was at full production. That amounts to about 3 million tonnes of incremental ore. So when we say we'll be up to 3 million tonnes, that means we'll be running virtually the whole incremental capacity of K3. Now what happens after that is K3 slowly takes over all production at the Esterhazy facility over the next couple of years. And what does that do for cost? The cost of -- first of all, the cost of production instead of producing it, let's say, at Colonsay, we have all the fixed costs. This is all coming in as incremental tonnes. And this is a good part of the reason why we believe our cash cost for mining is going -- at Esterhazy is going to end up somewhere below $60 a tonne, probably in that $50 to $60 a tonne range.
And that will really drive costs out of our system, and we've talked about $100 million this year from the -- producing tonnes from Esterhazy versus Colonsay. So that will continue. And it will continue to go down slightly from here. The other one, of course, is brine cost and brine cost I think peaked at $200 some million a year. They will be basically immaterial by the end of 2021. So we think that's another big improvement. And don't forget as well for Clint's comments, by pretty much by the end of 2021, we'll start ramping down the cost -- capital cost of Esterhazy, and that will be another big move towards better cash conversion for the company."

Last week, the Department of Commerce announced final duty rates in the CVD case, having adjusted them from the preliminary rates that we announced in November. The final rates are about 20% for OCP, 9% for PhosAgro and 47% for EuroChem. We really appreciate the work the Department of Commerce has done in this investigation and its efforts to enforce our trade laws. We're closely reviewing their findings to determine whether additional upward adjustments are required. Also last week, the International Trade Commission held its public full day hearing. The ITC is charged with determining whether the subject imports caused injury to the U.S. phosphate industry. We continue to believe that our injury case is compelling, especially given the undeniable surge in imports during the relevant period.
The price effects of those imports and the resulting harm to the U.S. industry, which manifests itself in plant curtailments and closures, job losses and reduction in market share, production capacity and revenue. We're thankful for the ITC's work on this case, and we look forward to its vote on or above March 11.
In terms of the current and expected imports into the U.S., we've seen the expected trade flow shifts, such that the U.S. market continues to be well served with phosphates. Our main concern is that wherever the supply comes from, it needs to be fairly priced and not priced based on highly subsidized production that comes at the expense of a free and fair market."

Maybe I'll start with the second question and then move back to Jonas' question afterwards. So related to the tax benefit associated with the Vale acquisitions, when we acquired the Brazil business in 2018, it came with certain tax assets. That we ended up having to put a valuation allowance against, given the historic profitability of that subsidiary, that just according to GAAP rules. What's now transpired is that, that -- the profitability of that subsidiary has improved to the point where under GAAP accounting, we can now remove that valuation allowance and affected our GAAP earnings for the year.
Now to Jonas' question around our effective tax rate for the year, we actually realized some foreign tax benefits in the fourth quarter that we had originally thought would be temporary in nature and reported on the balance sheet. But as we concluded our analysis, we got our opinions and finished our work, it became apparent that those foreign tax benefits were going to be permanent. And when that's the case, you need to take it through the income statement through P&L on the tax line. When we look at where our earnings and earnings mix came out for the year, which provided a lot -- quite a bit of volatility in our rate last year, all of that came out as expected, but as we again concluded our work on these foreign tax benefits and recognize that they were going to be eminent, we ended up needing to, again, run that through the tax line, and that's what brought our effective tax rate down to the level that we recorded.
As we go forward into 2021, a couple of things to keep in mind. First, the foreign tax benefits that we recognized in 2020, we expect that to continue to benefit our rate in future years. The other thing to keep in mind is that the better our phosphate business does, the more income is generated in the United States, which is our lowest tax jurisdiction. So the better that business performs, the lower our rate should go."

Soft commodity prices are at multiyear highs, and the expectation is that these strong ag economics will continue. So what that applies for us is continuing strong demand for fertilizers as farmers seek to maximize their production. Our quarter 4 shipments were definitely strong and they lowered our inventories even further, which means that we will be constrained by production capacity as we move into 2021. That said, our phosphate volumes are expected to include up to 150,000 tonnes from our joint venture, MWSPC, and we will bring to NOLA that as we work to meet the U.S. customer needs. As a result, we expect our quarter 1 shipments to be in line with historical performance as we work to meet what is pretty strong demand despite the strong volumes we saw in quarter 4.
A few extra things to consider. In both phosphates and potash, we will maximize our production at operating facilities, but we don't expect to be able to build our own inventories prior to the North American spring season.

A number of analysts, including Duffy Fischer from Barclays; Chris Parkinson from Crédit Suisse; Andrew Wong from RBC; and Steve Byrne from Bank of America have all asked about the China and Indian contracts. Canpotex and other producers have been publicly critical of the recent BPC contract settlement. Typically, in the past for potash contract settlements with China or India we've seen that when one producer settles at a certain price, other producers shortly follow at that same price. Can you talk about why that's the case? Why haven't other producers in the past held out for higher prices? And for this year, specifically, will the situation end up differently? Do you expect others to hold? And how do you think of the economics at this price?"

Look, I think the surprising outcome here is really centered around the Indian contract, where BPC was the first mover. And as you've heard from other suppliers, including Canpotex, settled at a price that was, what we believe, lower than what market fundamentals were pointing towards. From our perspective, the price doesn't represent the reality we're seeing or the tightness of the market and pricing and other jurisdictions highlights this. I can only speculate as to what motivated BPC to do that. But given the political uncertainty in Belarus over the last year, there may have been nonmarket drivers that played into it.
In terms of Mosaic, given that we sell internationally through Canpotex, we're going to allow Canpotex to do what it was set out to do. And therefore, we won't be negotiating contracts on our own or on calls like this. But it is important to keep in mind that contracts involve, prices, volumes, grades and durations. Not to mention any number of other terms, which can impact producer economics and which we believe will come into play given how tight the market is. We would expect Canpotex to take a holistic view as it interacts with Chinese and Indian buyers."

This was in line with our expectations, and we'd characterize that magnitude is significant. It is expected that in 2021, capacity is going to be stable, but at the same time, domestic demand is likely to increase once again. And our fairly conservative export forecast may be too high. The Chinese government has indicated the desire to increase phosphate operating rates. Our analysis already points to a relatively high operating rate in the Chinese effective capacity. So even if we were to assume a dramatic step higher in Chinese utilization of, say, 5 percentage points, that would increase export availability by no more than 1 million tonnes. And upside growth in domestic demand could easily absorb a portion of those tonnes."

Now U.S. and international prices will have to be basically at parity adjusted for things like freight differentials. So in other words, if the U.S. prices are high, it will bring in new imports. And if U.S. prices are more parity with the markets, maybe people will be less inclined to imports.
So prices will take care of it. Trade will work as trade is supposed to work. And we expect that, that convergence will take place somewhere in 2021. More generally on global pricing, markets are efficient at finding equilibrium. It appears that demand is on very solid footing, given the recent commodity -- ag commodity prices, but a few seasons of above trend yields could calm those markets and slow demand growth. And we can never forget the potential impact of weather on both yields and our ability to apply fertilizers. Now we are expecting current prices to modestly lower demand in India given the current subsidy scheme."

Instead, the government basically shifted their focus to ensure production -- crop production to meet the domestic demand and replacing part of the import as they attempted to. In terms of the fertilizer demand implication, based on the academics recommendation, also the recommendation from Ministry of Agriculture, there's a very clear indication potash should be interest in terms of the application in China, along with some of the secondary nutrients and the micronutrient. In terms of the indication to phosphate, there was a very clear indication that the farmers need to manage their application to phosphate. And we've seen phosphate demand reduced over the last 5 years.
However, that rebounded in 2020. We foresee this is going to continue in 2021 onwards. Basically, the farmers are going to apply phosphate in more appropriate way. Nitrogen is a different story. It's a very clear indication to reduce the supply. Back to the supply situation, China, as a country, they are self-sufficient for the production of phosphate and nitrogen. Thus, we have not seen policy support to -- from the government to encourage more capacity to be built in these 2 new trends. Potash, China needs to rely on import and they have limited reserve or hard to explore reserve. So we believe, as a country, they still need to continue to import potash as they grow the demand and also to support their agriculture production."

So with the latest phosphate price [indiscernible] globally, clearly, the margin expansion has occurred across the whole cost curve for all producers. Specifically for the Chinese producers, they are facing the raw material price increases, like you mentioned, sulfur, and also facing the increases of natural gas related to ammonia prices as well. The foreign exchange rate depreciation of Chinese RMB has also added cost to the FOB prices. So at this time, we believe the breakeven FOB Chinese DAP price is about $400 per metric ton."

First of all, in terms of the Department of Commerce and the ITC, they are independent and their determination is meant to be independent. So the DoC decides the level of subsidization and the ITC decides whether or not that the presence of those imports has caused harm to the U.S. industry. So technically, I guess they're not related, but I suppose there's got to be some element of relationship that says, well, if you have subsidized material coming in and it harms you, that there's a problem. So technically though, I don't believe they're related directly. In terms of the equity loss, most of that is Ma'aden and I think we've talked about before where Ma'aden is delayed by 1 quarter. So we report our equity earnings or losses from Ma'aden a quarter in arrears. And so if you look at the global price of phosphates today, I would expect certainly a much lower equity loss or for that to turn to a gain at some point. But again, that would be my expectation."

In terms of lag in sulfur, there's also a lag for both sulfur and ammonia. What I would point you to there, I guess, is just the stoichiometric requirement. Our need for ammonia represents about 0.21 tonnes per tonne of DAP produced. Our use of sulfur represents about 0.4 tonnes of sulfur for every tonne of DAP produced. So as you can see what that means, if sulfur moves from the $60 to the $90 some that it's at today, a $30 increase in sulfur is going to add something like a $12 increase to our overall price. So in sulfur, you should be able to take fairly much the Gulf price or our quarterly price and work that in. In terms of ammonia, again, same thing, except that, obviously, we produce 1/3 of our ammonia. So that is at normal cost. 1/3 of our ammonia is -- 1/3 or so of our ammonia is produced by CF on a long-term contract. And then we only buy about 1/4 of our -- 1/4 to 1/3 of our ammonia on spot. So on that one, it's much more dampened, if you will."

So there really was a big, big pull particularly in the third and fourth quarter in the country. And so we don't see elevated or above normal elevated inventories right now. In terms of the Belarusians or anyone else selling fertilizer into Brazil, I guess what I would say is those sales once made are what they are, and they don't affect the other -- the rest of the SMB.
So if they have below market sales, and we're seeing this with India, China, that it really has not impacted other sales because people need the product. They're willing to pay the market rate for those products. And market rate has moved up. So normal supply and demand is demanding that people pay more for the potash.

And it looks like, I think we'll be telling you soon probably slightly under budget. So for a 10-year project or an 8-year project, that's a pretty pleasing outcome. In terms of the design, we expected to produce an extra million tonnes of potash from K3 when it was at full production. That amounts to about 3 million tonnes of incremental ore. So when we say we'll be up to 3 million tonnes, that means we'll be running virtually the whole incremental capacity of K3. Now what happens after that is K3 slowly takes over all production at the Esterhazy facility over the next couple of years. And what does that do for cost? The cost of -- first of all, the cost of production instead of producing it, let's say, at Colonsay, we have all the fixed costs. This is all coming in as incremental tonnes. And this is a good part of the reason why we believe our cash cost for mining is going -- at Esterhazy is going to end up somewhere below $60 a tonne, probably in that $50 to $60 a tonne range.
And that will really drive costs out of our system, and we've talked about $100 million this year from the -- producing tonnes from Esterhazy versus Colonsay. So that will continue. And it will continue to go down slightly from here. The other one, of course, is brine cost and brine cost I think peaked at $200 some million a year. They will be basically immaterial by the end of 2021. So we think that's another big improvement. And don't forget as well for Clint's comments, by pretty much by the end of 2021, we'll start ramping down the cost -- capital cost of Esterhazy, and that will be another big move towards better cash conversion for the company."

Generally speaking, within normal ranges, grower demand for fertilizer is relatively price inelastic, whether that be in developed or emerging markets. Accepting that, changes to demand would then be driven by acreage and by yield expectations. However, growers will look at the return on investment of fertilizer applications and particularly, if prices of crops are elevated. Or conversely, if they're down, they will adjust their rates higher or lower in order to maximize their yield potential.

So If we look at the ending price or the high price of in the 5 90s, it was only there for a short period of time, and it was probably for the just-in-time deliveries as opposed to the people who plan better. So we expect now we're going to see Q3 average netback rise again as we sell into the summer fill. And basically, we'll move into the fall with that. And we don't have much lower-priced carryover anymore. So highlight will decrease."

And again, probably the only place where it will be flat year-on-year as probably going to be India. And although we expect a decrease in phosphate use, we sort of expect in potash. So overall, that would be the -- those would be the drivers. And if those do better, we could get up to the 71%. Otherwise, we'll probably be more in that 69% to 70% range is kind of our base case.

Our -- sorry, we would decrease our greenhouse gases by 20%. A lot of what we're doing there involves how we're running our phosphate businesses. We've put a lot of effort and resources into how we can use recycled heat to make power. And over time, we see that along with just other uses to use less power et cetera.

Generally speaking, within normal ranges, grower demand for fertilizer is relatively price inelastic, whether that be in developed or emerging markets. Accepting that, changes to demand would then be driven by acreage and by yield expectations. However, growers will look at the return on investment of fertilizer applications and particularly, if prices of crops are elevated. Or conversely, if they're down, they will adjust their rates higher or lower in order to maximize their yield potential. It certainly appears that last year and now this year, we're seeing signs of some of those upward adjustments to application rates.

We see this is going to continue in 2021 and going forward. Therefore, we are going to see less P2O5 to be produced at DAP and MAP.

In terms of OCP and the Russians, I mean, they're welcome to come into this market, but it doesn't really make sense with an OCP with a 20% tariff that they wouldn't go to a market, another market like India or whatever, which is not being tariffed right now.

We've put a lot of effort and resources into how we can use recycled heat to make power. And over time, we see that, along with just other uses to use less power, et cetera.

Thank you for joining our second quarter earnings discussion.

Today, I will provide some additional context before we respond to questions we received last night, and then we'll conclude with a live Q&A session.
Mosaic delivered excellent financial performance in the second quarter, and the second half of 2021 is set up to be one of the strongest periods in over a decade. Our earnings are driven by 2 key factors. First, strong underlying agricultural markets, coupled with tight fertilizer dynamics are driving fertilizer prices higher. Second, and just as important, are the results of our effort to optimize our business to fully realize the benefit of these market trends.
Throughout our long-term and ongoing work to reduce costs, we've created significant earning leverage as this quarter's performance demonstrates. Looking ahead, we expect further upside. Our third quarter order book is now 90% committed and priced. As a result, we expect a sequential increase of $90 to $100 per tonne in realized phosphate prices and $25 to $35 per tonne in realized potash prices.
Beyond the third quarter, we are seeing buyer appetite for fourth quarter commitments as well. All of this implies higher earnings in the third quarter and very strong results in the fourth and into 2022. The dynamics fueling the agricultural markets point to a period of strength that we believe will extend well beyond 2021. Grain stocks remain limited, and global corn and soybean demand is growing driven in part by surging Chinese demand and biofuels. As a result, agricultural commodity prices remain high, and the outlook is promising for continued strong farm income.
The world's farmers have solid incentive to maximize yields from every acre, and that is what drives higher fertilizer demand. Demand in the Americas is considerably stronger than we expected at the beginning of the year. Brazil is expected to once again set records for fertilizer shipments. Across the Americas, we saw a big recovery in 2020 and expect that the demand growth to moderate this year. The opposite has happened. Demand for potash and phosphates is up substantially compared with last year, and nearly all of the fertilizer delivered this year has gone to the ground, which means channel inventories in most regions remain below historic norms.
In North America, demand continues to be strong. Following the completion of our CBD petition, U.S. phosphate prices now trade at parity with global benchmarks. And the domestic market is benefiting from elevated imports from a more diverse pool of suppliers. This is reflective of a healthy market that's responding to the market signals.
In India, farmer demand remains very strong, but importer economics have negatively impacted available supply in the country because of the disconnect in government subsidies. As a result, it is difficult for the Indian farmer to get the phosphates they desire. It is clear that more work needs to be done to rectify the imbalance, but we continue to see the regions absorbing fertilizer supply.
Given how depleted Indian inventories are, we see India as a source of pent-up demand for the future. Southeast Asian fertilizer demand is benefiting from the strength in palm oil, and China is incenting its farmers to maximize yield.
While the demand dynamics for potash and phosphates are similar, driven by the strong underlying agricultural markets, the supply outlook is slightly different for the 2 products. In phosphates, new supply is limited and any new greenfield supply additions are several years from completion. Recently, Russia requested producers prioritize domestic demand to stabilize in-country pricing. And while supply from Chinese phosphate exports during the second quarter was elevated to meet global demand, Chinese exports are expected to decline in the second half of the year as in-country seasonal demand increases. This was reinforced by news last week. The China's National Development Reform Commission has begun requesting the export of fertilizer to ensure adequate domestic supply.
In potash, demand growth continues to exceed new supply from higher operating rates recently announced by producers. As a result, prices continue to rise. In fact, price increases have largely offset the financial impact of our early closure of K1 and K2 shafts at Esterhazy. We recently resumed production at Colonsay and now expect our net production launch to be approximately 700,000 tonnes for the year, down from our original 1 million-tonne estimate. This also brings the sales impact down to approximately 500,000 tonnes as we draw down available inventory.
Our earnings are leading to significant free cash flow generation, which has allowed us to proceed with the early retirement of our $450 million in long-term debt later this month. We are currently evaluating additional actions for capital deployment. Capital expenditures are expected to total $1.2 billion in 2021. This includes accelerated K3 spending to speed up our ability to bring K3 to full production as well as approximately $75 million in additional high-returning opportunities within our businesses. Given the strong cash generation, we continue to evaluate opportunities that also allow us to further strengthen our balance sheet, grow the business and share with our investors. Overall, Mosaic continues to execute and perform very well within this robust fertilizer market, and we expect to continue building momentum from here.
With that, we will move on to your questions."

Now the way we look at this is actually is the grain prices and higher-grade demand that's driving the fertilizers. So from our perspective, it's demand for grains and oilseeds and the price that that's creating that's driving fertilizer demand, which is, of course, driving fertilizer pricing. So we see the supply and demand balance the other way around, if you will.
Now we may see at some point the impact of high prices. Today, tight grain and oilseed markets are going to be tight for a while. They're not going to loosen in just one growing season. So this should last a while. And with global prices up, it seems that most growers have been comfortable with the prices we're seeing for fertilizer.
Now the one area of concern, we've talked about this, is India. And this is not an affordability issue for the farmer but an affordability issue for the importer because of the Indian subsidy system. But sooner or later, low Indian inventories will mean that they have to buy fertilizer."

So this is starting to push shipments back to the better-than-normal lag period that were experienced. Plus you have to consider that these prices are the Asian prices, which are lagging as well from the Brazilian and North American prices.
If we turn to North America, a lot of the tonnes that we're delivering now and will deliver through quarter 3 are tonnes that were sold in early May for August shipment to meet summer fill demand. Then of course, those were delayed further due to the K1/K2 closure, which means a lot of the main volume won't be priced or shipped until October. And so the pricing lag is higher than it would normally be.

Our volume production guidance was adjusted basically because of 2 things. First of all, the acceleration of our shaft at K3 and being able to move into production areas sooner in that K3 area, which will increase the contribution from that line in the fourth quarter. We also were able to optimize some of our turnarounds at the mills because they are being fully utilized.
And then the second part is a successful restart of Colonsay, which really has come up very well, and we've been very pleased with the rate at which we've been able to get it into production. A matter of fact, commissioned the mills just the other day. So we're fully ready to run their Colonsay. And between the 2 of them, we've been able to accelerate our ability to produce tonnes at those 2 operations, which has mitigated some of the loss that we had from the early closure of K1 and K2.
As far closure costs for K1 and K2, in the second quarter, they were $158 million, most of which was noncash write-offs. $110 million was fixed asset write-downs. $37 million was ARO adjustments. And then see MRO write-offs, $4 million was contractor severance.
In terms of the ARO itself, the $37 million brings a total up to about $120 million for ARO, of which $70 million to $100 million, let's say, will be in the closure of those 2 mineshafts. Of that 40% or so will be spent this year, and the rest will be spent next year and final closure of that.
For the third part of the question, our cost structures, if we do the sum of the parts, our K3 mine at 6 million tonne operating capacity will be one of the lowest costs in the world. We said that in the $50 range already. Belle Plaine is also very low cost and very well positioned on the cost curve, and that's 3 million tonnes of our operating capacity. Colonsay costs are still expected to be in the $100 per tonne range as per our previous guidance. And we're looking at ways to reduce that amount.
So if you kind of work it out from that, that 80% to 90% of our costs will be at that very first quartile. And then we'll make up the difference with slightly higher costs from Colonsay at $100 a tonne, assuming we actually need those tonnes to meet the market requirements. Let me emphasize that at these prices, Colonsay tonnes are still very profitable, and we would expect that to have a very good margin in today's environment."

We have seen the Chinese exports of phosphates, and probably urea as well, have increased in the first half of the year driven by very strong international market. The demand was so strong, and it's a pure economic-driven. As a result of it, the Chinese government has been -- growing concerns over the supply availability for the domestic market as well as the rising prices for the domestic market as well.
So as a result of this concern, NDRC, they call the super ministry in China as the development -- the National Development and Reform Committee has required the major producers of nitrogen and phosphate to meet basically the guidance NDRC to the major producers, where you guys need to stop exports. And you need to prioritize your supply to the domestic market and also stabilize the price. We know why they do it. They need to maximize the ag production in China. So that's their priority.
So at this moment, NDRC's requests are kind of soft regulation. The requests are mainly to the state-owned enterprises. How these major producers are going to comply and follow the guidance from NDRC, the government is closely watching it, and they're looking at whether the domestic supply has been improved and if the prices have been stabilized. And if the situation is not believed to be improved over the next period of time, we may see a very hard measurement to be taken by NDRC.
The reason that we have that confidence, one, is coming from the other industry, if you pay attention to the steel industry, which the Chinese government imposed export tax in May. And then that was not strong enough at the time. And yesterday, they hiked export tax again. So that's one of the measurements that NDRC has taken to the steel export. Whether they're going to do the same to phosphate and possibly to urea, it will really depend on how much export is coming up over the next 2 months. We foresee the significant slowdown were coming from September and Q4 because the export in July and August probably have been committed earlier before this request was sent by NDRC."

I think they only affected about 20% of the industrial potash that Belarus might have sold. So other than slap on the wrist, it really wasn't much of a restriction to the Belarusians. And with food security concerns in the mix, I'm not surprised by that.
Compare that to the CBD, which was -- I mean the countervailing duty case was all about unfair subsidies and really taking advantage of those unfair subsidies to impact the market and particularly harm the U.S. producers. So I think very, very different sort of situations and drivers. But what I would say about the CBD, and I think I've said this in my opening remarks, is now with the CBD, what we're seeing is we're seeing a number of new countries and companies importing into the U.S. And we're seeing the market run at essentially parity to other major markets, which I think is what we expect. In the case of the Belarusian, I mean it was simply a political statement to hopefully put pressure on contango to do something about some of their -- well, some of their human rights issues."

As we go into 2022, it's always hard to look into the future. But I would think we would be returning to more normal growth rates. One of the things to talk about this year, though, is I don't think we've built up about a bunch of channel inventory. So I think channel inventory stays low. 2022 will be normal demand growth, call it, 1 million to 1.5 million tonnes or in that 2%-plus range.

Thank you for joining our second quarter earnings discussion.

Today, I will provide some additional context before we respond to questions we received last night, and then we'll conclude with a live Q&A session.
Mosaic delivered excellent financial performance in the second quarter, and the second half of 2021 is set up to be one of the strongest periods in over a decade. Our earnings are driven by 2 key factors. First, strong underlying agricultural markets, coupled with tight fertilizer demand dynamics, are driving fertilizer prices higher. Second, and just as important, are the results of our effort to optimize our business to fully realize the benefit of these market trends.
Throughout our long-term and ongoing work to reduce costs, we've created significant earning leverage as this quarter's performance demonstrates. Looking ahead, we expect further upside. Our third quarter order book is now 90% committed and priced. As a result, we expect a sequential increase of $90 to $100 per tonne in realized phosphate prices and $25 to $35 per tonne in realized potash prices.
Beyond the third quarter, we are seeing buyer appetite for fourth quarter commitments as well. All of this implies higher earnings in the third quarter and very strong results in the fourth and into 2022. The dynamics fueling the agricultural markets point to a period of strength that we believe will extend well beyond 2021. Grain stocks remain limited and global corn and soybean demand is growing driven in part by surging Chinese demand and biofuels. As a result, agricultural commodity prices remain high, and the outlook is promising for continued strong farm income.
The world's farmers have solid incentive to maximize yields from every acre, and that is what drives higher fertilizer demand. Demand in the Americas is considerably stronger than we expected at the beginning of the year. Brazil is expected to once again set records for fertilizer shipments. Across the Americas, we saw a big recovery in 2020 and expected the demand growth to moderate this year. The opposite has happened. Demand for potash and phosphates is up substantially compared with last year, and nearly all of the fertilizer delivered this year has gone to the ground, which means channel inventories in most regions remain below historic norms.
In North America, demand continues to be strong. Following the completion of our CVD petition, U.S. phosphate prices now trade at parity with global benchmarks. And the domestic market is benefiting from elevated imports from a more diverse pool of suppliers. This is reflective of a healthy market that's responding to the market signals.
In India, farmer demand remains very strong, but importer economics have negatively impacted available supply in the country because of the disconnect in government subsidies. As a result, it is difficult for the Indian farmer to get the phosphates they desire. It is clear that more work needs to be done to rectify the imbalance, but we continue to see the region absorbing fertilizer supply.
Given how depleted Indian inventories are, we see India as a source of pent-up demand for the future. Southeast Asian fertilizer demand is benefiting from the strength in palm oil, and China is incenting its farmers to maximize yield.
While the demand dynamics for potash and phosphates are similar, driven by the strong underlying agricultural markets, the supply outlook is slightly different for the 2 products. In phosphates, new supply is limited and any new greenfield supply additions are several years from completion. Recently, Russia requested producers prioritize domestic demand to stabilize in-country pricing. And while supply from Chinese phosphate exports during the second quarter was elevated to meet global demand, Chinese exports are expected to decline in the second half of the year as in-country seasonal demand increases. This was reinforced by news last week that China's National Development and Reform Commission has begun requesting the export of fertilizer stop to ensure adequate domestic supply.
In potash, demand growth continues to exceed new supply from higher operating rates recently announced by producers. As a result, prices continue to rise. In fact, price increases have largely offset the financial impact of our early closure of K1 and K2 shafts at Esterhazy. We recently resumed production at Colonsay and now expect our net production loss to be approximately 700,000 tonnes for the year, down from our original 1 million-tonne estimate. This also brings the sales impact down to approximately 500,000 tonnes as we draw down available inventory.
Our earnings are leading to significant free cash flow generation, which has allowed us to proceed with the early retirement of our $450 million in long-term debt later this month. We are currently evaluating additional actions for capital deployment.
Capital expenditures are expected to total $1.2 billion in '21. This includes accelerated K3 spending to speed up our ability to bring K3 to full production as well as approximately $75 million in additional high-returning opportunities within our businesses. Given the strong cash generation, we continue to evaluate opportunities that also allow us to further strengthen our balance sheet, grow the business and share with our investors. Overall, Mosaic continues to execute and perform very well within this robust fertilizer market, and we expect to continue building momentum from here.
With that, we will move on to your questions."

Now the way we look at this is actually it is the grain prices and higher grain demand that's driving the fertilizers. So from our perspective, it's demand for grains and oilseeds and the price that, that's creating that's driving fertilizer demand, which is, of course, driving fertilizer pricing. So we see the supply and demand balance the other way around, if you will.
Now we may see at some point the impact of high prices. Today, tight grain and oilseed markets are going to be tight for a while. They're not going to loosen in just one growing season. So this should last a while. And with global prices up, it seems that most growers have been comfortable with the prices we're seeing for fertilizer.
Now the one area of concern, we've talked about this, is India. And this is not an affordability issue for the farmer but an affordability issue for the importer because of the Indian subsidy system. But sooner or later, low Indian inventories will mean that they have to buy fertilizer."

So this is starting to push shipments back to their better-than-normal lag period that we're experiencing. Plus, you have to consider that these prices are the Asian prices, which are lagging as well from the Brazilian and North American prices.
If we turn to North America, a lot of the tonnes that we're delivering now and will deliver through quarter 3 are tonnes that were sold in early May for August shipment to meet summer fill demand. Then of course, those were delayed further due to the K1/K2 closure, which means a lot of the May volume won't be priced or shipped until October. And so the pricing lag is higher than it would normally be. But I will emphasize that we are in our distribution business seeing and selling at the $600-plus price that we're talking about being the spot market."

Now it's a little too early to forecast quarter 4, but what I can tell you is Gulf refinery operating rates have stabilized and gone to normal rates. We have really done a lot of work to get a good inventory of sulfur in our system, which we did not have coming out of quarter 1. And if you remember, the issue we ran into in quarter 1 was low operating rates in the refineries, some turnarounds in the refineries and then freezing weather that shut down a lot of the Gulf refineries. So the combination of the 3 meant a normally tight situation was exacerbated quite a bit. So at this stage, we see the risk as significantly lower."

I think when we look at our opportunity, CapEx investments for this year, overall, I would say that it's about 1/3 in North America, about 2/3 in Brazil. I think there's more a focus in Brazil. But I would say that those investments are generally being made in a number of different areas, but I would include the following.
A number of these investments are around automation. We've spoken about some of the next-gen investments that we're making in our production assets, and that is ongoing. That's part of this program. Then another example is down in Brazil, where we're looking to increase gypsum sales, and we need to make some investments in infrastructure to be able to accommodate that. In potash, we're looking to increase some of the Aspire capacity. But again, as we look at these investments, they're all relatively modest investments, typically single-digit million dollar investments, but with very, very significant returns, some in the triple-digit type of return on an after-tax basis.
From a phosphate capacity expansion standpoint, I would say that really the things that we've focused on and talked about is along the lines of potentially increasing MicroEssential capacity in the future. Demand for that product continues to increase. And to the extent that we need to expand capacity there, I can see that. Beyond that, I think our rock and concentrate capacities are in fairly good balance at this point otherwise.
When we look at the new soil health initiatives, again, those are relatively modest investments. Those are typically expensed because we treat that really more along the lines of R&D. And so I would say, overall, those are relatively immaterial investments, not additive to CapEx. And again, I think that's supplementing our R&D into new products for the future."

Our volume production guidance was adjusted basically because of 2 things. First of all, the acceleration of our shaft at K3 and being able to move into production areas sooner in that K3 area, which will increase the contribution from that line in the fourth quarter. We also were able to optimize some of our turnarounds at the mills because they are being fully utilized.
And then the second part is a successful restart of Colonsay, which really has come up very well, and we've been very pleased with the rate at which we've been able to get it into production, matter of fact, commissioned the mills just the other day. So we're fully ready to run there, Colonsay. And between the 2 of them, we've been able to accelerate our ability to produce tonnes at those 2 operations, which has mitigated some of the loss that we had from the early closure of K1 and K2.
As far closure costs for K1 and K2, in the second quarter, they were $158 million, most of which was noncash write-offs. $110 million was fixed asset write-downs. $37 million was ARO adjustments. And then had MRO write-offs, $4 million was contractor severance.
In terms of the ARO itself, the $37 million brings the total up to about $120 million for ARO, of which $70 million to $100 million, let's say, will be in the closure of those 2 mineshafts. Of that, 40% or so will be spent this year, and the rest will be spent next year and the final closure of that.
For the third part of the question, our cost structures, if we do the sum of the parts, our K3 mine at 6 million tonne operating capacity will be one of the lowest costs in the world. We said that in the $50 range already. Belle Plaine is also very low cost and very well positioned on the cost curve, and that's 3 million tonnes of our operating capacity. Colonsay costs are still expected to be in the $100 per tonne range as per our previous guidance. And we're looking at ways to reduce that amount.
So if you kind of work it out from that, that 80% to 90% of our costs will be at that very first quartile. And then we'll make up the difference with slightly higher costs from Colonsay at $100 a tonne, assuming we actually need those tonnes to meet the market requirements. Let me emphasize that at these prices, Colonsay tonnes are still very profitable, and we would expect that to have a very good margin in today's environment."

So I just want to highlight that we had accounted or we were not expecting to account for inflation, and this was a method of offsetting inflation. So you have to adjust those cost numbers based on that.
But overall, we continue to drive very hard. I think you'll see in our results that we continue to drive very hard for those transformational benefits as we call them. And a big chunk of that is reducing our cost of mining. And in that, I just want to highlight that this quarter was exacerbated by lower rates caused by some downtime.

There is a high level of unpredictability in any large system. And frankly, our system runs very close to its capacity.
So in the case of the sulfur, with a very good spring ahead of us, a little sulfur hiccup impacted our tonnage. But I think if you look at it over time, you'll see that, really, we have run very close to our capacity and have made big improvements in that area. Likewise, in potash, I mean, if you look back where we were running the 3 potash mines continuously, you had a lot of flexibility, which we don't have anymore.

We have seen the Chinese exports of phosphates and probably urea as well have increased in the first half of the year driven by very strong international market. The demand was so strong and it's a pure economic-driven. As a result of it, the Chinese government has seen a growing concern over the supply availability for the domestic market as well as the rising prices for the domestic market as well.
So as a result of this concern, the NDRC, they call it the super ministry in China, the National Development and Reform Committee has required the major producers of nitrogen and phosphate to meet. Basically, the guidance of NDRC to the major producers were, you guys need to stop exports and you need to prioritize your supply to the domestic market and also stabilize the price. We know why they do it. They need to maximize the ag production in China. So that's their priority.
So at this moment, NDRC's requests are kind of a soft regulation. The requests are mainly to the state-owned enterprises. How these major producers are going to comply and follow the guidance from NDRC, the government is closely watching it, and they're looking at whether the domestic supply has been improved and if the prices have been stabilized. And if the situation is not believed to be improved over the next period of time, we may see a very hard measurement to be taken by NDRC.
The reason that we have that confidence, one is coming from the other industry, if you pay attention to the steel industry, which the Chinese government imposed export tax in May. And then that was not strong enough at the time. And yesterday, they hiked export tax again. So that's one of the measurements that NDRC has taken to the steel export. Whether they're going to do the same to phosphates and possibly to urea, it will really depending on how much export is coming up over the next 2 months. We foresee the significant slowdown were coming from September and Q4 because the export in July and August probably have been committed earlier before this request was sent by NDRC."

Compare that to the CVD, which was, I mean, the countervailing duty case was all about unfair subsidies and really taking advantage of those unfair subsidies to impact the market and particularly harm the U.S. producers. So I think very, very different sort of situations and drivers. But what I would say about the CVD, and I think I've said this in my opening remarks is, now with the CVD, what we're seeing is we're seeing a number of new countries and companies importing into the U.S. And we're seeing the market run at essentially parity to other major markets, which I think is what we expect.

So our expectation for the third quarter will be very strong in Brazil. What we expect to see there is with the drought conditions, planting may be a little later. So it might push the purchases back slightly, but there will be higher prices and pretty strong demand for fertilizer in this third quarter and probably heading into fourth quarter."

And certainly, in this environment, we're able to execute on that and take advantage of that distribution margin.
The second part of your question, I mean, comes to an important piece of our whole investment thesis in Brazil, which is to compete in Brazil being in-country and having that transportation advantage is a great thing both from a cost perspective.

I think supply has been a limiter to demand growth, if you will, in this year. We had some 6 million tonnes of growth last year, and we really expected it to moderate quite this year.

As we go into 2022, it's always hard to look into the future, but I would think we would be returning to more normal growth rates. One of the things to talk about this year, though, is I don't think we've built up about a bunch of channel inventory. So I think channel inventory stays low. 2022 will be normal demand growth, call it, 1 million to 1.5 million tonnes or in that 2%-plus range.

I hope you've had a chance to review our posted commentary and slides as well as our news release and performance data, which were made available on our website yesterday. I will provide some additional context before we respond to the questions we received last night, and then we'll conclude with a live Q&A session. 
Mosaic delivered excellent financial performance in the third quarter, with EBITDA reaching its highest level in more than a decade. Our business continues to benefit from the strong markets we've been discussing since the second half of 2020. With our North America production recovery and a strong order book, we expect the momentum to continue through the end of the year and into 2022. 
Before we get into our strong outlook, I want to briefly give you an update on the production issues we faced during the third quarter. As you'll remember, in June, our Esterhazy K1 and K2 potash mines experienced accelerated brine inflow and we made the decision to stop operations approximately 6 months ahead of schedule. To help mitigate lost production, we further expedited the ramp-up of K3 and restarted Colonsay. 
The second shaft at K3 is now operational, which paves the way for us to reach full production in the first quarter of 2022. And at Colonsay, we hit our target run rate in October. 
In phosphates, the damage from Hurricane IDA and the equipment failure at New Wales resulted in a 300,000 tonne reduction loss in the third quarter. Thanks to the efforts of our team, the fourth quarter production shortfall has been reduced to 100,000 tonnes, and operating rates should be normal by the end of the year. In both phosphates and potash, our team has worked diligently to ensure any shortfalls resulting from issues outside of our control were temporary. 
As we head into the end of the year, and into 2022, we are well positioned to take advantage of the current market. 
Shifting now to agricultural markets. We continue to see strength extending well into 2022. Grain stocks remain limited and global corn and soybean demand is elevated, driven in part by surging Chinese demand and rising global biofuel demand. As a result, agricultural commodity prices remain high and farmer income remains well above historic norms. 
That strength in crop markets, combined with global industry supply constraints, are the key drivers pushing fertilizer prices higher. In the Americas, demand is considerably stronger than we expected at the beginning of the year. Brazil is expected to once again set a record for fertilizer shipments in 2021. 
Grower economics remain profitable despite the latest surges in nutrient prices and this has been reflected in the significant order book into the end of the year and into the first half of 2022. In North America, demand continues to be strong and prices have followed reflecting a healthy domestic market benefiting from imports from a diverse group of suppliers. 
Though economics remain favorable in North America, although not quite as favorable as during the first half of the year. However, persistently low inventories and capacity constraints are underpinning the tight supply-demand balance as well as pricing. 
In India, while farmer demand remains strong and the government has recently acted to improve importer economics for phosphates, availability is still lagging. Recent moves by the governments will likely help in the recovery of Indian imports which lagged most of 2021 because of the disconnect between domestic subsidies and global prices. Given how depleted Indian inventories are, we see India as a source of pent-up demand, which should return to the market in 2022. 
In Southeast Asia, fertilizer demand is benefiting from the strength in palm oil prices and China is incenting its farmers to maximize yields through subsidized crop prices. New supply of phosphate is limited. Chinese exports are expected to decline significantly in the fourth quarter and in the first half of 2022, reflecting the directive from China's National Development and Reform Commission that major producers halt all phosphate exports to ensure adequate domestic supply. 
In potash, demand growth continues to exceed new supply from higher operating rates announced by producers and prices continue to rise. Putting this all together, we expect further upside in realized pricing for phosphates and potash. Our fourth quarter order book is now about 90% committed and priced. As a result, we expect to see a sequential increase of $55 to $65 a tonne in realized phosphate prices and $110 to $130 a tonne in realized potash prices. We are seeing buyer appetite for first quarter commitments as well. All of this implies higher earnings in the fourth quarter and a very strong results continuing into 2022. 
Our earnings are leading to substantial free cash flow generation, which has allowed us to make significant progress towards several commitments we've made. Earlier this year, we raised our regular dividend target by 50% to $0.30 a share. In October, our Board approved an additional regular dividend target increase of 50% to $0.45 per share effective in 2022. 
In August, we repaid $450 million in long-term debt towards our target of $1 billion of debt reduction. Also in August, we announced an expanded share repurchase program of $1 billion. Since that announcement, we have repurchased more than 950,000 shares. In addition to strengthening the balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders, we continue to evaluate further investments in the business. Capital expenditures are expected to total $1.3 billion in 2021, of which roughly $450 million is growth-related. 
We continue to evaluate every opportunity that allows us to further strengthen the balance sheet grow the business and return capital to our investors. 
Now before I conclude my opening remarks, I want to take a moment to recognize the many contributions of Laura Gagnon and what she has made at Mosaic. As Head of Investor Relations for the last decade, Laura has been an invaluable adviser to me and to the entire leadership team. We are very grateful for her service and wish her all the best in her retirement. Paul Massoud has been promoted to lead IR, and Laura will stay on through the end of the year to help with the transition. Please join me in wishing her well. 
With that, let's move on to questions. Paul?"

However, now the Chinese government has stepped in and restricted exports and we expect the exports to go very low in the last quarter and into quarter 1 of next year, which will allow for a better supply in the domestic market. 
In terms of India, the inability to secure P&K has not been about farmer demand but importer economics. The inability or inadequate subsidies have really been what's driven the inability of the importers to economically bring product into that jurisdiction. However, what we do expect to see based on those 2 is pent-up demand in both China and India for early next year and into the spring season. So with that, I'm going to throw it over to Jenny to really talk about the details of fertilizer affordability in our key markets."

We don't have perfect insight into the soil inventory per se. But what we do have is we have some studies by the likes of the University of Illinois that show that over the last 10 years, actual soil inventories have decreased. And that's particularly as we've used more precision agriculture, which allows you to put the right amount of fertilizer done. But it also means you have to replace it every year. 
And of course, in Brazil, with the depleted soil, that has to be replaced every year. So there is definitely on-ground demand that will be there next year. In terms of channel inventory, we see that as being low in almost every jurisdiction. There is no place around the globe where we see any kind of buildup of channel inventory. And that's fundamentally different than it was 10 years ago where you had large amounts of inventory, not only of the fertilizers, but large inventories of crops like grains and oilseeds. 
So this turnaround is quite different. And so as we look forward, we see affordability fine right now and we expect that affordability will be good because either price will have to go up for grains and oilseeds, which will drive long-term fertilizer. Or they will plant less, which means that prices for grains and oilseed will go up. So in other words, the cure for high prices is high prices."

At an importer level, the gap between global pricing and the retail price has been such that the importer economics are poor, which means they're not importing, which means that the product isn't available to the farmer. And really, that goes for both potash and phosphate.

But as we've seen recently, that has led to fairly large deficits domestically. So the government has stepped in, put on export restrictions, which are now taking effect. We don't expect a whole lot of Q4 exports or probably first quarter 2022. After that, we do expect things to return to normal. So for this year, we're expecting a little over 10 million tonnes of exports. Next year, we think that will return back to the, say, 9.5 or 9.3 that we've had in previous years. But year-over-year, we should be down about 1.5 million tonnes from where we were this year. 
Now we also see a long-term decline in production of phosphate fertilizers for agricultural use. That means that the phosphoric acid is starting to find its way into a lot of other industrial products, including these lithium iron phosphate batteries and a number of other areas. So what we see is a declining production over time and probably a restriction of availability into the phosphate fertilizer market. So that means that over time, we should see a decrease of exports from China."

This quarter, we're looking at approximately 20% to 25% will probably come from open market purchases. 
As such, what we expect to see is about a $5 to $10 increase per tonne of our raw materials. And that's based on market changes in ammonia plus a relatively flat sulfur pricing environment."

First of all, let me say, Mosaic Fertilizantes is an integrated business, though it is the combined benefit of distribution with production that has really driven our results there. Part of the strength has obviously been in the markets, but we've also made tremendous progress ourselves of transforming the business. First of all, in the $300 million of synergies we found and then more recently, we've just exceeded our $200 million EBITDA improvement target through transformation. 
So remember, the pro forma at the time of purchase was about $60 million EBITDA per year, and we just did $300 million in a quarter. So you can see where we've extracted significant value and has dropped straight to the bottom line.

And one of the things we've also been looking at is we have a number of assets that, over the long term, have been leased. And as we've looked at how core those assets are to our underlying operations, I think there is a portion of those assets that probably make more sense for us to own instead of leasing.

We are -- we have ownership or part ownership of a port in Paranagua and access to a port in Santos that really gives us an opportunity to get product into Brazil much more effectively than others. And then, of course, in-country production, where we save not only the ocean freight, but the rail or truck freight from the coast. 
So all of this logistics restrictions are actually working to our competitive advantage right now compared to others who would sell at the coast or -- and others who would have to come in through public ports. So we feel we're in a really good position there. Overall, Brazil will be tight for fertilizers, particularly, I guess, as we look forward, there could be some -- with any restrictions on the Belarusians, there could be some restrictions on getting the product to Brazil. 
And of course, ocean freight has at least probably doubled. So -- but that's going to affect everybody equally.

Again, with the rise in commodity prices and the Brazilian currency devaluation over the last couple of years, the Brazilian farmers had the benefit of extremely good profitability. Now that has certainly decreased this year. And because of rising not just fertilizer, but fuel prices, seed prices, everything has gone up. And so not surprisingly, it squeezed them more than they're used to. 
However, I mean, our own belief is farmers like to farm. They're not going to sacrifice yield by not fertilizing, that just is not a good economic solution to the problem. A matter of fact, if anything, that would exacerbate their profitability issues. So we think that, that will continue as normal. Do we expect growth to be as strong in the next year or so? No, we would expect that growth would be more moderated than it has been. And a matter of fact, our longer-term growth numbers, we're looking at that being slightly lower than what the history has been. 
But overall, we think that it will continue. And Brazil will continue to be a great market and ultimately will be one of the big red baskets for the world. In terms of our distribution business, I think we have a very strong customer base. We are well respected in the market. Our brand has a very good name down there. Plus we have great growth in our MicroEssentials, which is a good pull for that market. So they want our products specifically. 
So we have a very stable customer base. So even in a declining market, I would expect we would do as well or better than any of the others in that situation. So I worry less about the margins in distribution. They're very good right now, but I suspect we'll be able to keep those over time."

This year alone, we are saying around 300,000 tonnes of purified phos assets already shifted to LFP, which equals to 0.5 million tonnes of LFP. And I saw some questions related to the production of phosphate fertilizer into 2022, we believe the trend of shifting P205 to LFP will be the trend and will be the strategy. And that will profoundly change the phosphate industry in China. 
Coming into the U.S., as Joc mentioned, we have seen the announcement made by Tesla are working with some other parties of building up LFP factories in the U.S. and building up the U.S. owned supply chain. We are looking into this area as well. So as the major phosphate producers, like Joc mentioned, we are doing our own study. This is going to be a long-term long-term driver in terms of phosphate industry, starting from China, and we believe it will have impact around the growth, especially in the U.S."

At that point, now, I guess, the cost of Colonsay will start coming down. I mean, right now, we've been going through a transition. Overall, I would expect Colonsay to make up about 15% -- 10%, 15% of our total production. And as such, I guess, it's going to move our cost maybe $4, $5 a tonne overall. So it's not a big cost changer and that will be offset by as we move. 
Esterhazy K3 tonnes up, but they'll really start coming in at lower cost. So overall, I don't see a really significant increase in cost because of Colonsay, the overall market because of the offset of lower cost at K3. You asked about the 2022 ramp-up of K3. Again, as I mentioned earlier, we've just handed over the south shaft hoisting to operations. And so we have, I believe, 3 or 4 miners left to build, which takes a couple of months each. 
And then we'll be up at full production on K3 by the end of the -- basically by the end of the first quarter. So what you'll see now as we go forward is a slow move up to full production at K3, which will mean that our K1 and K2 mills will be fully utilized by the end of the third quarter, giving us approximately million tonnes of new capacity."

Well, thanks, Steve, and we're glad we got you back. We were worried about you. So as we look at new capital and you asked what -- how we would prioritize it, I guess there's probably a couple of areas that I'd like to highlight. We're not there yet, but we are coming close to where our MicroEssentials production capabilities are matched with our sales book. And so it won't be too long until we'll be looking at MicroEssentials expansion. 
And right now, we're asking ourselves a question, how and where do we expand MicroEssentials? Do you expand it in North America? And you still -- the growth is still in Brazil, but is it more efficient to expand it in North America or do you expand it in Brazil? So that question is being asked. Another area of -- we think growth opportunity, and you mentioned it, is distribution in Brazil, whether that be organic or whether that be a purchase. 
We think there's good opportunity in Brazil. It's a relatively lower capital -- lower cost, lower capital intensity. Though we see that as good, we've looked at a couple of opportunities to grow production in Brazil. And then the other one, I would say right now, we're extending our reserves in Florida. That might not increase our production but it certainly extends the mine life and the quality of the product as we go forward. 
So between MicroEssentials, reserves, extensions, we're not really looking at expanding potash as, I think, might have been the one you were asking. I just don't see that being required at this stage as we've just started Colonsay. So those are kind of the areas we're looking at, but they have to be high return, fairly quick payback. The one other one I just want to mention is there's -- I think there's a real opportunity investing in technology. So our next-gen transformation work, we think is going to pay back really well. And I'd encourage any of you to come and see some of the work we're doing around automation because it's great. So new products, distribution, reserves and automation would be the kind of the summary."

So let me start by saying today, affordability is okay. I think we all are kind of on the same page there. And I think the big question for most is, well, what happens if affordability gets to a point where people start rationing fertilizers. And I could easily see where marginal crop land, particularly here in the U.S. or something, may not get planted or whatever. 
But what I would expect to have happened in that case? I mean, today, we're looking at under 16% carryout for foreign. So stock-to-use ratio of under 16%, which is down to, what, a month? And so if you're looking at a month of supply, any kind of disruption or anything is going to cause a run-up in the price of corn or soybeans or whatever it is. And so you look around the world right now, palm oil prices more than doubled. Corn prices are sitting in the 5 50 range or something like that. Bean prices are good. So -- and the availability of all of them is low. 
So it's kind of a precarious spot for crops. So if people do plant less and that gets even tighter, I would expect you could start seeing price spikes. Likewise, if they plant more, the price may moderate, but then to do that, they're going to have to use more fertilizers. So in either case, I don't see a huge downside going forward from an affordability perspective because to get good yields, you need the fertilizer, and we need the crops. So you put the 2 together and you say, one of 2 things has got to happen. You've either got to use a lot of fertilizer on a few acres or you've got to plant a lot of acres. In either case,  we're -- we should be in pretty good shape going forward."

So in both cases, I think we're going to -- as I mentioned earlier, we're going to run up against production limitations before we run up against market limitations. In terms of the actual patent on it, I mean there's 2 aspects to that. Yes, we are working on ways to adapt the product to extend the patent and whatnot. But what we're seeing is there's a lot of copycats, but nobody has been yet able to make a product that has the same agronomic benefits, that has the same quality and certainly has the same reputation of 10-plus years of of good results. 
So, so far, it's been very successful, continues to be very successful. Nobody has really penetrated that market very much from us. So we're very positive going forward. In terms of some of our other performance products, we continue to do market development, as we've talked about before. Our Aspire product is growing well.

I hope you've had a chance to review our posted commentary and slides as well as our news release and performance data, which were made available on our website yesterday. I will provide some additional context before we respond to the questions we received last night, and then we'll conclude with a live Q&A session. 
Mosaic delivered excellent financial performance in the third quarter, with EBITDA reaching its highest level in more than a decade. Our business continues to benefit from the strong markets we've been discussing since the second half of 2020. With our North America production recovery and a strong order book, we expect the momentum to continue through the end of the year and into 2022. 
Before we get into our strong outlook, I want to briefly give you an update on the production issues we faced during the third quarter. As you'll remember, in June, our Esterhazy K1 and K2 potash mines experienced accelerated brine inflow, and we made the decision to stop operations approximately 6 months ahead of schedule. To help mitigate lost production, we further expedited the ramp-up of K3 and restarted Colonsay. 
The second shaft at K3 is now operational, which paves the way for us to reach full production in the first quarter of 2022. And at Colonsay, we hit our target run rate in October. 
In phosphates, the damage from Hurricane Ida and the equipment failure at New Wales resulted in a 300,000 tonne reduction loss in the third quarter. Thanks to the efforts of our team, the fourth quarter production shortfall has been reduced to 100,000 tonnes, and operating rates should be normal by the end of the year. In both phosphates and potash, our team has worked diligently to ensure any shortfalls resulting from issues outside of our control were temporary. 
As we head into the end of the year, and into 2022, we are well positioned to take advantage of the current market. 
Shifting now to agricultural markets. We continue to see strength extending well into 2022. Grain stocks remain limited and global corn and soybean demand is elevated, driven in part by surging Chinese demand and rising global biofuel demand. As a result, agricultural commodity prices remain high and farmer income remains well above historic norms. 
That strength in crop markets, combined with global industry supply constraints, are the key drivers pushing fertilizer prices higher. In the Americas, demand is considerably stronger than we expected at the beginning of the year. Brazil is expected to once again set a record for fertilizer shipments in 2021. 
Grower economics remain profitable despite the latest surges in nutrient prices, and this has been reflected in the significant order book into the end of the year and into the first half of 2022. In North America, demand continues to be strong and prices have followed reflecting a healthy domestic market benefiting from imports from a diverse group of suppliers. 
Grower economics remain favorable in North America, although not quite as favorable as during the first half of the year. However, persistently low inventories and capacity constraints are underpinning the tight supply-demand balance as well as pricing. 
In India, while farmer demand remains strong, and the government has recently acted to improve importer economics for phosphates, availability is still lagging. Recent moves by the governments will likely help in the recovery of Indian imports which lagged most of 2021 because of the disconnect between domestic subsidies and global prices. Given how depleted Indian inventories are, we see India as a source of pent-up demand, which should return to the market in 2022. 
In Southeast Asia, fertilizer demand is benefiting from the strength in palm oil prices, and China is incenting its farmers to maximize yields through subsidized crop prices. New supply of phosphates is limited. Chinese exports are expected to decline significantly in the fourth quarter and in the first half of 2022, reflecting the directive from China's National Development and Reform Commission that major producers halt all phosphate exports to ensure adequate domestic supply. 
In potash, demand growth continues to exceed new supply from higher operating rates announced by producers and prices continue to rise. Putting this all together, we expect further upside in realized pricing for phosphates and potash. Our fourth quarter order book is now about 90% committed and priced. As a result, we expect to see a sequential increase of $55 to $65 a tonne in realized phosphate prices and $110 to $130 a tonne in realized potash prices. We are seeing buyer appetite for first quarter commitments as well. All of this implies higher earnings in the fourth quarter and a very strong results continuing into 2022. 
Our earnings are leading to substantial free cash flow generation, which has allowed us to make significant progress towards several commitments we've made. Earlier this year, we raised our regular dividend target by 50% to $0.30 a share. In October, our Board approved an additional regular dividend target increase of 50% to $0.45 per share effective in 2022. 
In August, we repaid $450 million in long-term debt towards our target of $1 billion of debt reduction. Also in August, we announced an expanded share repurchase program of $1 billion. Since that announcement, we have repurchased more than 950,000 shares. In addition to strengthening the balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders, we continue to evaluate further investments in the business. Capital expenditures are expected to total $1.3 billion in 2021, of which roughly $450 million is growth-related. 
We continue to evaluate every opportunity that allows us to further strengthen the balance sheet, grow the business and return capital to our investors. 
Now before I conclude my opening remarks, I want to take a moment to recognize the many contributions of Laura Gagnon and what she has made at Mosaic. As Head of Investor Relations for the last decade, Laura has been an invaluable adviser to me and to the entire leadership team. We are very grateful for her service and wish her all the best in her retirement. Paul Massoud has been promoted to lead IR, and Laura will stay on through the end of the year to help with the transition. Please join me in wishing her well. 
With that, let's move on to questions. Paul?"

In terms of India, the inability to secure P&K has not been about farmer demand but importer economics. The inability or inadequate subsidies have really been what's driven the inability of the importers to economically bring product into that jurisdiction. However, what we do expect to see based on those 2 is pent-up demand in both China and India for early next year and into the spring season. So with that, I'm going to throw it over to Jenny to really talk about the details of fertilizer affordability in our key markets."

We don't have perfect insight into the soil inventory per se. But what we do have is we have some studies by the likes of the University of Illinois that show that over the last 10 years, actual soil inventories have decreased. And that's particularly as we've used more precision agriculture, which allows you to put the right amount of fertilizer down. But it also means you have to replace it every year. 
And of course, in Brazil, with the depleted soil, that has to be replaced every year. So there is definitely on-ground demand that will be there next year. In terms of channel inventory, we see that as being low in almost every jurisdiction. There is no place around the globe where we see any kind of buildup of channel inventory. And that's fundamentally different than it was 10 years ago where you had large amounts of inventory, not only of the fertilizers, but large inventories of crops like grains and oilseeds. 
So this turnaround is quite different. And so as we look forward, we see affordability fine right now, and we expect that affordability will be good because either price will have to go up for grains and oilseeds, which will drive long-term fertilizer or they will plant less, which means that prices for grains and oilseed will go up. So in other words, the cure for high prices is high prices."

Certainly, we know that on-farm demand for both phosphates and potash is very strong. At an importer level, the gap between global pricing and the retail price has been such that the importer economics are poor, which means they're not importing, which means that the product isn't available to the farmer. And really, that goes for both potash and phosphate.

But as we've seen recently, that has led to fairly large deficits domestically. So the government has stepped in, put on export restrictions, which are now taking effect. We don't expect a whole lot of Q4 exports or probably first quarter 2022. After that, we do expect things to return to normal. So for this year, we're expecting a little over 10 million tonnes of exports. Next year, we think that will return back to the, say, 9.5 or 9.3 that we've had in previous years. But year-over-year, we should be down about 1.5 million tonnes from where we were this year. 
Now we also see a long-term decline in production of phosphate fertilizers for agricultural use. That means that the phosphoric acid is starting to find its way into a lot of other industrial products, including these lithium iron phosphate batteries and a number of other areas. So what we see is a declining production over time and probably a restriction of availability into the phosphate fertilizer market. So that means that over time, we should see a decrease of exports from China."

And one of the things we've also been looking at is we have a number of assets that, over the long term, have been leased.

We are -- we have ownership or part ownership of a port in Paranagua and access to a port in Santos that really gives us an opportunity to get product into Brazil much more effectively than others. And then, of course, in-country production, where we save not only the ocean freight, but the rail or truck freight from the coast. 
So all of this logistics restrictions are actually working to our competitive advantage right now compared to others who would sell at the coast or -- and others who would have to come in through public ports. So we feel we're in a really good position there. Overall, Brazil will be tight for fertilizers, particularly, I guess, as we look forward, there could be some -- with any restrictions on the Belarusians, there could be some restrictions on getting the product to Brazil. 
And of course, ocean freight has at least probably doubled. So -- but that's going to affect everybody equally.

And then second, on your distribution business, and this is more for '22, you talked about a little bit some slowdown in demand or more flat demand next year in your market outlook is in that scenario. And if prices ever did correct, how do we think about the profitability of the distribution business in a falling price environment?"

Again, with the rise in commodity prices and the Brazilian currency devaluation over the last couple of years, the Brazilian farmers had the benefit of extremely good profitability. Now that has certainly decreased this year. And because of rising not just fertilizer, but fuel prices, seed prices, everything has gone up. And so not surprisingly, it squeezed them more than they're used to. 
However, I mean, our own belief is farmers like to farm. They're not going to sacrifice yield by not fertilizing, that just is not a good economic solution to the problem. A matter of fact, if anything, that would exacerbate their profitability issues. So we think that, that will continue as normal. Do we expect growth to be as strong in the next year or so? No, we would expect that growth would be more moderated than it has been. And a matter of fact, our longer-term growth numbers, we're looking at that being slightly lower than what the history has been. 
But overall, we think that it will continue. And Brazil will continue to be a great market and ultimately will be one of the big red baskets for the world. In terms of our distribution business, I think we have a very strong customer base. We are well respected in the market. Our brand has a very good name down there. Plus, we have great growth in our MicroEssentials, which is a good pull for that market. So they want our products specifically. 
So we have a very stable customer base. So even in a declining market, I would expect we would do as well or better than any of the others in that situation. So I worry less about the margins in distribution. They're very good right now, but I suspect we'll be able to keep those over time."

And that will profoundly change the phosphate industry in China. 
Coming into the U.S., as Joc mentioned, we have seen the announcement made by Tesla, are working with some other parties of building up LFP factories in the U.S. and building up the U.S. owned supply chain. We are looking into this area as well. So as the major phosphate producers, like Joc mentioned, we are doing our own study. This is going to be a long-term driver in terms of phosphate industry, starting from China, and we believe it will have impact around the growth, especially in the U.S."

At that point, now, I guess, the cost of Colonsay will start coming down. I mean, right now, we've been going through a transition. Overall, I would expect Colonsay to make up about 15% -- 10%, 15% of our total production. And as such, I guess, it's going to move our cost maybe $4, $5 a tonne overall. So it's not a big cost changer, and that will be offset by as we move. 
Esterhazy K3 tonnes up, but they'll really start coming in at lower cost. So overall, I don't see a really significant increase in cost because of Colonsay, the overall market because of the offset of lower cost at K3. You asked about the 2022 ramp-up of K3. Again, as I mentioned earlier, we've just handed over the south shaft hoisting to operations. And so we have, I believe, 3 or 4 miners left to build, which takes a couple of months each. 
And then we'll be up at full production on K3 by the end of the -- basically by the end of the first quarter. So what you'll see now as we go forward is a slow move up to full production at K3, which will mean that our K1 and K2 mills will be fully utilized by the end of the third quarter, giving us approximately million tonnes of new capacity."

Well, thanks, Steve, and we're glad we got you back. We were worried about you. So as we look at new capital and you asked what -- how we would prioritize it, I guess there's probably a couple of areas that I'd like to highlight. We're not there yet, but we are coming close to where our MicroEssentials production capabilities are matched with our sales book. And so it won't be too long until we'll be looking at MicroEssentials expansion. 
And right now, we're asking ourselves a question, how and where do we expand MicroEssentials? Do you expand it in North America? And you still -- the growth is still in Brazil, but is it more efficient to expand it in North America or do you expand it in Brazil? So that question is being asked. Another area of -- we think growth opportunity, and you mentioned it, is distribution in Brazil, whether that be organic or whether that be a purchase, we think there's good opportunity in Brazil. It's a relatively lower capital -- lower cost, lower capital intensity. Though we see that as good, we've looked at a couple of opportunities to grow production in Brazil. And then the other one, I would say right now, we're extending our reserves in Florida. That might not increase our production, but it certainly extends the mine life and the quality of the product as we go forward. 
So between MicroEssentials, reserves, extensions, we're not really looking at expanding potash as, I think, might have been the one you were asking. I just don't see that being required at this stage as we've just started Colonsay. So those are kind of the areas we're looking at, but they have to be high return, fairly quick payback. The one other one I just want to mention is there's -- I think there's a real opportunity investing in technology. So our next-gen transformation work, we think is going to pay back really well. And I'd encourage any of you to come and see some of the work we're doing around automation because it's great. So new products, distribution, reserves and automation would be the kind of the summary."

So let me start by saying today, affordability is okay. I think we all are kind of on the same page there. And I think the big question for most is, well, what happens if affordability gets to a point where people start rationing fertilizers. And I c",312,"Yes. So let me start by saying today, affordability is okay. I think we all are kind of on the same page there. And I think the big question for most is, well, what happens if affordability gets to a point where people start rationing fertilizers. And I could easily see where marginal crop land, particularly here in the U.S. or something, may not get planted or whatever. 
But what I would expect to have happened in that case? I mean, today, we're looking at under 16% carryout for foreign. So stock-to-use ratio of under 16%, which is down to, what, a month? And so if you're looking at a month of supply, any kind of disruption or anything is going to cause a run-up in the price of corn or soybeans or whatever it is. And so you look around the world right now, palm oil prices more than doubled. Corn prices are sitting in the $5.50 range or something like that. Bean prices are good. So -- and the availability of all of them is low. 
So it's kind of a precarious spot for crops. So if people do plant less and that gets even tighter, I would expect you could start seeing price spikes. Likewise, if they plant more, the price may moderate, but then to do that, they're going to have to use more fertilizers. So in either case, I don't see a huge downside going forward from an affordability perspective because to get good yields, you need the fertilizer, and we need the crops. So you put the 2 together and you say, one of 2 things has got to happen. You've either got to use a lot of fertilizer on a few acres or you've got to plant a lot of acres. In either case,  we're -- we should be in pretty good shape going forward."

So yes, so we're probably up to about 20% in the U.S., which would be about 2 million tonnes a year. And we're probably approaching 1.5 million tonnes in Brazil, so it's coming up to a similar size market, I guess, both of 15% and is still growing strong in Brazil. 
So in both cases, I think we're going to -- as I mentioned earlier, we're going to run up against production limitations before we run up against market limitations. In terms of the actual patent on it, I mean there's 2 aspects to that. Yes, we are working on ways to adapt the product to extend the patent and whatnot. But what we're seeing is there's a lot of copycats, but nobody has been yet able to make a product that has the same agronomic benefits, that has the same quality and certainly has the same reputation of 10-plus years of good results. 
So, so far, it's been very successful, continues to be very successful. Nobody has really penetrated that market very much from us. So we're very positive going forward.
