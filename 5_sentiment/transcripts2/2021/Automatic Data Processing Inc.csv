Earlier this morning, we released our results for the quarter. Our earnings materials are available on the SEC's website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com, where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today's call as well as our quarterly history of revenue and pretax earnings by reportable segment. 
During our call today, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. A description of these items along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release. 
Today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.

This morning, we reported results reflecting our continued strong business performance and momentum with our second quarter revenue and margins both outperforming our expectations as our bus",1250,"Thank you, Danny, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call. This morning, we reported results reflecting our continued strong business performance and momentum with our second quarter revenue and margins both outperforming our expectations as our business continued to demonstrate resilience in the face of ongoing economic headwinds. 
We reported revenue of $3.7 billion, up 1% on a reported basis and flat on an organic constant currency basis, with adjusted EBIT margin down 30 basis points. Coupled with a slight increase in the effective tax rate versus last year, a share count reduction, our adjusted diluted EPS was flat versus last year, much better than the decrease we were expecting. During the second quarter, we continue to see signs of improvement in the overall operating environment with positive implications for pays per control, new business bookings and retention. Our pays per control metric performed slightly better-than-expected as it improved sequentially to a decline of 6% versus the larger declines we experienced in Q1 and in the latter part of fiscal 2020. 
Underlying employment trends in Q2 were consistent with what we experienced in Q1, with larger enterprises somewhat slower to show improvement, but with small and midsized businesses demonstrating a healthy level of hiring. We performed well on Employer Services new business bookings. Even though bookings declined 7% this quarter, this was well ahead of our initial expectations earlier this year and in line with the revised expectations we communicated last quarter. And it's important to point out that our new business bookings for the first half nearly matched last year's half despite the very difficult environment as we had anticipated more modest sales contributions from items we noted last quarter, such as new business formations and multinational deals, coupled with a resurgence in virus case levels contributed to lower growth rate compared to Q1. But underlying trends have remained strong, including improving demand in our mid-market and HRO solutions as well as continued acceleration in leading indicators and a solid sales pipeline more broadly. 
Moreover, with the change in U.S. administration and the continuing dynamic regulatory environment, we expect momentum for our solutions to improve as companies continue to recognize the value of partnering with ADP given our deep compliance expertise and reliability. And as a final point, with what we believe to be the most challenging 6 months of the fiscal year behind us, we are now even more confident in our expectation for bookings performance to improve further. As a result of all these factors, we are raising our new business bookings guidance range by another 5% to 15% to 25%. 
Pays per control and bookings trends were both positive, but retention was the main highlight for us in the second quarter, with ES and PEO retention both reaching record levels. We saw strong performance across the board with the biggest improvement for the ES segment coming out of the U.S. downmarket and mid-market businesses as our client satisfaction scores remained at record levels across the board. Following this incredibly strong performance in an early read of Q3, we are very pleased to be able to raise our retention guidance significantly, a sign of our improving competitive position. And the retention we are now expecting would represent a record high ES retention for a full year. 
Now on to another critical topic and one that remains a key focus for us. Our product teams continue to execute well, and we reached a number of milestones this quarter. I'll start with RUN and Workforce Now, our 2 highest revenue platforms. For RUN, we continue to make a range of enhancements to make client onboarding seamless and in some cases, digitally automated, improving the implementation process for tens of thousands of RUN clients we bring on every year. We also made further enhancements this quarter to our Accountant Connect platform, already a big differentiator for us, and we now provide even more insights to our critical accountant partners. For Workforce Now, we continue to build momentum by leveraging our Next Gen Payroll engine. And as we discussed earlier this year, we are live with hundreds of clients who have been very pleased with the solution and continue to rate their experience very highly. In addition, we launched a new workforce management solution that along with our Next Gen Payroll engine enables real-time punch to net payroll calculations, all delivered from the public cloud. And based on feedback from our clients and sales associates, we believe a significant portion of the hundreds of sold Next Gen Payroll clients were incremental to what we would have sold without Next Gen, which, of course, has positive implications for market share and competitiveness in the mid-market as long as we continue to execute. 
Also, we continue to scale up our Next Gen HCM. In this quarter, we went live with our first client in Mexico. Importantly, we did this with enhanced speed to market as we partnered with a third-party to localize and implement, which speaks to the power of our federated architecture and the native global capability of our Next Gen HCM and Next Gen Payroll platforms. 
For our DataCloud platform, we had a number of exciting new launches. To support our clients around ESG objectives, we launched a pay equity storyboard that allows clients to identify equal pay gaps and calculate effective distribution models to close these differentials across their organization. We also continue to leverage the power of DataCloud outside our core HCM base. And earlier this month, launched a partnership with New York Stock Exchange owner, ICE, which will pair ICE data services market expertise with ADP's HR and compensation data. We are very excited about continuing to explore opportunities related to our differentiated and robust data set, which is the most expansive in the industry to drive both -- to drive insight both within and beyond traditional HCM use cases. 
This quarter, we also continued to receive industry accolades and won a number of awards for our solutions, including G2 and Capterra awards for the #1 user rated workforce management solution. We continue to reach all-time high client counts on all of our key platforms, including RUN, Workforce Now, Vantage, GlobalView and of course, Next Gen HCM. And within our HCM platforms, we continue to reach new client count milestones for individual solutions such as retirement services. 
Moving on, I'd like to once again acknowledge our associates for their ability to stay focused on finding innovative solutions and driving higher NPS in what has been an incredibly challenging and dynamic environment. It's because of this execution that we were able to demonstrate such resilient performance year-to-date with revenue flat, adjusted earnings per share up and retention at record levels. Now with the worst of the pandemic-related headwinds hopefully behind us and vaccine programs positioning us for continued recovery, we are increasingly focused on reaccelerating growth in the quarters and years ahead. To that end, we have already reinvested some of our Q2 outperformance into product development acceleration, a digital transformation push and selective sales and marketing expansion ahead of our key selling quarters. 
While it's too early to talk about fiscal 2022 in any detail, we expect our fourth quarter revenue growth to accelerate significantly, and our goal will be to sustain that momentum. We are very pleased with our performance year-to-date and the fundamental strength of our business, and we are very optimistic about the quarters ahead. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Kathleen."

Q2 was another strong quarter across every major business metric. While we will still face some pandemic-related headwinds for the balance of the year, we are more confident in our outlook given we believe the toughest part is behind us. Our performance thus far into the year reaffirms the resilience of our business model, the strength of our products and the ability of our sales and service teams to perform even in the toughest of environments. We remain confident in our ability to execute as we move forward. 
In the second quarter, our revenues grew 1% on a reported basis, flat on an organic constant currency basis, which is significantly better than our expectations coming into the year and better than even the revised expectations we had as of last quarter. Once again, ES retention rates represented favorability and did very -- as did very strong performance from our PEO. We managed expenses prudently while making important incremental growth and productivity investments and delivered margins that were better than our expectations. 
Our adjusted EBIT was down just 1% despite pressure from a decline in client funds interest. Our adjusted effective tax rate increased 20 basis points compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Our share count was lower year-over-year, driven by share repurchases. And as a result, our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.52 was flat versus last year's second quarter. 
Moving on to the segments. For ES, our revenues declined 1% on a reported basis and 2% on an organic constant currency basis, representing continued sequential improvement, driven by record level retention and a more modest 6% decline in pays per control versus 9% last quarter. Client funds interest declined 23% as average yield declined 50 basis points versus last year. Our balance growth, however, improved significantly to be flat this quarter, supported by better retention, better pays per control and the lapping of our Netherlands money movement operation closure in October of 2019.  Employer Services margin was flat for the quarter, significantly ahead of our expectations, supported by stronger revenue and prudent cost control. 
Our PEO also had another very strong quarter. Total PEO revenues increased 5% to $1.2 billion with average worksite employees improving sequentially to $571,000, down 2% year-over-year. The strong results were also driven by better retention, which was at record levels, as well as slight sequential improvement in pays per control, though it remains down mid-single digits versus last year. Revenues, excluding 0 margin benefit pass-throughs, improved to up 2%, well ahead of our expectations. This outperformance was driven partly by better WSE performance, but also due to favorability in wages paid for WSE during the quarter. PEO margin increased 100 basis points in the quarter, driven by better revenue as well as continued expense discipline. 
Given our overperformance in the first half of the year, we have taken the opportunity to ramp up certain investments to supplement growth and productivity coming out of the pandemic. Relative to our expectations heading into the year, we are investing to accelerate certain R&D initiatives. We are also increasing investment in digital transformation as we continue to apply technology to enhance self-service and take work out of the system. Additionally, we are investing further in sales head count and in certain marketing programs ahead of our key selling season in the back half of the year. 
Let me turn now to our updated guidance for fiscal 2021. As we've said, with 2 quarters now behind us, we feel more optimistic about the full year. Although we still anticipate certain pandemic-related headwinds to persist for the rest of the year, we do expect some of these headwinds to moderate. For pays per control, we continue to expect a decline of 3% to 4% for the year. For the first half of the year, pays per control performed slightly better than our expectations. But with the improvement seeming to moderate into the calendar year-end, we are making no change to our full year outlook at this point. Out-of-business losses have been better than expected throughout the first half. And at this point, we see minimal risk for a significant deterioration during the year given what we've seen early in Q3 and with stimulus potentially providing additional support to small businesses. On client funds interest, while the U.S. treasury yield curve has recently steepened, there is no material change to our expectation for our realized average yield for the current fiscal year. However, we are again revising our balance growth higher, primarily on stronger client growth. 
Let's now look at our revised fiscal 2021 guidance. For ES, we now expect revenue to be flat to up 2% for the full year versus our previous expectation for flat to down 2%. That's driven by a few factors. Having had strong bookings performance 6 months into the year and seeing continued improvement in leading indicators, we now expect our new business bookings to be up 15% to 25% compared to our prior forecast of up 10% to 20%. This additional 5% raise reflects the incremental investments we've made in sales and marketing as well as an overall increased confidence for the next 2 quarters, particularly as our clients and prospects continue to deal with changes in legislation governing the workplace, making the payroll and HCM solutions we offer and the compliance expertise we provide even more compelling. We now expect our ES retention to be up about 100 basis points versus flat to down 50 basis points. This improvement is driven by both the strong Q2 performance as well as reduced concern about Q3 losses as early signs indicate continued strong performance. This full year outlook would represent a new record ES retention level, and we are very focused on achieving that goal. And for our client funds interest, which primarily impacts the results of our ES segment, we are again raising our outlook on a higher average balances expectation following the strong Q2 retention performance as well as continued recovery in wages paid. There is no change to our expectation of an average yield of 1.6%. We now expect our margin in the Employer Services segment to decline 50 to 100 basis points for the year, representing a 50 basis point improvement versus our prior forecast. 
For our PEO, we now expect revenue up 3% to 5% versus our prior forecast of flat to up 3%. And we expect average worksite employees flat to up 2% versus our prior forecast of down 1% to up 1%. We continue to expect our average worksite employee metric to be negative in Q3 and then turn positive in Q4. Our revenues, excluding 0 margin pass-throughs, are now expected to be up 3% to 5% compared to our prior forecast of down 1% to up 1%. This significant increase is due to factors consistent with what we described for the second quarter, higher WSE count but also higher wages and therefore, more revenue on a per WSE basis. For PEO margin, we now expect to be up 50 to 100 basis points in fiscal 2021 versus our prior forecast for down 50 basis points to flat. This raise is driven primarily by stronger revenue performance. 
For our consolidated outlook, we now anticipate total ADP revenue to be up 1% to 3% in fiscal 2021 versus down 1% to up 1% prior. And we anticipate our adjusted EBIT margin to be down 50 to 100 basis points versus our prior guidance of down 100 to 150 basis points. We now expect our effective tax rate to be slightly lower at 23% for the year, and we continue to assume a net share count reduction in our guidance. Net of all these changes, we are raising our adjusted diluted EPS guidance to be down 2% to up 2% versus our prior guidance of down 3% to 7%. 
We are very pleased to have been able to raise our guidance again given the combination of better-than-expected macro conditions and our strong execution 6 months into the fiscal year. We remain confident in our strategy, growth prospects and ability to execute. Coming into the fiscal year, we have braced for a number of economic headwinds, but stayed focused on our strategy and growth. And we maintained our investment in our product, our sales force and our associates in order to support our key goals of delivering excellent client solutions and growing market share. As we have done since the pandemic started, we plan to continue to support investment in product and sales. We look forward to keeping you updated on our progress.

Let me take the -- I'll take the bookings maybe, and I'll let Kathleen talk about the SG&A. On the bookings, I think some of this is just lumpiness, if you will, of the results because there was no -- there are a couple of things that happen, but it's hard to call it a trend, right, because we only have really 2 quarters, if you will, of kind of post-pandemic results. But in essence, our mid-market business performed a lot better. So Workforce Now in the mid-market business did much better in this quarter than in the last quarter. And then if you remember, last quarter, we talked about that we got some help from our international business, and in particular, we called out multinational deals. And that was -- I'm not sure if we gave any color around that, but that was strong double digits, is the way I would put it, last quarter help to last quarter's growth. And this quarter, it was kind of slightly negative. Now in the context of what's happening in Europe, which really started to shut down and starting to have challenges before the U.S. in terms of the resurgence of the virus, we're pretty happy with that. Like, we're pretty proud of our sales teams over there that they were able to accomplish what they did in the second quarter. But sequentially, it was not as strong as the help we got in the first quarter. We also had really strong bookings in the first quarter in our downmarket business. We had some, what I would call, modest help from some, what we call, client conversions or, we call, client-based acquisitions, which we do on a regular basis, but they don't come in every single quarter. So we got a little bit of help from that. And I think I also mentioned last quarter, I think I've been doing this for 9 years, mentioning that whenever we have a strong finish to a year, we typically get off to a slower start. And the opposite is also true. When we have a really bad year, we tend to get off to a stronger start. A lot of our business is counted at the time of sale and start, but some of our business, as you know, like in the upmarket, we -- there is some flexibility, if you will, in the sales force. We don't necessarily endorse that, but there is some flexibility for salespeople to book something in, call it, July versus in May. And because of the way the incentives work and so forth, sometimes we get a little bit of movement from sales into the next fiscal year. If we have a bad fiscal year and the opposite is also true. When we have a strong fiscal year, and we tend to have a hard time getting started in July. But I think we've been -- so this is nothing new. We've been, I think, transparent in giving you all the kind of the color that we can around bookings. I would tell you that when we cut through all that, so we're trying to look at no different than you would do with, for example, earnings, where we're trying to see what's the core business doing excluding client funds interest, what's happening with the core business excluding pressure from pays per control. We do the same thing in bookings, like what's happening in the core underlying bookings, and we see very positive momentum there in terms of lead generation, digital leads coming in, activity by the sales force. So we're optimistic that the momentum will continue into the third and fourth quarter. Of course, the caveat being the virus has to cooperate in terms of -- and the vaccine rollout has to continue stay on track. But I think overall, if you cut through all the -- it's not fair to call them onetime items, but if you cut through all the noise, our momentum in the second quarter in terms of bookings was stronger than it was in the first quarter, even though it might not be what the reported number shows. And I'll let Kathleen talk about the SG&A."

The overall view or picture is that from a selling standpoint -- I'll talk about kind of full year, and then we can talk about linearity. But from an overall standpoint, we continue to invest in sales, as we've mentioned, and that is both head count investment as well as continuing to look at marketing investment and doing some of that. So you've got that investment in sales, but you've also got the work we're doing around transformation, which would be offsetting that investment as well as just discretionary cost control that we're very focused on doing as well. So kind of overall, you've got investment head count and marketing, you've got transformation work that we continue to do and discretionary cost control. That does change if you look at -- or not change, but the skew first half to second half is a little bit different as we do have significant bookings growth in Q4, our expectation. And so of course, that's going to result in higher Q4 selling expense for us."

On the pipeline question, we do have some visibility, but some of this is really about extrapolating momentum because in the downmarket, it's really more about head count and productivity than it is about pipeline. Whereas in the M&C and the upmarket -- I mean, I'm not telling you anything you wouldn't be able to figure out yourself. So we have a fair amount of visibility in some part of our business. But in other parts of our business, we -- based on our experience about productivity metrics and head count and so forth, we have confidence, obviously, in the guidance that we're giving in the raise, otherwise, we wouldn't be giving it. But a couple of things that have changed since last quarter. Last quarter, we had what we thought was much better results than we had expected, and we thought we had positive momentum. And then on top of that, now we have vaccine rollout. So that was not something that was talked about, but this is now a reality. We also had an election that was still in front of us, and that's been resolved. We also thought and people speculated there would be more stimulus and now there is, even though there's even more stimulus being debated. Just as a reminder, there was a $900 billion stimulus package that was approved. So I think if you look at -- which we try to do, we try to do a little bit of kind of correlation, regression or whatever you want to call it, between GDP and economic growth in our bookings because we do believe there is some connection there. Like there's other things, like the training of our sales force, the tools they have, the quality of the sales force, the turnover, but GDP is a powerful force. And the GDP numbers are looking pretty strong here on a go-forward basis, with perhaps the exception by some of our -- some analysts out there of the third -- of our third quarter, the quarter we're in right now. But if you look at fourth quarter -- our fourth quarter or the first half of next fiscal year for us and in the next calendar year after that, I mean even this full calendar year GDP expectation has been raised, I think, across the board by everyone. So I think it's partly visibility and pipeline and partly our experience. Like we know, for example, what a reasonable expectation is for productivity per DM per sales rep. We know how many sales reps we have. We know how many new ones we're hiring. We know what we're generating in terms of leads and digital marketing. And I think we put that all together, and that comes out to our guidance. And so I think we're confident in it, and we're actually very excited and positive that we were able to do that. And we're just glad that things are looking much better than they were last quarter and certainly better than they were looking in March and April. On the..."

The retention, obviously, is incredibly strong, and it's going to be record retention for the year, assuming we hit the guidance that we've just provided. We've never been at these retention levels. And I think there's a number of factors. I mean I think our product set is much stronger, and it's not just the products themselves, but it's our commitment to moving our clients onto our newer platform. So we have a lot more clients on newer platforms today than we had a year ago, 2 years ago, whether -- a quarter ago or a year ago. It's just a continuing progression that we've talked about now for many, many years, but we've made a lot of progress. And we know that the retention on our new platforms is higher than on some of our older platforms. So that's helping. There's probably some tailwind from -- that's pandemic related. We just can't put our finger on it, that clients are maybe not moving as much. But if you look at each business unit, like, for example, in our downmarket, the retention in our downmarket as a result of better product and better execution has been going up for probably 6 or 7 years and is up almost 500 basis points pre-pandemic and now it's gone up even more. So the fact that we've had this positive momentum in the downmarket, and it's a similar story in Workforce Now. It's not 500 basis points. But in the mid-market, we've also had 3 years of improving retention pre-pandemic. So I think those are signs that there's something happening in terms of our execution and our product, right? So execution is part of it as well. We have to deliver, I think, on the commitments we make to our clients to resolve issues for them and answer questions and so forth. So a combination of better service, like excellent service, and really better products and migrating clients, I think, is helping. And then secondly, the other data point that I would point to, which is really on the booking side, but -- combination of bookings and retention that our balance of trade is improving with several of our major competitors for the first time in a while. And I think it's, again, related to this effort that we've made to improve product, continue to deliver great service, stay focused on execution. And I think it's showing up now in some of these balance of trade numbers where we're showing some improvement. So the reason I bring that up is because balance of trade would be a combination of what we're bringing in, in terms of -- from some of our competitors, but also what we're losing to those same competitors. That's why we call it balance of trade. So there's a number of metrics that would tell me that our competitive position is getting better and then resulting obviously in higher retention and hopefully, also growing bookings here in the future."

So in Southern California, for example, we did see some challenges in terms of our bookings in the downmarket and into the mid-market there. It's still impressive that we were able to sell as much as we did. As a footnote, we sold a lot. To say that we're flat -- almost flat for us is -- at least we're impressed with ourselves that our bookings are flat for the first half of the year versus last year, but there clearly are pockets of challenge. Southern California would be a challenge. The Midwest was -- and the central part of the country was incredibly challenged for several months. But we've had other places that things were better as a result of maybe more economic activity or continuing opening regardless of the controversy around that. And then, again, Europe would be a place where I would call out where I think we started to encounter some real headwinds. So -- because geography for us is not just about the U.S., it's also global. So the answer is yes and that you should assume that we would be impacted by whatever you're seeing in the news. And so when you have hard lockdowns in very large metropolitan markets, that would affect us. But fortunately, we're very diversified geographically and across segments. So remember, we operate all the way from small to upmarket to international. And so we -- obviously, we try to find a way to keep all of these things in balance and have something helping us when other things may be working against us. So we did see some of that volatility, as you described. On the price side, so one of the things we did talk about last quarter, we did talk about competitors and what we heard anecdotally about competitor pricing action. But we did -- we also said last quarter that we didn't get any help from price last quarter. We did get a little bit of help. It was not significant, but call it around -- I think it was around 30 basis points of help, which is about normally what we would be getting in terms of revenue growth, help from price. And so I think what that tells you is -- what we're trying to signal to you there is to tell you that it was appropriate for us to pause for, call it, 4 to 5 months, our normal price increases. By the way, our normal price increases would have been -- July 1 would have been one of the main times when we do pricing -- price increases. And remember, our price increases are much more modest than they were 5, 10 years ago. But at our scale, it does matter. But we delayed those price increases because it was not appropriate to do that given the circumstances that we were under. But you fast forward to September, October, we felt that given the additional services that we were providing. So we're providing a number of incremental services at no additional cost to our clients that I believe our competitors are not providing. And so we thought that going back to our normal, modest price increases was a reasonable thing to do, and we did that. And you can see the impact on retention, which has been none. And so that would be, I think, a good sign for us."

Like we're very focused on market share and new unit growth, but we don't mind additional share of wallet and additional attach rate because that's helpful too. And as you know, our bookings have generally been balanced for many, many years, about half of it coming from new logos and half of it coming from incremental attach. So we love that business. I happened to be looking at those figures last night, and it obviously varies by business unit. But as an example, in the mid-market, we're kind of in the 60% to 70% range in terms of a tax rate for things like workforce management, which we used to call time and labor management and benefits administration. And we have things like DataCloud and other items that we can attach as well. But I think the best color to put on that is that there's still a lot of room. I mentioned how we are doing well not just in our new strategic platforms, but we're also doing well on some of our products that we don't always talk about a lot on these calls, like retirement services, insurance services, where those attach rates are very low in comparison to what I think is the potential for our client base because when you have a tightly integrated solution, it really is a much better experience for our clients. So it's good for us, but it's also good for our clients, which is always an important thing. So I guess the color I would put there is we've got really good attach rates on some of the core HCM modules like workforce management, ben admin. So HR, payroll, ben admin, workforce management, those are kind of the core. Talent management is a place where we've been seeing growing attach rates, and there's a lot of room still there for people to adopt those solutions. So we're very optimistic. And this is a key strategy for, I think, my predecessor before that, which has been great for us that we have a very broad industry. Part of our reason for concentrating on HCM and focusing the company away from some of the other businesses we have, like the brokerage business and dealer services and so forth, is this is a growing, robust space globally, and there's plenty of room to grow. We definitely want to still focus on and not take our eye off of market share and logo growth, but there's an enormous opportunity for us in terms of incremental attach rate."

But if I think back to the Analyst Day in 2018 and some of the company's key initiatives around the service alignment and taking costs out of the business and getting to, call it, mid-20s EBIT margin. I guess, aside from the world being very different with what happened with COVID, but I'm curious, Carlos, if you could just think, as far as those initiatives went and getting the margin structure of the business toward that, would you say that we're -- ex what happened with rates and with COVID, would we be in that shape today?

So I did go back and that's something that I actually have fresh on my mind. So -- and Danny will correct me if I'm wrong here. But I think our margin in '18, which you would have seen in that -- in our Analyst Day, was 20.7%. And we're now, I think, forecasting for fiscal year '21 -- I'm not sure that we're forecasting it, but I think you can extrapolate based on our guidance, I'll just throw out a number, so call it, 22.3%, 22.5%, somewhere in that range for fiscal year '21. That's with a significant drag from client funds interest, as you mentioned, and some drag from COVID as a result of slower than we would have thought or would have expected revenue growth. So I would say that on the margin side, we would be well ahead of what we talked about at Analyst Day, excluding these items. On the revenue side, clearly, we're not anywhere near that. It's why we had to withdraw that 3-year guidance that we had provided because obviously, the COVID headwinds with what happened with pays per control and just the economy in general made it very difficult. But again, it feels like this would -- this is a transitory event as we've talked about now for 2 or 3 quarters. Painful, devastating for many people, for our country, for the economy and for the world, but it is transitory and not an existential threat. And so we expect to get right back on the track that we were on before. And I happen to think that the fact that we were a couple of hundred basis points higher in margin, even with everything that's happened, than we were in '18, I think, tells you something about the structural margin opportunity in the business. But clearly, a very important part of that picture is growth. We need to grow the business long term because growth does require investment. And so what you should be hearing from us is we care about margin, and we think there's opportunity in terms of structural margins here going forward. But the most important thing we can do to drive long-term shareholder value here is to also grow the top line, and we're focused on that."

And I think that -- I'll pile on to that, that your comment, I think earlier, after you asked a question, and you summarized my comments, the business is definitely performing much better than it looks because we have. This client funds interest headwind is not just a headwind on margins, it's a headwind on revenue growth as well. It's almost a full percentage point. And as an example, on the margin impact, our margin I think in ES would have been up. And ADP overall, our margin would have been up 40 basis points instead of down 30 basis points for the quarter. So clearly, on the margin side, the picture is clouded, and that picture will -- I mean, interest rates go up and down, as we know. And everyone is always convinced that rates are going to stay low forever or they're going to stay high for over depending on where they are. But we believe that at a minimum, that headwind will abate unless interest rates continue to go down and then turn negative for the next 10 years, which is very unlikely as we all -- I think, as we all know. At least in the U.S., that's unlikely. On your question about bookings, one thing that's important to note is we do have record leads from -- through digital marketing coming in. So we have increased our investment in digital marketing, but we're very careful to do that to make sure that we're getting the proper ROI. But that is something that is certainly helping our sales force. But really, the message for our sales force is that we want them to meet our -- the clients and the prospects where they want to be met. And they have all the tools, all modern tools that any sales force uses. I mean the reality is, I've said this before, people steal our sales force. And so we have to understand, we have the best sales force in the industry. There's no question about it. And they have all the tools they need to compete effectively. And they had to obviously moved to being mostly a virtual sales force over the last 6 months, and we made sure they have the tools to be able to do that, and that's where clients wanted to be met. And if in 6 months, we anticipate that some of our upmarket and multinational clients will be okay having some digital meetings or virtual meetings, but they might want to have people visiting some of them again, we'll be ready for that as well, assuming that it's safe and that people are vaccinated. So there are a number of channels that we can pursue, but you should understand that our kind of -- our strategy is really to meet the clients where they want to be met. As an example, in the downmarket, our clients rely on trusted advisers like accountants and brokers. We have very, very strong partner relationships with those channels, and that's how we drive results in that channel. So it really varies channel by channel. But you should understand that we are pursuing every channel, every avenue, including upping our digital marketing investments to make sure that we're getting our fair share of that without throwing money away."

But I'm in the camp, for example, in the upmarket with some of my other competitors and CEOs who believe that there will be face-to-face meetings again and particularly sales meetings. But I'm also in the camp of believing with lots of others that we shouldn't assume that things are going to go back exactly the way they were before, right? Whether it's with the way people are working or the way people are selling, we're going to have to adapt to what inevitably is going to be some change. Having said that, I believe I saw a statistic the other day that said that prior to the pandemic, about 10% of the U.S. workforce was working from home, and it went up to 33% at the worst part of the pandemic and then came back down to 25%. And I kind of monitor this through other sources that show that it ticked up slightly again, the number of people working from home as this virus continued to surge. But you would expect that 25% to probably go back to 15%, 20%, but not probably back to 10%. But remember that the other 70% never worked from home, and today, 75% of the people are not working from home. And so -- but that doesn't mean that we haven't learned new techniques. So for example, an initial meeting or a follow-up meeting or maybe even an implementation meeting with a client, I think we've all learned that it's much more effective to do that for both parties virtually. But it's hard to believe that we're going to go back exactly to where we were before, and it's also very hard to believe that we're going to stay exactly the way we are today. And again, I hate to give you a wishy washy answer because I think we're going to have to let that play out. But we are -- like a lot of other things, we are maintaining optionality and equipping our sales force to be prepared for either of those eventualities.

So -- but maybe taking a little bit of liberty like others are doing and giving you a little bit more color about just the things that are going well. So -- but if we did that, like, if we'd only focused on the growth of, for example, Next Gen, it would be 800% growth.

So I think we're making progress, but we are a large organization with large market share. And clearly, that exposes our flanks. And we have to be very good at making sure that we protect our flanks, which I think we're doing a good job of as evidenced by retention. But when you look at the go-forward and the growth of our strategic platforms, there's a lot of reason for optimism that we will, I think, be able to compete effectively on a go-forward basis.

So I think that bodes well for, I think, our competitiveness and our market share. And our plans are to have, call it, somewhere around a couple of thousand I think for this fiscal year. So it's positive momentum. Again, the caveat there is with Next Gen HCM, we are generally going after very large clients. And in the case of Next Gen Payroll, it is really a platform that solves our kind of Next Gen Payroll needs across the board, and we started in, call it, the core of our mid-market. So call it, between 50 and 150 employees has -- really has been our focus. So -- but having said that, it's still pretty impressive, and we're pretty happy and pretty positive, satisfaction levels are very high. And I think we've just got great momentum. And the sales force is obviously incredibly excited. Even though, remember, this is still a back-end engine, right? So it's still a Workforce Now and in the future, will be Lifion that are using pie as an engine. But it does provide some additional benefits to the client and a lot of sizzle as well as we know that matters as well, given how some of our competitors, I think, have used sizzle in their in their sales process. And so we're able to use some sizzle now with Next Gen Payroll. So very excited about that rollout and about the progress there. On Next Gen HCM, you heard about our rollout in Mexico, which is really Next Gen HCM with PI. So we have, call it, a handful of clients now in 4 countries that are actually running on Next Gen HCM with Kai. Again it's very early, like to talk about only a handful of clients isn't a lot. But what was most encouraging is that in a couple of those situations, we were able to use what we're calling a federated development process, which is -- one of the intentions was that the investment in this platform which is to be able to build rapidly. So the Mexico client was onboarded in -- from soup to nuts in terms of building platform, getting the client and getting them onboarded in, call it, 6 to 9 months. So very, very impressive for us to be able to do that. So we're optimistic that this will continue to hopefully help us, again, competitively. And I think you also asked about how many clients we've migrated off of Workforce Now on to PI. And remember that it's really -- and you're not migrating clients off of Workforce Now, you're just changing the underlying payroll engine. They're still on the workforce now. The answer to that is, I think, not many, like this is mostly new logo sales in the case of Next Gen Payroll, again, underneath Workforce Now. So as we go to market, it's still Workforce Now with the pie payroll engine beneath it. And just to -- again, footnote, I think I said this last quarter, Workforce Now is a Next Gen platform. We don't talk about it that way because we haven't been talking about it that way, but Workforce Now with Pie is a Next Gen platform."

That $150 million still holds, that was our estimated benefits for the year, the current fiscal year from digital and other transformation efforts. Where are we in that journey? I'd say we're in the early days, early innings here. I mean, as I mentioned, these projects are not fast-to-implement projects. These are not 2, 3, 4 months projects that you roll out. These are how do we procure or build the right tools to take work out of the system. How do we -- while some of it can be a little faster, like continuing to build out chat box functionality and how many inquiries [indiscernible] and some of those could go faster. But some of them could be longer projects like supporting our implementation teams with tools that we're building. So my view is we're in the early innings here. We've had some good success thus far.

And it's really -- it varies business by business. But as an example, we are, I think, in the early stages, I would say, still not ready -- I think I'm not supposed to say anything about it, but we think that in the down market, there is part of the addressable market that we could do better with if we had a more kind of end-to-end digital product, if you will, in terms of -- so this would be a complement to RUN that would compete in a segment of the market that we don't compete in today. Likewise, if you go all the way to the upmarket and international, the acquisition of Solergo was intended to kind of bolster, I think, a market that is growing and I think is expanded by our acquisition of Solergo. And in the Next Gen platforms, if you will, are for sure, intended to expand the addressable market. So for example, the Next Gen Payroll engine again with Workforce Now would probably be -- have more appeal to an in-house user, even though people don't think there's a lot of those left, there are still people who use kind of in-house software, if you will. And I think that this Next Gen payroll platform combined with Workforce Now provides more control, which is something that for the last 20 years when we survey the market, if you will, to assess what's addressable, there was always this kind of outsourcing versus in-house. And I think what's happened is that cloud technology has blurred that line, but there's still a line there. And the ability to have the payroll platform perform some of the things that people want from a control standpoint when they're in-house, I think, expands that addressable market. And then lastly, in terms of Next Gen HCM, I mean, clearly, the big play there and the big investment was to expand the addressable market in the upmarket for us, both the larger, more complex clients, but the clients who also had HR needs that we were not necessarily able to satisfy with some of our older platforms. So definitely, I think a lot of opportunity and it's a focus -- a key focus of our strategy in terms of how we develop our products is to expand the addressable market."

Just a question and a follow-up or a clarification. Just on the KPIs here, Carlos, that you're most focused on in the second half, just hearing everything you talked about positive revisions to retention, bookings. I'm curious if there are any underappreciated KPIs at this point of the cycle that we should be tracking to gauge the sustainability of the improvement that you're talking about as we get through the second half of the year. And just a clarification, I think you touched upon it in the last comment here. Just the 25% of sales of Next Gen Payroll that would not have been attained without it. Are you -- are those clients on a cloud platform that are looking for a cloud, like the controls and what not that you're talking about that  was the condition for considering it? I'm just trying to understand how -- why they didn't consider it before, if that makes sense."

We could probably maybe follow-up to give you a little more color. That's why I tried to use the words not scientific. So our sales force -- we're obviously very focused on the rollout of our Next Gen platforms. And so as we try to keep close communication and keep close tabs with our sales force on how it's going, and they came to us and said, we think we got 25% more logos as a result of Next Gen Payroll than we would have gotten in the past. I'm guessing there are going to be a number of different reasons for that, including there may be a little bit of a sizzle factor there, right, in terms of -- because we -- as you know, we run fully compliant payrolls. We help our clients with PPP loans. I mean we were able to do everything. Like our existing platforms are the most robust, most comprehensive, most effective, I believe, of course, I'm biased, in the industry. But there are incremental improvements, right, that give people -- whether it's the control aspect that I mentioned or the sizzle that helps sales. And it's no different than you go buy a car, and there's 5 different models of the same car and people buy the 5 different cars. And -- but you have to have new cars every now and then, and I think it's every 5 years or whatever that cycle is. And I think that's maybe some of what's happening here. But we'll try to get you a little bit of additional color if we can, but that wasn't intended to spark a kind of a new level of disclosure, if you will, about what percentage of our 25% came as a result of which feature. But we'll try to provide some color either in the interim or certainly on the next call when we're going to have many more clients on Next Gen Payroll, and we'll have a little bit more data for you. On the question you had about KPIs, I would say you hit on all of them, like there's a lot of important ones that you just -- that you touched on that we watch and that we share with you. The other ones that I think are important are ones around productivity, both for sales but also for our service and implementation associates. And in particular, on sales, that's part of why I was talking about the kind of the underlying trends improving and us being so optimistic about the future is we are -- there's no reason why our sales force can't get to the same productivity they were pre-pandemic and then continue to increase that productivity as they had been doing for many, many years. And so that's one of those KPIs that we watch very carefully is what's happening to that sales force productivity number quarter-on-quarter and what's expected to do in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter. And luckily, it's on track, and it's something that we watch very carefully. Likewise, the productivity per service rep and productivity of implementation. So as an example, how many new clients can an implementation rep onboard. And these were all impacted by the digital transformation that Kathleen was talking about because our goal is to make it easier and better for our clients, and as a byproduct, hopefully, reduce our operating expenses, not reduce our operating expenses and then figure out what happens after that because the most important driver of long-term value here is client retention. And I can tell you that if we maintain these client retentions, you guys should go do the math on how much faster our revenue will grow on a normal steady-state basis with the same bookings. It's pretty powerful, right? And obviously, that's incremental revenue growth that doesn't have incremental sales expense or implementation expense. So the most important thing for us to do is to make good on our commitment to our client. But having said that, those productivity metrics are important too in determining kind of our ability to drive margin into the future because those are 2 big buckets of expense, our service and implementation costs. And again, that's another item where the KPI there would really be around not just NPS and retention but around productivity. And the good news there is that we've been showing really good productivity improvements while we've also been driving very good retention, which speaks to the success of our digital transformation efforts."

This morning, we reported results reflecting our continued strong business performance and momentum with our second quarter revenue and margins both outperforming our expectations as our bus",1253,"Thank you, Danny, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call. This morning, we reported results reflecting our continued strong business performance and momentum with our second quarter revenue and margins both outperforming our expectations as our business continued to demonstrate resilience in the face of ongoing economic headwinds. We reported revenue of $3.7 billion, up 1% on a reported basis and flat on an organic constant currency basis, with adjusted EBIT margin down 30 basis points. Coupled with a slight increase in the effective tax rate versus last year, a share count reduction, our adjusted diluted EPS was flat versus last year, much better than the decrease we were expecting. 
During the second quarter, we continue to see signs of improvement in the overall operating environment with positive implications for pays per control, new business bookings and retention. Our pays per control metric performed slightly better than expected as it improved sequentially to a decline of 6% versus the larger declines we experienced in Q1 and in the latter part of fiscal 2020. Underlying employment trends in Q2 were consistent with what we experienced in Q1, with larger enterprises somewhat slower to show improvement, but with small and midsized businesses demonstrating a healthy level of hiring. 
We performed well on Employer Services new business bookings. Even though bookings declined 7% this quarter, this was well ahead of our initial expectations earlier this year and in line with the revised expectations we communicated last quarter. And it's important to point out that our new business bookings for the first half nearly matched last year's half despite the very difficult environment. 
As we had anticipated, more modest sales contributions from items we noted last quarter, such as new business formations and multinational deals, coupled with a resurgence in virus case levels, contributed to lower growth rate compared to Q1. But underlying trends have remained strong, including improving demand in our mid-market and HRO solutions as well as continued acceleration in leading indicators and a solid sales pipeline more broadly. Moreover, with the change in U.S. administration and the continuing dynamic regulatory environment, we expect momentum for our solutions to improve as companies continue to recognize the value of partnering with ADP given our deep compliance expertise and reliability. And as a final point, with what we believe to be the most challenging 6 months of the fiscal year behind us, we are now even more confident in our expectation for bookings performance to improve further. As a result of all these factors, we are raising our new business bookings guidance range by another 5% to 15% to 25%.  
Pays per control and bookings trends were both positive, but retention was the main highlight for us the second quarter, with ES and PEO retention both reaching record levels. We saw strong performance across the board with the biggest improvement for the ES segment coming out of the U.S. downmarket and mid-market businesses as our client satisfaction scores remained at record levels across the board. Following this incredibly strong performance in an early read of Q3, we are very pleased to be able to raise our retention guidance significantly, a sign of our improving competitive position. And the retention we are now expecting would represent a record-high ES retention for a full year. 
Now on to another critical topic and one that remains a key focus for us. Our product teams continue to execute well, and we reached a number of milestones this quarter. I'll start with RUN and Workforce Now, our 2 highest-revenue platforms. 
For RUN, we continue to make a range of enhancements to make client onboarding seamless, and in some cases, digitally automated, improving the implementation process for tens of thousands of RUN clients we bring on every year. We also made further enhancements this quarter to our Accountant Connect platform, already a big differentiator for us, and we now provide even more insights to our critical accountant partners. 
For Workforce Now, we continue to build momentum by leveraging our Next Gen Payroll engine. And as we discussed earlier this year, we are live with hundreds of clients who have been very pleased with the solution and continue to rate their experience very highly. In addition, we launched a new workforce management solution that, along with our Next Gen Payroll engine, enables real-time punch to net payroll calculations, all delivered from the public cloud. And based on feedback from our clients and sales associates, we believe a significant portion of the hundreds of sold Next Gen Payroll clients were incremental to what we would have sold without Next Gen, which of course has positive implications for market share and competitiveness in the mid-market as long as we continue to execute. 
Also, we continue to scale up our Next Gen HCM. In this quarter, we went live with our first client in Mexico. Importantly, we did this with enhanced speed to market as we partnered with a third party to localize and implement, which speaks to the power of our federated architecture and the native global capability of our Next Gen HCM and Next Gen Payroll platforms. 
For our DataCloud platform, we had a number of exciting new launches. To support our clients around ESG objectives, we launched a pay equity storyboard that allows clients to identify equal pay gaps and calculate effective distribution models to close these differentials across their organization. We also continue to leverage the power of DataCloud outside our core HCM base, and earlier this month, launched a partnership with New York Stock Exchange owner, ICE, which will pair ICE Data Services' market expertise with ADP's HR and compensation data. We are very excited about continuing to explore opportunities related to our differentiated and robust data set, which is the most expansive in the industry, to drive both -- to drive insight both within and beyond traditional HCM use cases. 
This quarter, we also continued to receive industry accolades and won a number of awards for our solutions, including G2 and Capterra awards, for the #1 user rated workforce management solution. We continue to reach all-time high client counts on all of our key platforms, including RUN, Workforce Now, Vantage, GlobalView and of course Next Gen HCM. And within our HCM platforms, we continue to reach new client count milestones for individual solutions such as retirement services. 
Moving on, I'd like to once again acknowledge our associates for their ability to stay focused on finding innovative solutions and driving higher NPS in what has been an incredibly challenging and dynamic environment. It's because of this execution that we were able to demonstrate such resilience -- such resilient performance year-to-date with revenue flat, adjusted earnings per share up and retention at record levels. 
Now with the worst of the pandemic-related headwinds hopefully behind us and vaccine programs positioning us for continued recovery, we are increasingly focused on reaccelerating growth in the quarters and years ahead. To that end, we have already reinvested some of our Q2 outperformance into product development acceleration, a digital transformation push and selective sales and marketing expansion ahead of our key selling quarters.  
While it's too early to talk about fiscal 2022 in any detail, we expect our fourth quarter revenue growth to accelerate significantly, and our goal will be to sustain that momentum. We are very pleased with our performance year-to-date and the fundamental strength of our business, and we are very optimistic about the quarters ahead.  
And with that, I'll turn it over to Kathleen."

Q2 was another strong quarter across every major business metric. While we will still face some pandemic-related headwinds for the balance of the year, we are more confident in our outlook given, we believe, the toughest part is behind us. Our performance thus far into the year reaffirms the resilience of our business model, the strength of our product and the ability of our sales and service teams to perform even in the toughest of environments. We remain confident in our ability to execute as we move forward. 
In the second quarter, our revenues grew 1% on a reported basis, flat on an organic constant currency basis, which is significantly better than our expectations coming into the year and better than even the revised expectations we had as of last quarter. Once again, ES retention rates represented favorability and did very -- as did very strong performance from our PEO. We managed expenses prudently while making important incremental growth and productivity investments and delivered margins that were better than our expectations. 
Our adjusted EBIT was down just 1% despite pressure from a decline in client funds interest. Our adjusted effective tax rate increased 20 basis points compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Our share count was lower year-over-year, driven by share repurchases. And as a result, our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.52 was flat versus last year's second quarter. 
Moving on to the segments. For ES, our revenues declined 1% on a reported basis and 2% on an organic constant currency basis, representing continued sequential improvement driven by record-level retention and a more modest 6% decline in pays per control versus 9% last quarter. Client funds interest declined 23% as average yield declined 50 basis points versus last year. Our balance growth, however, improved significantly to be flat this quarter, supported by better retention, better pays per control and the lapping of our Netherlands money movement operation closure in October of 2019. Employer Services margin was flat for the quarter, significantly ahead of our expectations, supported by stronger revenue and prudent cost control. 
Our PEO also had another very strong quarter. Total PEO revenues increased 5% to $1.2 billion with average worksite employees improving sequentially to 571,000, down 2% year-over-year. The strong results were also driven by better retention, which was at record levels, as well as slight sequential improvement in pays per control, though it remains down mid-single digits versus last year. Revenues, excluding 0 margin benefit pass-throughs, improved to up 2%, well ahead of our expectations. This outperformance was driven partly by better WSE performance, but also due to favorability in wages paid for WSEs during the quarter. PEO margin increased 100 basis points in the quarter, driven by better revenue as well as continued expense discipline. 
Given our overperformance in the first half of the year, we have taken the opportunity to ramp up certain investments to supplement growth and productivity coming out of the pandemic. Relative to our expectations heading into the year, we are investing to accelerate certain R&D initiatives. We are also increasing investment in digital transformation as we continue to apply technology to enhance self-service and take work out of the system. Additionally, we are investing further in sales headcount and in certain marketing programs ahead of our key selling season in the back half of the year. 
Let me turn now to our updated guidance for fiscal 2021. As we've said, with 2 quarters now behind us, we feel more optimistic about the full year. Although we still anticipate certain pandemic-related headwinds to persist for the rest of the year, we do expect some of these headwinds to moderate. 
For pays per control, we continue to expect a decline of 3% to 4% for the year. For the first half of the year, pays per control performed slightly better than our expectations. But with the improvement seeming to moderate into the calendar year-end, we are making no change to our full year outlook at this point. 
Out-of-business losses have been better than expected throughout the first half. And at this point, we see minimal risk for a significant deterioration during the year given what we've seen early in Q3 and with stimulus potentially providing additional support to small businesses. 
On client funds interest, while the U.S. treasury yield curve has recently steepened, there is no material change to our expectation for our realized average yield for the current fiscal year. However, we are again revising our balance growth higher, primarily on stronger client growth. 
Let's now look at our revised fiscal 2021 guidance. For ES, we now expect revenue to be flat to up 2% for the full year versus our previous expectation for flat to down 2%. That's driven by a few factors. Having had strong bookings performance 6 months into the year and seeing continued improvement in leading indicators, we now expect our new business bookings to be up 15% to 25% compared to our prior forecast of up 10% to 20%. This additional 5% raise reflects the incremental investments we've made in sales and marketing as well as an overall increased confidence for the next 2 quarters, particularly as our clients and prospects continue to deal with changes in legislation governing the workplace, making the payroll and HCM solutions we offer and the compliance expertise we provide even more compelling. 
We now expect our ES retention to be up about 100 basis points versus flat to down 50 basis points. This improvement is driven by both the strong Q2 performance as well as reduced concern about Q3 losses as early signs indicate continued strong performance. This full year outlook would represent a new record ES retention level, and we are very focused on achieving that goal. 
And for our client funds interest, which primarily impacts the results of our ES segment, we are again raising our outlook on a higher average balances expectation following the strong Q2 retention performance as well as continued recovery in wages paid. There is no change to our expectation of an average yield of 1.6%. 
We now expect our margin in the Employer Services segment to decline 50 to 100 basis points for the year, representing a 50 basis point improvement versus our prior forecast.  
For our PEO, we now expect revenue up 3% to 5% versus our prior forecast of flat to up 3%. And we expect average worksite employees flat to up 2% versus our prior forecast of down 1% to up 1%. We continue to expect our average worksite employee metric to be negative in Q3 and then turn positive in Q4. Our revenues, excluding 0 margin pass-throughs, are now expected to be up 3% to 5% compared to our prior forecast of down 1% to up 1%. This significant increase is due to factors consistent with what we described for the second quarter, higher WSE count but also higher wages and therefore more revenue on a per WSE basis. For PEO margin, we now expect to be up 50 to 100 basis points in fiscal 2021 versus our prior forecast for down 50 basis points to flat. This raise is driven primarily by stronger revenue performance.  
For our consolidated outlook, we now anticipate total ADP revenue to be up 1% to 3% in fiscal 2021 versus down 1% to up 1% prior. And we anticipate our adjusted EBIT margin to be down 50 to 100 basis points versus our prior guidance of down 100 to 150 basis points. We now expect our effective tax rate to be slightly lower at 23% for the year, and we continue to assume a net share count reduction in our guidance. Net of all these changes, we are raising our adjusted diluted EPS guidance to be down 2% to up 2% versus our prior guidance of down 3% to 7%. 
We are very pleased to have been able to raise our guidance again given the combination of better-than-expected macro conditions and our strong execution 6 months into the fiscal year. We remain confident in our strategy, growth prospects and ability to execute. Coming into the fiscal year, we had braced for a number of economic headwinds, but stayed focused on our strategy and growth. And we maintained our investment in our product, our sales force and our associates in order to support our key goals of delivering excellent client solutions and growing market share. As we have done since the pandemic started, we plan to continue to support investment in product and sales. We look forward to keeping you updated on our progress.  
And with that, I will turn it over to the operator for Q&A."

Let me take the -- I'll take the bookings maybe, and I'll let Kathleen talk about the SG&A. On the bookings, I think some of this is just the lumpiness, if you will, of the results because there was no -- there are a couple of things that happened, but it's hard to call it a trend, right, because we only have really 2 quarters, if you will, of kind of post-pandemic results. 
But in essence, our mid-market business performed a lot better. So Workforce Now in the mid-market business did much better in this quarter than in the last quarter. And then if you remember, last quarter, we talked about that we got some help from our international business, and in particular we called out multinational deals. And that was -- I'm not sure if we gave any color around that, but that was strong double digits, is the way I would put it, last quarter, help to last quarter's growth. And this quarter, it was kind of slightly negative. 
Now in the context of what's happening in Europe, which really started to shut down and starting to have challenges before the U.S. in terms of the resurgence of the virus, we're pretty happy with that. Like, we're pretty proud of our sales teams over there that they were able to accomplish what they did in the second quarter. But sequentially, it was not as strong as the help we got in the first quarter. 
We also had really strong bookings in the first quarter in our downmarket business. We had some, what I would call, modest help from some, what we call, client conversions or we call client-based acquisitions, which we do on a regular basis, but they don't come in every single quarter. So we got a little bit of help from that. 
And I think I also mentioned last quarter, I think I've been doing this for 9 years, mentioning that whenever we have a strong finish to a year, we typically get off to a slower start. And the opposite is also true. When we have a really bad year, we tend to get off to a stronger start. 
A lot of our business is counted at the time of sale and start, but some of our business, as you know, like in the upmarket, we -- there is some flexibility, if you will, in the sales force. We don't necessarily endorse that, but there is some flexibility for salespeople to book something in, call it, July versus in May. And because of the way the incentives work and so forth, sometimes, we get a little bit of movement from sales into the next fiscal year if we have a bad fiscal year. And the opposite is also true. When we have a strong fiscal year, and we tend to have a hard time getting started in July. 
But I think we've been -- so this is nothing new. We've been, I think, transparent in giving you all the kind of the color that we can around bookings. I would tell you that when we cut through all that, so we're trying to look at, no different than you would do with, for example, earnings, where we're trying to see what's the core business doing, excluding client funds interest? What's happening with the core business, excluding pressure from pays per control? We do the same thing in bookings, like what's happening in the core underlying bookings? And we see very positive momentum there in terms of lead generation, digital leads coming in, activity by the sales force. 
So we're optimistic that the momentum will continue into the third and fourth quarter. Of course, the caveat being the virus has to cooperate in terms of -- and the vaccine rollout has to continue to stay on track. But I think overall, if you cut through all the -- it's not fair to call them onetime items, but if you cut through all the noise, our momentum in the second quarter in terms of bookings was stronger than it was in the first quarter, even though it might not be what the reported number shows. 
And I'll let Kathleen talk about the SG&A."

The overall view or picture is that, from a selling standpoint -- I'll talk about kind of full year, and then we can talk about linearity. But from an overall standpoint, we continue to invest in sales, as we've mentioned. And that is both headcount investment as well as continuing to look at marketing investment and doing some of that. 
So you've got that investment in sales, but you've also got the work we're doing around transformation, which would be offsetting that investment, as well as just discretionary cost control that we're very focused on doing as well. 
So kind of overall, you've got investment, headcount and marketing, you've got transformation work that we continue to do and discretionary cost control. That does change if you look at -- or not change, but the skew, first half to second half, is a little bit different as we do have significant bookings growth in Q4, our expectation. And so of course, that's going to result in higher Q4 selling expense for us."

On the pipeline question, we do have some visibility, but some of this is really about extrapolating momentum. Because in the downmarket, it's really more about headcount and productivity than it is about pipeline. Whereas in the MNC and the upmarket -- I mean, I'm not telling you anything you wouldn't be able to figure out yourself. So there -- we have a fair amount of visibility in some part of our business. But in other parts of our business, we, based on our experience about productivity metrics and headcount and so forth, we have confidence, obviously, in the guidance that we're giving in the raise. Otherwise, we wouldn't be giving it. 
But a couple of things that have changed since last quarter. Last quarter, we had what we thought was much better results than we had expected, and we thought we had positive momentum. And then on top of that, now we have the vaccine rollout. So that was not something that was talked about, but this is now a reality. We also had an election that was still in front of us, and that's been resolved. We also thought, and people speculated, there would be more stimulus, and now there is. Even though there's even more stimulus being debated, just as a reminder, there was a $900 billion stimulus package that was approved. 
So I think if you look at -- which we try to do, we try to do a little bit of kind of correlation, regression or whatever you want to call it, between GDP and economic growth and our bookings because we do believe there is some connection there. Like there's other things, like the training of our sales force, the tools they have, the quality of the sales force, the turnover, but GDP is a powerful force. 
And the GDP numbers are looking pretty strong here on a go-forward basis, with perhaps the exception by some of our -- some analysts out there of the third -- of our third quarter, the quarter we're in right now. But if you look at fourth quarter -- our fourth quarter or the first half of next fiscal year for us and then the next calendar year after that, I mean, even this full calendar year GDP expectation has been raised, I think, across the board by everyone. 
So I think it's partly visibility and pipeline and partly our experience. Like we know, for example, what a reasonable expectation is for productivity per diem, per sales rep. We know how many sales reps we have. We know how many new ones we're hiring. We know what we're generating in terms of leads and digital marketing. And I think we put that all together, and that comes out to our guidance. And so I think we're confident in it, and we're actually very excited and positive that we were able to do that. And we're just glad that things are looking much better than they were last quarter and certainly better than they were looking in March and April.

The retention, obviously, is incredibly strong, and it's going to be record retention for the year assuming we hit the guidance that we've just provided. We've never been at these retention levels. And I think there's a number of factors. 
I mean, I think our product set is much stronger. And it's not just the products themselves, but it's our commitment to moving our clients onto our newer platform. So we have a lot more clients on newer platforms today than we had a year ago, 2 years ago. Whether a quarter ago or a year ago, it's just a continuing progression that we've talked about now for many, many years, but we've made a lot of progress. And we know that the retention on our new platforms is higher than on some of our older platforms, so that's helping. There's probably some tailwind from -- that's pandemic related, we just can't put our finger on it, that clients are maybe not moving as much. 
But if you look at each business unit, like for example in our downmarket, the retention in our downmarket, as a result of better product and better execution, has been going up for probably 6 or 7 years and is up almost 500 basis points pre-pandemic, and now it's gone up even more. So the fact that we've had this positive momentum in the downmarket. And it's a similar story in Workforce Now. It's not 500 basis points. But in the mid-market, we've also had 3 years of improving retention pre-pandemic. 
So I think those are signs that there's something happening in terms of our execution and our product, right? So execution is part of it as well. We have to deliver, I think, on the commitments we make to our clients to resolve issues for them and answer questions and so forth. So a combination of better service, excellent service, and really better products and migrating clients, I think, is helping. 
And then secondly, the other data point that I would point to, which is really on the booking side, but -- combination of bookings and retention, that our balance of trade is improving with several of our major competitors for the first time in a while. And I think it's, again, related to this effort that we've made to improve product, continue to deliver great service, stay focused on execution. And I think it's showing up now in some of these balance of trade numbers where we're showing some improvement. 
So the reason I bring that up is because balance of trade would be a combination of what we're bringing in, in terms of from some of our competitors, but also what we're losing to those same competitors. That's why we call it balance of trade. So there's a number of metrics that would tell me that our competitive position is getting better and then resulting obviously in higher retention and hopefully also growing bookings here in the future."

On divergence, yes, we would see what you would expect to see because we are -- I think we're big enough that we can't really escape, again, the gravitational pull of overall GDP but also of specific geographic challenges. 
So in Southern California, for example, we did see some challenges in terms of our bookings in the downmarket and into the mid-market there. It's still impressive that we were able to sell as much as we did. As a footnote, we sold a lot. To say that we're flat, almost flat, for us is -- at least we're impressed with ourselves, that our bookings are flat for the first half of the year versus last year. 
But there clearly are pockets of challenge. Southern California would be a challenge. The Midwest was -- and the central part of the country was incredibly challenged for several months. But we've had other places that things were better as a result of maybe more economic activity or continuing opening regardless of the controversy around that. And then, again, Europe would be a place where I would call out where I think we started to encounter some real headwinds. So -- because geography for us is not just about the U.S., it's also global. 
So the answer is yes and that you should assume that we would be impacted by whatever you're seeing in the news. And so when you have hard lockdowns in very large metropolitan markets, that would affect us. But fortunately, we're very diversified geographically and across segments. So remember, we operate all the way from small to upmarket to international. And so we -- obviously, we try to find a way to keep all of these things in balance and have something helping us when other things may be working against us. So we did see some of that volatility, as you described. 
On the price side, so one of the things we did talk about last quarter, we did talk about competitors and what we heard anecdotally about competitor pricing action. But we did -- we also said last quarter that we didn't get any help from price last quarter. We did get a little bit of help. It was not significant, but call it, around -- I think it was around 30 basis points of help, which is about normally what we would be getting, in terms of revenue growth, help from price. 
And so I think what that tells you, this -- what we're trying to signal to you there is to tell you that it was appropriate for us to pause for, call it, 4 to 5 months, our normal price increases. By the way, our normal price increases would have been -- July 1 would have been one of the main times when we do pricing -- price increases. And remember, our price increases are much more modest than they were 5, 10 years ago. But at our scale, it does matter. But we delayed those price increases because it was not appropriate to do that given the circumstances that we were under. 
But you fast forward to September, October, we felt that given the additional services that we were providing. So we're providing a number of incremental services at no additional cost to our clients that I believe our competitors are not providing. And so we thought that going back to our normal, modest price increases was a reasonable thing to do, and we did that. And you can see the impact on retention, which has been none. And so that would be, I think, a good sign for us."

Like we're very focused on market share and new unit growth, but we don't mind additional share of wallet and additional attach rate because that's helpful, too. And as you know, our bookings have generally been balanced for many, many years, about half of it coming from new logos and half of it coming from incremental attach. So we love that business. 
I happened to be looking at those figures last night, and it obviously varies by business unit. But as an example, in the mid-market, we're kind of in the 60% to 70% range in terms of attach rate for things like workforce management, which we used to call time and labor management, and benefits administration. And we have things like DataCloud and other items that we can attach as well. But I think the best color to put on that is that there's still a lot of room. 
I mentioned how we are doing well not just in our new strategic platforms, but we're also doing well on some of our products that we don't always talk about a lot on these calls, like retirement services, insurance services, where those attach rates are very low in comparison to what I think is the potential for our client base. Because when you have a tightly integrated solution, it really is a much better experience for our clients. So it's good for us, but it's also good for our clients, which is always an important thing. So I guess the color I would put there is we've got really good attach rates on some of the core HCM modules like workforce management, ben admin. So HR, payroll, ben admin, workforce management, those are kind of the core. Talent management is a place where we've been seeing growing attach rates, and there's a lot of room still there for people to adopt those solutions. So we're very optimistic. 
And this is a key strategy for, I think, my predecessor, predecessor before that, which has been great for us, that we have a very broad industry. Part of our reason for concentrating on HCM and focusing the company away from some of the other businesses we have, like the brokerage business and dealer services and so forth, is this is a growing, robust space globally and there's plenty of room to grow.

A little bit in the time machine, but if I think back to the Analyst Day in 2018 and some of the company's key initiatives around the service alignment and taking costs out of the business and getting to, call it, mid-20s EBIT margin. I guess, aside from the world being very different with what happened with COVID. But I'm curious, Carlos, if you could just think, as far as those initiatives went and getting the margin structure of the business toward that, would you say that we're -- ex what happened with rates and with COVID, would we be in that shape today? 
And I guess, maybe thinking forward, how should we think about the structural margins of this business post recovery? And can it be at those long-term levels that we talked about before? And then I have one follow-up."

So I did go back and that's something that I actually have fresh on my mind. So -- and Danny will correct me if I'm wrong here. But I think our margin in '18, which you would have seen in that -- in our Analyst Day, was 20.7%. And we're now, I think, forecasting for fiscal year '21 -- I'm not sure that we're forecasting it, but I think you can extrapolate based on our guidance, I'll just throw out a number. So call it 22.3%, 22.5%, somewhere in that range for fiscal year '21. That's with a significant drag from client funds interest, as you mentioned, and some drag from COVID as a result of slower than we would have thought or would have expected revenue growth. 
So I would say that on the margin side, we would be well ahead of what we talked about at Analyst Day, excluding these items. On the revenue side, clearly, we're not anywhere near that. It's why we had to withdraw that 3-year guidance that we had provided because, obviously, the COVID headwinds with what happened with pays per control and just the economy in general made it very difficult. 
But again, it feels like this would -- this is a transitory event, as we've talked about now for 2 or 3 quarters. Painful, devastating for many people, for our country, for the economy and for the world, but it is transitory and not an existential threat. And so we expect to get right back on the track that we were on before. And I happen to think that the fact that we were a couple of hundred basis points higher in margin, even with everything that's happened, than we were in '18, I think, tells you something about the structural margin opportunity in the business. 
But clearly, a very important part of that picture is growth. We need to grow the business long term because growth does require investment. And so what you should be hearing from us is we care about margin, and we think there's opportunity in terms of structural margins here going forward. But the most important thing we can do to drive long-term shareholder value here is to also grow the top line, and we're focused on that."

But I want to add that one of those really important initiatives that we are now working very hard is digital transformation, which has been helping us, right? As we look at our transformation initiatives, we've talked about digital and procurement really driving a lot of the benefits kind of today, if you will. A lot of that procurement does get harder as you go. But from a digital transformation perspective, that's an initiative that we believe is going to be with us for some period of time because these projects are not fast projects to execute. They do take time to execute. And so we're optimistic that we've got a pipeline of projects and that they will continue to yield benefits for us."

And I think that -- I'll pile on to that, that your comment, I think earlier, after you asked the question, and you summarized my comments, the business is definitely performing much better than it looks because we have -- this client funds interest headwind is not just a headwind on margins, it's a headwind on revenue growth as well. It's almost a full percentage point. 
And as an example, on the margin impact, our margin I think in ES would have been up. And ADP overall, our margin would have been up 40 basis points instead of down 30 basis points for the quarter. So clearly, on the margin side, the picture is clouded, and that picture will -- I mean, interest rates go up and down, as we know. And everyone is always convinced that rates are going to stay low forever or they're going to stay high forever, depending on where they are. But we believe that at a minimum, that headwind will abate unless interest rates continue to go down and then turn negative for the next 10 years, which is very unlikely as we all -- I think, as we all know. At least in the U.S., that's unlikely. 
On your question about bookings, one thing that's important to note is we do have record leads from -- through digital marketing coming in. So we have increased our investment in digital marketing, but we're very careful to do that to make sure that we're getting the proper ROI. But that is something that is certainly helping our sales force. But really, the message for our sales force is that we want them to meet our -- the clients and the prospects where they want to be met. And they have all the tools, all modern tools that any sales force uses. 
I mean, the reality is, I've said this before, people steal our sales force. And so we have to understand, we have the best sales force in the industry, there's no question about it. And they have all the tools they need to compete effectively. And they had to obviously move to being mostly a virtual sales force over the last 6 months, and we made sure they have the tools to be able to do that, and that's where clients wanted to be met. 
And if in 6 months, we anticipate that some of our upmarket and multinational clients will be okay having some digital meetings or virtual meetings, but they might want to have people visiting some of them again, we'll be ready for that as well, assuming that it's safe and that people are vaccinated. So there are a number of channels that we can pursue, but you should understand that our kind of -- our strategy is really to meet the clients where they want to be met. 
As an example, in the downmarket, our clients rely on trusted advisers like accountants and brokers. We have very, very strong partner relationships with those channels, and that's how we drive results in that channel. So it really varies channel-by-channel. But you should understand that we are pursuing every channel, every avenue, including upping our digital marketing investments, to make sure that we're getting our fair share of that without throwing money away."

So there has to be balance here in terms of it's not one clear-cut answer. 
But I'm in the camp, for example, in the upmarket, with some of my other competitors and CEOs, who believe that there will be face-to-face meetings again and particularly sales meetings. But I'm also in the camp of believing, with lots of others, that we shouldn't assume that things are going to go back exactly the way they were before, right? Whether it's with the way people are working or the way people are selling, we're going to have to adapt to what inevitably is going to be some change. 
Having said that, I believe I saw a statistic the other day that said that, prior to the pandemic, about 10% of the U.S. workforce was working from home, and it went up to 33% at the worst part of the pandemic and then came back down to 25%. And I kind of monitor this through other sources that show that it ticked up slightly again, the number of people working from home, as this virus continued to surge. But you would expect that 25% to probably go back to 15%, 20%, but not probably back to 10%. But remember that the other 70% never worked from home. And today, 75% of the people are not working from home. 
And so -- but that doesn't mean that we haven't learned new techniques. So for example, an initial meeting or a follow-up meeting or maybe even an implementation meeting with a client, I think we've all learned that it's much more effective to do that for both parties virtually. But it's hard to believe that we're going to go back exactly to where we were before, and it's also very hard to believe that we're going to stay exactly the way we are today. And again, I hate to give you a wishy washy answer because I think we're going to have to let that play out. But we are -- like a lot of other things, we are maintaining optionality and equipping our sales force to be prepared for either of those eventualities.

Again, we are -- I think I mentioned in one of my -- in my script that all of our strategic platforms, so if you think about RUN, Workforce Now, GlobalView, I forgot what the other ones I mentioned. But the platforms that we are -- that are strategic, that we're investing in, not just the Next Gen ones, are all growing and they're growing very robustly, and I don't know that people understand that. 
And part of the challenge is that we have a large company, and we have other things that maybe aren't growing as fast or we have a drag from a platform that we're trying to get off of. And we, unlike some others, try to report the facts as they are, right? 
So -- but maybe we're taking a little bit of liberty like others are doing and giving you a little bit more color about just the things that are going well. So -- but if we did that, like if we'd only focused on the growth of, for example, Next Gen, it would be 800% growth. Or if we focused on the growth of Workforce Now across the board, not just in the mid-market because we also use Workforce Now in the upmarket and we use Workforce Now in our PEO, you would see robust growth, even in the middle of a pandemic, on our Workforce Now. 
So I think we're making progress, but we are a large organization with large market share. And clearly, that exposes our flanks. And we have to be very good at making sure that we protect our flanks, which I think we're doing a good job of, as evidenced by retention. But when you look at the go-forward and the growth of our strategic platforms, there's a lot of reason for optimism that we will, I think, be able to compete effectively on a go-forward basis. 
So I'm not sure I can give you a lot more detail on that because this is more detail than we normally give because we like to just be straight shooters. And the growth is what it is, whether it's on client counts or revenue. But if you want a little bit of additional color underneath the covers, the strategic platforms are doing very well against our competitors."

And the -- kind of what you're seeing in terms of the satisfaction once you have that in place. You made some initial comments that sounded really positive. 
And then the follow-up is just basically on Next Gen HCM, just in terms of what the outlook is there in terms of new sales and new bookings."

If you look at Next Gen Payroll, we have, I think, I would say,",657,"Sure. Thanks for the question. Because if you thought I was optimistic before, prepare yourself, because the story on Next Gen Payroll and HCM is quite positive for us in terms of the future. If you look at Next Gen Payroll, we have, I think, I would say, a couple of hundred. So let's say over 200 live clients. So not just sold, but live clients. We have over 500 that are sold. 
I think we said in our comments, but you may not have picked up on it, that we think that it's possible, even though this is not scientifically approvable, that up to 25% of the sales we've had so far of Next Gen payroll, we would not retain without Next Gen Payroll. So I think that bodes well for, I think, our competitiveness and our market share. And our plans are to have, call it, somewhere around a couple of thousand, I think, for this fiscal year. So it's positive momentum. 
Again, the caveat there is, with Next Gen HCM, we are generally going after very large clients. And in the case of Next Gen Payroll, it is really a platform that solves our kind of Next Gen Payroll needs across the board. And we started in, call it, the core of our mid-market. So call it, between 50 and 150 employees really has been our focus. So -- but having said that, it's still pretty impressive, and we're pretty happy and pretty positive. Satisfaction levels are very high. And I think we've just got great momentum. And the sales force is obviously incredibly excited. 
Even though, remember, this is still a back-end engine, right? So it's still a Workforce Now, and in the future, will be Lifion that are using Pi as an engine. But it does provide some additional benefits to the client and a lot of sizzle as well as we know that matters as well, given how some of our competitors, I think, have used sizzle in their  sales process. And so we're able to use some sizzle now with Next Gen Payroll. So very excited about that rollout and about the progress there. 
On Next Gen HCM, you heard about our rollout in Mexico, which is really Next Gen HCM with Pi. So we have, call it, a handful of clients now in 4 countries that are actually running on Next Gen HCM with Pi. Again, it's very early, like to talk about only a handful of clients isn't a lot. But what was most encouraging is that, in a couple of those situations, we were able to use what we're calling a federated development process, which is -- one of the intentions was that the investment in this platform was to be able to build rapidly. So the Mexico client was onboarded in -- from soup to nuts in terms of building platform, getting the client and getting them onboarded in, call it, 6 to 9 months. So very, very impressive for us to be able to do that. So we're optimistic that this will continue to hopefully help us, again, competitively. 
And I think you also asked about how many clients we've migrated off of Workforce Now on to Pi. And remember that it's really -- and you're not migrating clients off of Workforce Now, you're just changing the underlying payroll engine. They're still on the Workforce Now. The answer to that is, I think, not many. Like this is mostly new logo sales in the case of Next Gen Payroll. Again, underneath Workforce Now. So as we go to market, it's still Workforce Now with the Pi payroll engine beneath it. 
And just to, again, footnote. I think I said this last quarter, Workforce Now is a Next Gen platform. We don't talk about it that way because we haven't been talking about it that way, but Workforce Now with Pi is a Next Gen platform."

That $150 million still holds, that was our estimated benefits for the year, the current fiscal year, from digital and other transformation efforts. 
Where are we in that journey? I'd say we're in the early days, early innings here. I mean, as I mentioned, these projects are not fast-to-implement projects. These are not 2-, 3-, 4-month projects that you roll out. These are how do we procure or build the right tools to take work out of the system? How do we -- while some of it can be a little faster, like continuing to build out chat bot functionality and how many inquiries [ the chat bot is handling ], some of those could go faster. But some of them could be longer projects, like supporting our implementation teams with tools that we're building. 
So my view is we're in the early innings here. We've had some good success thus far. We continue to stay very focused on building pipeline of projects. And it's every single part of the company that we expect and that we go to, to say, ""What are you doing to digitally transform what you do? How do you take work out of the system?""

And it's really -- it varies business-by-business. But as an example, we are, I think, in the early stages. I would say still not ready -- I think I'm not supposed to say anything about it, but we think that in the down market, there is part of the addressable market that we could do better with if we had a more kind of end-to-end digital product, if you will, in terms of -- so this would be a complement to RUN that would compete in a segment of the market that we don't compete in today. 
Likewise, if you go all the way to the upmarket and international, the acquisition of Celergo was intended to kind of bolster, I think, a market that is growing and I think is expanded by our acquisition of Celergo. And in the Next Gen platforms, if you will, are for sure, intended to expand the addressable market. 
So for example, the Next Gen Payroll engine, again, with Workforce Now, would probably be -- have more appeal to an in-house user. Even though people don't think there's a lot of those left, there are still people who use kind of in-house software, if you will. And I think that this Next Gen payroll platform, combined with Workforce Now, provides more control, which is something that, for the last 20 years, when we survey the market, if you will, to assess what's addressable, there was always this kind of outsourcing versus in-house. And I think what's happened is that cloud technology has blurred that line, but there's still a line there. And the ability to have the payroll platform perform some of the things that people want from a control standpoint when they're in-house, I think, expands that addressable market. 
And then lastly, in terms of Next Gen HCM, I mean, clearly, the big play there and the big investment was to expand the addressable market in the upmarket for us, both the larger, more complex clients, but the clients who also had HR needs that we were not necessarily able to satisfy with some of our older platforms. 
So definitely, I think a lot of opportunity and it's a focus -- a key focus of our strategy in terms of how we develop our products, is to expand the addressable market."

Sales cycle time, shortening that cycle time to get something through the sales process, we're working on that in our PEO business. Improving -- via digital work, improving service. So with improved service, therefore improved NPS, therefore improved retention. So it's meant to target both acceleration from a top line perspective, and as we've talked about, taking work out of the system and productivity."

Just a question and a follow-up -- or a clarification. Just on the KPIs here, Carlos, that you're most focused on in the second half, just hearing everything you talked about, positive revisions to retention, bookings. I'm curious if there are any underappreciated KPIs at this point of the cycle that we should be tracking to gauge the sustainability of the improvement that you're talking about as we get through the second half of the year. 
And just a clarification, I think you touched upon it in the last comment here. Just the 25% of sales of Next Gen Payroll that would not have been attained without it. Are you -- are those clients on a cloud platform that are looking for a cloud, like the controls and whatnot that you're talking about, that, that was the condition for considering it? I'm just trying to understand how -- why they didn't consider it before, if that makes sense."

We could probably maybe follow-up to give you a little more color. That's why I tried to use the words not scientific. So our sales force, we're obviously very focused on the rollout of our Next Gen platforms. And so as we try to keep close communication and keep close tabs with our sales force on how it's going, and they came to us and said, ""We think we got 25% more logos as a result of Next Gen Payroll than we would have gotten in the past."" 
I'm guessing there are going to be a number of different reasons for that, including there may be a little bit of a sizzle factor there, right, in terms of -- because we -- as you know, we run fully compliant payrolls. We help our clients with PPP loans. I mean, we were able to do everything. Like our existing platforms are the most robust, most comprehensive, most effective, I believe, of course, I'm biased, in the industry. But there are incremental improvements, right, that give people -- whether it's the control aspect that I mentioned or the sizzle that helps sales. And it's no different than you go buy a car, and there's 5 different models of the same car and people buy the 5 different cars. And -- but you have to have new cars every now and then, and I think it's every 5 years or whatever that cycle is. And I think that's maybe some of what's happening here. 
But we'll try to get you a little bit of additional color if we can, but that wasn't intended to spark a kind of a new level of disclosure, if you will, about what percentage of our 25% came as a result of which feature. But we'll try to provide some color either in the interim or certainly on the next call when we're going to have many more clients on Next Gen Payroll, and we'll have a little bit more data for you. 
On the question you had about KPIs, I would say you hit on all of them, like there's a lot of important ones that you just -- that you touched on that we watch and that we share with you. The other ones that I think are important are ones around productivity, both for sales but also for our service and implementation associates. And in particular on sales, that's part of why I was talking about the kind of the underlying trends improving and us being so optimistic about the future is we are -- there's no reason why our sales force can't get to the same productivity they were pre-pandemic and then continue to increase that productivity as they had been doing for many, many years. 
And so that's one of those KPIs that we watch very carefully, is what's happening to that sales force productivity number quarter-on-quarter, and what's it expected to do in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter. And luckily, it's on track. And it's something that we watch very carefully. Likewise, the productivity per service rep and productivity of implementation. So as an example, how many new clients can an implementation rep onboard? 
And these were all impacted by the digital transformation that Kathleen was talking about because our goal is to make it easier and better for our clients, and as a byproduct, hopefully, reduce our operating expenses. Not reduce our operating expenses and then figure out what happens after that, because the most important driver of long-term value here is client retention. And I can tell you that if we maintain these client retentions, you guys should go do the math on how much faster our revenue will grow on a normal steady-state basis with the same bookings. It's pretty powerful, right? And obviously, that's incremental revenue growth that doesn't have incremental sales expense or implementation expense. 
So the most important thing for us to do is to make good on our commitment to our client. But having said that, those productivity metrics are important, too, in determining kind of our ability to drive margin into the future because those are 2 big buckets of expense, our service and implementation cost. And again, that's another item where the KPI there would really be around, not just NPS and retention, but around productivity. And the good news there is that we've been showing really good productivity improvements while we've also been driving very good retention, which speaks to the success of our digital transformation efforts."

This morning, we reported another strong set of quarterly results that were ahead of our expectations, with revenue growth of 1% and adjusted EBIT margin down 90 basis points, combining for a modest adjusted diluted EPS decline of 2%. This, of course, was the final quarter before we begin to lap the impact of the pandemic and I'm very proud of our organization's ability to have delivered positive revenue and earnings growth for the first 9 months of the fiscal year despite unprecedented challenges in the economy and the labor markets. 
I'll start with a review of some of our key performance drivers and an update on the operating environment we've been experiencing. This quarter, our Employer Services new business bookings reaccelerated, and we delivered 7% growth, a strong result for the team. The improved year-over-year growth compared to the second quarter was driven by every business unit. Importantly, we ended the quarter on a particularly strong note, with record March sales performance that was well above pre-pandemic fiscal 2019 levels, which we see as a positive signal for client engagement in the quarters ahead. 
The selling environment will likely continue to evolve month-to-month and with differences on a regional basis, as COVID cases and the reopening trajectories stabilize. We are optimistic that with vaccine deployment progressing steadily, our clients are in the best position since the pandemic started to begin making buying decisions again. Also encouraging is that we started to hold more in-person sales meetings with over 1/3 of our field sales force having conducted at least 1 in-person meeting this quarter. We expect in-person engagement to pick up over the coming quarters as well. 
With our Q3 performance and the trajectory we see in Q4, we're pleased to narrow our bookings range around a higher midpoint. We now expect growth of 20% to 25% for the year versus 15% to 25% prior. Achieving this growth rate would put us at first full year sales productivity close to 90% of pre-pandemic levels, which would be an incredible achievement for our sales associates. 
Our retention, which has been a key driver for our strong results this year, was a positive development once again and performed slightly ahead of even our revised and elevated expectations. Retention remains at record levels. Many of you have been asking about how sustainable this improved retention performance is for ADP. It's a great question and hard to answer with precision given the unpredictable environment we're all in. But our belief is that during the pandemic, there have been some temporary benefits from client hesitancy to make major decisions, plus lower out-of-business losses given government support in North America and Europe. 
But we also believe there will be enduring benefit resulting from the record client satisfaction we've seen as our product and service both have continued to improve. Next quarter, we expect to be in a better position to talk about retention expectations for fiscal 2022. But clearly, we feel very good about what we've achieved this year. On the back of our record Q3 performance, We're pleased to raise our guidance and now expect full year retention to be up at least 125 basis points from 2020 versus our prior guidance of up 100 basis points. As a reminder, this guidance would put us in record territory for the year. 
Moving to the overall employment picture. Our pace for control metric performance was softer than expected as it improved only modestly from Q2 and rounded again to a decline of 6% for Q3. But that said, we are encouraged by the recent trends in employment data, particularly in the U.S., as more of the economy reopens. As of April, we've now started to lap the pandemic affected case per control figures and have been pleased with the positive year-over-year growth we've seen so far in Q4. So we're making no change to our full year pays per control outlook of down 3% to 4%. 
I'd like to now provide an update on some of our key products and strategic initiatives. In February, we announced the launch of Roll, a new payroll and tax filing product for small businesses. Roll combines the simplicity of an AI-driven chat-based interface with the power and scale of our payroll and tax filing expertise, sold digitally and delivered through an app-only interface. With this offering, we believe we can expand our reach into the U.S. small business market beyond the businesses we've historically targeted with RUN, as the target clients for Roll users is with simpler needs who prioritize a mobile-first fully chat-based interface. 
This is a different set of users compared with the target clients for a more comprehensive RUN solution. We look forward to sharing Roll's progress with you in the quarters ahead. Parallel to this, we're also making great progress in increasing the amount of digital onboarding we're conducting with RUN. And we've continued to scale up this capability since we discussed it with you during our Innovation Day in early 2020. This quarter alone, 15,000 or over 1/3 of our new RUN clients onboarded themselves digitally, enabling a better experience for the clients as well as cost savings for ADP. 
This initiative is just one of many digitally enabled efforts we are making to drive improved efficiency at ADP. And as we've mentioned in the past, we have more to look forward to as our digital transformation continues. 
Our Next Gen Payroll engine also continues to scale up and demonstrate success in the mid-market. In this quarter, we sold hundreds more clients and continued to expand our capability set to accommodate more complex payroll needs. We now have over 400 clients live on Workforce Now with our Next Gen Payroll engine, and we expect to accelerate this further in the coming quarters. 
In addition to its improving position in the mid-market, Workforce Now continues to scale nicely into the enterprise market. In this quarter, ADP was recognized as a customer's choice leader in Gartner's Voice of the Customer for cloud HCM suites from North American companies with 1,000 or more employees. This is a great milestone for the team and strong validation of the flexibility of Workforce Now, as we've continued to sell it to larger clients in recent years, while, of course, concurrently scaling implementation and service of our Next Gen HCM platform. 
Ultimately, these product enhancements are all designed to drive growth. And I'm happy to report that this quarter, our client count reached 900,000, a remarkable achievement, particularly during the pandemic. This is a testament to both the strong retention we've experienced this year as well as better than expected year-to-date sales performance. We're very proud of our execution so far this year, and we look forward to putting the impact of the pandemic behind us. 
On that front, we recognize there's a lot of interest in our potential growth and earnings profile for next year. As you can appreciate, it's still early to discuss fiscal 2022 with any precision, given the dynamic environment and the fact that we're still going through our operating plan process for next year. But Kathleen will share some additional perspective on fiscal 2022 in a moment. 
I'd also like to share that we plan to host a virtual Investor Day later this calendar year, where we plan to update you on our strategy and discuss our post-pandemic aspirations. We are tentatively aiming for November, and we'll share a date shortly. For now, we remain focused on maintaining our very positive momentum as we close out this fiscal year. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Kathleen for more detail on the quarter and the outlook."

Q3 represented another strong quarter for us, with our performance on both revenues and margins driven by excellent execution across the organization. Our revenues grew 1% on both a reported and organic constant currency basis. which represented a slight acceleration versus Q2. We delivered this growth despite incremental drag from client funds interest versus Q2, and as well as some incremental pressure related to our usual seasonal Q3 revenue drivers, such as annual W-2 forms. I'll share more on these in a moment. 
As anticipated, we also experienced a margin decline as we continue to make additional growth and productivity investments and as we experienced a more significant client funds interest revenue decline compared to prior quarters. But the 90 basis points of margin decline was better than our expectations. Combining this revenue and margin performance, our adjusted EBIT was down 2% to $1.1 billion. Our adjusted effective tax rate increased slightly compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2020, as we had less contribution from excess tax benefit on stock comp, but our share count was lower year-over-year, driven by share repurchases. And as a result, our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.89 was down a modest 2% versus last year. 
For our Employer Services segment, revenues declined 1% on a reported basis and 2% on an organic constant currency basis, demonstrating steady growth rates compared to last quarter despite additional pressure from 2 sources, as I just mentioned, both of which were fully anticipated. First with greater pressure from client funds interest. Our Q3 has a seasonally larger client fund balance than other quarters of the year. And as a result, it skews more to cash and cash equivalent investments where interest rates have been pushed down to near 0. As a result, our client funds interest declined 32% versus last year, with average yield down 70 basis points, more than offsetting our strong balance growth, which improved to 6%. 
Second, with a headwind related to seasonal Q3 revenues, like the annual Form W-2, which effectively makes our Q3 slightly more sensitive to pays per control and employment turnover trends than other quarters. Looking past these 2 headwinds, underlying ES performance showed sequential improvement, driven in part by continued record level retention that was partially offset by slightly lower-than-expected pays per control. 
Employer Services Q3 margin was down 120 basis points compared to last year, ahead of our expectations. We continue to invest in headcount to support our growing client base. We also started lapping lower incentive costs from last year, and we experienced greater pressure from the lower client funds interest revenue compared to the first half of this year. But at the same time, we kept our focus on prudent cost control and continue to execute on our transformation initiatives. 
Our PEO also had another very strong quarter. Average worksite employees increased sequentially to 594,000 . This was flat on a year-over-year basis, and this strong result was supported by retention outperformance and a slight sequential improvement in pays per control, which was more impactful than what we experienced in our ES segment. Although PEO sales growth still lags that of our ES segment, we did see an improvement in sales performance in Q3 and are encouraged that unit sales growth for the PEO was positive. 
Our PEO revenue growth, meanwhile, was very strong at 7% and revenues, excluding zero-margin benefits pass-throughs, grew 10%, both ahead of our expectations. Once again, this strong performance benefited from higher payroll per WSE supported by employee mix. Additionally, this quarter, our revenue per WSE was further supported by a more favorable SUI rate environment as some states have started to increase SUI rates. Workers' Comp rates remained a headwind in the quarter. 
PEO margin increased 100 basis points in the quarter, driven by revenue growth and continued expense discipline, as well as roughly 50 basis points of contribution from Workers' Compensation reserve true-ups. 
I'll turn now to our updated guidance for fiscal 2021. With only 1 quarter remaining, we're pleased to raise our guidance midpoints for several key metrics and narrow our guidance ranges for others. Beginning with the ES segment, we now expect revenue to be up about 1% for the full year versus our previous expectation for flat to up 2%. There's no real change in our revenue expectations, and this revised outlook includes the impact from the following drivers. 
We now expect our ES new business bookings to be up 20% to 25% compared to our prior forecast of up 15% to 25%. This reflects Q3 sales performance that came in slightly ahead of our expectations and our better line of sight into Q4. We're very happy to raise our bookings guidance again. And although this doesn't materially change our revenue expectations for this fiscal year, it does add to our optimism about next year. We now expect our ES retention to be up at least 125 basis points versus up 100 basis points prior. Similar to our updated bookings guidance, this improvement is driven by our Q3 performance and encouraging visibility into Q4 retention. 
We are raising our client funds interest expectations slightly and now expect $415 million for the full year. We have seen the interest rate environment improve compared to what we had contemplated last quarter. However, those improvements only apply to our new fixed income purchases over the last few months of the year. There is no material change to our expectation for 1.6% average yield in our client funds portfolio for fiscal year 2021. 
We are encouraged by the signs of improvement in the U.S. labor markets. But as we mentioned, over this last quarter, pays per control did underperform our Q3 expectations modestly. We have tempered our Q4 expectations slightly as a result, but our full year fiscal 2021 outlook remains a decline of 3% to 4%. 
For our expected Employer Services margin for the year, we are narrowing to a decline of 50 to 75 basis points. While we experienced stronger-than-expected margin performance in Q3, we will reinvest some of this on discrete projects in Q4 to further accelerate our growth, investing, for example, in our Next Gen rollout, Wisely Card program, and additional marketing and advertising. 
For our PEO segment, we now expect revenue up 5% to 6% versus our prior forecast of up 3% to 5%, and we expect average worksite employees to be up 1% to 2% versus our prior forecast of flat to up 2%. We also expect our revenues, excluding 0 margin pass-throughs, to be up 5% to 6% compared to our prior forecast of up 3% to 5%. Our top line raise for the PEO is driven primarily by the strong Q3 performance we experienced and slightly higher payroll per WSE assumptions for Q4. 
Last, for PEO margin, we now expect to be up about 75 basis points in fiscal 2021 versus our prior forecast range for up 50 to 100 basis points. Our visibility into Q4 has improved and year-to-date, we've seen stronger revenue performance and better than expected contribution from Workers' Compensation true-ups, offset by greater pass-through revenue. 
For our consolidated outlook, we now anticipate total ADP revenue to be up 2% to 3% in fiscal 2021 versus up 1% to 3% prior. And we anticipate our adjusted EBIT margin to be down 50 to 75 basis points, an improvement of our prior guidance of down 50 to 100 basis points. There is no change to our expected effective tax rate of 23% for the year, and we continue to assume a net share count reduction in our guidance. 
Net of all these changes, we are updating our adjusted diluted EPS guidance to be flat to up 1% versus our prior guidance of down 2% to up 2%. We As you know, with Q4, we will begin to lap the impact of the pandemic, and we recognize there is a lot of interest in what our growth rate will look like as conditions continue to normalize. With that said, we're still going through our planning process. As usual, we will provide fiscal '22 guidance when we report our fourth quarter results, but I'd like to share some preliminary considerations. 
The most important factor for us in accelerating growth is driving strong new business bookings, and we expect our sales productivity to improve further next year as in-person visits increase and clients and prospects continue to reengage more fully. As that productivity continues to progress toward pre-pandemic levels and beyond, the contribution it makes to our revenue growth will likewise continue to build. Pays per control should provide a tailwind and the magnitude of contribution will depend on the pace of global employment recovery. We've provided sensitivities to pays per control in the past and will share a pace per control assumption next quarter. 
Client funds interest will likely remain a headwind if the current rate environment holds. Then it should be much less of a headwind than we are experiencing in fiscal 2021. And on retention, improving economic activity could mean greater client switching levels compared to this year, but we're not seeing pressure yet and will remain focused on holding on to the gains we've achieved. We'll share our assumption about it next quarter. 
Clearly, there are a number of moving pieces, but the net effect should be favorable. The 2% to 3% revenue growth we expect to deliver this year demonstrates the resilience of our business model, and we look forward to building from this higher revenue base and accelerating our growth back to pre-pandemic levels as quickly as we can. We are going into next year from a position of strength, and our aim is to deliver an improved market position, stronger top line growth and margin expansion, while maintaining the steady cash flows that have allowed us to increase our shareholder distributions consistently for more than 7 decades. More on all this will come next quarter, and we look forward to updating you then. I'll now turn it back over to the operator for Q&A."

And when you combine those factors in addition to kind of new products and other things, that's what kind of drove our new business bookings growth, the combination of increases in headcount and increases in productivity. So you're right, that's the path, this will help us get quickly back to our previous productivity and hopefully allow us to get above that, which is, I think, important for us in terms of our long-term growth expectations."

And I think Kathleen, in particular, mentioned the 2 or 3 things that we're investing in. So the answer is no, there's no kind of mysterious margin pressure. In other words, the business continues to move in the right trajectory, like almost every metric we have has improved. In fact, I say every metric we have has improved sequentially, even the pays per control. Even though it was modest, it's still rounded to 6% down. 
We know now, after watching the data at the beginning of Q4, that that's heading in the right direction. And we can all tell from what's happening in unemployment, that that's going to also continue to improve fairly quickly here. So when you really kind of add it all together, like we're in a very strong position to have very strong momentum And people who've known us for a long time know that when we experience that, we try to reinvest some of that.

It's really across the board really in every business unit, in every channel, in every category, our bookings have been improving, again, sequentially every quarter. And they continue to do that this quarter. 
So we believe that medium to long term, that's the key to us sustaining kind of our multi-decade growth rates is these Next Gen platforms. But I just continue to caution everyone to -- because we want to give you the updates if we want to continue to focus on Next Gen. And I like -- I appreciate the question because it's important to kind of separate what's driving the quarters and what's driving the next fiscal year versus what's driving the next 3 to 5 years. And I would say that Next Gen Payroll is going to be increasingly important in the next year or two from a bookings standpoint and will start to probably make a difference, and we'll then give you that color in terms of what difference it's making. 
But we should be cautious about revenue impact just because of the recurring revenue model. It just takes a while for that to get into the revenue growth numbers. But it was positive, but really not what really moved the needle."

So as you know, our business model is really more about providing not just the software the support, right? You call it support, you can call service, you can call it compliance. And I think what we saw this year with all of the activity that the government had around -- the various hat around the various stimulus programs to help companies and individuals and so on. That created a lot of complexity for employers. 
It appears that we're entering into an environment where, despite the pandemic hopefully fading, there will be increased levels of government activity around employment and incentives and that kind of thing. I think that's a good environment for ADP and for our downmarket business, because most small businesses don't have the time or the inclination to really focus on these things and to take care of these things. So it works for some clients, and we believe that. That's why we're rolling out Roll, no pun intended. But once you get to even a little bit slightly larger, you do end up running into issues that you need help with, and you need support and need advice and much of that can be automated, but you still need it. 
So for example, a lot of our PPP support reports were automated. So it doesn't mean that somebody have to get on the phone and have a discussion about your PPP report. But you have to be focused on providing the support and the compliance in addition to just the software. So I think that helped us this year. And again, so to answer your question, how do we believe we're set up competitively right now. I think we're set up excellently, competitively, because we now have very simple solutions for the micro market where people want to self-buy, self-install and don't have complexity and maybe don't have issues with taxes or compliance or don't want to ask questions because it's not priced or built to ask questions. But we also have the ability to provide this assistance that is important for even small clients. 
For sure, it's important for mid sized clients and for larger clients. But I think what really got highlighted this year is that small clients need a lot of help and need a lot of assistance. And you can see in our growth rates, in our retention, in our client satisfaction, like all of our metrics in our small business division, that we happen to be in the right place at the right time, I think, to be able to help our clients and then hopefully now benefit from the tailwind of the demand that that's going to create on a go-forward basis. So anyway, long-winded way of saying, I think we're in a great position because of our business model."

Our results have actually been quite good internationally, both in terms of bookings as well as just the performance of the business overall, in terms of revenue, pay per control, et cetera. Some of that is that a large portion of our business is in Europe, and there were a lot of government programs there as well to help companies and to prevent high levels of unemployment. 
And so for example, our pays per control metric never got to the negative levels that we saw in the U.S. and Europe. So that was a benefit. At the same time, our bookings have been quite strong. And I have to admit that I've been looking for kind of the explanation for that other than really good execution on the part of our sales force as they moved into a virtual environment because they had to sell virtually there as well. But I would say it's strong differentiation of our products. Again, the service aspect to our solutions, the ability to provide support, and to provide compliance and help, all of those things probably helped our bookings performance internationally as well. 
So I would say that our global business actually is probably one of the bright spots, I would say, despite what is obviously a very difficult environment. And we obviously feel for our businesses in not just Europe, which now happens to be improving again, particularly in the U.K. But we're having challenges now in Toronto. We're having in Canada, in Brazil. We're having challenges, obviously, as you know, in India as well. But it has not translated into negative results. So I think it's a testament to the resiliency and the strength of the business model, but I don't want to take anything away from the fact that it also obviously shows great execution by our international leaders as well."

So there isn't a huge difference between, yes, patient control performance and PEO. They both have been improving every quarter sequentially. And remember, the PEO doesn't -- we generally stay away from very, very small clients. So we don't have a lot of clients that are 1 to 2 employees or 5 employees. The average size client in the PEO, I think, is somewhere around 40. And so by definition, it tends to skew a little bit bigger than maybe our average client size for sure for small business. 
So actually, I was looking at these figures last night, it makes perfect sense kind of where we are, which is that the PEO is performing a little bit better in terms of absolute level of pays per control and has been improving sequentially just as ES has as well. So -- and again, I'm probably not allowed to say this because I'm going to get in trouble, but last night, I got a note from the PEO that we experienced the first positive pays per control week. Now the problem with pays per control is that it does vary based on payroll cycles. So if you have weekly payrolls or biweekly payroll, so you and I can't read anything into that. But it's the first time we've had a positive pays per control in any week over the last 12 months. So that's a very positive sign."

We would love to, at some point in the future, extend that into the mid-market and maybe someday into the upmarket. But as you know, like you know better than us because you talked a lot of other competitors, there's not a lot of digital onboarding going on, for example, with large complex ERP installations, not to pick on any competitors, but it's pretty -- I know the image is that this stuff all kind of gets installed itself, but most of -- many of our competitors use third parties. 
So there's still quite a lot of implementation activity and expense, whether it's done by the seller of the solutions or it's done by a third party, we happen to have a model where we do a lot of it ourselves. And so as bookings pick up, and demand picks up, we need to add to our capacity for implementation, in particular, in the mid-market, the upmarket and also global, which as I mentioned, has been strong. So that doesn't mean that we're not adding in the downmarket also. But in our small business segment, as we alluded to and as I think you pointed out, the digital onboarding capabilities obviously reduce the need to grow headcount as much as we otherwise would have. 
But even in small business, we have a lot of growth in bookings. And so it's a matter of the trade-off of how much can we onboard digitally versus how much we still need some help with in terms of people being involved in. In terms of some of the other items that we alluded to, I mean, some of this is just kind of natural to the business model. As we bring on more clients, we obviously expect productivity improvements every year, whether it's in sales or implementation or everywhere. But we are seeing a recovery of our business and very strong GDP forecast. And so we're anticipating improved prospects for bookings and for revenue and for growth. And we need to make sure that we have the right staffing levels based on the productivity metrics that -- and the productivity goals that we have to be able to handle that business so we can maintain our high clients of -- level of client satisfaction that we've experienced. 
And then we have some natural growth in expenses like, I think Kathleen alluded to, sales expense is clearly something that grows as you have sales success and as grows -- as sales grow year-over-year. So I wouldn't read too much into it other than that we made some conscious decisions to reinvest in some specific things in the fourth quarter to really position us well for '22 and beyond. But most of this is just kind of natural stuff where, again, as our revenue growth picks up over time, we still have a great incremental margin business where we would expect to have good operating leverage as we grow those revenues."

And I think it's something that we've been excited about. But again, it was hard to get excited about. There was a lot of natural tailwind because people wanted more digitally-oriented payment methods in the last 3 quarters.

And this may not have made it all the way to the top of the list, but it was on the top of the list kind of pre-pandemic, if you recall. 
And so I think I would see this as more of a reemergence of some of the themes and some of the things that we had been talking about that excite us, because I think the Wisely opportunity is a big one. So I'm glad that the team brought this forward in terms of as an investment opportunity because we were excited about it. Call it, 12 to 18 months ago, we should be just as excited about it today.

Obviously, when you look at mathematically the overall growth rate and the overall number, it's driven in large part by our small business division, because that's where we have the bulk of the absolute number of clients. But I wanted to give you a little bit of color around -- If you look at -- if you look at Workforce now across our multiple channels, just remember, we sell workforce now in the -- not just in the mid-market, but we sell it in the upmarket, and we sell it in the PEO, the PEO platform as well.

But in this business, like people who have been following us for a long time, like when we have a 10 to 20 basis point move in retention, it's a big deal. So to have this kind of retention on top of the retention that we had last year is pretty remarkable. And so we're pretty excited about it. And I think the key for us is trying to determine -- like when I look at the retention figures, there's a lot of improvement in what's called the controllable losses. So the ones that are related to kind of service issues and so forth. So we're excited that we might be able to hold on to some of this gain, but at the same time, we're realistic enough to acknowledge that some of the stuff that was related to kind of out of business and government stimulus, there might be a little bit of give back there. 
But it's been pretty consistent, like every -- it seems like every quarter, The improvement has been in that same neighborhood year-over-year, hence, why we kind of tweaked the full year because we're probably going to end up in the range that we gave you, which is a little higher than what we had before.

And as you said, it's hard for me to tell about retention in terms of the rest of the industry, you guys would be the experts on that because as my casual review of some 10-Ks makes it kind of hard to compare. Like some people would say retention of their annual recurring revenue, cloud revenues, which is not the same as the retention for their company. So it's kind of hard for me to say. I mean, some of it, I would say is probably more variable than you think based on what I'm seeing in terms of the variability of growth rates, because it's clearly been a huge part of our ability to outperform. 
I mean this is a pretty remarkable revenue performance given what we've been through and given the pays per control headcount. And by the way, nobody has brought it up yet, but we have a huge headwind on client funds interest, which is going to abate here in the fourth quarter and is going to abate next year as well. There may still be a little bit of headwind, but this was really the worst quarter that we had. In these 9 months were that -- it was $130 million drag just from client funds interest. 
So when you put everything into the pot, without really good strong retention, it's hard to outperform the way we have. And we've done some work on the relative performances of us versus some of our competitors. And we feel pretty good about that and about our the potential for retention to be one of the needle movers there. There might be some other factors that I'm not -- that we're not -- we haven't thought about. But no, I don't think there's anything else really big out there, like we've done a little bit better against some of our -- the usual competitors that you know about in terms of balance of trade. But there's others that are still challenging for us. And so net-net, we're pretty comfortable with where we are and determined to continue to drive our growth. 
I think all of us are probably benefiting from kind of overall economic growth and the fact that it seems like maybe there are some either in-house or regional providers that are -- because you can see our -- we're growing our units in Workforce Now and in RUN. And so we're -- it seems like we're all -- have some ability to grow in this environment, which is, I guess, good for everyone."

We obviously are trying to figure that out because it's very important to the long-term value creation of the company. And it's all the things you mentioned because you obviously know the business well enough that you hit on all. And the question is how much is each of those, right? Like the last one that you mentioned about the goodwill, no question that us being there, like there were 2 or 3 months where people could not talk to anyone other than us about what to do, right? What to do about the PPP loans that the government was offering, around tax credits, because if you buy software from someone, you can't call them to ask them those questions. I just want to remind everyone, right? 
You can call them to ask them about the software and you can send in a ticket to get your software issue resolved, but you can't call to ask about tax deferrals or tax credits or PPP reports or any of that kind of stuff. So we clearly built a lot of goodwill. But on the other hand, business is business and goodwill doesn't last forever. So we're not planning on living off of that for the next 5 or 10 years. So that brings me back to kind of the basics of client satisfaction, which is we have to be there for our clients when they need us, not just during the pandemic, but at all times. 
So I would say that the second major factor besides the goodwill that I mentioned and some of the digital initiatives to like make things easier for our clients and improve our user experience is that we did not panic at the onset of the pandemic. And if you recall, we took some lumps for that because we really maintained our investments, both -- not just in R&D, but we maintained our investments in headcount and implementation. That doesn't mean that we didn't have some drift down as a result of some turnover, which we did, and our headcount did decline because we had temporarily a drop in volume, if you will. But that was really, really important, right, to be able to kind of get through this period and be able to deliver on our commitments to our clients. 
And back to the comments I made about productivity before, that's one of those things that we watch very carefully because we want to improve productivity, but we won't -- we can't be naive and think that if our -- obviously, if our headcount was 10% lower, we'd have higher net income. The problem is what would your client satisfaction be and your retention. And so that's the magic, right, of being able to figure out what's that right balance. And you have tools to figure that out. You have monitoring systems, right, to understand what the client satisfaction levels are in relation to how quickly you're getting back to people to resolve their problems, for example, and how well trained your people are. 
So there's a number of different factors that we look at. But the key is to be committed to delivering high levels of client service, which we are. And I think we just proved it. If we can do it during a pandemic, we can do it anytime."

But you should probably -- if I were you, I would look at maybe call it the second quarter or maybe 2019 fourth quarter or something -- there's got to be something else that would give you something as good as a proxy, right? 
We don't expect to be back to 100% productivity levels in the fourth quarter, but we should be getting close to like where we were in 2019, and there might be other small moving parts there from 2019.

I mean some of this, obviously, is cyclical, right, in the sense that 12 to 18 months ago, people were looking for other tools other than client acquisition tools. So you have to be careful about not kind of shifting with the wind necessarily. You have to be consistently able to help people throughout the whole life cycle of HCM. And right now, that happens to be an important one. And so I would say that there's 2 things. One is we build our own tools, as you said, around recruitment management and we also have an RPO business and we have other tools to help with the talent acquisition process. 
We also partner and we have some really strong partnerships. I'm not sure I should -- I don't know if I mentioned the names of the companies or not, but the names that you hear a lot of kind of advertising about, we have very strong integration and partnerships with some of those companies to really make it easy, in particular, in small business, but also even in the mid-market for people to use those tools to really help with the recruiting needs that they have. But we feel we've been making -- we have made significant investments in our recruitment management platform and our talent acquisition platforms, nothing to do with the pandemic. So that, you could call it fortuitous, that we had done that before the pandemic. And we would expect that those would be contributors to our overall value proposition, into our revenue -- sorry, into our bookings growth, because those are generally tools that create incrementality around your bookings number. 
In other words, what you can charge clients is typically there's a core set of solutions. And then recruitment management, things like time and attendance or workforce management, those tend to be more incremental around the basic package, if you will, of HCM. So we're positive. We're bullish on it. And I think we're very -- just as a reminder, our app marketplace is -- creates a very easy and seamless way for people to use different solutions in HCM, and this would be a category that we would have a lot of partners in that app marketplace that allow you to get all the other benefits you mentioned about ADP's business model and still be able to fulfill your talent acquisition needs if you don't believe that ADP has what you need, which we believe you do. But if you don't, you can always get it through one of our partners."

And I would anticipate that not changing, and we're not changing our laddering strategy and we're not changing our client funds interest strategy. 
The good news is that it appears the worst is behind us in terms of drag from client funds interest, which was painful. I think we had a $50 million drag just this quarter. So again, not to beat a dead horse, but it just shows the strength of the business that we didn't mention that to you, and we kind of overcame that drag and $130 million for the year. So we're looking forward to better times ahead. And I did see an interesting chart. Again, I probably shouldn't say this, but we had $16 billion in balances in 2008, and we had $635 million in client funds interest -- I'm sorry, $685 million, not $35 million in client funds interest. So it just shows to you the magnitude. I mean you all know what's happened to interest rates. 
But that was 2008. That wasn't like a different century or in a different country, like that was here. And so today, our balances are call it the mid-$20 billion number for the year. I think that's the expectation. So I think you could probably do the math yourself in terms of if we do believe that there's going to be some inflation here. And if you look at the inflation breakevens and you look at some other things that are going on, we're looking forward to better times ahead for client funds interest."

And we're really, really thankful for the performance of our sales organization and also our frontline associates in terms of what they've been able to do for our clients. And at the risk of ending on a negative note, though, all of this positive and all of this positivity and enthusiasm, we don't want to overlook the fact that we still have some challenges and some people still have some challenges in other parts of the world. This is a U.S. headquartered company with over 80% of our revenues in the U.S. So that's probably why you're hearing all of this optimism. 
But we're not only in the U.S. We have associates in India, in Brazil, in Canada and in Europe, and the situation is not the same there. Even though the businesses are performing well, we -- just as back in the spring of last year, it was enormous suffering and challenges here in the U.S. among our associates. The same thing is happening for some of our associates and some other parts of the world, in particular, in India. And we are not going to forget them. We're doing everything we can to help them. We appreciate what the U.S. government is doing, along with the Indian government and local governments to help as well. 
And we look forward to helping them kind of get through the same difficult situation that we managed to get through. And they, too, will have their vaccination rates pick up in all of those parts of the world. And they, too, will emerge from the pandemic. But it's clear that it's going to take a little bit longer. And we should all remember to be there to help them and to support them in any way we can. And ADP will do exactly that. 
But having said that, we are close to seeing the situation in the rearview mirror here, and we're really anxious to see our growth rates reaccelerate to kind of where we were pre-pandemic here at some point in the future and getting back to the business and to helping our clients with their challenges and helping our associates build careers and helping all of you and our other shareholders and stakeholders get a fair return for their investment. 
So we -- I guess, as always, we appreciate your interest in ADP, and we appreciate you tuning in, and we will be back in a quarter with our outlook for fiscal year '22. Thank you."

This morning, we reported another strong set of quarterly results that were ahead of our expectations, with revenue growth of 1% and adjusted EBIT margin down 90 basis points, combining for a modest adjusted diluted EPS decline of 2%.
This, of course, was the final quarter before we begin to lap the impact of the pandemic. And I'm very proud of our organization's ability to have delivered positive revenue and earnings growth for the first 9 months of the fiscal year despite unprecedented challenges in the economy and the labor markets.
I'll start with a review of some of our key performance drivers and an update on the operating environment we've been experiencing. This quarter, our Employer Services New Business Bookings reaccelerated, and we delivered 7% growth, a strong result for the team. The improved year-over-year growth compared to the second quarter was driven by every business unit. Importantly, we ended the quarter on a particularly strong note, with record March sales performance that was well above pre-pandemic fiscal 2019 levels, which we see as a positive signal for client engagement in the quarters ahead.
The selling environment will likely continue to evolve month-to-month and with differences on a regional basis, as COVID cases and the reopening trajectories stabilize. We are optimistic that with vaccine deployment progressing steadily, our clients are in the best position since the pandemic started to begin making buying decisions again. Also encouraging is that we started to hold more in-person sales meetings, with over 1/3 of our field sales force having conducted at least 1 in-person meeting this quarter. We expect in-person engagement to pick up over the coming quarters as well.
With our Q3 performance and the trajectory we see in Q4, we're pleased to narrow our bookings range around a higher midpoint. We now expect growth of 20% to 25% for the year versus 15% to 25% prior. Achieving this growth rate would put us at first full year sales productivity close to 90% of pre-pandemic levels, which would be an incredible achievement for our sales associates. 
Our retention, which has been a key driver for our strong results this year, was a positive development once again and performed slightly ahead of even our revised and elevated expectations. Retention remains at record levels.
Many of you have been asking about how sustainable this improved retention performance is for ADP. It's a great question and hard to answer with precision given the unpredictable environment we're all in. But our belief is that during the pandemic, there have been some temporary benefits from client hesitancy to make major decisions, plus lower out-of-business losses given government support in North America and Europe. But we also believe there will be enduring benefit resulting from the record client satisfaction we've seen as our product and service both have continued to improve. 
Next quarter, we expect to be in a better position to talk about retention expectations for fiscal 2022. But clearly, we feel very good about what we've achieved this year. On the back of our record Q3 performance, we're pleased to raise our guidance and now expect full year retention to be up at least 125 basis points from 2020 versus our prior guidance of up 100 basis points. As a reminder, this guidance would put us in record territory for the year.
Moving to the overall employment picture. Our pays per control metric performance was softer than expected as it improved only modestly from Q2 and rounded again to a decline of 6% for Q3. But that said, we are encouraged by the recent trends in employment data, particularly in the U.S., as more of the economy reopens. As of April, we've now started to lap the pandemic-affected pays per control figures and have been pleased with the positive year-over-year growth we've seen so far in Q4. So we're making no change to our full year pays per control outlook of down 3% to 4%.
I'd like to now provide an update on some of our key product and strategic initiatives. In February, we announced the launch of Roll, a new payroll and tax filing product for small businesses. Roll combines the simplicity of an AI-driven, chat-based interface with the power and scale of our payroll and tax filing expertise, sold digitally and delivered through an app-only interface.
With this offering, we believe we can expand our reach into the U.S. small business market beyond the businesses we've historically targeted with RUN, as the target clients for Roll users is with simpler needs who prioritize a mobile-first, fully chat-based interface. This is a different set of users compared with the target clients for a more comprehensive RUN solution. We look forward to sharing Roll's progress with you in the quarters ahead.
Parallel to this, we're also making great progress in increasing the amount of digital onboarding we're conducting with RUN. And we've continued to scale up this capability since we discussed it with you during our Innovation Day in early 2020. This quarter alone, 15,000 or over 1/3 of our new RUN clients onboarded themselves digitally, enabling a better experience for the clients as well as cost savings for ADP.
This initiative is just one of many digitally enabled efforts we are making to drive improved efficiency at ADP. And as we've mentioned in the past, we have more to look forward to as our digital transformation continues.
Our Next Gen Payroll engine also continues to scale up and demonstrate success in the mid-market. In this quarter, we sold hundreds more clients and continued to expand our capability set to accommodate more complex payroll needs. We now have over 400 clients live on Workforce Now with our Next Gen Payroll engine, and we expect to accelerate this further in the coming quarters.
In addition to its improving position in the mid-market, Workforce Now continues to scale nicely into the enterprise market. In this quarter, ADP was recognized as a customer's choice leader in Gartner's Voice of the Customer for cloud HCM suites from North American companies with 1000-or-more employees. This is a great milestone for the team and strong validation of the flexibility of Workforce Now, as we've continued to sell it to larger clients in recent years while, of course, concurrently scaling implementation and service of our Next Gen HCM platform.
Ultimately, these product enhancements are all designed to drive growth. And I'm happy to report that this quarter, our client count reached 900,000, a remarkable achievement, particularly during the pandemic. This is a testament to both the strong retention we've experienced this year as well as better-than-expected year-to-date sales performance.
We're very proud of our execution so far this year. And we look forward to putting the impact of the pandemic behind us. On that front, we recognize there's a lot of interest in our potential growth and earnings profile for next year. As you can appreciate, it's still early to discuss fiscal 2022 with any precision given the dynamic environment and the fact that we're still going through our operating plan process for next year. But Kathleen will share some additional perspective on fiscal 2022 in a moment.
I'd also like to share that we plan to host a virtual Investor Day later this calendar year, where we plan to update you on our strategy and discuss our post-pandemic aspirations. We are tentatively aiming for November, and we'll share a date shortly. For now, we remain focused on maintaining our very positive momentum as we close out this fiscal year.
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Kathleen for more detail on the quarter and the outlook."
126269,707791192,2260871,"Automatic Data Processing, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2021",2021-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. Q3 represented another strong quarter for us, with our performance on both revenues and margins driven by excellent execution across the organization.

Q3 represented another strong quarter for us, with our performance on both revenues and margins driven by excellent execution across the organization. Our revenues grew 1% on both a reported and organic constant currency basis. which represented a slight acceleration versus Q2. We delivered this growth despite incremental drag from client funds interest versus Q2 as well as some incremental pressure related to our usual seasonal Q3 revenue drivers, such as annual W-2 forms. I'll share more on these in a moment. 
As anticipated, we also experienced a margin decline as we continued to make additional growth and productivity investments and as we experienced a more significant client funds interest revenue decline compared to prior quarters. But the 90 basis points of margin decline was better than our expectations.
Combining this revenue and margin performance, our adjusted EBIT was down 2% to $1.1 billion. Our adjusted effective tax rate increased slightly compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2020, as we had less contribution from excess tax benefit on stock comp. But our share count was lower year-over-year driven by share repurchases. And as a result, our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.89 was down a modest 2% versus last year.
For our Employer Services segment, revenues declined 1% on a reported basis and 2% on an organic constant currency basis, demonstrating steady growth rates compared to last quarter despite additional pressure from 2 sources, as I just mentioned, both of which were fully anticipated.
First with greater pressure from client funds interest. Our Q3 has a seasonally larger client funds balance than other quarters of the year. And as a result, it skews more to cash and cash equivalent investments, where interest rates have been pushed down to near 0. As a result, our client funds interest declined 32% versus last year, with average yield down 70 basis points, more than offsetting our strong balance growth, which improved to 6%.
Second, with a headwind related to seasonal Q3 revenues, like the annual Form W-2, which effectively makes our Q3 slightly more sensitive to pays per control and employment turnover trends than other quarters.
Looking past these 2 headwinds, underlying ES performance showed sequential improvement driven in part by continued record level retention that was partially offset by slightly lower-than-expected pays per control.
Employer Services Q3 margin was down 120 basis points compared to last year, ahead of our expectations. We continue to invest in headcount to support our growing client base. We also started lapping lower incentive costs from last year. And we experienced greater pressure from the lower client funds interest revenue compared to the first half of this year. But at the same time, we kept our focus on prudent cost control and continue to execute on our transformation initiatives. 
Our PEO also had another very strong quarter. Average worksite employees increased sequentially to 594,000 . This was flat on a year-over-year basis. And this strong result was supported by retention outperformance and a slight sequential improvement in pays per control, which was more impactful than what we experienced in our ES segment. Although PEO sales growth still lags that of our ES segment, we did see an improvement in sales performance in Q3 and are encouraged that unit sales growth for the PEO was positive.
Our PEO revenue growth, meanwhile, was very strong at 7%. And revenues, excluding zero-margin benefits pass-throughs, grew 10%, both ahead of our expectations. Once again, this strong performance benefited from higher payroll per WSE supported by employee mix.
Additionally, this quarter, our revenue per WSE was further supported by a more favorable SUI rate environment as some states have started to increase SUI rates. Workers' comp rates remained a headwind in the quarter. PEO margin increased 100 basis points in the quarter driven by revenue growth and continued expense discipline as well as roughly 50 basis points of contribution from workers' compensation reserve true-ups.
I'll turn now to our updated guidance for fiscal 2021. With only 1 quarter remaining, we're pleased to raise our guidance midpoints for several key metrics and narrow our guidance ranges for others.
Beginning with the ES segment. We now expect revenue to be up about 1% for the full year versus our previous expectation for flat to up 2%. There's no real change in our revenue expectations. And this revised outlook includes the impact from the following drivers.
We now expect our ES new business bookings to be up 20% to 25% compared to our prior forecast of up 15% to 25%. This reflects Q3 sales performance that came in slightly ahead of our expectations and our better line of sight into Q4. We're very happy to raise our bookings guidance again. And although this doesn't materially change our revenue expectations for this fiscal year, it does add to our optimism about next year.
We now expect our ES retention to be up at least 125 basis points versus up 100 basis points prior. Similar to our updated bookings guidance, this improvement is driven by our Q3 performance and encouraging visibility into Q4 retention.
We are raising our client funds interest expectations slightly and now expect $415 million for the full year. We have seen the interest rate environment improve compared to what we had contemplated last quarter. However, those improvements only apply to our new fixed income purchases over the last few months of the year. There is no material change to our expectation for 1.6% average yield in our client funds portfolio for fiscal year 2021.
We are encouraged by the signs of improvement in the U.S. labor markets. But as we mentioned, over this last quarter, pays per control did underperform our Q3 expectations modestly. We have tempered our Q4 expectations slightly as a result, but our full year fiscal 2021 outlook remains a decline of 3% to 4%.
For our expected Employer Services margin for the year, we are narrowing to a decline of 50 to 75 basis points. While we experienced stronger-than-expected margin performance in Q3, we will reinvest some of this on discrete projects in Q4 to further accelerate our growth, investing, for example, in our Next Gen rollout, Wisely card program and additional marketing and advertising.
For our PEO segment, we now expect revenue up 5% to 6% versus our prior forecast of up 3% to 5%. And we expect average worksite employees to be up 1% to 2% versus our prior forecast of flat to up 2%. We also expect our revenues, excluding zero-margin pass-throughs, to be up 5% to 6% compared to our prior forecast of up 3% to 5%. Our top line raised for the PEO is driven primarily by the strong Q3 performance we experienced and slightly higher payroll per WSE assumptions for Q4.
Last, for PEO margin, we now expect to be up about 75 basis points in fiscal 2021 versus our prior forecast range for up 50 to 100 basis points. Our visibility into Q4 has improved. And year-to-date, we've seen stronger revenue performance and better-than-expected contribution from workers' compensation true-ups, offset by greater pass-through revenue.
For our consolidated outlook, we now anticipate total ADP revenue to be up 2% to 3% in fiscal 2021 versus up 1% to 3% prior. And we anticipate our adjusted EBIT margin to be down 50 to 75 basis points, an improvement of our prior guidance of down 50 to 100 basis points. There is no change to our expected effective tax rate of 23% for the year. And we continue to assume a net share count reduction in our guidance. Net of all these changes, we are updating our adjusted diluted EPS guidance to be flat to up 1% versus our prior guidance of down 2% to up 2%. 
As you know, with Q4, we will begin to lap the impact of the pandemic. And we recognize there is a lot of interest in what our growth rate will look like as conditions continue to normalize. With that said, we're still going through our planning process. As usual, we will provide fiscal '22 guidance when we report our fourth quarter results, but I'd like to share some preliminary considerations.
The most important factor for us in accelerating growth is driving strong new business bookings. And we expect our sales productivity to improve further next year as in-person visits increase and clients and prospects continue to reengage more fully. As that productivity continues to progress toward pre-pandemic levels and beyond, the contribution it makes to our revenue growth will likewise continue to build.
Pays per control should provide a tailwind. And the magnitude of contribution will depend on the pace of global employment recovery. We've provided sensitivities to pays per control in the past and will share a pays per control assumption next quarter.
Client funds interest will likely remain a headwind if the current rate environment holds, though it should be much less of a headwind than we are experiencing in fiscal 2021.
And on retention, improving economic activity could mean greater client switching levels compared to this year. But we're not seeing pressure yet and will remain focused on holding on to the gains we've achieved. We'll share our assumption about it next quarter.
Clearly, there are a number of moving pieces, but the net effect should be favorable. The 2% to 3% revenue growth we expect to deliver this year demonstrates the resilience of our business model. And we look forward to building from this higher revenue base and accelerating our growth back to pre-pandemic levels as quickly as we can.
We are going into next year from a position of strength. And our aim is to deliver an improved market position, stronger top line growth and margin expansion while maintaining the steady cash flows that have allowed us to increase our shareholder distributions consistently for more than 7 decades. More on all this will come next quarter, and we look forward to updating you then.
I'll now turn it back over to the operator for Q&A."

And when you combine those factors, in addition to kind of new products and other things, that's what kind of drove our new business bookings growth, the combination of increases in headcount and increases in productivity.

And I think Kathleen, in particular, mentioned the 2 or 3 things that we're investing in.
So the answer is no, there's no kind of mysterious margin pressure. In other words, the business continues to move in the right trajectory, like almost every metric we have has improved. In fact, I'd say every metric we have has improved sequentially, even the pays per control. Even though it was modest, it's still rounded to 6% down. We know now, after watching the data at the beginning of Q4, that that's heading in the right direction. And we can all tell from what's happening in unemployment that that's going to also continue to improve fairly quickly here.
So when you really kind of add it all together, like we're in a very strong position to have very strong momentum. And people who've known us for a long time know that when we experience that, we try to reinvest some of that. And I think that's exactly what you're seeing in the fourth quarter.

It's really across the board. Really, in every business unit, in every channel, in every category, our bookings have been improving, again, sequentially every quarter. And they continue to do that this quarter.
So we believe that medium to long term, that's the key to us sustaining kind of our multi-decade growth rates is these Next Gen platforms. But I just continue to caution everyone too because we want to give you the updates and we want to continue to focus on Next Gen. And I like -- I appreciate the question because it's important to kind of separate what's driving the quarters and what's driving the next fiscal year versus what's driving the next 3 to 5 years. 
And I would say that Next Gen Payroll is going to be increasingly important in the next year or two from a bookings standpoint and will start to probably make a difference. And we'll then give you that color in terms of what difference it's making. But we should be cautious about revenue impact just because of the recurring revenue model. It just takes a while for that to get into the revenue growth numbers. But it was positive but really not what really moved the needle."

So as you know, our business model is really more about providing not just the software [indiscernible] the support, right? You can call it support. You can call service. You can call it compliance. And I think what we saw this year with all of the activity that the government had around the various stimulus programs to help companies and individuals and so on, that created a lot of complexity for employers.
It appears that we're entering into an environment where, despite the pandemic hopefully fading, there will be increased levels of government activity around employment and incentives and that kind of thing. I think that's a good environment for ADP and for our downmarket business because most small businesses don't have the time or the inclination to really focus on these things and to take care of these things.
So it works for some clients, and we believe that. That's why we're rolling out Roll, no pun intended. But once you get to even a little bit slightly larger, you do end up running into issues that you need help with and you need support and need advice. And much of that can be automated, but you still need it.
So for example, a lot of our PPP support reports were automated. So it doesn't mean that somebody has to get on the phone and have a discussion about your PPP report. But you have to be focused on providing the support and the compliance in addition to just the software. So I think that helped us this year.
And again, so to answer your question, how do we believe we're set up competitively right now, I think we're set up excellently, competitively, because we now have very simple solutions for the micro market where people want to self-buy, self-install and don't have complexity and maybe don't have issues with taxes or compliance or don't want to ask questions because it's not priced or built to ask questions. But we also have the ability to provide this assistance that is important for even small clients.
For sure, it's important for midsize clients and for larger clients. But I think what really got highlighted this year is that small clients need a lot of help and need a lot of assistance. And you can see in our growth rates, in our retention, in our client satisfaction, like in all of our metrics in our small business division, that we happen to be in the right place at the right time, I think, to be able to help our clients and then hopefully now benefit from the tailwind of the demand that that's going to create on a go-forward basis. So anyway, long-winded way of saying I think we're in a great position because of our business model."

Our results have actually been quite good internationally, both in terms of bookings as well as just the performance of the business overall, in terms of revenue, pays per control, et cetera.
Some of that is that a large portion of our business is in Europe. And there were a lot of government programs there as well to help companies and to prevent high levels of unemployment. And so for example, our pays per control metric never got to the negative levels that we saw in the U.S. and Europe. So that was a benefit.
At the same time, our bookings have been quite strong. And I have to admit that I've been looking for kind of the explanation for that other than really good execution on the part of our sales force as they moved into a virtual environment because they had to sell virtually there as well. But I would say it's strong differentiation of our products. Again, the service aspect to our solutions, the ability to provide support and to provide compliance and help, all of those things probably helped our bookings performance internationally as well. 
So I would say that our global business actually is probably one of the bright spots, I would say, despite what is obviously a very difficult environment. And we obviously feel for our businesses in not just Europe, which now happens to be improving again, particularly in the U.K., but we're having challenges now in Toronto. We're having -- in Canada, in Brazil. We're having challenges obviously, as you know, in India as well. But it has not translated into negative results.
So I think it's a testament to the resiliency and the strength of the business model. But I don't want to take anything away from the fact that it also obviously shows great execution by our international leaders as well."

So there isn't a huge difference between ES pays per control performance and PEO. They both have been improving every quarter sequentially.
And remember, the PEO doesn't -- we generally stay away from very, very small clients. So we don't have a lot of clients that are 1 to 2 employees or 5 employees. The average size client in the PEO, I think, is somewhere around 40. And so by definition, it tends to skew a little bit bigger than maybe our average client size, for sure, for small business.
So actually, I was looking at these figures last night. It makes perfect sense kind of where we are, which is that the PEO is performing a little bit better in terms of absolute level of pays per control and has been improving sequentially just as ES has as well.
So -- and again, I'm probably not allowed to say this because I'm going to get in trouble. But last night, I got a note from the PEO that we experienced the first positive pays per control week. Now the problem with pays per control is that it does vary based on payroll cycles. So if you have weekly payrolls or biweekly payrolls, so you and I can't read anything into that. But it's the first time we've had a positive pays per control in any week over the last 12 months. So that's a very positive sign."

We would love to, at some point in the future, extend that into the mid-market and maybe someday into the upmarket. But as you know, like -- you know better than us because you talk to a lot of our competitors, there's not a lot of digital onboarding going on, for example, with large, complex ERP installations. Not to pick on any competitors, but it's pretty -- I know the image is that this stuff all kind of gets installed itself, but most of -- many of our competitors use third parties.
So there's still quite a lot of implementation activity and expense, whether it's done by the seller of the solutions or if it's done by a third party. We happen to have a model where we do a lot of it ourselves. And so as bookings pick up and demand picks up, we need to add to our capacity for implementation, in particular, in the mid-market, the upmarket and also global, which as I mentioned, has been strong.
So that doesn't mean that we're not adding in the downmarket also. But in our small business segment, as we alluded to and as I think you pointed out, the digital onboarding capabilities obviously reduce the need to grow headcount as much as we otherwise would have. But even in small business, we have a lot of growth in bookings. And so it's a matter of the trade-off of how much can we onboard digitally versus how much we still need some help with in terms of people being involved in. 
In terms of some of the other items that we alluded to, I mean some of this is just kind of natural to the business model. As we bring on more clients, we obviously expect productivity improvements every year, whether it's in sales or implementation or everywhere. But we are seeing a recovery of our business and very strong GDP forecast.
And so we're anticipating improved prospects for bookings and for revenue and for growth. And we need to make sure that we have the right staffing levels based on the productivity metrics that -- and the productivity goals that we have to be able to handle that business so we can maintain our high clients of -- level of client satisfaction that we've experienced.
And then we have some natural growth in expenses like -- I think Kathleen alluded to sales expense is clearly something that grows as you have sales success and as grows -- sales grow year-over-year. So I wouldn't read too much into it, other than that we made some conscious decisions to reinvest in some specific things in the fourth quarter to really position us well for '22 and beyond. But most of this is just kind of natural stuff where, again, as our revenue growth picks up over time, we still have a great incremental margin business, where we would expect to have good operating leverage as we grow those revenues."

But in this business, like people who have been following us for a long time, like when we have a 10 to 20 basis point move in retention, it's a big deal.
So to have this kind of retention on top of the retention that we had last year is pretty remarkable. And so we're pretty excited about it. And I think the key for us is trying to determine -- like when I look at the retention figures, there's a lot of improvement in what's called the controllable losses, so the ones that are related to kind of service issues and so forth.
So we're excited that we might be able to hold on to some of this gain. But at the same time, we're realistic enough to acknowledge that some of the stuff that was related to kind of out of business and government stimulus, there might be a little bit of give-back there.
But it's been pretty consistent, like every -- it seems like every quarter, the improvement has been in that same neighborhood year-over-year. Hence, why we kind of tweaked the full year -- because we're probably going to end up in the range that we gave you, which is a little higher than what we had before.

And as you said, it's hard for me to tell about retention in terms of the rest of the industry. You guys would be the experts on that because my casual review of some 10-Ks makes it kind of hard to compare, like some people would say retention of their annual recurring revenue, cloud revenues, which is not the same as the retention for their company.
So it's kind of hard for me to say. I mean some of it, I would say, is probably more variable than you think based on what I'm seeing in terms of the variability of growth rates because it's clearly been a huge part of our ability to outperform.
I mean this is a pretty remarkable revenue performance given what we've been through and given the pays per control headcount. And by the way, nobody has brought it up yet, but we have a huge headwind on client funds interest, which is going to abate here in the fourth quarter and is going to abate next year as well. There may still be a little bit of headwind, but this was really the worst quarter that we had in these 9 months, where that -- there was a $130 million drag just from client funds interest.
So when you put everything into the pot, without really good strong retention, it's hard to outperform the way we have. And we've done some work on the relative performances of us versus some of our competitors. And we feel pretty good about that and about our potential for retention to be one of the needle movers there. There might be some other factors that I'm not -- that we're not -- we haven't thought about. But no, I don't think there's anything else really big out there, like we've done a little bit better against some of our -- the usual competitors that you know about in terms of balance of trade. But there's others that are still challenging for us.
And so net-net, we're pretty comfortable with where we are and determined to continue to drive our growth. I think all of us are probably benefiting from kind of overall economic growth. And the fact that it seems like maybe there are some either in-house or regional providers that are -- because you can see our -- we're growing our units in Workforce Now and in RUN. And so we're -- it seems like we're all -- have some ability to grow in this environment, which is, I guess, good for everyone."

We obviously are trying to figure that out because it's very important to the long-term value creation of the company. And it's all the things you mentioned because you obviously know the business well enough that you hit on all. And the question is how much is each of those, right? Like the last one that you mentioned about the goodwill, there's no question that us being there -- like there were 2 or 3 months where people could not talk to anyone other than us about what to do, right? What to do about the PPP loans that the government was offering, around tax credits, because if you buy software from someone, you can't call them to ask them those questions. I just want to remind everyone, right?
You can call them to ask them about the software. And you can send in a ticket to get your software issue resolved. But you can't call to ask about tax deferrals or tax credits or PPP reports or any of that kind of stuff. So we clearly built a lot of goodwill. But on the other hand, business is business, and goodwill doesn't last forever. So we're not planning on living off of that for the next 5 or 10 years. 
So that brings me back to kind of the basics of client satisfaction, which is we have to be there for our clients when they need us, not just during the pandemic but at all times. So I would say that the second major factor, besides the goodwill that I mentioned and some of the digital initiatives to like make things easier for our clients and improve our user experience, is that we did not panic at the onset of the pandemic.
And if you recall, we took some lumps for that because we really maintained our investments, both -- not just in R&D but we maintained our investments in headcount and implementation.
That doesn't mean that we didn't have some drift down as a result of some turnover, which we did. And our headcount did decline because we had temporarily a drop in volume, if you will. But that was really, really important, right, to be able to kind of get through this period and be able to deliver on our commitments to our clients.
And back to the comments I made about productivity before, that's one of those things that we watch very carefully because we want to improve productivity. But we won't -- we can't be naive and think that if our -- obviously, if our headcount was 10% lower, we'd have higher net income. The problem is what would your client satisfaction be and your retention.
And so that's the magic, right, of being able to figure out what's that right balance. And you have tools to figure that out. You have monitoring systems, right, to understand what the client satisfaction levels are in relation to how quickly you're getting back to people to resolve their problems, for example, and how well trained your people are.
So there's a number of different factors that we look at. But the key is to be committed to delivering high levels of client service, which we are. And I think we just proved it. If we can do it during a pandemic, we can do it anytime."

I mean some of this obviously is cyclical, right, in the sense that 12 to 18 months ago, people were looking for other tools other than client acquisition tools. So you have to be careful about not kind of shifting with the wind necessarily. You have to be consistently able to help people throughout the whole life cycle of HCM. And right now, that happens to be an important one.
And so I would say that there's 2 things. One is we build our own tools, as you said, around recruitment management. And we also have an RPO business, and we have other tools to help with the talent acquisition process. We also partner and we have some really strong partnerships. I'm not sure I should -- I don't know if I mentioned the names of the companies or not. But the names that you hear a lot of kind of advertising about, we have very strong integration and partnerships with some of those companies to really make it easy, in particular, in small business but also even in the mid-market for people to use those tools to really help with the recruiting needs that they have.
But we feel we've been making -- we have made significant investments in our recruitment management platform and our talent acquisition platforms, nothing to do with the pandemic. So that -- you could call it fortuitous that we had done that before the pandemic. And we would expect that those would be contributors to our overall value proposition, into our revenue -- sorry, into our bookings growth because those are generally tools that create incrementality around your bookings number.
In other words, what you can charge clients is typically there's a core set of solutions. And then recruitment management, things like time and attendance or workforce management, those tend to be more incremental around the basic package, if you will, of HCM.
So we're positive. We're bullish on it. And I think we're very -- just as a reminder, our app marketplace is -- creates a very easy and seamless way for people to use different solutions in HCM. And this would be a category that we would have a lot of partners in that app marketplace that allow you to get all the other benefits you mentioned about ADP's business model and still be able to fulfill your talent acquisition needs. If you don't believe that ADP has what you need, which we believe you do, but if you don't, you can always get it through one of our partners."

And we're not changing our laddering strategy and we're not changing our client funds interest strategy.
The good news is that it appears the worst is behind us in terms of drag from client funds interest, which was painful. I think we had a $50 million drag just this quarter. So again, not to beat a dead horse, but it just shows the strength of the business that we didn't mention that to you. And we kind of overcame that drag and $130 million for the year. So we're looking forward to better times ahead. 
And I did see an interesting chart. Again, I probably shouldn't say this, but we had $16 billion in balances in 2008. And we had $635 million in client funds interest -- I'm sorry, $685 million, not $35 million in client funds interest. So it just shows to you the magnitude. I mean you all know what's happened to interest rates, but that was 2008. That wasn't like a different century or in a different country, like that was here.
And so today, our balances are, call it, the mid-$20 billion number for the year. I think that's the expectation.

And if you look at the inflation breakevens and you look at some other things that are going on, we're looking forward to better times ahead for client funds interest."

And we're really, really thankful for the performance of our sales organization and also our frontline associates in terms of what they've been able to do for our clients.
And at the risk of ending on a negative note, though, all of this positive and all of this -- positivity and enthusiasm, we don't want to overlook the fact that we still have some challenges, and some people still have some challenges in other parts of the world. This is a U.S.-headquartered company with over 80% of our revenues in the U.S. So that's probably why you're hearing all of this optimism.
But we're not only in the U.S. We have associates in India, in Brazil, in Canada and in Europe, and the situation is not the same there. Even though the businesses are performing well, we -- just as back in the spring of last year, there was enormous suffering and challenges here in the U.S. among our associates. The same thing is happening for some of our associates and some other parts of the world, in particular, in India.
And we are not going to forget them. We're doing everything we can to help them. We appreciate what the U.S. government is doing, along with the Indian government and local governments to help as well. And we look forward to helping them kind of get through the same difficult situation that we managed to get through. 
And they too will have their vaccination rates pick up in all of those parts of the world. And they too will emerge from the pandemic, but it's clear that it's going to take a little bit longer. And we should all remember to be there, to help them and to support them in any way we can. And ADP will do exactly that.
But having said that, we are close to seeing the situation in the rearview mirror here. And we're really anxious to see our growth rates reaccelerate to kind of where we were pre-pandemic here at some point in the future and getting back to the business and to helping our clients with their challenges and helping our associates build careers and helping all of you and our other shareholders and stakeholders get a fair return for their investment.
So we -- I guess, as always, we appreciate your interest in ADP, and we appreciate you tuning in. And we will be back in a quarter with our outlook for fiscal year '22. Thank you."

We reported very strong fourth quarter results, including 11% revenue growth and 5% adjusted diluted EPS growth, capping a year in which revenue and margin outperformed our expectations in every quarter. For the full year, we delivered 3% revenue growth, the high end of our guidance range. And I'm happy to say we reached $15 billion in revenue, a big milestone for the company. 
As we've discussed all year, we took a consistent approach to investing this year while also prudently managing expenses. As a result, our adjusted EBIT margin was down only slightly, and we were able to deliver 2% adjusted diluted EPS growth for the year, ahead of our guidance and well ahead of our expectations at the start of the year. 
I'll first cover some highlights from the quarter. Our new business bookings results were very strong, and our momentum in the market continues to build. Compared to last year's fourth quarter, we grew our employer services and new business bookings by 174%, which was slightly ahead of our expectations. And for the full year, we delivered 23% growth in ES bookings towards the higher end of our guidance. We are very pleased with this outcome from our sales team which booked $1.5 billion in new business in a year with a high degree of economic uncertainty. 
This full year ES bookings performance represented an average quota carrier productivity level of roughly 90% of our fiscal 2019 pre-pandemic levels when we delivered $1.6 billion in ES bookings. And our sales productivity continued to trend favorably in Q4. [Audio Gap] Our retention was likewise an area of very strong performance with better-than-expected fourth quarter results. Our ES segment experienced a full year increase of 170 basis points to a record 92.2 retention. Our PEO segment also experienced record retention for the year. And as we've seen all year long, client satisfaction remained incredibly high. Kathleen will share how we have approached our assumptions for next year's retention, but in Q4, the trends remained strong. 
In addition to impressive retention performance, our PEO continued to benefit from the overall resilience of our client base. And in the quarter, we had 12% revenue growth, driving us to 7% full year growth which was ahead of our expectations and guidance. This was a result of record retention as well as stronger hiring and payroll trends within our PEO, which we believe reflects the very high quality of our client base. And our ES pays per control turned positive in the quarter with 8% growth. This was in line with our expectations, and we continue to see some gradual rehiring in what would seem like a supply constrained labor market. For the full year, we ended up rounding to negative 3% pays per control growth, right in the middle of our guidance range and the assumption that we held all year long. 
During the quarter, we also continued to advance our market-leading solutions and achieved some new milestones I'd like to highlight. I'm excited to announce that this quarter, we launched and began rolling out a new user experience for RUN representing the most comprehensive refresh we've done since its launch. RUN is already the leading solution in the market with 750,000 clients that use it to help with payroll, time HR, insurance, retirement and other means. It's a powerful HCM product, and we look forward to maintaining its positive momentum. We're also looking forward to rolling out similar UX refreshes on our other major platforms in the near future. 
This year, we also made a number of enhancements to our workforce management solutions. Workforce management, which includes time, attendance and scheduling offerings, represents one of the most critical parts of our HCM suite. This year, we launched timekeeping plus scheduling, an entirely new native solution for the RUN platform. And for our Workforce Now platform, we rolled out advanced scheduling enabling clients to perform more complex workforce management tasks such as skills-based scheduling. I'm also proud to share that, this quarter, we reached 100,000 workforce management clients for the first time as the pandemic reinforced the need for robust workforce management solutions for our clients while they navigate the new norm of increasingly flexible schedules and work arrangements. 
Our suite of HRO solutions also continued to deliver steady growth for us this year. I already mentioned the strength in our PEO business, which had its average worksite employee count grow to 616,000, up 12% from last year's count and which now serves 14,500 businesses. And in addition to these employees covered by our PEO, we have over 2 million client employees on our other HRO solutions within our Employer Services segment. where we've seen robust demand all year long as clients look for ways to outsource parts of their HR function to a best-in-class provider like ADP. 
Also, this quarter, we enhanced our return to Workplace it by adding a vaccination status tracker, allowing our clients to easily assess and track vaccinations within their workforces to facilitate planning decisions. Our clients continue to appreciate the efforts we've made to help them navigate the pandemic. 
And our Next Gen agenda continued to progress nicely. Our Next Gen HCM platform continues to deliver competitive takeaways in the market. During the quarter, we also expanded our global footprint by going live in Ireland. And in the U.S., we are quickly adding to our implementation capacity for our pipeline of sold clients. For Nex Gen Payroll, we've now sold over 1,000 Nex Gen Payroll clients on Workforce Now. And Roll by ADP, which also utilizes our Nex Gen Payroll engine is off to a great start. -- where we are running ahead of our expectations so far as we drive micro businesses to this mobile-first solution. And as a final highlight, we ended the year with over 920,000 clients, up 7% from the $860,000 we had a year ago and no doubt supported by these continuous improvements we've been making to our product portfolio. 
I have to say that fiscal 2021 stood out as 1 of the most challenging years in ADP's history, and I'm very proud of how we executed. It's hard to overstate the amount of effort took across the organization to quickly adopt and manage through the pandemic while providing excellent service to our clients. And in the end, our organization and financial results both demonstrated the extraordinary resilience that is expected from us. 
As we look ahead to fiscal 2022 and beyond, our focus is on reaccelerating our growth through an intense focus on market-leading innovation, further simplification of our product portfolio, continued digital transformation and an unwavering commitment to best-in-class service. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Kathleen for more detail on the quarter and outlook."

Our fourth quarter represented a strong close to the year with 11% revenue growth on a reported basis and 9% growth on an organic constant currency basis. solidly ahead of our expectations. Our adjusted EBIT margin was down 120 basis points, better than expected. And as a reminder, we did have some comparison pressure versus last year's lower selling and incentive compensation expenses that drove the comparative decline. Our 5% adjusted diluted EPS growth was strong and, in addition to the revenue and margin performance, benefited from share repurchases. 
For our Employer Services segment, revenues increased 10% on a reported basis and 8% on an organic constant currency basis as we lapped last year's pandemic affected Q4. We continued to see contributions from excellent retention, strong new business bookings and growth in pays per control, offset by lower client funds interest. ES margin was down 90 basis points due primarily to higher selling and incentive compensation expenses versus the prior year. 
Our PEO also had another very strong quarter. Average worksite employees increased to 616,000, up 12% on a year-over-year basis on both continued retention outperformance and contribution from solid employment growth. Our PEO revenue grew 12%, an impressive performance as we once again benefited from higher payroll per WSE as well as stronger workers' comp and SUI revenue for WSE compared to the prior year partially offset by lower growth in 0 margin pass-throughs. PEO margin was up 340 basis points in the quarter due to an elevated workers' compensation reserve true-up last year. 
We are very pleased with our strong finish to the year. For fiscal 2021, a year heavily impacted by a pandemic, we drove strong bookings growth, solid 3% revenue growth delivered positive EPS growth and continued to invest for sustainable growth and digital transformation. 
I'll turn now to our outlook for fiscal '22. Beginning with ES segment revenues, we expect growth of 4% to 6%, and this outlook is a product of several underlying assumptions. We expect our ES new business bookings growth to be 10% to 15%. This strong growth would be driven by 2 factors: sales head count growth, which we typically aim to do; and benefits from continuing recovery in sales productivity as we trend back to and surpass pre-pandemic levels by the back half of the year. 
Please note, beginning this year, we will no longer be reporting our Employer Services new business bookings growth on a quarterly basis. Instead, we will focus on our full year bookings growth which better normalizes for the inherent variability in this metric. This also aligns to how we focus internally on bookings trends over a full year period. We'll, of course, continue to update the full year bookings guidance quarterly. And as we do so, we'll continue to provide color on our quarterly ES bookings performance. We believe our annual bookings disclosure and guidance remains an industry best practice. 
Moving on to ES retention. We are not yet seeing any specific indications from our clients that we should expect an increase in switching behavior. However, we believe it is prudent planning to expect that a portion of the retention gains we saw over fiscal 2021 will reverse as companies reopen and reengage in the marketplace. For the purpose of our outlook, our initial assumption is that we'll experience a decline of about 75 basis points for the year. representing just under half of last year's improvement. If this proves out, our resulting fiscal '22 retention rate would still be a record compared to prepandemic levels. But as I think we all can appreciate there is still uncertainty in this environment given the unusual year we just experienced, and we believe this to be a prudent middle-of-the-road assumption to make. We will update you in the quarters ahead as we gain further visibility, particularly during the calendar year-end period where we've historically seen the most switching. 
Our pays per control outlook for fiscal '22 is for 4% to 5% growth and above normal growth rate that assumes a continued gradual recovery in the overall labor market. Labor markets appear to be tight at the moment, but we do expect overall employment to continue trending in a favorable direction from where we are today. And then for our client funds interest revenue, most of which sits in the ES segment, we expect some modest pressure. The interest rate environment remains favorable to what we were experiencing earlier -- in the earlier part of the pandemic. But we are still expecting to reinvest at lower yields than what we are earning on securities that are maturing this coming year. 
We are also providing for the first time an added disclosure for our expected average yield on new purchases for the remainder of the fiscal year, which we believe to be useful for you in understanding the direction our average portfolio yield is headed as the portfolio turns over. Currently, that expectation is for a 1% yield on new purchases. All this said, we are expecting balanced growth of 8% to 10% and an average yield of 1.4% versus 1.5% last year. Together, this would net us $405 million to $415 million in client funds interest revenue for fiscal 2022. 
For our ES margin, we expect an increase of 50 to 75 basis points, and there are a few factors considered in this outlook. As a starting point, we are benefiting more fully from operating leverage in fiscal '22 than we did last year while also recognizing higher sales expenses and continuing our steady investment in product, implementation and service. Additionally, we expect incremental margin benefit from the continuation of our digital and other transformation initiatives in fiscal '22, as we continue to increase the utilization of digital tools to improve efficiencies throughout the organization. However, the benefit from our transformation initiatives is expected to be largely offset by a year-over-year increase in facilities and other return-to-office expenses as well as higher T&E expenses. 
Moving on to the PEO segment. We expect PEO revenues to grow 9% to 11% and PEO revenues excluding 0 margin pass-through to grow 10% to 12%. The primary driver for our PEO revenue growth is our outlook for average worksite employee growth of 9% to 11%. We expect PEO margin to be down 25 to 75 basis points in fiscal 2022 compared to the very strong margin results in fiscal 2021. This is driven partly by an assumption for stronger sales growth and associated selling expenses. 
Putting it together, our consolidated revenue outlook is for 6% to 7% growth in fiscal '22 and  our adjusted EBIT margin outlook is for expansion of 25 to 50 basis points. At this time, because of some comparison differences in the prior year, we expect the first quarter to have revenue growth just above the guidance range with the remaining 3 quarters in the range. We expect adjusted EBIT margin flat to down slightly in the first half with most of the margin expansion coming in the later part of the year. We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal '22 to improve very slightly to about 22.5% next year, assuming no change in the corporate tax rate. Our outlook also reflects the impact of additional corporate interest expense. 
During our fourth quarter, we enhanced our capital structure by issuing $1 billion in 7-year notes, the proceeds of which we're planning to use for additional accretive share repurchases over the coming quarters. This added about $3 million in interest expense in fiscal '21 with a full run rate of about $18 million in fiscal '22. At the same time, we're also contemplating further reduction in our share count beyond the typical level we would have expected to achieve driven by these incremental share repurchases. Net of this higher interest expense, lower tax rate and additional share repurchases, we expect growth in adjusted diluted EPS of 9% to 11%. 
As we enter fiscal year '22, despite the continuing challenges around the pandemic, we are very encouraged by the signs of a continued recovery in the global economy as well as the ongoing secular growth trends in HCM. As the world of work evolves, we believe we are very well positioned to continue adding value for our clients and differentiating ourselves in the market. We look forward to updating you on our progress. I'll now turn it back over to the operator for Q&A."

Kathleen probably has a couple of other she can mention. But like I think we mentioned in our prepared remarks, what we're seeing around workforce management, in terms of time tracking and scheduling and so forth, we also mentioned some of the products we've developed for return to workplace. So there are a number of things that are probably related to what's likely to be a more hybrid work environment for white collar employees at least on a go-forward basis, which probably requires people to think about their investments in HCM in terms of what they can do to maximize the recruiting and the retention and the engagement of that hybrid workforce. So I think that is one. 
The other one is there's always been a secular uptrend in terms of regulatory-related, and this is on a global basis. demand for HCM products. In other words, the more complexity there is around being an employer, the greater the demand for the wide array of services that we provide. That secular trend has probably gotten a bit of a boost based on, in the U.S., the change in administrations, right, which -- we've had that secular growth for 7 years that ADP has existed. But there are times where it's stronger in terms of a tailwind and sometimes where it's weaker. And I would say that we're heading into strong secular tailwinds here as a result of some of the increased attention on regulatory actions. And you probably all saw, I think it was yesterday or the day before, that the President signed a number of executive orders, most of which are aimed at employer-employee-related relationships that increase the amount of tracking and reporting and compliance necessary on the part of employers. So those are a couple that I would mention. 
I think our retention rate also shows, in an indirect way, secular demand improving, right, in the sense that people have kind of rethought dropping or switching from their HCM vendors, but that one is a little difficult to be 100% sure about because we do expect some normalization in that retention rate."

All of that is -- you can just see in the bookings number that we have, our bookings, and I'm sure we'll get into the discussion on this, but the growth is pretty broad-based. I mean certainly, we saw some channels stronger than others, but it's pretty broad-based. And I think that's because of all of the dynamic change and complexity that we see. And in particular, our comprehensive solution, our outsourcing solutions have seen quite significant growth. So we're really encouraged about the macro trends that we see in the space."

Obviously, if we end up having more challenges because of the pandemic or otherwise, but right now, the amount of -- even the existing government stimulus, even if there's no additional stimulus is pretty strong and also the pent-up demand and all these -- the reopening, that feels like a very good backdrop for us from a bookings growth standpoint. 
And then as long as we have that background or that backdrop that's positive, it really comes down to really 2 things, is sales force productivity at the sales quota carrier level times number of sales quota carriers. And I hate to be so simplistic, but at our size, because we have new products, and we're rolling out -- you heard how excited we are about all the new things that we're putting out there, but we sell a lot of business every year. So for a smaller company, when they end up having like a new product launch, that can cause all kinds of growth -- and by the way, likewise, if you don't have any new products, but for us, from what I would consider to be a steady eddy. So we really grow through methodically improving and adding new products, making tuck-in acquisitions, et cetera, a lot of that. But the key formula for us is we cannot hit our sales plan unless we have the head count, and we are continually improving our sales force productivity, and that's exactly what our plan is. 
And we had some good news over the last 4 quarters where our sales force productivity at the average quota carrier level steadily improved throughout the year to reach 90% for the full year, but we exited the fourth quarter in kind of the mid-90s, if you will, in comparison to pre-pandemic level. So it feels like we're getting back to ""trend"" from an average sales productivity standpoint. And if we can get back to that trend and we deliver on our head count additions, we should be able to hit our new business bookings number."

And perhaps how are you thinking about the strategy that land-and-expand strategy to really take advantage of this opportunity."

So one of the -- in case somebody asked that we -- one of the questions we sometimes get is -- and it's related to what you're asking is the mix of how much is new logo sales versus how much is add-on sales. And it's really been very steady over many years. It was only during the ACA period where we had a little bit of a tilt more towards incremental add-on sales, but it's for a long time, been around 50-50, and it's still kind of in that neighborhood. So that, I think, bodes well because the more clients we add, the more opportunities we have to pursue that land-and-expand, I think, approach that you just described. 
So I would say that we're bullish on the opportunity to continue to go back to the new logos that we sold, which, in many cases, we sell with multiple modules, but there's always additional room for new products as well to go back to that existing client base. So I think that underlying logo growth, I think, is another kind of supportive factor, if you will, for our new business bookings because we do get about 50% of our bookings from our existing client base."

Maybe we may have confused some people, I think, in prior calls, but I think GlobalView's probably -- could be at the top of our list in terms of performance this year.

There's a lot of factors that probably went into what was incredibly strong demand and very positive sales growth. So I would say, again, we don't disclose individual product lines, but I would say that GlobalView sales were one of the stronger line items, I think, for us. 
And I'll add that to your question about differences between the businesses, I think all of our businesses really performed well. It's kind of hard. It really comes down to trying to point out which ones were spectacular versus just good. And I would say that GlobalView and even our international business really were standouts. And really, it's very impressive because some of the situations in Europe, for example, were very challenging in terms of dealing with the pandemic, but I didn't really stop people from looking for solutions and it didn't stop our sales force from finding them even though they had to do that from -- obviously, from a remote workplace.

So it feels to us like this is a multiyear cycle here where employers are going to be really scrambling to find people, and I think that generally creates conversation opportunities. 
So we don't have a magic formula necessary -- necessarily, and we're not a staffing firm, but we do have tools and we have technology and we have people that can help our clients be more competitive as they look for solutions as they look for the right employees in the right place at the right time at the right pay level. That's our sweet spot. And so I'd say we're right in the middle of this, what I would call, super cycle of demand for labor that is probably short term related to kind of friction where people are just not in the right places and and people are probably also -- there's some hesitations still. There's issues with child care and elder care. There's a number of factors. It is -- we assume like other economists that this will be -- that part will be transitory, but that the need for people will not be given just the, obviously, low unemployment rate, which we will be at by the end of, call it, calendar year '22."

So I think some of this is really about us being able to adapt, which is our job, to what the market wants, right, what the clients want and what the prospects want. 
And the fact of the matter is that about half of our -- half of the workforce out there, which probably translates into half of our clients, they actually kept going to workplaces. They kept making things, delivering things and going to workplaces. The rest of the -- some of us white-collar employees didn't. So that segment of the prospects and clients, they expect us to be available if they want us to meet with them in person. We're not going to go force anyone to meet in person we're happy to meet them they want to be met, whether it's virtually online or in person. But we want to be ready for whatever the market once and whatever the market demands, and that's exactly our plan. But to answer your question, it's really hard to know which factor is the most important factor.

I think Kathleen may probably have a little bit of additional color, but I would tell you that this -- I think your insinuation that the PPP loans may have something to do with these elevated retention rates is something that we've heard kind of out there in terms of as a buzz. And again, that's very hard to like put our finger on in terms of how to quantify that and what's the impact. But for sure, one of the strongest areas we've had in retention is our downmarket business. And that is why I think we've prudently planned for some give-back on that next year. 
Having said that, I would tell you that this year, fiscal '21,  and the 2 months before that, we're probably the greatest example of ADP's business model in terms of ability to deliver, we call it service, you can call it compliance, call it whatever you want. But when the chips were down and people needed help and needed to talk to someone about their PPP loan and they weren't calling their banker. They didn't have to apply for a loan and they did have to go through a bank, but you can go do your own channel checks to see how many banks were actually answering the phone or giving people advice because they were completely overwhelmed as we were, but we actually figured out a way to handle it. And we were there for our clients. And so I think that what we just did over the last year, and I get it, I'm a pragmatist, so memories are short, and we have to continue to impress and continue to deliver for our clients. But I think we just proved to hundreds of thousands of clients and, hopefully, to prospects from a reputation standpoint, that if you want to have someone who's a partner at ADP, if you want software, you can buy software. But if you want great technology and great software, but you want someone who's going to be able to deliver on the service side, then you should be with ADP. 
And so I think that, that is going to have some -- there's going to be some factor in hopefully allowing us to hold on to some of this retention on a more permanent basis because I think the -- when the chips were down, I think people saw the difference between not having someone that you could get help from and having someone that you can reach out to and get advice and get your problems solved. But the bottom line is we clearly are prudent and aware that some of this normalization could result in some lower retention rates, particularly in the down market as you are, I think, alluding to."

We saw it inch a little bit higher there as well, too. So pretty much strong across the board. 
But look, we want to be prudent from a planning perspective. And while we haven't seen any change yet in terms of switching or along those lines, I do think it's prudent to plan that there's going to be, I'll call it, a little bit of giveback in fiscal '22. I think we are going to hold on to some of the gains. We're certainly attempting to do that. We want to do that.

So let me just start off with that comment. And part of that is that we're always trying to balance short-term and long-term investors. I'm not sure which ones you were hearing from. But our intent here is to continue the machine, right, and the momentum that has led to multiple decades here of compounded growth and creation of value over a very long period of time, and that requires delivering short-term results as well as long-term results. And those long-term results, I think, require some investment, including on the R&D side. But in particular, this year, really, the biggest factor is selling expense and sales investment, which has happened to us in the past. So we've had other times in, call it, 2000, 2001 or '02 and then '08, '09, '10 because I was around for those, where as we reaccelerate and take advantage of demand back to the secular growth opportunity, the way our business model works is we incur a lot of upfront selling and implementation expense. Now there are some accounting rules that allow you to defer some of that. But generally speaking, you get elevated selling expenses and implementation expenses and it's pretty significant. So I would say that, that is a significant part of what would have maybe otherwise been higher margins for '22. 
But when that business then is on the books, that's a high incremental margin business that then in '23, '24 and then for the next 12 to 13 years, that's how long we keep our clients on average, creates an annuity. So as you can imagine, we never turned down the incremental opportunity to add business, never, because of just the way the value creation model works. And we're going to make hay while the sun is shining here. And with 6%, 7% GDP growth last quarter and what's likely to be incredibly strong GDP in the next year or 2, we're going to take every possible opportunity. And unfortunately, that requires some selling expense and some implementation expense in addition to the ongoing investments in technology and some of the other things that we do."

The way to think about it is, look, we're going to have operating leverage to a greater extent in fiscal '22, obviously. But we've also got the investments that we want to continue to make, as Carlos just articulated, in product, in sales and in digital transformation importantly. And we do have some offsets. Carlos mentioned the sales expense. But we also have things like return to office and ramping up T&E versus what we were -- where we were in fiscal '21. Kind of all that goes into the mix. Net-net, we've got this 25 to 50 basis points margin expansion. We're going to do our best to deliver on that and continue to work our digital transformation, and it's possible to do even more."

So our revenue growth would have been almost 1 point higher our margin for this year in a pandemic would have been up 70 basis points instead of down 40 basis points had we not had that headwind. 
Now we did have a headwind. So it's always hard to say if we didn't have this and we didn't have that. But that's a pretty easy thing to isolate that has no operational -- nothing to do with operations. We have no control over, and we have to just ride that cyclical wave, which hopefully that cyclical wave is heading in a very positive direction for us over the next 2 to 3 years. But I just want to make sure you understood that because I think that tells you just how much control we have over our expenses and over our business model and over our long-term value creation objectives."

And we happen to package the 2 things together, great technology with great service. So I'd say we have great technology and we have great service. We're going to be able to hold on to hopefully a lot of that improvement we've had in retention, even if we have a little bit of giveback in the down market."

So we have -- for example, we have a lot of data around -- like we track individual clients how many times they call. We actually can monitor. We have voice recognition that tells us certain keywords that people use when they're -- because we record all phone calls, and that really gives us deep insight into clients that are at risk. And then we have special teams that can follow up with those clients to make sure that whatever problem they have has been resolved. But that's -- I would call that trench warfare, which -- but if you want to get into those details, I can go in the trenches with you. But we have very deep analytical tools that really give us a lot of insight. 
For example, in our downmarket, I mean our clients don't call that often because, hopefully, they don't have problems very often because we do a nice job of preventing problems. But one of our small business clients has -- we detect has multiple calls in a month. That requires a reach-out to that client or a deeper investigation and a triage to make sure that we don't lose that client because that's usually a sign that there's something wrong with that client. And we have other techniques and other approaches and other tools to identify what we would call hotspots. We also monitor pricing very carefully. When we do our price changes, which I guess is code for price increases, we do that very carefully using a lot of analytical tools to make sure that we do that in the smartest possible way, if you will, to maximize retention."

I think that it's -- again, like a lot of things we've been saying over the last 2 or 3 years, some of these things are inevitable, are going to happen, and we're preparing for them. So things like real-time payroll, and this one that you're referring to is kind of one that we just heard over the last couple of days. That's something we've been thinking about for many, many years, and we have solutions where someone needs to get paid. Like, for example, in California, if someone is terminated from their job, you have to give them their final paycheck like immediately. And so that is difficult to do through the normal process. So we have solutions for that, that we've had for quite some time. And so I think the increasing popularity is probably more related to increasing discussion about it but also to technological advances that allow more options, right, in terms of instant payments and/or faster payments. So I would say the answer is yes. That is an important thing. And for certain sectors, like if you have a high turnover hourly workforce, your ability to provide that solution is crucial, but we have that ability to provide that solution. But you can't, for example, sell a client in California and not be able to provide instant pay upon termination. So it's -- you have to have that."

You -- again, you're right that I myself was surprised that there was an opportunity to do that and that we were able to execute on it, but we had one that I think we mentioned last year in the fourth quarter and kind of spilled a little bit over into the first quarter, but it was mostly, I think, fourth quarter. We had one the year before that, that was significant also in the fourth quarter. And this year, we've had a number of, what I would call, smaller ones, but they add up. And so I would say that the news there is good and is ongoing, and we've created a nice ability to do these conversions and make it good for us in terms of growth. 
And back to the question around cross-sell, we usually have a much broader set of solutions than other people that we are making these acquisitions from, which creates upside opportunity, right, in terms of value creation for us. On the kind of overall M&A comment side, I would say that we've -- where we've been most active is looking in some of our international locations and markets where I think we have very little market share, and we still have needs, for example, for add-on products, whereas in the U.S., we're not really looking to add additional platforms for either benefits or payroll and so forth. So it really has to be things that are adjacent, right, in the HCM space but not duplicative because, as you know, we've been on this kind of simplification push for many, many years and trying to build things organically and invest in technology organically. So that doesn't mean that we won't acquire because we have in a couple of years. We just haven't done anything for a couple of years, but we do welcome the opportunity to add additional ancillary as long as they fit into our technology road map and they're not disruptive or add-on, and we're not doing it just to get the ""revenue pop"". 
But on the international side, we typically don't have those factors at play as much, and that's a place where we're still excited and we still see a lot of greenfield opportunity to expand through M&A."

And then they can get enhanced, I think, by cyclical factors like a strong economy. So people sometimes say that the PEO will do well or outsourcing will do well when there's a recession because people are looking to save money. And that -- there is some truth to that, but it's not what the data supports or shows, right? It's usually when you have very strong economic growth and strong GDP and people are scrambling for talent, and they're competing for offering the right benefits, that's when PEOs and outsourcing tend to I think, do better. 
So I would say that based on experience, which you have to discount because we just went through a pandemic, so most of our experiences, we should park somewhere outside the door because we may end up being wrong. But all things being equal, this kind of economic environment is usually very strong for the PEO. 
And as for the last 18 months, what we saw there is it's a long cycle sale, and it's a high involvement decision. So I think we've been clear that we've had good -- great results there from a booking standpoint and probably better than we would have thought was possible but definitely not as strong as yet in kind of the early stages of the recovery of our bookings. We expect that to reverse, and that is our plan in '22. In other words, we expect very strong bookings and strong recovery on the PEO. And we're seeing some signs of that in the fourth quarter because what happened is in this kind of hunkering down mode, we saw very high retention in our PEO but not as much. It was more difficult to sell new clients, but the existing clients, I mean it was unbelievable value that we delivered to them because it was beyond just PPP loans. It was how do I downsize my workforce or how do I put people on furlough and what are the rules in this state around benefits. I mean our people were busy. I mean all of our people over all of ADP were busy this year, while maybe other people were less busy but our people were busy. And in the PEO, they were extra busy. So I think that, that bodes well. And those anecdotal stories and that reputation along with kind of some of these cyclical tailwinds, I think, bode well for the PEO here in the next year or 2."

We think we mentioned in our prepared comments, but our non-PEO HRO solutions, so these would be kind of mid-market and upmarket outsourcing solutions that are what I would call more comprehensive, if you will, really were probably one of the real highlights. And I think that was, again related probably to people realizing probably within months after the pandemic that like this stuff is hard to do, especially if you have to pivot very quickly, right? You have to make sure your systems are still up. Like you can't have a server in a closet somewhere that you're using to run payroll because you still do this internally. And then people who go to the office to key in the payroll is like this stuff, there's just a lot of people all of a sudden we woke up and realized from a business continuity standpoint and from a support standpoint, I need help, and it needs to be more than just the software, right, and basic service. So these HRO solutions really were an incredible bright spot.

And we're pretty happy, as you could tell from our tone and what we've talked about in the last couple of quarters, with our progress there. And we have a plan. I don't think it's really great for us to share it because I think competitors listen to these calls, too. But we have a very methodical plan to eventually get to 100% of our core sales being on Nex Gen Payroll while at the same time then gradually moving into the other parts of major accounts, call it, the 150 to 1,000 and then selling 100% of those clients on to Nex Gen Payroll. 
And then as we're going along, we will start some conversions, but it's not a huge priority because, again remember, Workforce Now is the front end on both of these. And this is all intended to be transparent. This is not one of those migrations that you heard about 5, 7 years ago at ADP, where we disrupt everything and the clients are going to see very little change other than some enhancements in terms of self-service capabilities and other things that obviously we think are going to be net positives from both a selling and a client retention standpoint. But generally speaking, their experience will not change in a significant way."

But I'm just incredibly grateful to our associates for what they did, first and foremost, for our clients. When the chips were down we really delivered. It started obviously in the fourth quarter of last year with all the government regulation changes that needed to be put in place and the huge volume of inquiries we were getting about PPP loans, et cetera, but it really continued into this fiscal year as well. And it was just an incredibly challenging environment while people have personal challenges, right, including health challenges in their family. And so again, I'm just -- I just look back to we're a mission-driven company and you can see it in the culture. And I'm grateful for my predecessors and the culture that was built over all these decades that allowed us to -- it wasn't without incident, and it wasn't easy, but we really got through it. I think we delivered for our clients. We delivered for the economy because we are a mission-critical service in the economy, and I just couldn't be prouder of our associates, including our back-office associates to support our frontline associates as well as our sales force who, as we talked about a lot today, continue to plow through and allow us to continue to grow our business despite where unprecedented headwinds. 
So -- but first and foremost, I'm just so glad that despite, obviously, we have some short-term challenges here with the new Delta variant and so forth, but I mean, clearly, we're heading in the right direction, and we're very optimistic both for ourselves, for our families and for our associates and for our clients, and we look forward to better times ahead here over the next couple of quarters where inevitably, we'll have some ups and downs area some challenges here and there, but it's great that everything is on the right track, at least in the United States. And we're hoping that other parts of the world follow closely behind given that we have a very significant business in Europe, Asia and Latin America as well.

We reported very strong fourth quarter results, including 11% revenue growth and 5% adjusted diluted EPS growth, capping a year in which revenue and margin outperformed our expectations in every quarter. For the full year, we delivered 3% revenue growth, the high end of our guidance range. And I'm happy to say we reached $15 billion in revenue, a big milestone for the company. 
As we've discussed all year, we took a consistent approach to investing this year while also prudently managing expenses. As a result, our adjusted EBIT margin was down only slightly, and we were able to deliver 2% adjusted diluted EPS growth for the year, ahead of our guidance and well ahead of our expectations at the start of the year. 
I'll first cover some highlights from the quarter. Our new business bookings results were very strong, and our momentum in the market continues to build. Compared to last year's fourth quarter, we grew our employer services and new business bookings by 174%, which was slightly ahead of our expectations. And for the full year, we delivered 23% growth in ES bookings towards the higher end of our guidance. We are very pleased with this outcome from our sales team which booked $1.5 billion in new business in a year with a high degree of economic uncertainty. 
This full year ES bookings performance represented an average quota carrier productivity level of roughly 90% of our fiscal 2019 pre-pandemic levels when we delivered $1.6 billion in ES bookings. And our sales productivity continued to trend favorably in Q4. At this point, most of our U.S. field quota carriers have conducted some in-person meetings, and we expect that to keep trending positively as our clients and prospects show increasing preference for doing so. 
We also reopened additional sales offices in this quarter, and our current plan is to have most of our major U.S. sales offices back opened by the end of September. Our retention was likewise an area of very strong performance with better-than-expected fourth quarter results. Our ES segment experienced a full year increase of 170 basis points to a record 92.2 retention. Our PEO segment also experienced record retention for the year. And as we've seen all year long, client satisfaction remained incredibly high. Kathleen will share how we have approached our assumptions for next year's retention, but in Q4, the trends remained strong. 
In addition to impressive retention performance, our PEO continued to benefit from the overall resilience of our client base. And in the quarter, we had 12% revenue growth, driving us to 7% full year growth which was ahead of our expectations and guidance. This was a result of record retention as well as stronger hiring and payroll trends within our PEO, which we believe reflects the very high quality of our client base. And our ES pays per control turned positive in the quarter with 8% growth. This was in line with our expectations, and we continue to see some gradual rehiring in what would seem like a supply constrained labor market. For the full year, we ended up rounding to negative 3% pays per control growth, right in the middle of our guidance range and the assumption that we held all year long. 
During the quarter, we also continued to advance our market-leading solutions and achieved some new milestones I'd like to highlight. I'm excited to announce that this quarter, we launched and began rolling out a new user experience for RUN representing the most comprehensive refresh we've done since its launch. RUN is already the leading solution in the market with 750,000 clients that use it to help with payroll, time HR, insurance, retirement and other means. It's a powerful HCM product, and we look forward to maintaining its positive momentum. We're also looking forward to rolling out similar UX refreshes on our other major platforms in the near future. 
This year, we also made a number of enhancements to our workforce management solutions. Workforce management, which includes time, attendance and scheduling offerings, represents one of the most critical parts of our HCM suite. This year, we launched timekeeping plus scheduling, an entirely new native solution for the RUN platform. And for our Workforce Now platform, we rolled out advanced scheduling enabling clients to perform more complex workforce management tasks such as skills-based scheduling. I'm also proud to share that, this quarter, we reached 100,000 workforce management clients for the first time as the pandemic reinforced the need for robust workforce management solutions for our clients while they navigate the new norm of increasingly flexible schedules and work arrangements. 
Our suite of HRO solutions also continued to deliver steady growth for us this year. I already mentioned the strength in our PEO business, which had its average worksite employee count grow to 616,000, up 12% from last year's count and which now serves 14,500 businesses. And in addition to these employees covered by our PEO, we have over 2 million client employees on our other HRO solutions within our Employer Services segment. where we've seen robust demand all year long as clients look for ways to outsource parts of their HR function to a best-in-class provider like ADP. 
Also, this quarter, we enhanced our return to Workplace it by adding a vaccination status tracker, allowing our clients to easily assess and track vaccinations within their workforces to facilitate planning decisions. Our clients continue to appreciate the efforts we've made to help them navigate the pandemic. 
And our Next Gen agenda continued to progress nicely. Our Next Gen HCM platform continues to deliver competitive takeaways in the market. During the quarter, we also expanded our global footprint by going live in Ireland. And in the U.S., we are quickly adding to our implementation capacity for our pipeline of sold clients. For Nex Gen Payroll, we've now sold over 1,000 Nex Gen Payroll clients on Workforce Now. And Roll by ADP, which also utilizes our Nex Gen Payroll engine is off to a great start. -- where we are running ahead of our expectations so far as we drive micro businesses to this mobile-first solution. And as a final highlight, we ended the year with over 920,000 clients, up 7% from the $860,000 we had a year ago and no doubt supported by these continuous improvements we've been making to our product portfolio. 
I have to say that fiscal 2021 stood out as 1 of the most challenging years in ADP's history, and I'm very proud of how we executed. It's hard to overstate the amount of effort took across the organization to quickly adopt and manage through the pandemic while providing excellent service to our clients. And in the end, our organization and financial results both demonstrated the extraordinary resilience that is expected from us. 
As we look ahead to fiscal 2022 and beyond, our focus is on reaccelerating our growth through an intense focus on market-leading innovation, further simplification of our product portfolio, continued digital transformation and an unwavering commitment to best-in-class service. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Kathleen for more detail on the quarter and outlook."

Our adjusted EBIT",1412,"Thank you, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter represented a strong close to the year with 11% revenue growth on a reported basis and 9% growth on an organic constant currency basis. solidly ahead of our expectations. Our adjusted EBIT margin was down 120 basis points, better than expected. And as a reminder, we did have some comparison pressure versus last year's lower selling and incentive compensation expenses that drove the comparative decline. Our 5% adjusted diluted EPS growth was strong and, in addition to the revenue and margin performance, benefited from share repurchases. 
For our Employer Services segment, revenues increased 10% on a reported basis and 8% on an organic constant currency basis as we lapped last year's pandemic affected Q4. We continued to see contributions from excellent retention, strong new business bookings and growth in pays per control, offset by lower client funds interest. ES margin was down 90 basis points due primarily to higher selling and incentive compensation expenses versus the prior year. 
Our PEO also had another very strong quarter. Average worksite employees increased to 616,000, up 12% on a year-over-year basis on both continued retention outperformance and contribution from solid employment growth. Our PEO revenue grew 12%, an impressive performance as we once again benefited from higher payroll per WSE as well as stronger workers' comp and SUI revenue for WSE compared to the prior year partially offset by lower growth in 0 margin pass-throughs. PEO margin was up 340 basis points in the quarter due to an elevated workers' compensation reserve true-up last year. 
We are very pleased with our strong finish to the year. For fiscal 2021, a year heavily impacted by a pandemic, we drove strong bookings growth, solid 3% revenue growth delivered positive EPS growth and continued to invest for sustainable growth and digital transformation. 
I'll turn now to our outlook for fiscal '22. Beginning with ES segment revenues, we expect growth of 4% to 6%, and this outlook is a product of several underlying assumptions. We expect our ES new business bookings growth to be 10% to 15%. This strong growth would be driven by 2 factors: sales head count growth, which we typically aim to do; and benefits from continuing recovery in sales productivity as we trend back to and surpass pre-pandemic levels by the back half of the year. 
Please note, beginning this year, we will no longer be reporting our Employer Services new business bookings growth on a quarterly basis. Instead, we will focus on our full year bookings growth which better normalizes for the inherent variability in this metric. This also aligns to how we focus internally on bookings trends over a full year period. We'll, of course, continue to update the full year bookings guidance quarterly. And as we do so, we'll continue to provide color on our quarterly ES bookings performance. We believe our annual bookings disclosure and guidance remains an industry best practice. 
Moving on to ES retention. We are not yet seeing any specific indications from our clients that we should expect an increase in switching behavior. However, we believe it is prudent planning to expect that a portion of the retention gains we saw over fiscal 2021 will reverse as companies reopen and reengage in the marketplace. For the purpose of our outlook, our initial assumption is that we'll experience a decline of about 75 basis points for the year. representing just under half of last year's improvement. If this proves out, our resulting fiscal '22 retention rate would still be a record compared to prepandemic levels. But as I think we all can appreciate there is still uncertainty in this environment given the unusual year we just experienced, and we believe this to be a prudent middle-of-the-road assumption to make. We will update you in the quarters ahead as we gain further visibility, particularly during the calendar year-end period where we've historically seen the most switching. 
Our pays per control outlook for fiscal '22 is for 4% to 5% growth and above normal growth rate that assumes a continued gradual recovery in the overall labor market. Labor markets appear to be tight at the moment, but we do expect overall employment to continue trending in a favorable direction from where we are today. And then for our client funds interest revenue, most of which sits in the ES segment, we expect some modest pressure. The interest rate environment remains favorable to what we were experiencing earlier -- in the earlier part of the pandemic. But we are still expecting to reinvest at lower yields than what we are earning on securities that are maturing this coming year. 
We are also providing for the first time an added disclosure for our expected average yield on new purchases for the remainder of the fiscal year, which we believe to be useful for you in understanding the direction our average portfolio yield is headed as the portfolio turns over. Currently, that expectation is for a 1% yield on new purchases. All this said, we are expecting balanced growth of 8% to 10% and an average yield of 1.4% versus 1.5% last year. Together, this would net us $405 million to $415 million in client funds interest revenue for fiscal 2022. 
For our ES margin, we expect an increase of 50 to 75 basis points, and there are a few factors considered in this outlook. As a starting point, we are benefiting more fully from operating leverage in fiscal '22 than we did last year while also recognizing higher sales expenses and continuing our steady investment in product, implementation and service. Additionally, we expect incremental margin benefit from the continuation of our digital and other transformation initiatives in fiscal '22, as we continue to increase the utilization of digital tools to improve efficiencies throughout the organization. However, the benefit from our transformation initiatives is expected to be largely offset by a year-over-year increase in facilities and other return-to-office expenses as well as higher T&E expenses. 
Moving on to the PEO segment. We expect PEO revenues to grow 9% to 11% and PEO revenues excluding 0 margin pass-through to grow 10% to 12%. The primary driver for our PEO revenue growth is our outlook for average worksite employee growth of 9% to 11%. We expect PEO margin to be down 25 to 75 basis points in fiscal 2022 compared to the very strong margin results in fiscal 2021. This is driven partly by an assumption for stronger sales growth and associated selling expenses. 
Putting it together, our consolidated revenue outlook is for 6% to 7% growth in fiscal '22 and  our adjusted EBIT margin outlook is for expansion of 25 to 50 basis points. At this time, because of some comparison differences in the prior year, we expect the first quarter to have revenue growth just above the guidance range with the remaining 3 quarters in the range. We expect adjusted EBIT margin flat to down slightly in the first half with most of the margin expansion coming in the later part of the year. We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal '22 to improve very slightly to about 22.5% next year, assuming no change in the corporate tax rate. Our outlook also reflects the impact of additional corporate interest expense. 
During our fourth quarter, we enhanced our capital structure by issuing $1 billion in 7-year notes, the proceeds of which we're planning to use for additional accretive share repurchases over the coming quarters. This added about $3 million in interest expense in fiscal '21 with a full run rate of about $18 million in fiscal '22. At the same time, we're also contemplating further reduction in our share count beyond the typical level we would have expected to achieve driven by these incremental share repurchases. Net of this higher interest expense, lower tax rate and additional share repurchases, we expect growth in adjusted diluted EPS of 9% to 11%. 
As we enter fiscal year '22, despite the continuing challenges around the pandemic, we are very encouraged by the signs of a continued recovery in the global economy as well as the ongoing secular growth trends in HCM. As the world of work evolves, we believe we are very well positioned to continue adding value for our clients and differentiating ourselves in the market. We look forward to updating you on our progress. I'll now turn it back over to the operator for Q&A."

Kathleen probably has a couple of other she can mention. But like I think we mentioned in our prepared remarks, what we're seeing around workforce management, in terms of time tracking and scheduling and so forth, we also mentioned some of the products we've developed for return to workplace. So there are a number of things that are probably related to what's likely to be a more hybrid work environment for white collar employees at least on a go-forward basis, which probably requires people to think about their investments in HCM in terms of what they can do to maximize the recruiting and the retention and the engagement of that hybrid workforce. So I think that is one. 
The other one is there's always been a secular uptrend in terms of regulatory-related, and this is on a global basis. demand for HCM products. In other words, the more complexity there is around being an employer, the greater the demand for the wide array of services that we provide. That secular trend has probably gotten a bit of a boost based on, in the U.S., the change in administrations, right, which -- we've had that secular growth for 7 years that ADP has existed. But there are times where it's stronger in terms of a tailwind and sometimes where it's weaker. And I would say that we're heading into strong secular tailwinds here as a result of some of the increased attention on regulatory actions. And you probably all saw, I think it was yesterday or the day before, that the President signed a number of executive orders, most of which are aimed at employer-employee-related relationships that increase the amount of tracking and reporting and compliance necessary on the part of employers. So those are a couple that I would mention. 
I think our retention rate also shows, in an indirect way, secular demand improving, right, in the sense that people have kind of rethought dropping or switching from their HCM vendors, but that one is a little difficult to be 100% sure about because we do expect some normalization in that retention rate."

All of that is -- you can just see in the bookings number that we have, our bookings, and I'm sure we'll get into the discussion on this, but the growth is pretty broad-based. I mean certainly, we saw some channels stronger than others, but it's pretty broad-based. And I think that's because of all of the dynamic change and complexity that we see. And in particular, our comprehensive solution, our outsourcing solutions have seen quite significant growth. So we're really encouraged about the macro trends that we see in the space."

So number one, obviously, is what we just talked about, is the secular and cyclical tailwinds or headwinds. So if the economy continues with the momentum it's got, we're feeling pretty good. Obviously, if we end up having more challenges because of the pandemic or otherwise, but right now, the amount of -- even the existing government stimulus, even if there's no additional stimulus is pretty strong and also the pent-up demand and all these -- the reopening, that feels like a very good backdrop for us from a bookings growth standpoint. 
And then as long as we have that background or that backdrop that's positive, it really comes down to really 2 things, is sales force productivity at the sales quota carrier level times number of sales quota carriers. And I hate to be so simplistic, but at our size, because we have new products, and we're rolling out -- you heard how excited we are about all the new things that we're putting out there, but we sell a lot of business every year. So for a smaller company, when they end up having like a new product launch, that can cause all kinds of growth -- and by the way, likewise, if you don't have any new products, but for us, from what I would consider to be a steady eddy. So we really grow through methodically improving and adding new products, making tuck-in acquisitions, et cetera, a lot of that. But the key formula for us is we cannot hit our sales plan unless we have the head count, and we are continually improving our sales force productivity, and that's exactly what our plan is. 
And we had some good news over the last 4 quarters where our sales force productivity at the average quota carrier level steadily improved throughout the year to reach 90% for the full year, but we exited the fourth quarter in kind of the mid-90s, if you will, in comparison to pre-pandemic level. So it feels like we're getting back to ""trend"" from an average sales productivity standpoint. And if we can get back to that trend and we deliver on our head count additions, we should be able to hit our new business bookings number."

So one of the -- in case somebody asked that we -- one of the questions we sometimes get is -- and it's related to what you're asking is the mix of how much is new logo sales versus how much is add-on sales. And it's really been very steady over many years. It was only during the ACA period where we had a little bit of a tilt more towards incremental add-on sales, but it's for a long time, been around 50-50, and it's still kind of in that neighborhood. So that, I think, bodes well because the more clients we add, the more opportunities we have to pursue that land-and-expand, I think, approach that you just described. 
So I would say that we're bullish on the opportunity to continue to go back to the new logos that we sold, which, in many cases, we sell with multiple modules, but there's always additional room for new products as well to go back to that existing client base. So I think that underlying logo growth, I think, is another kind of supportive factor, if you will, for our new business bookings because we do get about 50% of our bookings from our existing client base."

There's a lot of factors that probably went into what was incredibly strong demand and very positive sales growth. So I would say, again, we don't disclose individual product lines, but I would say that GlobalView sales were one of the stronger line items, I think, for us. 
And I'll add that to your question about differences between the businesses, I think all of our businesses really performed well. It's kind of hard. It really comes down to trying to point out which ones were spectacular versus just good. And I would say that GlobalView and even our international business really were standouts. And really, it's very impressive because some of the situations in Europe, for example, were very challenging in terms of dealing with the pandemic, but I didn't really stop people from looking for solutions and it didn't stop our sales force from finding them even though they had to do that from -- obviously, from a remote workplace.

So it feels to us like this is a multiyear cycle here where employers are going to be really scrambling to find people, and I think that generally creates conversation opportunities. 
So we don't have a magic formula necessary -- necessarily, and we're not a staffing firm, but we do have tools and we have technology and we have people that can help our clients be more competitive as they look for solutions as they look for the right employees in the right place at the right time at the right pay level. That's our sweet spot. And so I'd say we're right in the middle of this, what I would call, super cycle of demand for labor that is probably short term related to kind of friction where people are just not in the right places and  people are probably also -- there's some hesitations still. There's issues with child care and elder care. There's a number of factors. It is -- we assume like other economists that this will be -- that part will be transitory, but that the need for people will not be given just the, obviously, low unemployment rate, which we will be at by the end of, call it, calendar year '22."

So I think some of this is really about us being able to adapt, which is our job, to what the market wants, right, what the clients want and what the prospects want. 
And the fact of the matter is that about half of our -- half of the workforce out there, which probably translates into half of our clients, they actually kept going to workplaces. They kept making things, delivering things and going to workplaces. The rest of the -- some of us white-collar employees didn't. So that segment of the prospects and clients, they expect us to be available if they want us to meet with them in person. We're not going to go force anyone to meet in person we're happy to meet them they want to be met, whether it's virtually online or in person. But we want to be ready for whatever the market once and whatever the market demands, and that's exactly our plan. But to answer your question, it's really hard to know which factor is the most important factor. We think that being able and willing and available to meet in person with prospects is an important element of our sales success for fiscal '22, but I can't really put a number on it because we were successful in '21 without doing that."

I think Kathleen may probably have a little bit of additional color, but I would tell you that this -- I think your insinuation that the PPP loans may have something to do with these elevated retention rates is something that we've heard kind of out there in terms of as a buzz. And again, that's very hard to like put our finger on in terms of how to quantify that and what's the impact. But for sure, one of the strongest areas we've had in retention is our downmarket business. And that is why I think we've prudently planned for some give-back on that next year. 
Having said that, I would tell you that this year, fiscal '21,  and the 2 months before that, we're probably the greatest example of ADP's business model in terms of ability to deliver, we call it service, you can call it compliance, call it whatever you want. But when the chips were down and people needed help and needed to talk to someone about their PPP loan and they weren't calling their banker. They didn't have to apply for a loan and they did have to go through a bank, but you can go do your own channel checks to see how many banks were actually answering the phone or giving people advice because they were completely overwhelmed as we were, but we actually figured out a way to handle it. And we were there for our clients. And so I think that what we just did over the last year, and I get it, I'm a pragmatist, so memories are short, and we have to continue to impress and continue to deliver for our clients. But I think we just proved to hundreds of thousands of clients and, hopefully, to prospects from a reputation standpoint, that if you want to have someone who's a partner at ADP, if you want software, you can buy software. But if you want great technology and great software, but you want someone who's going to be able to deliver on the service side, then you should be with ADP. 
And so I think that, that is going to have some -- there's going to be some factor in hopefully allowing us to hold on to some of this retention on a more permanent basis because I think the -- when the chips were down, I think people saw the difference between not having someone that you could get help from and having someone that you can reach out to and get advice and get your problems solved. But the bottom line is we clearly are prudent and aware that some of this normalization could result in some lower retention rates, particularly in the down market as you are, I think, alluding to."

We saw it inch a little bit higher there as well, too. So pretty much strong across the board. 
But look, we want to be prudent from a planning perspective. And while we haven't seen any change yet in terms of switching or along those lines, I do think it's prudent to plan that there's going to be, I'll call it, a little bit of giveback in fiscal '22. I think we are going to hold on to some of the gains. We're certainly attempting to do that. We want to do that. But I do think it's prudent to plan for a little bit of giveback, which we've done, and that would be primarily with regard to Small Business segment normalizing back to prepandemic levels."

So let me just start off with that comment. And part of that is that we're always trying to balance short-term and long-term investors. I'm not sure which ones you were hearing from. But our intent here is to continue the machine, right, and the momentum that has led to multiple decades here of compounded growth and creation of value over a very long period of time, and that requires delivering short-term results as well as long-term results. And those long-term results, I think, require some investment, including on the R&D side. But in particular, this year, really, the biggest factor is selling expense and sales investment, which has happened to us in the past. So we've had other times in, call it, 2000, 2001 or '02 and then '08, '09, '10 because I was around for those, where as we reaccelerate and take advantage of demand back to the secular growth opportunity, the way our business model works is we incur a lot of upfront selling and implementation expense. Now there are some accounting rules that allow you to defer some of that. But generally speaking, you get elevated selling expenses and implementation expenses and it's pretty significant. So I would say that, that is a significant part of what would have maybe otherwise been higher margins for '22. 
But when that business then is on the books, that's a high incremental margin business that then in '23, '24 and then for the next 12 to 13 years, that's how long we keep our clients on average, creates an annuity. So as you can imagine, we never turned down the incremental opportunity to add business, never, because of just the way the value creation model works. And we're going to make hay while the sun is shining here. And with 6%, 7% GDP growth last quarter and what's likely to be incredibly strong GDP in the next year or 2, we're going to take every possible opportunity. And unfortunately, that requires some selling expense and some implementation expense in addition to the ongoing investments in technology and some of the other things that we do."

The way to think about it is, look, we're going to have operating leverage to a greater extent in fiscal '22, obviously. But we've also got the investments that we want to continue to make, as Carlos just articulated, in product, in sales and in digital transformation importantly. And we do have some offsets. Carlos mentioned the sales expense. But we also have things like return to office and ramping up T&E versus what we were -- where we were in fiscal '21. Kind of all that goes into the mix. Net-net, we've got this 25 to 50 basis points margin expansion. We're going to do our best to deliver on that and continue to work our digital transformation, and it's possible to do even more."

So our revenue growth would have been almost 1 point higher our margin for this year in a pandemic would have been up 70 basis points instead of down 40 basis points had we not had that headwind. 
Now we did have a headwind. So it's always hard to say if we didn't have this and we didn't have that. But that's a pretty easy thing to isolate that has no operational -- nothing to do with operations. We have no control over, and we have to just ride that cyclical wave, which hopefully that cyclical wave is heading in a very positive direction for us over the next 2 to 3 years. But I just want to make sure you understood that because I think that tells you just how much control we have over our expenses and over our business model and over our long-term value creation objectives."

I think -- and again, I -- we probably have a couple of examples we could give of things that we've done over the last year, but it's usually a methodical multiyear approach to making our products -- like when we talk about innovation, innovation is partly about new business bookings but it's also about making our solutions easier to use and more intuitive. And you heard in our comments, and we shouldn't go -- over it, like the UX experience investments we've made in both RUN but now in some of our other platforms is a significant factor in today's world of whether or not a client sticks with you or not. 
So we get that. That's why however many years ago, we kind of got it and we said we need to become a technology company in addition to the services company that we are. And so I'd say, number one is you have to have great products. They have to be easy to use and they have to have no friction. That will help with retention. I think the other thing that I think you can point to are really just around availability. So our business model and our promise is not just technology and software, but it's to help with compliance, and it's to help with advice and is to provide expertise. And that really means that we have to have well-trained associates who are there to answer questions. Whether it's chat, whether it's by phone, it doesn't matter, however the client wants to reach us, but the stuff we do is complicated. And being an employer is complicated, and it requires help. And you can either get the help from us or you can call an attorney or you can call a consultant but most people do not just do this stuff on their own. And we happen to package the 2 things together, great technology with great service. So I'd say we have great technology and we have great service. We're going to be able to hold on to hopefully a lot of that improvement we've had in retention, even if we have a little bit of giveback in the down market."

So we have -- for example, we have a lot of data around -- like we track individual clients how many times they call. We actually can monitor. We have voice recognition that tells us certain keywords that people use when they're -- because we record all phone calls, and that really gives us deep insight into clients that are at risk. And then we have special teams that can follow up with those clients to make sure that whatever problem they have has been resolved. But that's -- I would call that trench warfare, which -- but if you want to get into those details, I can go in the trenches with you. But we have very deep analytical tools that really give us a lot of insight. 
For example, in our downmarket, I mean our clients don't call that often because, hopefully, they don't have problems very often because we do a nice job of preventing problems. But one of our small business clients has -- we detect has multiple calls in a month. That requires a reach-out to that client or a deeper investigation and a triage to make sure that we don't lose that client because that's usually a sign that there's something wrong with that client. And we have other techniques and other approaches and other tools to identify what we would call hotspots. We also monitor pricing very carefully. When we do our price changes, which I guess is code for price increases, we do that very carefully using a lot of analytical tools to make sure that we do that in the smartest possible way, if you will, to maximize retention."

I think that it's -- again, like a lot of things we've been saying over the last 2 or 3 years, some of these things are inevitable, are going to happen, and we're preparing for them. So things like real-time payroll, and this one that you're referring to is kind of one that we just heard over the last couple of days. That's something we've been thinking about for many, many years, and we have solutions where someone needs to get paid. Like, for example, in California, if someone is terminated from their job, you have to give them their final paycheck like immediately. And so that is difficult to do through the normal process. So we have solutions for that, that we've had for quite some time. And so I think the increasing popularity is probably more related to increasing discussion about it but also to technological advances that allow more options, right, in terms of instant payments and/or faster payments. So I would say the answer is yes. That is an important thing. And for certain sectors, like if you have a high turnover hourly workforce, your ability to provide that solution is crucial, but we have that ability to provide that solution. But you can't, for example, sell a client in California and not be able to provide instant pay upon termination. So it's -- you have to have that."

You -- again, you're right that I myself was surprised that there was an opportunity to do that and that we were able to execute on it, but we had one that I think we mentioned last year in the fourth quarter and kind of spilled a little bit over into the first quarter, but it was mostly, I think, fourth quarter. We had one the year before that, that was significant also in the fourth quarter. And this year, we've had a number of, what I would call, smaller ones, but they add up. And so I would say that the news there is good and is ongoing, and we've created a nice ability to do these conversions and make it good for us in terms of growth. 
And back to the question around cross-sell, we usually have a much broader set of solutions than other people that we are making these acquisitions from, which creates upside opportunity, right, in terms of value creation for us. On the kind of overall M&A comment side, I would say that we've -- where we've been most active is looking in some of our international locations and markets where I think we have very little market share, and we still have needs, for example, for add-on products, whereas in the U.S., we're not really looking to add additional platforms for either benefits or payroll and so forth. So it really has to be things that are adjacent, right, in the HCM space but not duplicative because, as you know, we've been on this kind of simplification push for many, many years and trying to build things organically and invest in technology organically. So that doesn't mean that we won't acquire because we have in a couple of years. We just haven't done anything for a couple of years, but we do welcome the opportunity to add additional ancillary as long as they fit into our technology road map and they're not disruptive or add-on, and we're not doing it just to get the ""revenue pop"". 
But on the international side, we typically don't have those factors at play as much, and that's a place where we're still excited and we still see a lot of greenfield opportunity to expand through M&A."

And when you head into this kind of economic environment, it's usually a positive secular tailwind for -- I guess, factor like some I don't like that word, but I would say that there have been positive secular trends for the PEO for 20 to 30 years. And then they can get enhanced, I think, by cyclical factors like a strong economy. So people sometimes say that the PEO will do well or outsourcing will do well when there's a recession because people are looking to save money. And that -- there is some truth to that, but it's not what the data supports or shows, right? It's usually when you have very strong economic growth and strong GDP and people are scrambling for talent, and they're competing for offering the right benefits, that's when PEOs and outsourcing tend to I think, do better. 
So I would say that based on experience, which you have to discount because we just went through a pandemic, so most of our experiences, we should park somewhere outside the door because we may end up being wrong. But all things being equal, this kind of economic environment is usually very strong for the PEO. 
And as for the last 18 months, what we saw there is it's a long cycle sale, and it's a high involvement decision. So I think we've been clear that we've had good -- great results there from a booking standpoint and probably better than we would have thought was possible but definitely not as strong as yet in kind of the early stages of the recovery of our bookings. We expect that to reverse, and that is our plan in '22. In other words, we expect very strong bookings and strong recovery on the PEO. And we're seeing some signs of that in the fourth quarter because what happened is in this kind of hunkering down mode, we saw very high retention in our PEO but not as much. It was more difficult to sell new clients, but the existing clients, I mean it was unbelievable value that we delivered to them because it was beyond just PPP loans. It was how do I downsize my workforce or how do I put people on furlough and what are the rules in this state around benefits. I mean our people were busy. I mean all of our people over all of ADP were busy this year, while maybe other people were less busy but our people were busy. And in the PEO, they were extra busy. So I think that, that bodes well. And those anecdotal stories and that reputation along with kind of some of these cyclical tailwinds, I think, bode well for the PEO here in the next year or 2."

We think we mentioned in our prepared comments, but our non-PEO HRO solutions, so these would be kind of mid-market and upmarket outsourcing solutions that are what I would call more comprehensive, if you will, really were probably one of the real highlights. And I think that was, again related probably to people realizing probably within months after the pandemic that like this stuff is hard to do, especially if you have to pivot very quickly, right? You have to make sure your systems are still up. Like you can't have a server in a closet somewhere that you're using to run payroll because you still do this internally. And then people who go to the office to key in the payroll is like this stuff, there's just a lot of people all of a sudden we woke up and realized from a business continuity standpoint and from a support standpoint, I need help, and it needs to be more than just the software, right, and basic service. So these HRO solutions really were an incredible bright spot. 
And then I think Kathleen mentioned our up market and our ESI bookings results were also very, very strong. Yes, new business formation helped in the down market.

So -- but first and foremost, I'm just so glad that despite, obviously, we have some short-term challenges here with the new Delta variant and so forth, but I mean, clearly, we're heading in the right direction, and we're very optimistic both for ourselves, for our families and for our associates and for our clients, and we look forward to better times ahead here over the next couple of quarters where inevitably, we'll have some ups and downs area some challenges here and there, but it's great that everything is on the right track, at least in the United States.

We reported very strong fourth quarter results, including 11% revenue growth and 5% adjusted diluted EPS growth, capping a year in which revenue and margin outperformed our expectations in every quarter. For the full year, we delivered 3% revenue growth, the high end of our guidance range. And I'm happy to say we reached $15 billion in revenue, a big milestone for the company.
As we've discussed all year, we took a consistent approach to investing this year while also prudently managing expenses. As a result, our adjusted EBIT margin was down only slightly, and we were able to deliver 2% adjusted diluted EPS growth for the year, ahead of our guidance and well ahead of our expectations at the start of the year.
I'll first cover some highlights from the quarter. Our new business bookings results were very strong, and our momentum in the market continues to build. Compared to last year's fourth quarter, we grew our Employer Services new business bookings by 174%, which was slightly ahead of our expectations. And for the full year, we delivered 23% growth in ES bookings, towards the higher end of our guidance. We are very pleased with this outcome from our sales team, which booked $1.5 billion in new business in a year with a high degree of economic uncertainty. This full year ES bookings performance represented an average quota carrier productivity level of roughly 90% of our fiscal 2019 pre-pandemic levels when we delivered $1.6 billion in ES bookings. 
And our sales productivity continued to trend favorably in Q4. At this point, most of our U.S. PEO quota carriers have conducted some in-person meetings, and we expect that to keep trending positively as our clients and prospects show increasing preference for doing so. We also reopened additional sales offices in this quarter, and our current plan is to have most of our major U.S. sales offices back open by the end of September.
Our retention was likewise an area of very strong performance with better-than-expected fourth quarter results. Our ES segment experienced a full year increase of 170 basis points to a record 92.2% retention. Our PEO segment also experienced record retention for the year. And as we've seen all year long, client satisfaction remained incredibly high. Kathleen will share how we have approached our assumptions for next year's retention, but in Q4, the trends remained strong.
In addition to impressive retention performance, our PEO continued to benefit from the overall resilience of our client base. And in the quarter, we had 12% revenue growth, driving us to 7% full year growth, which was ahead of our expectations and guidance. This was a result of record retention as well as stronger hiring and payroll trends within our PEO, which we believe reflects the very high quality of our client base.
And our ES pays-per-control turned positive in the quarter with 8% growth. This was in line with our expectations, and we continue to see some gradual rehiring amid what seems like a supply-constrained labor market. For the full year, we ended up rounding to negative 3% pays-per-control growth, right in the middle of our guidance range and the assumption that we held all year long.
During the quarter, we also continued to advance our market-leading solutions and achieved some new milestones I'd like to highlight. I'm excited to announce that this quarter, we launched and began rolling out a new user experience for RUN, representing the most comprehensive refresh we've done since its launch. RUN is already the leading solution in the market with 750,000 clients that use it to help with payroll, time, HR, insurance, retirement and other means. It's a powerful HCM product, and we look forward to maintaining its positive momentum. We're also looking forward to rolling out similar UX refreshes on our other major platforms in the near future.
This year, we also made a number of enhancements to our workforce management solutions. Workforce management, which includes time, attendance and scheduling offerings, represents one of the most critical parts of our HCM suite. This year, we launched timekeeping plus scheduling, an entirely new native solution for the RUN platform. And for our Workforce Now platform, we rolled out advanced scheduling, enabling clients to perform more complex workforce management tasks such as skills-based scheduling. I'm also proud to share that this quarter, we reached 100,000 workforce management clients for the first time as the pandemic reinforced the need for robust workforce management solutions for our clients while they navigate the new norm of increasingly flexible schedules and work arrangements.
Our suite of HRO solutions also continued to deliver steady growth for us this year. I already mentioned the strength in our PEO business, which had its average worksite employee count grow to 616,000, up 12% from last year's count and which now serves 14,500 businesses. And in addition to these employees covered by our PEO, we have over 2 million client employees on our other HRO solutions within our Employer Services segment where we've seen robust demand all year long as clients look for ways to outsource parts of their HR function to a best-in-class provider like ADP.
Also, this quarter, we enhanced our return to Workplace suite by adding a vaccination status tracker, allowing our clients to easily assess and track vaccinations within their workforces to facilitate planning decisions. Our clients continue to appreciate the efforts we've made to help them navigate the pandemic.
And our Next Gen agenda continued to progress nicely. Our Next Gen HCM platform continues to deliver competitive takeaways in the market. During the quarter, we also expanded our global footprint by going live in Ireland. And in the U.S., we are quickly adding to our implementation capacity for our pipeline of sold clients.
For Next Gen Payroll, we've now sold over 1,000 Next Gen Payroll clients on Workforce Now. And Roll by ADP, which also utilizes our Next Gen Payroll engine, is off to a great start where we are running ahead of our expectations so far as we drive micro businesses to this mobile-first solution.
And as a final highlight, we ended the year with over 920,000 clients, up 7% from the 860,000 we had a year ago and no doubt supported by these continuous improvements we've been making to our product portfolio.
I have to say that fiscal 2021 stood out as one of the most challenging years in ADP's history, and I'm very proud of how we executed. It's hard to overstate the amount of effort took across the organization to quickly adopt and manage through the pandemic while providing excellent service to our clients. And in the end, our organization and financial results both demonstrated the extraordinary resilience that is expected from us.
As we look ahead to fiscal 2022 and beyond, our focus is on reaccelerating our growth through an intense focus on market-leading innovation, further simplification of our product portfolio, continued digital transformation and an unwavering commitment to best-in-class service.
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Kathleen for more detail on the quarter and outlook."

Our fourth quarter represented a strong close to the year with 11% revenue growth on a reported basis and 9% growth on an organic constant currency basis, solidly ahead of our expectations. Our adjusted EBIT margin was down 120 basis points, better than expected. And as a reminder, we did have some comparison pressure versus last year's lower selling and incentive compensation expenses that drove the comparative decline. Our 5% adjusted diluted EPS growth was strong and in addition to the revenue and margin performance, benefited from share repurchases.
For our Employer Services segment, revenues increased 10% on a reported basis and 8% on an organic constant currency basis as we lapped last year's pandemic-affected Q4. We continued to see contributions from excellent retention, strong new business bookings and growth in pays-per-control, offset by lower client funds interest. ES margin was down 90 basis points due primarily to higher selling and incentive compensation expenses versus the prior year.
Our PEO also had another very strong quarter. Average worksite employees increased to 616,000, up 12% on a year-over-year basis on both continued retention outperformance and contribution from solid employment growth. Our PEO revenue grew 12%, an impressive performance as we once again benefited from higher payroll per WSE as well as stronger workers' comp and SUI revenue per WSE compared to the prior year, partially offset by lower growth in 0 margin pass-throughs. PEO margin was up 340 basis points in the quarter due to an elevated workers' compensation reserve true-up last year.
We are very pleased with our strong finish to the year. For fiscal 2021, a year heavily impacted by a pandemic, we drove strong bookings growth, solid 3% revenue growth, delivered positive EPS growth and continued to invest for sustainable growth and digital transformation.
I'll turn now to our outlook for fiscal '22. Beginning with ES segment revenues, we expect growth of 4% to 6%, and this outlook is a product of several underlying assumptions. We expect our ES new business bookings growth to be 10% to 15%. This strong growth would be driven by 2 factors: sales headcount growth, which we typically aim to do; and benefits from continuing recovery in sales productivity as we trend back to and surpass pre-pandemic levels by the back half of the year.
Please note, beginning this year, we will no longer be reporting our Employer Services new business bookings growth on a quarterly basis. Instead, we will focus on our full year bookings growth, which better normalizes for the inherent variability in this metric. This also aligns to how we focus internally on bookings trends over a full year period. We'll, of course, continue to update the full year bookings guidance quarterly. And as we do so, we'll continue to provide color on our quarterly ES bookings performance. We believe our annual bookings disclosure and guidance remains an industry best practice.
Moving on to ES retention. We are not yet seeing any specific indications from our clients that we should expect an increase in switching behavior. However, we believe it is prudent planning to expect that a portion of the retention gains we saw over fiscal 2021 will reverse as companies reopen and reengage in the marketplace.
For the purpose of our outlook, our initial assumption is that we'll experience a decline of about 75 basis points for the year, representing just under half of last year's improvement. If this proves out, our resulting fiscal '22 retention rate would still be a record compared to pre-pandemic levels. But as I think we all can appreciate, there is still uncertainty in this environment given the unusual year we just experienced, and we believe this to be a prudent middle-of-the-road assumption to make. We will update you in the quarters ahead as we gain further visibility, particularly during the calendar year-end period where we've historically seen the most switching.
Our pays-per-control outlook for fiscal '22 is for 4% to 5% growth and above normal growth rate that assumes a continued gradual recovery in the overall labor market. Labor markets appear to be tight at the moment, but we do expect overall employment to continue trending in a favorable direction from where we are today.
And then for our client funds interest revenue, most of which sits in the ES segment, we expect some modest pressure. The interest rate environment remains favorable to what we were experiencing earlier -- in the earlier part of the pandemic. But we are still expecting to reinvest at lower yields than what we are earning on securities that are maturing this coming year.
We are also providing for the first time an added disclosure for our expected average yield on new purchases for the remainder of the fiscal year, which we believe to be useful for you in understanding the direction our average portfolio yield is headed as the portfolio turns over. Currently, that expectation is for a 1% yield on new purchases.
All this said, we are expecting balanced growth of 8% to 10% and an average yield of 1.4% versus 1.5% last year. Together, this would net us $405 million to $415 million in client funds interest revenue for fiscal 2022.
For our ES margin, we expect an increase of 50 to 75 basis points, and there are a few factors considered in this outlook. As a starting point, we are benefiting more fully from operating leverage in fiscal '22 than we did last year while also recognizing higher sales expenses and continuing our steady investment in product, implementation and service. Additionally, we expect incremental margin benefit from the continuation of our digital and other transformation initiatives in fiscal '22 as we continue to increase the utilization of digital tools to improve efficiencies throughout the organization. However, the benefit from our transformation initiatives is expected to be largely offset by a year-over-year increase in facilities and other return-to-office expenses as well as higher T&E expenses.
Moving on to the PEO segment. We expect PEO revenues to grow 9% to 11% and PEO revenues excluding 0 margin pass-through to grow 10% to 12%. The primary driver for our PEO revenue growth is our outlook for average worksite employee growth of 9% to 11%. We expect PEO margin to be down 25 to 75 basis points in fiscal 2022 compared to the very strong margin results in fiscal 2021. This is driven partly by an assumption for stronger sales growth and associated selling expenses.
Putting it together, our consolidated revenue outlook is for 6% to 7% growth in fiscal '22, and our adjusted EBIT margin outlook is for expansion of 25 to 50 basis points. At this time, because of some comparison differences in the prior year, we expect the first quarter to have revenue growth just above the guidance range with the remaining 3 quarters in the range.
We expect adjusted EBIT margin flat to down slightly in the first half, with most of the margin expansion coming in the later part of the year. We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal '22 to improve very slightly to about 22.5% next year, assuming no change in the corporate tax rate. Our outlook also reflects the impact of additional corporate interest expense.
During our fourth quarter, we enhanced our capital structure by issuing $1 billion in 7-year notes, the proceeds of which we're planning to use for additional accretive share repurchases over the coming quarters. This added about $3 million in interest expense in fiscal '21 with a full run rate of about $18 million in fiscal '22. At the same time, we're also contemplating further reduction in our share count beyond the typical level we would have expected to achieve driven by these incremental share repurchases. Net of this higher interest expense, lower tax rate and additional share repurchases, we expect growth in adjusted diluted EPS of 9% to 11%.
As we enter fiscal year '22, despite the continuing challenges around the pandemic, we are very encouraged by the signs of a continued recovery in the global economy as well as the ongoing secular growth trends in HCM. As the world of work evolves, we believe we are very well positioned to continue adding value for our clients and differentiating ourselves in the market. We look forward to updating you on our progress.
I'll now turn it back over to the operator for Q&A."

Kathleen probably has a couple of other she can mention. But like I think we mentioned in our prepared remarks, what we're seeing around workforce management in terms of time tracking and scheduling and so forth, we also mentioned some of the products we've developed for return to workplace. So there are a number of things that are probably related to what's likely to be a more hybrid work environment for white-collar employees at least on a go-forward basis, which probably requires people to think about their investments in HCM in terms of what they can do to maximize the recruiting and the retention and engagement of that hybrid workforce. So I think that is one.
The other one is there's always been a secular uptrend in terms of regulatory-related, and this is on a global basis, demand for HCM products. In other words, the more complexity there is around being an employer, the greater the demand for the wide array of services that we provide. That secular trend has probably gotten a bit of a boost based on, in the U.S., the change in administrations, right, which -- we've had that secular growth for 7 years that ADP has existed. But there are times where it's stronger in terms of a tailwind and sometimes where it's weaker. And I would say that we're heading into strong secular tailwinds here as a result of some of the increased attention on regulatory actions.
And you probably all saw, I think it was yesterday or the day before, that the President signed a number of executive orders, most of which are aimed at employer-employee-related relationships that increase the amount of tracking and of reporting and of compliance necessary on the part of employers. So those are a couple that I would mention.
I think our retention rate also shows, in an indirect way, secular demand improving, right, in the sense that people have kind of rethought dropping or switching from their HCM vendors. But that one is a little difficult to be 100% sure about because we do expect some normalization in that retention rate."

I think that really covers a lot of it. I mean to kind of summarize and categorize what Carlos said, when you think about the complexity, number one, of being an employer, the ongoing and pretty significant changes that we see from a regulatory standpoint, so complexity, regulatory change, the dynamic environment as the way people work and employer-employer relationship -- employer-employee relationship changes, it's a very dynamic environment. All of that is -- you can just see in the bookings number that we have.
Our bookings, and I'm sure we'll get into the discussion on this, but the growth is pretty broad-based. I mean, certainly, we saw some channels stronger than others, but it's pretty broad-based. And I think that's because of all of the dynamic change and complexity that we see. And in particular, our comprehensive solution, our outsourcing solutions have seen quite significant growth. So we're really encouraged about the macro trends that we see in the space."

So actually, I could probably give you 3 that would probably account for kind of the way we think about this. So number one, obviously, is what we just talked about is the secular and cyclical tailwinds or headwinds. So if the economy continues with the momentum it's got, we're feeling pretty good. Obviously, if we end up having more challenges because of the pandemic or otherwise, but right now, the amount of -- even the existing government stimulus, even if there's no additional stimulus, is pretty strong and also the pent-up demand and all these -- the reopening, that feels like a very good backdrop for us from a bookings growth standpoint.
And then as long as we have that background or that backdrop that's positive, it really comes down to really 2 things, is sales force productivity at the sales quota carrier level times number of sales quota carriers. And I hate to be so simplistic, but at our size, because we have new products and we're rolling out -- you heard how excited we are about all the new things that we're putting out there, but we sell a lot of business every year. So for a smaller company, when they end up having like a new product launch, that can cause all kinds of growth -- and by the way, likewise, if you don't have any new products, but for us, what I would consider to be a steady eddy. So we really grow through methodically improving and adding new products, making tuck-in acquisitions, et cetera, a lot of those. But the key formula for us is we cannot hit our sales plan unless we have the headcount and we are continually improving our sales force productivity, and that's exactly what our plan is.
And we had some good news over the last 4 quarters where our sales force productivity at the average quota carrier level steadily improved throughout the year to reach 90% for the full year, but we exited the fourth quarter in kind of the mid-90s, if you will, in comparison to pre-pandemic level.
So it feels like we're getting back to ""trend"" from an average sales productivity standpoint. And if we can get back to that trend and we deliver on our headcount additions, we should be able to hit our new business bookings number."

So one of the -- in case somebody asked that we -- one of the questions we sometimes get is -- and it's related to what you're asking is the mix of how much is new logo sales versus how much is add-on sales. And it's really been very steady over many years. It was only during the ACA period where we had a little bit of a tilt more towards incremental add-on sales, but it's for a long time been around 50-50, and it's still kind of in that neighborhood. So that, I think, bodes well because the more clients we add, the more opportunities we have to pursue that land-and-expand, I think, approach that you just described.
So I would say that we're bullish on the opportunity to continue to go back to the new logos that we sold, which, in many cases, we sell with multiple modules, but there's always additional room for new products as well to go back to that existing client base. So I think that underlying logo growth, I think, is another kind of supportive factor, if you will, for our new business bookings because we do get about 50% of our bookings from our existing client base."

Maybe we may have confused some people, I think, in prior calls, but I think GlobalView's probably -- could be at the top of our list in terms of performance this year.

There's a lot of factors that probably went into what was incredibly strong demand and very positive sales growth. So I would say -- again, we don't disclose individual product lines, but I would say that GlobalView sales were one of the stronger line items, I think, for us.
And I'll add that to your question about differences between the businesses, I think all of our businesses really performed well. It's kind of hard. It really comes down to trying to point out which ones were spectacular versus just good. And I would say that GlobalView and even our international business really were standouts. And really, it's very impressive because some of the situations in Europe, for example, were very challenging in terms of dealing with the pandemic, but it didn't really stop people from looking for solutions and it didn't stop our sales force from finding them even though they had to do that from -- obviously, from a remote workplace.

But it does seem like if this kind of resolves itself, there's a couple of scenarios. But if it's transitory in terms of the friction of getting people into the right jobs, and then 6 months from now, some of this has passed, by the time we get to that point, unemployment might be down in the kind of a 4% to 5% range, which then creates a whole another wave of needs for employers in terms of finding talent and kind of fighting for talent. So it feels to us like this is a multiyear cycle here where employers are going to be really scrambling to find people, and I think that generally creates conversation opportunities.
So we don't have a magic formula necessary -- necessarily, and we're not a staffing firm, but we do have tools and we have technology and we have people that can help our clients be more competitive as they look for solutions, as they look for the right employees in the right place at the right time at the right pay level. That's our sweet spot.
And so I'd say we're right in the middle of this, what I would call, super cycle of demand for labor that is probably short term related to kind of friction where people are just not in the right places and people are probably also -- there's some hesitations still. There's issues with child care and elder care. There's a number of factors. It is -- we assume like other economists that this will be -- that part will be transitory, but that the need for people will not be given just the, obviously, low unemployment rate, which we will be at by the end of, call it, calendar year '22."

So I think some of this is really about us being able to adapt, which is our job, to what the market wants, right, what the clients want and what the prospects want.
And the fact of the matter is that about half of our -- half of the workforce out there, which probably translates into half of our clients, they actually kept going to workplaces. They kept making things, delivering things and going to workplaces. The rest of the -- some of us white-collar employees didn't. So that segment of the prospects and clients, they expect us to be available if they want us to meet with them in person. We're not going to go force anyone to meet in person. We're happy to meet them where they want to be met, whether it's virtually online or in person. But we want to be ready for whatever the market wants and whatever the market demands, and that's exactly our plan.

I think Kathleen may probably have a little bit of additional color, but I would tell you that this -- I think your insinuation that the PPP loans may have something to do with these elevated retention rates is something that we've heard kind of out there in terms of as a buzz. And again, that's very hard to like put our finger on in terms of how to quantify that and what's the impact. But for sure, one of the strongest areas we've had in retention is our downmarket business. And that is why I think we've prudently planned for some giveback on that next year.
Having said that, I would tell you that this year, fiscal '21, and the 2 months before that, were probably the greatest example of ADP's business model in terms of ability to deliver. We call it service, you can call it compliance, you can call it whatever you want. But when the chips were down and people needed help and needed to talk to someone about their PPP loan, they weren't calling their banker, they didn't have to apply for a loan and they didn't have to go through a bank, but you can go do your own channel checks to see how many banks were actually answering the phone or giving people advice because they were completely overwhelmed as we were, but we actually figured out a way to handle it. And we were there for our clients.
And so I think that what we just did over the last year -- and I get it, I'm a pragmatist, so memories are short, and we have to continue to impress and continue to deliver for our clients. But I think we just proved to hundreds of thousands of clients and, hopefully, to prospects from a reputation standpoint that if you want to have someone who's a partner at ADP, if you want software, you can buy software. But if you want great technology and great software, but you want someone who's going to be able to deliver on the service side, then you should be with ADP.
And so I think that, that is going to have some -- there's going to be some factor in hopefully allowing us to hold on to some of this retention on a more permanent basis because I think the -- when the chips were down, I think people saw the difference between not having someone that you could get help from and having someone that you can reach out to and get advice and get your problems solved. But the bottom line is we clearly are prudent and aware that some of this normalization could result in some lower retention rates, particularly in the down market as you are, I think, alluding to."

We saw it inch a little bit higher there as well, too. So pretty much strong across the board.
But look, we want to be prudent from a planning perspective. And while we haven't seen any change yet in terms of switching or -- along those lines, I do think it's prudent to plan that there's going to be, I'll call it, a little bit of giveback in fiscal '22. I think we are going to hold on to some of the gains. We're certainly attempting to do that. We want to do that.

So let me just start off with that comment. And part of that is that we're always trying to balance short-term and long-term investors. I'm not sure which ones you were hearing from. But our intent here is to continue the machine, right, and the momentum that has led to multiple decades here of compounded growth and creation of value over a very long period of time, and that requires delivering short-term results as well as long-term results. And those long-term results, I think, require some investment, including on the R&D side.
But in particular, this year, really, the biggest factor is selling expense and sales investment, which has happened to us in the past. So we've had other times in, call it, 2000, 2001 or '02 and then '08, '09, '10, because I was around for those, where as we reaccelerate and take advantage of demand back to the secular growth opportunity, the way our business model works is we incur a lot of upfront selling and implementation expense. Now there are some accounting rules that allow you to defer some of that. But generally speaking, you get elevated selling expenses and implementation expenses, and it's pretty significant. So I would say that, that is a significant part of what would have maybe otherwise been higher margins for '22. But when that business then is on the books, that's a high incremental margin business that then in '23, '24 and then for the next 12 to 13 years, that's how long we keep our clients on average, creates an annuity.
So as you can imagine, we never turn down the incremental opportunity to add business, never, because of just the way the value creation model works. And we're going to make hay while the sun is shining here. And with 6%, 7% GDP growth last quarter and what's likely to be incredibly strong GDP in the next year or 2, we're going to take every possible opportunity. And unfortunately, that requires some selling expense and some implementation expense in addition to the ongoing investments in technology and some of the other things that we do."

So just big picture, the way to think about margin for next year, and we're very happy that we're able to kind of guide to this 25 to 50 basis points of margin expansion, I mean, look, we always look to do better than the plan, but that's what we're comfortable with right now. The way to think about it is, look, we're going to have operating leverage to a greater extent in fiscal '22, obviously. But we've also got the investments that we want to continue to make, as Carlos just articulated, in product, in sales and in digital transformation importantly. And we do have some offsets. Carlos mentioned the sales expense. But we also have things like return to office and ramping up T&E versus what we were -- where we were in fiscal '21.
So kind of all that goes into the mix. Net-net, we've got this 25 to 50 basis points margin expansion. We're going to do our best to deliver on that and continue to work our digital transformation, and it's possible to do even more."

So our revenue growth would have been almost 1 point higher, and our margin for this year in a pandemic would have been up 70 basis points instead of down 40 basis points had we not had that headwind.
Now we did have a headwind. So it's always hard to say if we didn't have this and we didn't have that. But that's a pretty easy thing to isolate that has no operational -- nothing to do with operations. We have no control over, and we have to just ride that cyclical wave, which hopefully that cyclical wave is heading in a very positive direction for us over the next 2 to 3 years. But I just want to make sure you understood that because I think that tells you just how much control we have over our expenses and over our business model and over our long-term value creation objectives."

I think -- and again, I -- we probably have a couple of examples we could give of things that we've done over the last year, but it's usually a methodical multiyear approach to making our products -- like when we talk about innovation, innovation is partly about new business bookings, but it's also about making our solutions easier to use and more intuitive. And you heard in our comments, and we shouldn't gloss over it, like the UX experience investments we've made in both RUN but now in some of our other platforms is a significant factor in today's world of whether or not a client sticks with you or not.
So we get that. That's why however many years ago, we kind of got it and we said we need to become a technology company in addition to the services company that we are. And so I'd say, number one is you have to have great products. They have to be easy to use and they have to have no friction. That will help with retention.
I think the other thing that I think you can point to are really just around availability. So our business model and our promise is not just technology and software, but it's to help with compliance and it's to help with advice and it's to provide expertise. And that really means that we have to have well-trained associates who are there to answer questions, whether it's chat, whether it's by phone, it doesn't matter, however the client wants to reach us. But the stuff we do is complicated. And being an employer is complicated, and it requires help. And you can either get the help from us or you can call an attorney or you can call a consultant, but most people do not just do this stuff on their own. And we happen to package the 2 things together, great technology with great service. So I'd say if we have great technology and we have great service, we're going to be able to hold on to hopefully a lot of that improvement we've had in retention, even if we have a little bit of giveback in the downmarket."

So we have -- for example, we have a lot of data around -- like we track individual clients how many times they call. We actually can monitor. We have voice recognition that tells us certain keywords that people use when they're -- because we record all phone calls, and that really gives us deep insight into clients that are at risk. And then we have special teams that can follow up with those clients to make sure that whatever problem they have has been resolved. But that's -- I would call that trench warfare, which -- but if you want to get into those details, I can go in the trenches with you. But we have very deep analytical tools that really give us a lot of insight.
For example, in our downmarket, I mean our clients don't call that often because, hopefully, they don't have problems very often because we do a nice job of preventing problems. But one of our small business clients has -- we detect has multiple calls in a month. That requires a reach-out to that client or a deeper investigation and a triage to make sure that we don't lose that client because that's usually a sign that there's something wrong with that client. And we have other techniques and other approaches and other tools to identify what we would call hotspots.
We also monitor pricing very carefully. When we do our price changes, which I guess is code for price increases, we do that very carefully using a lot of analytical tools to make sure that we do that in the smartest possible way, if you will, to maximize retention."

I think that it's -- again, like a lot of things we've been saying over the last 2 or 3 years, some of these things are inevitable, are going to happen, and we're preparing for them. So things like real-time payroll, and this one that you're referring to is kind of one that we just heard over the last couple of days. That's something we've been thinking about for many, many years, and we have solutions where someone needs to get paid -- like, for example, in California, if someone is terminated from their job, you have to give them their final paycheck like immediately. And so that is difficult to do through the normal process. So we have solutions for that, that we've had for quite some time.
So I think the increasing popularity is probably more related to increasing discussion about it but also to technological advances that allow more options, right, in terms of instant payments and/or faster payments. So I would say the answer is yes, that is an important thing. And for certain sectors, like if you have a high turnover hourly workforce, your ability to provide that solution is crucial, but we have that ability to provide that solution. But you can't, for example, sell a client in California and not be able to provide instant pay upon termination. So it's -- you have to have that."

You -- again, you're right that I myself was surprised that there was an opportunity to do that and that we were able to execute on it. But we had one that I think we mentioned last year in the fourth quarter and kind of spilled a little bit over into the first quarter, but it was mostly, I think, fourth quarter. We had one the year before that, that was significant also in the fourth quarter. And this year, we've had a number of, what I would call, smaller ones, but they add up. And so I would say that the news there is good and is ongoing, and we've created a nice ability to do these conversions and make it good for us in terms of growth.
And back to the question around cross-sell, we usually have a much broader set of solutions than other people that we are making these acquisitions from, which creates upside opportunity, right, in terms of value creation for us.
On the kind of overall M&A comment side, I would say that we've -- where we've been most active is looking in some of our international locations and markets where I think we have very little market share and we still have needs, for example, for add-on products, whereas in the U.S., we're not really looking to add additional platforms for either benefits or payroll and so forth. So it really has to be things that are adjacent, right, in the HCM space but not duplicative because, as you know, we've been on this kind of simplification push for many, many years and trying to build things organically and invest in technology organically. So that doesn't mean that we won't acquire because we have. In a couple of years -- we just haven't done anything for a couple of years, but we do welcome the opportunity to add additional ancillary as long as they fit into our technology road map and they're not disruptive or add-on, and we're not doing it just to get the ""revenue pop"". But on the international side, we typically don't have those factors at play as much, and that's a place where we're still excited and we still see a lot of greenfield opportunity to expand through M&A."

And when you head into this kind of economic environment, it's usually a positive secular tailwind for -- I guess back to like -- it's not that I don't like that word, but I would say that there have been positive secular trends for the PEO for 20 to 30 years. And then they can get enhanced, I think, by cyclical factors like a strong economy.
So people sometimes say that the PEO will do well or outsourcing will do well when there's a recession because people are looking to save money. And that -- there is some truth to that, but it's not what the data supports or shows, right? It's usually when you have very strong economic growth and strong GDP and people are scrambling for talent and they're competing for offering the right benefits. That's when PEOs and outsourcing tend to, I think, do better.
So I would say that based on experience, which you have to discount because we just went through a pandemic. So most of our experiences, we should park somewhere outside the door because we may end up being wrong. But all things being equal, this kind of economic environment is usually very strong for the PEO.
And as for the last 18 months, what we saw there is it's a long cycle sale and it's a high involvement decision. So I think we've been clear that we've had good, great results there from a booking standpoint and probably better than we would have thought was possible but definitely not as strong as ES in kind of the early stages of the recovery of our bookings.
We expect that to reverse, and that is our plan in '22. In other words, we expect very strong bookings and strong recovery on the PEO. And we're seeing some signs of that in the fourth quarter because what happened is in this kind of hunkering down mode, we saw very high retention in our PEO but not as much -- it was more difficult to sell new clients. But the existing clients, I mean, it was unbelievable value that we delivered to them because it was beyond just PPP loans. It was how do I downside my workforce or how do I put people on furlough and what are the rules in this state around benefits. I mean our people were busy. I mean all of our people, all of ADP were busy this year, while maybe other people were less busy, but our people were busy. And in the PEO, they were extra busy. So I think that, that bodes well. And those anecdotal stories and that reputation along with kind of some of these cyclical tailwinds, I think, bode well for the PEO here in the next year or 2."

And I think that was, again, related probably to people realizing probably within months after the pandemic that like this stuff is hard to do, especially if you have to pivot very quickly, right? You have to make sure your systems are still up. Like you can't have a server in a closet somewhere that you're using to run payroll because you still do this internally. And then people who go to the office to key in the payrolls like this stuff, there's just a lot of people all of a sudden woke up and realized from a business continuity standpoint and from a support standpoint, I need help, and it needs to be more than just a software, right, and basic service.

And we have a plan. I don't think it's really great for us to share it because I think competitors listen to these calls, too. But we have a very methodical plan to eventually get to 100% of our core sales being on Next Gen Payroll, while at the same time then gradually moving into the other parts of major accounts, call it, the 150 to 1,000 and then selling 100% of those clients onto Next Gen Payroll.
And then as we're going along, we will start some conversions. But it's not a huge priority because, again, remember, Workforce Now is the front end on both of these. And this is all intended to be transparent. This is not one of those migrations that you heard about 5, 7 years ago at ADP where we disrupt everything.

Don has been with ADP since 1998 when he joined the ADP Canada team as a VP of Finance. He's held a series of roles with increasing responsibility, most recently serving as President of our International business, where he's done a phenomenal job of driving growth and profitability in a very complex environment. I know he's looking forward to meeting all of you. 
Now moving on to the quarter. We are pleased to have delivered a very strong start to the year with 10% revenue growth and 140 basis points of margin expansion, resulting in a 17% increase in adjusted diluted EPS. While we did expect our Q1 revenue growth to be above our prior full year guidance range, this result was still above our initial forecast and underscores the strong position we are in as we emerge from the pandemic. I'll let Don go through the details after I cover some highlights. 
Our ES new business bookings results were very strong, representing another record Q1 bookings amount. And we're ahead of our expectations with outperformance driven by continued strength in our HR portfolio and our international business. With this impressive bookings performance across the enterprise, we're pleased to raise our ES bookings guidance for the year after just 1 quarter as we're now feeling even more confident about our sales momentum. 
Even stronger was our PEO bookings performance, which was also well ahead of our expectations and a key reason that we're raising our guidance for average worksite employee growth for the year, as Don will outline for you. As you will recall, we've been sharing our sales productivity trends over the course of the pandemic, and I'm pleased to report that in Q1, we were well above pre-pandemic levels. We reached this result several months sooner than we expected, and we expect this to continue as we look ahead. 
Our ES retention remained incredibly strong as well. As we shared last quarter, we believed it was reasonable to assume a slight step back in retention from the record 92.2% level we experienced last year. But in Q1, we did not see meaningful deterioration. 
Instead, we actually saw further improvement in our overall ES retention to a new record Q1 level despite a modest decline in our small business division, where out-of-business losses started to trend back to more normal levels compared to the below-normal levels last year. We're continuing to assume a slight decline in our retention outlook for the year. But clearly, we are pleased with our performance so far, and the upward revision in our retention outlook reflects the strong Q1 performance. 
Our ES pays per control was solid with 7% growth in the quarter, about in line with our expectations. We fielded a number of questions these past several months about what we think might drive workers back into the labor force. While we don't have an answer to that question, what we can tell you is that we continue to see positive trends. 
Our clients are eager to hire, and we are seeing workers return to the labor force, even if it's gradual. As a result, we expect to benefit from above-normal -- an above-normal level of pays-per-control growth over the course of the year. 
In addition to the very strong ES performance, our PEO delivered another stellar quarter with 15% revenue growth and 15% average worksite employee growth, even better than the high expectations we had coming into the quarter. There were multiple drivers to the outperformance in the PEO, including the strong level of hiring within the client base, resilient retention and the improved bookings performance I mentioned earlier. We're very pleased with the momentum we see building in the PEO, and we're raising our full year guidance accordingly. 
In addition to the financial highlights, there are a few product highlights I wanted to share with you. First, I'm excited to share that we completed the initial rollout of our new user experience for RUN. As we shared with you last quarter, this represents the most comprehensive refresh we've done since the launch of RUN. And we're very proud that in a matter of a quarter, we were able to seamlessly move hundreds of thousands of clients to a new and better user experience. 
Early signs indicate that client satisfaction scores should trend even higher than the record levels we already have in our small business division. So it's a really great outcome and represents a very strong execution by the team. 
I'd like to also share that at the annual HR Tech conference a few weeks ago, our innovative diversity, equity and inclusion tool on the DataCloud platform was named a top HR product. This recognition adds to ADP's long-standing history of award wins at the conference, marking an unprecedented seventh consecutive year ADP has been honored for its innovative HCM technology. 
You can probably tell from the number of times we've highlighted DataCloud that our velocity of innovation has increased significantly there. With this DE&I solution as an example, we've seen over 50% of active users of this solution take action and realize positive impact on their DE&I measures. 
I'm proud that we provide solutions that drive real positive change for our clients. This 7-year track record demonstrates that innovation is part of ADP's DNA and that we have a strong, growing, agile R&D team committed to delivering solutions in the market that continue to push the boundary of what HCM solutions can do for employers and their employees. 
As I said before, we're very pleased with the fantastic start to the year. We look forward to sharing even more of the ADP story with you at the upcoming Investor Day in November. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Don for more detail on the quarter and the outlook."

Our first quarter represented a strong start to the year with 10% revenue growth on both the reported and organic constant currency basis. Our adjusted EBIT margin was u",1300,"Thank you, Carlos, and to everyone on the call, good morning, and nice to meet you. Our first quarter represented a strong start to the year with 10% revenue growth on both the reported and organic constant currency basis. 
Our adjusted EBIT margin was up 140 basis points, much better than expected and was supported by higher revenue and overall cost containment. Our tax rate was up slightly in the quarter versus last year, but we also benefited from an elevated pace of share repurchases following our debt issuance in May. Combined, those factors contributed to a 17% increase in our adjusted diluted earnings per share. 
Moving on to the segments. Our Employer Services revenue increased 8% on a reported and organic constant currency basis. Our strong Q1 ES bookings performance and record retention contributed to this performance. Though as a reminder, we did continue to lap some of the lower revenues we had last year in some of our volume-related businesses, including recruiting and background screening. 
Our clients fund interest represented only a slight headwind in the quarter as our 40 point -- basis point decline in average yield was offset by fantastic balance growth of 22% driven by client growth, employment growth, higher wages and the lapping of the payroll tax deferral last year. ES margin increased 150 basis points on strong revenue performance and overall cost containment. 
As Carlos mentioned, our PEO had another terrific quarter. Average worksite employees increased 15% year-over-year to 629,000. And revenues, excluding 0-margin pass-throughs, grew 20%, supported once again by favorable mix trends within the PEO employee base as well as improving SUI rates. 
Total PEO revenue grew 15%, which included a modest drag from lower 0-margin pass-through growth and worksite employee growth as expected. PEO margin was up 70 basis points in the quarter driven by operating leverage. Overall, our Q1 results reflect a very strong start to the year and delivered ahead of our expectations on practically all fronts. 
Let me now turn to our updated outlook for fiscal 2022. For ES revenues, we now expect growth of 5% to 6%, which we're raising 50 basis points at the midpoint. This is driven by several underlying factors. 
We're raising our expected range of ES new bookings growth to 12% to 16%. As we mentioned, we had a better-than-expected performance in Q1 and reached pre-pandemic productivity earlier than we had forecasted. We haven't made significant changes to our rest of year outlook at this point, but if momentum remains as strong as we've seen it, then we may see opportunity to deliver additional upside. 
We're also raising our ES retention, and we are now assuming a decline of 50 basis points off of FY '21's all-time highs versus our prior outlook of a decline of 75 basis points. As with bookings, this is primarily a function of the strong Q1 performance. 
Our continued assumption is that as clients continue to reengage in the marketplace, we may experience a slight decline over the course of the year. We expect to have significantly more clarity once we get through the calendar year-end period, where we typically see most of the switching activity. 
For U.S. pays per control, we're making no change to our outlook of 4% to 5% growth. We continue to expect a gradual recovery in the overall labor market, and the 7% growth in Q1 was about in line with our expectations. 
And then for our client funds interest revenue, we're raising our outlook by about $15 million to a range of $420 million to $430 million as we're raising our balance growth assumptions by about 4% to growth of 12% to 14%. Our outlook for client funds yield, meanwhile, is unchanged despite the improvement in the yield environment primarily as our stronger balance performance actually created a temporary mix shift to overnight investments until new securities are gradually purchased. But that said, the favorable shift in the yield curve is clearly helpful to us and will certainly benefit our multiyear client funds outlook, all else equal. 
For ES margin, we now expect an increase of about 75 to 100 basis points, up from our prior range of 50 to 75 basis points. While we did outperform meaningfully on margin in Q1, we are also seeing some additional expenses over the rest of the year, including higher headcount in our outsourcing businesses. Meanwhile, we continue to expect transformation initiative benefits, including our digital transformation, to offset a year-over-year increase in facilities, T&E expenses and other return-to-office expenses. 
Moving on to the PEO. We now expect PEO revenues to grow 11% to 13%; average worksite employees to grow 11% to 13%; and revenues, excluding 0-margin pass-throughs, to grow 12% to 14%. This 2 percentage point raise across the board is a function of both our strong Q1 bookings and overall performance as well as an expectation from stronger hiring within our PEO base to contribute over the remainder of the year. 
Our PEO is very well positioned to capitalize on growing levels of client demand coming out of the pandemic. And if we continue to drive outsized booking performance over the rest of the year, that could represent further upside to our outlook. 
Following our strong start to the year, we now expect a range of flat to down 50 basis points for the year for an improvement from our prior expectation of down 70 -- 25 to 75 basis points on our margin. As a reminder, we are growing over a very strong margin result in fiscal 2021 and are also expecting elevated selling expenses this year from strong bookings performance. 
Turning it all together for our consolidated outlook. We now expect revenue to grow 7% to 8%. Following the strong 10% Q1 performance, we now expect the remaining quarters to grow closer to 7%, which is higher than our prior forecast. 
For adjusted EBIT margin, we now expect an increase of 50 to 75 basis points. As we shared last quarter, we expect our margin improvement to be back half-weighted, most specifically in the fourth quarter. Our current expectation is for a slight margin decline in Q2 and Q3. 
We're making no change to our tax rate assumption. And with these changes, we now expect growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share of 11% to 13%. 
As I think you've heard us say a couple of times now, we are very pleased with our Q1 results, and we're happy to be raising our guidance this early in the year. This is still a dynamic environment, and there are a wide range of potential outcomes. And we believe our guidance is appropriately balanced given these conditions. However, should our associates continue to drive better-than-expected sales results, client satisfaction, efficiency and service and implementation, we would see opportunity to deliver additional upside to our outlook. 
Before we move to Q&A, I wanted to share 2 things. First, I look forward to meeting everyone, perhaps virtually for now, but eventually in person as we get back out on the road to meet our shareholders and the investment community. 
And second is that we are very much looking forward to our upcoming Investor Day in a couple of weeks on November 15. Having run one of our largest businesses for years, I can tell you there is always much happening here at ADP on the ground. And although it all tends to roll up to a very stable financial picture, I can tell you there is really a lot of excitement among our associates for the things they're working on. We hope to share some of that -- I hope to share some of that excitement with you in November. 
And with that, I'll now turn it back over to the operator for Q&A."

I think every company, including ADP, is going through some of these challenges in terms of attracting our own internal talent. 
And then you have another dynamic, which is if there are shortages of labor in various categories there, we're hearing that there's also shortages of talent in kind of the HCM category in general. That should create a little bit of an advantage for the ""outsourcers,"" right? 
So as you know, our model is we provide great technology and software, but we also do the back-office work and we take accountability for outcomes. And I think when people are struggling to hire people to do the work in their HR department or their payroll department or their benefits department, we're here to help. And so I think those outsourcing solutions are getting a lot of tailwind. 
We also saw because of the easy comps, and I think you heard it in Don's comments, some of the things like our recruitment process outsourcing business and our screening and selection business, which were really at very low bookings levels last year at the same time, have rebounded for obvious reasons incredibly well. But having said that, it was really across the board that we had very strong growth in Workforce Now. 
We had very strong growth in the upmarket. We had strong growth even in the down market, although last year, at the same time, I think we mentioned that we had what we call a client-based acquisition, which is not technically an M&A deal, but we were able to buy a large book of business that we converted that really some of that flowed through our bookings. 
So it made that comparison a little harder on the SBS side. But if you back that out, it was equally strong on the SBS side as well. So I would say that, that could give you a little bit of color, but it really was across the board. 
It just shows how connected we are to the economy and the GDP when it comes to bookings, which is something that we've had as a theory here for some years now. And we just have a very strong recovery in a very strong economy, and it's a great environment for our sales force."

The expectation as we went into the year was to see, particularly in the smaller business segment to see that slip back a little. And indeed it has, but it hasn't slipped back nearly to the extent that we had anticipated. So we're even better there against what we had previously thought. 
Of course, then that means that we did have and continue to have good retention levels in the mid-market and the upmarket. So we expect that to continue. However, as you know, the cyclicality of our business and the seasonality of our business, we will need to get through the calendar year-end, which is when we see most of the switching activity because of the drivers and the new starts of the year, et cetera. 
So we are positive, and we did take our retention estimate up for the year. And we'll see if it holds and perhaps is better than we expected."

And so you have, I think, a very strong backdrop for what I would say is the foreseeable future. In that environment, historically, what ADP would do is we would add as much sales capacity as possible. That doesn't mean that we indiscriminately hire because we have people to hire and onboard and train and so forth. And we have to make those people effective. 
But I would say that we have a strong appetite for growing our sales force, but also for growing our investment in marketing, whether it's digital marketing or more traditional advertising. And that's exactly what we plan to do. 
Having said that, I would tell you that we've had challenges, I think, like everyone else in terms of hiring. It's a very difficult labor market. So I hope that we can fulfill those expectations or those dreams, if you will, of growing our sales force as fast as possible. But that's the only thing that I could see getting in the way. 
We obviously have the capital. We have the, I think, the desire. And we have, I think, the experience to be able to execute once we hire those people to get the sales, get the clients implemented and then hopefully, derive the benefits of that revenue for, in many cases, 15, 20 years, depending on which business unit we're in. So I guess I would say strong appetite for both headcount growth, but also other investments in sales, whether it's marketing, digital marketing, sales tools, all across the board."

And those are a different recession. So I have to be careful about any specific predictions. 
But we had some challenges, I think, coming out of the pandemic with the clients we were selling in the PEO were slightly smaller and just ballpark it around 10% smaller. So let's say that the average -- I'm just going to make up the numbers. Let's say the average new clients over the PEO was 30 worksite employees. And all of a sudden, prior to the pandemic, and that has been ""growing"" slightly over the years. All of a sudden, it came down to like 27. So a 10% decline. 
So even if you sell 10% more units if the units are 10% smaller, you basically end up in the same place. So that's a little bit of what we were expecting. We believe that's 100% related to the economy and to what was happening with the pandemic. 
Now what we've seen in the recovery is both the unit growth is still strong as it was prior year, and now our unit size has recovered. And so the combination of those 2 things has created really, really strong growth in the first quarter in the PEO. 
The only caveat that I would add also is that we did have a kind of a transition into a new year. As you know, our fiscal year ended on June 30. And in some cases, our businesses tend to perform really extremely well in the first quarter when they come out of a year where, I wouldn't call it underperformance because it was still a good year last year given the circumstances. But clearly, the PEO, we were very, I think, clear that the PEO had been trailing in terms of recovery when it comes to bookings what we were seeing in ES. 
And now as we expected, the horse race now, the horse in the lead has changed. So now the PEO is the one leading the race."

And I'm sure every competitor handle it differently in terms of how long they were virtual versus when they went back in the field. 
But that process, which we had been learning about for 20, 25 years like we had almost 1/3 of our sales force already selling what we call inside sales, so they were able to sell virtually. They had been in a building, but it didn't really matter whether they were in a building or in their homes, they were still able to sell very effectively. So that was an easy transition for that portion of our sales force. 
And then we -- really with the appropriate tools and some training and some learning from our inside sales force, we really moved our entire sales force to sell virtually. So I'd say now we're really in a period where we're going to sell based on however the client wants to be sold. 
And so if the client wants a combination of an initial video call on Zoom or Webex, we'll do that. If the client wants an in-person visit, we'll do that. If they want to close the deal with an in-person but start with a video, we can do that. 
So I think there's no question that sales force leverage has increased for us, but admittedly, probably for our competitors as well. Our reach has definitely been extended. There's no question about that in terms of tools, but also philosophically. 
I think our -- we are now, I think, able to sell in a -- I mean, to use a cliche, an omnichannel way. We're also investing heavily in digital marketing. So you mentioned the down market. I would just add that because of some of the comparisons that the downmarket had, that was not what drove the sales results this quarter. It was actually all the other businesses. 
So -- but we do see the underlying strength in small business, but because of the difficult comparison, it's not reflected in the percentages. So not trying to minimize the strength and the momentum in the down market, I'm trying to emphasize the strength everywhere else in the portfolio. 
And the rest of the portfolio also can benefit from digital tools, digital marketing, but it's not quite as leveraged as it is in the down market. So I think it's a combination of a lot of different things. But the overall, I think, comment would be, there's no question that there's increased leverage in the sales force. And you're seeing it in terms of the productivity numbers. 
I mean, we are, frankly, very positively surprised by the rebound in kind of what we call average sales force productivity. So the actual sales rep level, how much are they selling today versus what were they selling in fiscal year '19, and that is back to and above that level, which is very, very pleasing to us."

The -- but no doubt that the retention is very good. And we're benefiting still, I think, from a little bit of some of the concerns coming out of the pandemic that clients may have about switching during a time of still virtual for many. So we're benefiting from that as well, and we acknowledge that. 
But as I said, we're very happy with the retention and the progress we're making with our products and our service that go along to driving those retention numbers. We will see a little bit of a step back perhaps in a down market. But as we said so far, it's holding up better than we expected."

But if you go back to last year, last year was above the prior year. And so it's quite impressive that we had margin improvement last year, given that we were 1 quarter into a pandemic. But it's even more impressive that we had margin improvement again. 
Having said that, that's the victory lap. So then the other part of the comment is we had way higher revenue than we had anticipated, which is incredibly gratifying. We're very happy about that. And it was really in both ES and PEO. And it was in a bunch of different places, slightly better pays per control, retention was better. You heard all the comments. We have just a lot of things working in our favor here. 
The expenses have not caught up to the revenues. And so right now, we are trying to add capacity both for implementation and service, particularly ahead of our year-end period. And so like other companies, the most important thing for us is to be able to execute on our commitments to our clients and to be able to start all the business that we've sold. 
And so I would say that, that's a dynamic that factored into the margin performance. But I don't want to take anything away from the organization or anything away from the operating leverage because it's pretty impressive what the organization was able to accomplish. But had we known where we were going to be in terms of top line and volumes, we would have more headcount today than we have, and there is some catching up to do. 
Now to put a fine point on that, don't think of we have to add hundreds of millions of dollars of expense. We're just a little bit behind, and that's why you see in case -- someone hasn't asked it yet, I may as well address it head on that for the rest of the year, when you look at the EPS and the guidance, we're really not raising by much more than what we have in terms of our performance in Q1. 
And that's because we are going to continue to invest in both sales and distribution, but also in service and implementation. And that delay in hiring or deferred hiring helped us in terms of the margin in the first quarter. 
I strongly believe we still would have had a very strong margin performance in the first quarter, even had we hit our headcount numbers for service implementation and volume-related businesses. But I thought I should kind of put that out there because it seems like an obvious question as well."

So the first part, let me -- we'll come back to the, I think, the second question about the attach rates. 
Let me answer that one first. The attach rates are -- there's a couple of products where we have what I would call good attach rates, acceptable, let's just say, the CEO speak for they could always be higher. Like our benefits to admin tools, our time and attendance systems, but most of our product and our workers' compensation tool in the down market also has a high attach rate. But almost everything else that is ""beyond payroll,"" so HCM in addition to kind of our core payroll solutions, we're way underpenetrated in terms of attach rates. So there's a lot of potential, I think, for that to improve as well. 
So on the first part of your question in terms of how we cross-sell, as I started saying, there isn't a simple answer because there isn't a simple answer. In some of our businesses, we have very distinct organizations like in the down market, we have a large downmarket sales force that works with accountants and other kind of third-party channels and also sell directly. 
And then we have a sales force that sells our retirement solutions, our 401(k) product and our insurance services solution. Those are distinct sales forces that basically share leads with each other, and they have incentives to do so. That downmarket business also feeds business to our PEO through also incentives, but there's a separate and distinct sales force in the PEO as well. 
When you get into the upmarket and into the mid-market, you start to get some portion of our sales force which is able to sell multiple products or what I would call bundles. But even then, you still have specialized sales forces in certain circumstances depending on, I think, the specialization or the complexity of the product. But in all cases, we have primary sales, what I would call primary salespeople. So the quarterback, if you will, on an account. Now I'm talking about upmarket and mid-market. 
And those quarterbacks are really in charge of making sure that when it's appropriate and when a client has a need that we bring in our specialized salespeople that have specific knowledge about some of our other HCM solutions. So I wish I could give you a simple answer, but that's actually part of the secret sauce, right, in terms of our ability to grow and outperform some of our competitors is to be able to do that well. 
And I'd like to say that I invented this, but this is something that goes all the way back to the Frank Lautenberg days and to my predecessors Gary, Art and Josh. And this is a well-oiled machine in terms of our sales and distribution and specifically on what you just described about the cross-sell. And again, to put a fine point on it, roughly 50% of our bookings come from cross-sell, and roughly 50% of our bookings come from new logos each year."

So this is the same leverage that you're seeing in so many industries and so many businesses, including ours, on the revenue happens on the bookings as well, right? 
When you get higher volumes, it basically indicates higher -- unless you add a lot of expense, by definition, you get higher productivity. So you see this being reported in the press all the time about how worker productivity is up. Well, part of the reason why work on productivity is up is because revenues have recovered, volumes have recovered, and it's the same people, right, or you're adding a few more people now. 
What maybe people are focusing on is that worker productivity went down, right, as the pandemic kind of set in and people's revenues went down. So I mean, I hate to make it so simplistic mathematically, but some of that is what's happening now. 
So you do have to be careful about jumping to any medium- to long-term conclusions because right now, our cost of sale compared to last year and the year before is definitely coming down as a result of a very large increase in bookings without a similar increase in expenses. We still, though, are not back to where our cost of sale was pre-pandemic. And we hope to get there, but that will require even a little bit more productivity during this year. 
But that would be -- our expectation is that whether it's the GDP or interest rates or employment, there's a regression to the mean is a very large economy. ADP is a large company, but the economy is massive, and it tends to regress to the mean on a lot of things, and we also tend to regress to the mean. 
So I think some of these things will work themselves out. And then you have to just get past the base effects and the comparisons and so forth to really understand where you are. And we won't know that until we're on the other side, unfortunately. I hate to say it."

The second part of your question, I think kind of answers the first part. The answer is yes. Like I think part -- again, hard to separate how much is just pure GDP growth, new business formation, et cetera. 
But the last part of your question, there's no question that part of our growth is driven by what you are alluding to, which is everyone now is looking for help in terms of hiring, attracting people and frankly, also trying to hold on to them. This is a great environment for us. 
The combination of strong GDP, an administration that is more inclined towards regulation, and then a tight labor market for people who do the things that we do, by that, I mean, payroll staff and HR staff at prospects and at clients, that's all a very good backdrop for us. So I'm assuming that this is not going to resolve itself overnight in terms of the tightness in the labor market. So we should anticipate some tailwinds here and some help for some period of time until that changes. 
And I hate to use the R word, but someday, at some point in the future doesn't seem anywhere near future given what's going on with government stimulus and government policy, but someday, that might change. But we don't see that on the horizon right now. 
On the very first part of your question, though, in terms of the tight labor markets, I would say the overwhelming impact of tight labor market is positive on ADP. I mentioned one of the challenges we have, which is tight labor market affects our own internal associates in terms of we have to hire service people, implementation people. So it's harder for us like it is harder for anyone else. 
But that pales in comparison to the upside. Like a tight labor market drives new bookings, as we just talked about, the last part of your question. But it also could create inflationary pressures, which drives our balance growth. It should drive interest rates higher, which is one of the most underappreciated stories, I think, of ADP is the potential upside in our float business. And the reason it's underestimated because it's done nothing for 10 years. Because I've been here for 10 years, and there's been nothing but pain and headwind. 
And just when I thought we were coming out of it, we go into a pandemic. And we get more pain, and rates go even lower than they were before. But I'm pretty sure they're not going any lower now, although I think we may have to file an 8-K after saying that, right? I'm making a statement on interest rates. 
But yes, they may, whatever, hover around here and go down a little bit there, but it feels pretty certain that the long-term -- medium- and long-term trend now for interest rates will be at least for gradual increases. I'm not suggesting that -- there's still underlying demographics that may keep us from getting back to the same kind of 10-year rate that we had 15 years ago or 10 years ago. But I think everyone knows when you look at real interest rates that there is upside on interest rates. 
So the tight labor market helps in a number of ways. It creates activity for our sales force. Every time there's activity and there's conversations, we're going to win our fair share. So that's a great backdrop. 
It creates opportunities for our balances. I think it creates opportunities for the PEO because some of our billings are actually driven by as a percentage of wages. And whenever you have wage inflation if you're billing on percent of wages, to some extent that will help. That's not like an infinite thing because we won't just allow our revenue to go up indefinitely. We'd have to adjust those rates. But in the medium term, we will see, I think, some tailwind from -- in the PEO from higher wages and wage growth, which is an inevitable outcome of a tight labor market."

We have a fair amount of detail in terms of losses and retention around what we call noncontrollable losses, which are broadly speaking, out of business, bankruptcies, et cetera. And those have started to trend back up again. They're not back to normal levels, but they started to trend back. 
I think that's not surprising because there's still a lot of liquidity and a lot of stimulus, if you will, even if it's not new stimulus. So when you have consumer spending doing what it's doing and you have activity doing what it's doing, it tends to be supportive of small businesses rather than the normal turnover that you have that's natural in the small business sector. 
So I guess with hindsight, like if 3 or 6 months ago when we were putting together our plan we had a crystal ball, we would have probably -- and we had experience with the pandemic, we probably would have planned the downturn in retention to be slower. So we've been positively surprised by how long it's taking for those losses to regress back to normal. 
Having said that, we don't know that they're going to regress 100% back to normal because there's other parts of our retention that are controlled, what we call controllable. And on our controllable losses, we see those going down as well. 
And I think Don made a comment that -- it should not be lost on you, which is that our client satisfaction scores as measured by NPS are the highest they've ever been. And I give credit to the organization for, during the pandemic, being able to get through what was an incredibly difficult time for them personally in terms of they were trying to help our clients. 
But we also had a huge increase in volume because of all the government stimulus programs and the PPP loans, et cetera. And this happened all over the world. It wasn't just in the U.S. And fortunately, we maintained relative stability in our head count. We didn't do mass layoffs and let a bunch of people go. 
So the combination of maintaining investment and also being able to have people -- I don't know how to describe it, but make heroic efforts to help our clients, we were able to maintain those NPS scores and actually have them go up. And they're staying at very strong levels, and we believe that there is a correlation between strong NPS and retention. So we may be able to see kind of new record highs for retention on a permanent basis, but it's way too early to make that prediction."

So we got thrown a little bit off course, if you will, in terms of our implementations and our starts. 
We also, I think, started to focus on implementation tools. I think we had -- I don't know how many we said we had sold. And as we started implementing and starting these clients, we recognize that we still have some work to do in terms of implementation tools and making sure that if and when we want to use third-party integrators to help us with that, that we need to build out those tools. 
So there's been quite a lot of focus on that effort, and we feel good about it. We actually -- I think we also talked about investments in the last quarter that we made to bring in some third parties to help us with the evaluation and in some cases, the build of that to make sure that as we now kind of enter hopefully a period of time where we can really accelerate the implementation and the growth and the starts of those clients. 
But it's fair to say, and I think we said in the last couple of quarters, that our focus turned more to making sure that we have a strong foundation and that we had the right implementation tools to be able to get the business started that we intend to have in the next year or 2, which is hopefully quite a lot of business. And you'll hear more details about this when we get to our Investor Day on November 15."

And are you seeing any switching between clients who might be using HR solution without benefits switching into the PEO? So that will be the first one.

Upmarket, because we have HRO solutions in the upmarket. We have them in the mid-market, and we have them in the down market. 
In the downmarket and in the mid-market, we have PEO. But we also have what you're alluding to, which is a non-co-employment, what I would call -- we call it comprehensive services. As the name implies, it provides a kind of broader assortment of services in addition to our traditional software and our traditional tax and other services. 
There is, to my knowledge, a lot of switching from clients that are what I would call typical clients of ADP that have payroll benefits admin, maybe TLM, et cetera, whether it's in the downmarket and the mid-market into these HRO solutions. There is not a lot to my knowledge of switching across because it typically -- again, if we're doing our job from a sales standpoint, you're really trying to find the right fit for the client. 
In some cases, the client wants you to do their benefits admin and provide their benefits, provide their workers' comp and their 401(k). In other cases, the client wants you to only do the administrative back office of the payroll department and the HR department, which would be the non-PEO solution. 
So I think if we do our job well, which I think we do in the sales process and in the upgrade process, those clients tend to stay on those -- on whatever solution they have chosen. But to be clear, both of them are growing at this point at rates that are multiples of our growth in Employer Services. And so it's quite impressive in terms of the tailwind and the growth rates that we have in all of the HRO businesses. 
On the last part of your question, which I think was about positioning PEO in terms of market share and so forth. We have 600 -- I think 630,000 roughly, we reported worksite employees, average worksite employees this last quarter. That's triple what it was 10 years ago in the first quarter of fiscal year '11. 
And so -- and that's a higher market share than it was 10 years ago. So I don't know what -- how else to answer that question other than to say that we have a proven track record of execution to continue to drive growth in the PEO that's faster than the market. So I don't think there's any question about our positioning or our ability to drive market share as evidenced by our ability to execute."

The challenge for us in terms of as we communicate and on November 15, we'll try to figure out a way to address this issue, like we have $15 billion in revenue. 
So as well as Next Gen HCM are going and Next Gen Payroll is going, it just doesn't -- this is a future impact for ADP. So it's not in the next quarter. I know you're not asking a question necessarily about the next quarter, Mark, but I think it was a good opportunity to kind of throw that out there that what's driving the performance of ADP this quarter, this year and for the next 2 to 3 years is not going to be that from a financial standpoint. 
But in terms of positioning the company for the future in terms of growth and creating competitive differentiation and ability to drive new bookings, they're absolutely critical. So I would say that on those measurements, we're still happy and excited by the progress we're seeing with both Next Gen HCM as well as Next Gen Payroll. 
We have not gone to general availability. So we're selling a lot of Next Gen Payroll, but we're only selling in what we call the core of major accounts right now of the mid-market, which is kind of 50 to 150. And this is no different in terms of the playbook that we use with our transition from our old platform to RUN in a down market and some of our more legacy platforms in mid-market to then our Next Gen Workforce Now version, which we're on now. 
So we're doing the same thing with Next Gen Payroll and the same thing with Next Gen HCM, which is we're doing it very carefully. We have a very large installed base, and we are not -- we're going to eventually move some of those clients and begin to move some of those clients. But we're happy with the business and the cash flow that we have and the client satisfaction scores that are on record levels on our existing platform. 
So we do not have any -- this is not -- we're not panicking. There's no sense of crisis, and there's no -- we have urgency, but no crisis because I want to make sure people hear that. Like I don't want you to think that we don't have a sense of urgency because the faster we get these 2 solutions to scale, the faster we beat the competition."

So hopefully, you'll forget about the first part because we don't have -- we try to prepare for everything and that one we'll have to follow up with you on in terms of what regions or what states we're strongest in terms of our -- I'm going to suspect that they were all strong because honestly, like the PEO results were off the charts. So there can't be any state that wasn't in strong double-digit growth. But we'll follow up on that question. 
On the health care rates question, you're right that we're not directly impacted, but you're also right to imply that we're indirectly impacted because it does matter, right? It matters to our clients, what they're paying for health care. 
And I hate to be so simplistic, but I think what -- back the regression to the mean and large economies, the health care world and insurance companies are also similar in terms of they regress, right? So losses have an uncanny way of regressing to the mean. 
That's why I always caution people when all of a sudden, someone thinks that they have this big decline in either workers' comp costs or health care cost, it usually doesn't work that way. There's usually something that explains it, and it usually regresses back to the mean. 
So I think if I can try to answer what I think is the implication of your question, there was a temporary decline in things like elective surgery and frankly, health care in general. People even stopped going to their primary care physicians and so forth. That decreased health care costs temporarily. 
And I hate to use that word transitory that is now the favorite word it seems to talk about inflation. But it's very clear that, that was transitory and that health care costs will come back. 
And so I think to the extent you had below-normal renewals, which would be our situation, right, because we don't take risk on health care. So we wouldn't see it in our margins and in our cost structure. But to the extent that we had below-normal renewals, we would expect those renewals to go back to normal because we would expect as health care costs go back to normal slowly that those costs would have to be passed through. 
When you look at the health care insurance companies as much criticism as they get, they are largely pass-through entities. They're paying hospitals and providers and other health care costs, prescription drugs, et cetera. And it's really not a business where you can say, ""Oh, we can't pass this 10% increase in health care cost because their margins aren't even 10%. 
And so that business is very, very straightforward, which is they try to earn a markup or a margin for doing what they do in terms of managing networks, et cetera. But in the end, they have to pass those costs through. We have to also because we're a pass-through entity as well. And I think those who take risk on health care, we'll probably see those costs go up over some period of time."

The -- I just want to end the way I usually end, which is thanking our organization and particularly our frontline associates because I'm not sure what's going on in other companies, but we would not be able to get our goals accomplished without people going above and beyond. I think we mentioned the tight labor market and that we're a little bit behind in terms of our hiring. That means our people are working extra hard. 
An economist says that's an increase in productivity. I'd say that's just people working hard. And we really appreciate it. Our clients appreciate it. I think our shareholders appreciate it. I don't think a lot of them listen to this call, but you should be aware that whether it's here and other companies, there's a lot of people out there that are pushing really hard to deliver. And many of us, whether we are as consumers or buyers of products and businesses and so, we're frustrated by what's happening in terms of supply chain and some of these other things. 
But all I see is a bunch of people working really, really hard to try to like fulfill the needs of our clients. And I think that's happening across the whole economy. And I think we need to show a little bit of patience with each other because this will all, I think, normalize as this variant now recedes. 
I mean you're seeing already in some of the mobility data, things will slowly get back to normal. People will come back into the labor force. And this great economy that we have will function the way it's supposed to function. 
But in the meantime, I want to thank our associates for what they've done so far, whether it's this last quarter and what they're going to have to do to get through this year-end, which is going to be very challenging given the volumes we have and the capacity we have.

Don has been with ADP since 1998 when he joined the ADP Canada team as a VP of Finance. He's held a series of roles with increasing responsibility, most recently serving as President of our International business, where he's done a phenomenal job of driving growth and profitability in a very complex environment. I know he's looking forward to meeting all of you. 
Now moving on to the quarter. We are pleased to have delivered a very strong start to the year with 10% revenue growth and 140 basis points of margin expansion, resulting in a 17% increase in adjusted diluted EPS. While we did expect our Q1 revenue growth to be above our prior full year guidance range, this result was still above our initial forecast and underscores the strong position we are in as we emerge from the pandemic. I'll let Don go through the details after I cover some highlights. 
Our ES new business bookings results were very strong, representing another record Q1 bookings amount. And we're ahead of our expectations with outperformance driven by continued strength in our HR portfolio and our international business. With this impressive bookings performance across the enterprise, we're pleased to raise our ES bookings guidance for the year after just 1 quarter as we're now feeling even more confident about our sales momentum. 
Even stronger was our PEO bookings performance, which was also well ahead of our expectations and a key reason that we're raising our guidance for average worksite employee growth for the year, as Don will outline for you. As you will recall, we've been sharing our sales productivity trends over the course of the pandemic, and I'm pleased to report that in Q1, we were well above pre-pandemic levels. We reached this result several months sooner than we expected, and we expect this to continue as we look ahead. 
Our ES retention remained incredibly strong as well. As we shared last quarter, we believed it was reasonable to assume a slight step back in retention from the record 92.2% level we experienced last year. But in Q1, we did not see meaningful deterioration. 
Instead, we actually saw further improvement in our overall ES retention to a new record Q1 level despite a modest decline in our small business division, where out-of-business losses started to trend back to more normal levels compared to the below-normal levels last year. We're continuing to assume a slight decline in our retention outlook for the year. But clearly, we are pleased with our performance so far, and the upward revision in our retention outlook reflects the strong Q1 performance. 
Our ES pays per control was solid with 7% growth in the quarter, about in line with our expectations. We fielded a number of questions these past several months about what we think might drive workers back into the labor force. While we don't have an answer to that question, what we can tell you is that we continue to see positive trends. 
Our clients are eager to hire, and we are seeing workers return to the labor force, even if it's gradual. As a result, we expect to benefit from above-normal -- an above-normal level of pay-per-control growth over the course of the year. 
In addition to the very strong ES performance, our PEO delivered another stellar quarter with 15% revenue growth and 15% average worksite employee growth, even better than the high expectations we had coming into the quarter. There were multiple drivers to the outperformance in the PEO, including the strong level of hiring within the client base, resilient retention and the improved bookings performance I mentioned earlier. We're very pleased with the momentum we see building in the PEO, and we're raising our full year guidance accordingly. 
In addition to the financial highlights, there are a few product highlights I wanted to share with you. First, I'm excited to share that we completed the initial rollout of our new user experience for RUN. As we shared with you last quarter, this represents the most comprehensive refresh we've done since the launch of RUN. And we're very proud that in a matter of a quarter, we were able to seamlessly move hundreds of thousands of clients to a new and better user experience. Early signs indicate that client satisfaction scores should trend even higher than the record levels we already have in our small business division. So it's a really great outcome and represents a very strong execution by the team. 
I'd like to also share that at the annual HR Tech conference a few weeks ago, our innovative diversity, equity and inclusion tool on the DataCloud platform was named a top HR product. This recognition adds to ADP's long-standing history of award wins at the conference, marking an unprecedented seventh consecutive year ADP has been honored for its innovative HCM technology. You can probably tell from the number of times we've highlighted DataCloud that our velocity of innovation has increased significantly there. With this DE&I solution as an example, we've seen revenues over 50% of active users of this solution take action and realize positive impact on their DE&I measures. 
I'm proud that we provide solutions that drive real positive change for our clients. This 7-year track record demonstrates that innovation is part of ADP's DNA and that we have a strong, growing, agile R&D team committed to delivering solutions in the market that continue to push the boundary of what HCM solutions can do for employers and their employees. As I said before, we're very pleased with the fantastic start to the year. We look forward to sharing even more of the ADP story with you at the upcoming Investor Day in November. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Don for more detail on the quarter and the outlook."

Our first quarter represented a strong start to the year with 10% revenue growth on both the reported and organic constant currency basis.

Our first quarter represented a strong start to the year with 10% revenue growth on both the reported and organic constant currency basis. 
Our adjusted EBIT margin was up 140 basis points, much better than expected and was supported by higher revenue and overall cost containment. Our tax rate was up slightly in the quarter versus last year, but we also benefited from an elevated pace of share repurchases following our debt issuance in May. Combined, those factors contributed to a 17% increase in our adjusted diluted earnings per share. 
Moving on to the segments. Our Employer Services revenue increased 8% on a reported and organic constant currency basis. Our strong Q1 ES bookings performance and record retention contributed to this performance. Though as a reminder, we did continue to lap some of the lower revenues we had last year in some of our volume-related businesses, including recruiting and background screening. 
Our clients fund interest represented only a slight headwind in the quarter as our 40 point -- basis point decline in average yield was offset by fantastic balance growth of 22% driven by client growth, employment growth, higher wages and the lapping of the payroll tax deferral last year. ES margin increased 150 basis points on strong revenue performance and overall cost containment. 
As Carlos mentioned, our PEO had another terrific quarter. Average worksite employees increased 15% year-over-year to 629,000. And revenues, excluding 0-margin pass-throughs, grew 20%, supported once again by favorable mix trends within the PEO employee base as well as improving SUI rates. 
Total PEO revenue grew 15%, which included a modest drag from lower 0-margin pass-through growth and worksite employee growth as expected. PEO margin was up 70 basis points in the quarter driven by operating leverage. Overall, our Q1 results reflect a very strong start to the year and delivered ahead of our expectations on practically all fronts. Let me now turn to our updated outlook for fiscal 2022. For ES revenues, we now expect growth of 5% to 6%, which we're raising 50 basis points at the midpoint. This is driven by several underlying factors. 
We're raising our expected range of ES new bookings growth to 12% to 16%. As we mentioned, we had a better-than-expected performance in Q1 and reached pre-pandemic productivity earlier than we had forecasted. We haven't made significant changes to our rest of year outlook at this point, but if momentum remains as strong as we've seen it, then we may see opportunity to deliver additional upside. We're also raising our ES retention, and we are now assuming a decline of 50 basis points off of FY '21's all-time highs versus our prior outlook of a decline of 75 basis points. As with bookings, this is primarily a function of the strong Q1 performance. 
Our continued assumption is that as clients continue to reengage in the marketplace, we may experience a slight decline over the course of the year. We expect to have significantly more clarity once we get through the calendar year-end period, where we typically see most of the switching activity. For U.S. pays per control, we're making no change to our outlook of 4% to 5% growth. We continue to expect a gradual recovery in the overall labor market, and the 7% growth in Q1 was about in line with our expectations. 
And then for our client funds interest revenue, we're raising our outlook by about $15 million to a range of $420 million to $430 million as we're raising our balance growth assumptions by about 4% to growth of 12% to 14%. Our outlook for client funds yield, meanwhile, is unchanged despite the improvement in the yield environment primarily as our stronger balance performance actually created a temporary mix shift to overnight investments until new securities are gradually purchased. But that said, the favorable shift in the yield curve is clearly helpful to us and will certainly benefit our multiyear client funds outlook, all else equal. 
For ES margin, we now expect an increase of about 75 to 100 basis points, up from our prior range of 50 to 75 basis points. While we did outperform meaningfully on margin in Q1, we are also seeing some additional expenses over the rest of the year, including higher headcount in our outsourcing businesses. Meanwhile, we continue to expect transformation initiative benefits, including our digital transformation, to offset a year-over-year increase in facilities, T&E expenses and other return-to-office expenses. 
Moving on to the PEO. We now expect PEO revenues to grow 11% to 13%; average worksite employees to grow 11% to 13%; and revenues, excluding 0-margin pass-throughs, to grow 12% to 14%. This 2 percentage point raise across the board is a function of both our strong Q1 bookings and overall performance as well as an expectation from stronger hiring within our PEO base to contribute over the remainder of the year. Our PEO is very well-positioned to capitalize on growing levels of client demand coming out of the pandemic. And if we continue to drive outsized booking performance over the rest of the year, that could represent further upside to our outlook. 
Following our strong start to the year, we now expect a range of flat to down 50 basis points for the year for an improvement from our prior expectation of down 70 -- 25 to 75 basis points on our margin. As a reminder, we are growing over a very strong margin result in fiscal 2021 and are also expecting elevated selling expenses this year from strong bookings performance. 
Turning it all together for our consolidated outlook. We now expect revenue to grow 7% to 8%. Following the strong 10% Q1 performance, we now expect the remaining quarters to grow closer to 7%, which is higher than our prior forecast. For adjusted EBIT margin, we now expect an increase of 50 to 75 basis points. As we shared last quarter, we expect our margin improvement to be back half-weighted, most specifically in the fourth quarter. Our current expectation is for a slight margin decline in Q2 and Q3. We're making no change to our tax rate assumption. And with these changes, we now expect growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share of 11% to 13%. 
As I think you've heard us say a couple of times now, we are very pleased with our Q1 results, and we're happy to be raising our guidance this early in the year. This is still a dynamic environment, and there are a wide range of potential outcomes. And we believe our guidance is appropriately balanced given these conditions. However, should our associates continue to drive better-than-expected sales results, client satisfaction, efficiency and service and implementation, we would see opportunity to deliver additional upside to our outlook. 
Before we move to Q&A, I wanted to share 2 things. First, I look forward to meeting everyone, perhaps virtually for now, but eventually in person as we get back out on the road to meet our shareholders and the investment community. And second is that we are very much looking forward to our upcoming Investor Day in a couple of weeks on November 15. Having run one of our largest businesses for years, I can tell you there is always much happening here at ADP on the ground. And although it all tends to roll up to a very stable financial picture, I can tell you there is really a lot of excitement among our associates for the things they're working on. We hope to share some of that -- I hope to share some of that excitement with you in November. 
And with that, I'll now turn it back over to the operator for Q&A."

I don't know how else to put it. So kind of, call it, orders of magnitude in terms of growth rate higher than even the ES bookings growth for the quarter. So that was really good to see. So that's kind of a sign to your question about products that I think the market is really searching for solutions coming out of this pandemic that help them with, obviously, people issues and so, but there's also a talent crunch. So people are looking to obviously attract and retain people in this environment. I think every company, including ADP, is going through some of these challenges in terms of attracting our own internal talent. 
And then you have another dynamic, which is if there are shortages of labor in various categories there, we're hearing that there's also shortages of talent in kind of the HCM category in general. That should create a little bit of an advantage for the ""outsourcers"" right? So as you know, our model is we provide great technology and software, but we also do the back-office work and we take accountability for outcomes. And I think when people are struggling to hire people to do the work in their HR department or their payroll department or their benefits department, we're here to help. And so I think those outsourcing solutions are getting a lot of tailwind. 
We also saw because, of the easy comps, and I think you heard it in Don's comments, some of the things like our recruitment process outsourcing business and our screening and selection business, which were really at very low bookings levels last year at the same time, have rebounded for obvious reasons incredibly well. But having said that, it was really across the board that we had very strong growth in Workforce Now. 
We had very strong growth in the upmarket. We had strong growth even in the down market, although last year, at the same time, I think we mentioned that we had what we call a client-based acquisition, which is not technically an M&A deal, but we were able to buy a large book of business that we converted that really some of that flowed through our bookings. So it made that comparison a little harder on the SBS side. But if you back that out, it was equally strong on the SBS side as well. So I would say that, that could give you a little bit of color, but it really was across the board. 
It just shows how connected we are to the economy and the GDP when it comes to bookings, which is something that we've had as a theory here for some years now. And we just have a very strong recovery in a very strong economy, and it's a great environment for our sales force."

But just help me unpack the slight uptick in the SMB side moving a little bit more towards normal in terms of business failure.

And indeed it has, but it hasn't slipped back nearly to the extent that we had anticipated. So we're even better there against what we had previously thought. 
Of course, then that means that we did have and continue to have good retention levels in the mid-market and the upmarket. So we expect that to continue. However, as you know, the cyclicality of our business and the seasonality of our business, we will need to get through the calendar year-end, which is when we see most of the switching activity because of the drivers and the new starts of the year, et cetera.

And so you have, I think, a very strong backdrop for what I would say is the foreseeable future. In that environment, historically, what ADP would do is we would add as much sales capacity as possible. That doesn't mean that we indiscriminately hire because we have people to hire and onboard and train and so forth. And we have to make those people effective. 
But I would say that we have a strong appetite for growing our sales force, but also for growing our investment in marketing, whether it's digital marketing or more traditional advertising. And that's exactly what we plan to do. Having said that, I would tell you that we've had challenges, I think, like everyone else in terms of hiring. It's a very difficult labor market. So I hope that we can fulfill those expectations or those dreams, if you will, of growing our sales force as fast as possible. But that's the only thing that I could see getting in the way. 
We obviously have the capital. We have the, I think, the desire. And we have, I think, the experience to be able to execute once we hire those people to get the sales, get the clients implemented and then hopefully, derive the benefits of that revenue for, in many cases, 15, 20 years, depending on which business unit we're in. So I guess, I would say strong appetite for both headcount growth, but also other investments in sales, whether it's marketing, digital marketing, sales tools, all across the board."

And those are a different recession. So I have to be careful about any specific predictions. But we had some challenges, I think, coming out of the pandemic with the clients we were selling in the PEO were slightly smaller and just ballpark it around 10% smaller. So let's say that the average -- I'm just going to make up the numbers. Let's say the average new clients over the PEO was 30 worksite employees. And all of a sudden, prior to the pandemic, and that has been ""growing"" slightly over the years. All of a sudden, it came down to like 27. So a 10% decline. 
So even if you sell 10% more units if the units are 10% smaller, you basically end up in the same place. So that's a little bit of what we were expecting. We believe that's 100% related to the economy and to what was happening with the pandemic. Now what we've seen in the recovery is both the unit growth is still strong as it was prior year, and now our unit size has recovered. And so the combination of those 2 things has created really, really strong growth in the first quarter in the PEO. 
The only caveat that I would add also is that we did have a kind of a transition into a new year. As you know, our fiscal year ended on June 30. And in some cases, our businesses tend to perform really extremely well in the first quarter when they come out of a year where, I wouldn't call it underperformance because it was still a good year last year given the circumstances. But clearly, the PEO, we were very, I think, clear that the PEO had been trailing in terms of recovery when it comes to bookings what we were seeing in ES. 
And now as we expected, the horse race now, the horse in the lead has changed. So now the PEO is the one leading the race."

And I'm sure every competitor handle it differently in terms of how long they were virtual versus when they went back in the field. But that process, which we had been learning about for 20, 25 years like we had almost 1/3 of our sales force already selling what we call inside sales, so they were able to sell virtually. They had been in a building, but it didn't really matter whether they were in a building or in their homes, they were still able to sell very effectively. So that was an easy transition for that portion of our sales force. 
And then we -- really with the appropriate tools and some training and some learning from our inside sales force, we really moved our entire sales force to sell virtually. So I'd say now we're really in a period where we're going to sell based on however the client wants to be sold. And so if the client wants a combination of an initial video call on Zoom or Webex, we'll do that. If the client wants an in-person visit, we'll do that. If they want to close the deal with an in-person but start with a video, we can do that. 
So I think there's no question that sales force leverage has increased for us, but admittedly, probably for our competitors as well. Our reach has definitely been extended. There's no question about that in terms of tools, but also philosophically. I think our -- we are now, I think, able to sell in a -- I mean, to use a cliche, an omnichannel way. We're also investing heavily in digital marketing. So you mentioned the down market. I would just add that because of some of the comparisons that the downmarket had, that was not what drove the sales results this quarter. It was actually all the other businesses. 
So -- but we do see the underlying strength in small business, but because of the difficult comparison, it's not reflected in the percentages. So not trying to minimize the strength and the momentum in the down market, I'm trying to emphasize the strength everywhere else in the portfolio. And the rest of the portfolio also can benefit from digital tools, digital marketing, but it's not quite as leveraged as it is in the down market. So I think it's a combination of a lot of different things. But the overall, I think, comment would be, there's no question that there's increased leverage in the sales force. And you're seeing it in terms of the productivity numbers. 
I mean, we are, frankly, very positively surprised by the rebound in kind of what we call average sales force productivity. So the actual sales rep level, how much are they selling today versus what were they selling in fiscal year '19, and that is back to and above that level, which is very, very pleasing to us."

The -- but no doubt that the retention is very good. And we're benefiting still, I think, from a little bit of some of the concerns coming out of the pandemic that clients may have about switching during a time of still virtual for many. So we're benefiting from that as well, and we acknowledge that. But as I said, we're very happy with the retention and the progress we're making with our products, and our service that go along to driving those retention numbers. We will see a little bit of a step back perhaps in a down market. But as we said so far, it's holding up better than we expected."

Let me start off by saying that the margin in the first quarter was a record for us, and it was above last year as we just reported. But if you go back to last year, last year was above the prior year. And so it's quite impressive that we had margin improvement last year, given that we were 1 quarter into a pandemic. But it's even more impressive that we had margin improvement again. Having said that, that's the victory lap. So then the other part of the comment is we had way higher revenue than we had anticipated, which is incredibly gratifying. We're very happy about that. And it was really in both ES and PEO. And it was in a bunch of different places, slightly better pays per control, retention was better. You heard all the comments. We have just a lot of things working in our favor here. 
The expenses have not caught up to the revenues. And so right now, we are trying to add capacity both for implementation and service, particularly ahead of our year-end period. And so like other companies, the most important thing for us is to be able to execute on our commitments to our clients and to be able to start all the business that we've sold. And so I would say that, that's a dynamic that factored into the margin performance. But I don't want to take anything away from the organization or anything away from the operating leverage because it's pretty impressive what the organization was able to accomplish. But had we known where we were going to be in terms of top line and volumes, we would have more headcount today than we have, and there is some catching up to do. 
Now to put a fine point on that, don't think of we have to add hundreds of millions of dollars of expense. We're just a little bit behind, and that's why you see in case -- someone hasn't asked it yet, I may as well address it head on that for the rest of the year, when you look at the EPS and the guidance, we're really not raising by much more than what we have in terms of our performance in Q1. 
And that's because we are going to continue to invest in both sales and distribution, but also in service implementation. And that delay in hiring or deferred hiring helped us in terms of the margin in the first quarter. I strongly believe we still would have had a very strong margin performance in the first quarter, even had we hit our headcount numbers for service implementation and volume-related businesses. But I thought I should kind of put that out there because it seems like an obvious question as well."

I was wondering about the human resources and human capital management products. Can you talk about how the cross-selling process into your base of kind of payroll customers is organized? I'm just trying to figure out sort of how you go about that cross-sell process. And I guess, how much of a runway do you see for attach rates with those products?"
126269,1682316362,2414509,"Automatic Data Processing, Inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2021",2021-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Executives","There really isn't a simple answer to that.

So the first part, let me -- we'll come back to the, I think, the second question about the attach rates. Let me answer that one first. The attach rates are -- there's a couple of products where we have what I would call good attach rates, acceptable, let's just say, the CEO speak for they could always be higher. Like our benefits to admin tools, our time and attendance systems, but most of our product and our workers' compensation tool in the down market also has a high attach rate. But almost everything else that is ""beyond payroll."" So HCM, in addition to kind of our core payroll solutions, we're way underpenetrated in terms of attach rates. So there's a lot of potential, I think, for that to improve as well. 
So on the first part of your question in terms of how we cross-sell, as I started saying, there isn't a simple answer because there isn't a simple answer. In some of our businesses, we have very distinct organizations like in the down market, we have a large downmarket sales force that works with accountants and other kind of third-party channels and also sell directly. And then we have a sales force that sells our retirement solutions, our 401(k) product and our insurance services solution. Those are distinct sales forces that basically share leads with each other, and they have incentives to do so. That downmarket business also feeds business to our PEO, through also incentives, but there's a separate and distinct sales force in the PEO as well. 
When you get into the upmarket and into the mid-market, you start to get some portion of our sales force which is able to sell multiple products or what I would call bundles. But even then, you still have specialized sales forces in certain circumstances depending on, I think, the specialization or the complexity of the product. But in all cases, we have primary sales, what I would call primary salespeople. So the quarterback, if you will, on an account. Now I'm talking about upmarket and mid-market. 
And those quarterbacks are really in charge of making sure that when it's appropriate, and when a client has a need, that we bring in our specialized salespeople that have specific knowledge about some of our other HCM solutions. So I wish I could give you a simple answer, but that's actually part of the secret sauce, right, in terms of our ability to grow and outperform some of our competitors is to be able to do that well. 
And I'd like to say that I invented this, but this is something that goes all the way back to the Frank Lautenberg days and to my predecessors Gary, Art and Josh. And this is a well-oiled machine in terms of our sales and distribution and specifically on what you just described about the cross-sell. And again, to put a fine point on it, roughly 50% of our bookings come from cross-sell, and roughly 50% of our bookings come from new logos each year."

So this is the same leverage that you're seeing in so many industries and so many businesses, including ours, on the revenue happens on the bookings as well, right? 
When you get higher volumes, it basically indicates higher -- unless you add a lot of expense, by definition, you get higher productivity. So you see this being reported in the press all the time about how worker productivity is up. Well, part of the reason why work on productivity is up is because revenues have recovered, volumes have recovered, and it's the same people, right, or you're adding a few more people now. 
What maybe people are focusing on is that worker productivity went down, right, as the pandemic kind of set in and people's revenues went down. So I mean, I hate to make it so simplistic mathematically, but some of that is what's happening now. So you do have to be careful about jumping to any medium- to long-term conclusions because right now, our cost to sale compared to last year, and the year before, is definitely coming down as a result of a very large increase in bookings without a similar increase in expenses. We still, though, are not back to where our cost of sale was pre-pandemic. And we hope to get there, but that will require even a little bit more productivity during this year. 
But that would be -- our expectation is that whether it's the GDP or interest rates or employment, there's a regression to the mean is a very large economy. ADP is a large company, but the economy is massive, and it tends to regress to the mean on a lot of things, and we also tend to regress to the mean. So I think some of these things will work themselves out. And then you have to just get past the base effects and the comparisons and so forth to really understand where you are. And we won't know that until we're on the other side, unfortunately. I hate to say it."

The second part of your question, I think kind of answers the first part. The answer is yes. Like I think part -- again, hard to separate how much is just pure GDP growth, new business formation, et cetera. But the last part of your question, there's no question that part of our growth is driven by what you are alluding to, which is everyone now is looking for help in terms of hiring, attracting people and frankly, also trying to hold on to them. This is a great environment for us. 
The combination of strong GDP, an administration that is more inclined towards regulation, and then a tight labor market for people who do the things that we do. By that, I mean, payroll staff and HR staff at prospects and at clients, that's all a very good backdrop for us. So I'm assuming that this is not going to resolve itself overnight in terms of the tightness in the labor market. So we should anticipate some tailwinds here and some help for some period of time until that changes. 
And I hate to use the R word, but someday, at some point in the future doesn't seem anywhere near future given what's going on with government stimulus and government policy, but someday, that might change. But we don't see that on the horizon right now. On the very first part of your question, though, in terms of the tight labor markets, I would say the overwhelming impact of tight labor market is positive on ADP. I mentioned one of the challenges we have, which is tight labor market affects our own internal associates, in terms of we have to hire service people, implementation people. So it's harder for us like it is harder for anyone else. 
But that pales in comparison to the upside. Like a tight labor market drives new bookings, as we just talked about, the last part of your question. But it also could create inflationary pressures, which drives our balance growth. It should drive interest rates higher, which is one of the most underappreciated stories, I think, of ADP is the potential upside in our float business. And the reason it's underestimated because it's done nothing for 10 years. Because I've been here for 10 years, and there's been nothing but pain and headwind. And just when I thought we were coming out of it, we go into a pandemic. And we get more pain, and rates go even lower than they were before. But I'm pretty sure they're not going any lower now, although I think we may have to file an 8-K after saying that, right? I'm making a statement on interest rates. 
But yes, they may, whatever, hover around here and go down a little bit there, but it feels pretty certain that the long-term -- medium- and long-term trend now for interest rates will be, at least, for gradual increases. I'm not suggesting that -- there's still underlying demographics that may keep us from getting back to the same kind of 10-year rate that we had 15 years ago or 10 years ago. But I think everyone knows when you look at real interest rates that there is upside on interest rates. So the tight labor market helps in a number of ways. It creates activity for our sales force. Every time there's activity and there's conversations, we're going to win our fair share. So that's a great backdrop. 
It creates opportunities for our balances. I think it creates opportunities for the PEO because some of our billings are actually driven by as a percentage of wages. And whenever you have wage inflation if you're billing on percent of wages, to some extent, that will help. That's not like an infinite thing because we won't just allow our revenue to go up indefinitely. We'd have to adjust those rates. But in the medium term, we will see, I think, some tailwind from -- in the PEO from higher wages and wage growth, which is an inevitable outcome of a tight labor market."

We have a fair amount of detail in terms of losses and retention around what we call noncontrollable losses, which are broadly speaking, out of business, bankruptcies, et cetera. And those have started to trend back up again. They're not back to normal levels, but they started to trend back. I think that's not surprising because there's still a lot of liquidity and still a lot of stimulus, if you will, even if it's not new stimulus. So when you have consumer spending doing what it's doing and you have activity doing what it's doing, it tends to be supportive of small businesses rather than the normal turnover that you have that's natural in the small business sector. 
So I guess with hindsight, like if 3 or 6 months ago when we were putting together our plan we had a crystal ball, we would have probably -- and we had experience with the pandemic, we probably would have planned the downturn in retention to be slower. So we've been positively surprised by how long it's taking for those losses to regress back to normal. Having said that, we don't know that they're going to regress 100% back to normal because there's other parts of our retention that are controlled, what we call controllable. And on our controllable losses, we see those going down as well. 
And I think Don made a comment that -- it should not be lost on you, which is that our client satisfaction scores as measured by NPS are the highest they've ever been. And I give credit to the organization for, during the pandemic, being able to get through what was an incredibly difficult time for them personally in terms of they were trying to help our clients. We also had a huge increase in volume because of all the government stimulus programs and the PPP loans, et cetera. And this happened all over the world. It wasn't just in the U.S. And fortunately, we maintained relative stability in our head count. We didn't do mass layoffs and let a bunch of people go. 
So the combination of maintaining investment and also being able to have people -- I don't know how to describe it, but make heroic efforts to help our clients, we were able to maintain those NPS scores and actually have them go up. And they're staying at very strong levels, and we believe that there is a correlation between strong NPS and retention. So we may be able to see kind of new record highs for retention on a permanent basis, but it's way too early to make that prediction."

And as we started implementing and starting these clients, we recognize that we still have some work to do in terms of implementation tools and making sure that if and when we want to use third-party integrators to help us with that, that we need to build out those tools. 
So there's been quite a lot of focus on that effort, and we feel good about it. We actually -- I think we also talked about investments in the last quarter that we made to bring in some third parties to help us with the evaluation and in some cases, the build of that to make sure that as we now kind of enter hopefully a period of time where we can really accelerate the implementation and the growth and the starts of those clients. 
But it's fair to say, and I think we said in the last couple of quarters, that our focus turned more to making sure that we have a strong foundation and that we had the right implementation tools to be able to get the business started that we intend to have in the next year or 2, which is hopefully quite a lot of business. And you'll hear more details about this when we get to our Investor Day on November 15."

How are you seeing them growing relative to each other, the demand? And are you seeing any switching between clients who might be using HR solution without benefits switching into the PEO? So that will be the first one. 
And the second, I was curious how you're positioning the PEO franchise to really win market share in a post-pandemic environment, given the secular growth seems to be very favorable. But how do you actually make sure that ADP wins share?"

Upmarket, because we have HRO solutions in the upmarket. We have them in the mid-market, and we have them in the down market. In the downmarket and in the mid-market, we have PEO. But we also have what you're alluding to, which is a non-co-employment, what I would call -- we call it comprehensive services. As the name implies, it provides a kind of broader assortment of services in addition to our traditional software and our traditional tax and other services. 
There is, to my knowledge, a lot of switching from clients that are what I would call typical clients of ADP that have payroll benefits admin, maybe TLM, et cetera, whether it's in the downmarket and the mid-market into these HRO solutions. There is not a lot to my knowledge of switching across because it typically -- again, if we're doing our job from a sales standpoint, you're really trying to find the right fit for the client. 
In some cases, the client wants you to do their benefits, admin and provide their benefits, provide their workers' comp and their 401(k). In other cases, the client wants you to only do the administrative back office of the payroll department and the HR department, which would be the non-PEO solution. 
So I think if we do our job well, which I think we do in the sales process and in the upgrade process, those clients tend to stay on those -- on whatever solution they have chosen. But to be clear, both of them are growing at this point at rates that are multiples of our growth in Employer Services. And so it's quite impressive in terms of the tailwind and the growth rates that we have in all of the HRO businesses. 
On the last part of your question, which I think was about positioning PEO in terms of market share and so forth. We have 600 -- I think 630,000 roughly, we reported worksite employees, average worksite employees this last quarter. That's triple what it was 10 years ago in the first quarter of fiscal year '11. And so -- and that's a higher market share than it was 10 years ago. So I don't know what -- how else to answer that question other than to say that we have a proven track record of execution to continue to drive growth in the PEO that's faster than the market. So I don't think there's any question about our positioning or our ability to drive market share as evidenced by our ability to execute."

The challenge for us in terms of -- as we communicate and on November 15, we'll try to figure out a way to address this issue, like we have $15 billion in revenue. 
So as well as Next Gen HCM are going and Next Gen Payroll is going, it just doesn't -- this is a future impact for ADP. So it's not in the next quarter. I know you're not asking a question necessarily about the next quarter, Mark, but I think it was a good opportunity to kind of throw that out there that what's driving the performance of ADP this quarter, this year and for the next 2 to 3 years is not going to be that from a financial standpoint. 
But in terms of positioning the company for the future in terms of growth and creating competitive differentiation and ability to drive new bookings, they're absolutely critical. So I would say that on those measurements, we're still happy and excited by the progress we're seeing with both Next Gen HCM as well as Next Gen Payroll. 
We have not gone to general availability. So we're selling a lot of Next Gen Payroll, but we're only selling in what we call the core of major accounts right now of the mid-market, which is kind of 50 to 150. And this is no different in terms of the playbook that we use with our transition from our old platform to RUN, in a down market, and some of our more legacy platforms in mid-market to then our Next Gen Workforce Now version, which we're on now. 
So we're doing the same thing with Next Gen Payroll and the same thing with Next Gen HCM, which is we're doing it very carefully. We have a very large installed base, and we are not -- we're going to eventually move some of those clients and begin to move some of those clients. But we're happy with the business and the cash flow that we have and the client satisfaction score that are on record levels on our existing platform. 
So we do not have any -- this is not -- we're not panicking. There's no sense of crisis, and there's no -- we have urgency, but no crisis because I want to make sure people hear that. Like I don't want you to think that we don't have a sense of urgency because the faster we get these 2 solutions to scale, the faster we beat the competition."

One would be the growth that you're seeing kind of in the established states relative to some of the less mature states. And to what extent are you seeing less mature states really catch on, particularly given the legislative and regulatory backdrop? 
And then secondly, how should we think about just health insurance costs now that elective surgeries are starting to come back, elective procedures are starting to come back? What sort of impact would that end up having just on the overall pricing? I know that you're not necessarily impacted directly from a margin perspective, but just thinking about the demand environment."

So hopefully, you'll forget about the first part because we don't have -- we try to prepare for everything and that one, we'll have to follow up with you on in terms of what regions or what states we're strongest in terms of our -- I'm going to suspect that they were all strong because honestly, like the PEO results were off the charts. So there can't be any state that wasn't in strong double-digit growth. But we'll follow up on that question. 
On the health care rates question, you're right that we're not directly impacted, but you're also right to imply that we're indirectly impacted because it does matter, right? It matters to our clients, what they're paying for health care. 
And I hate to be so simplistic, but I think what -- back the regression to the mean and large economies, the health care world and insurance companies are also similar in terms of they regress, right? So losses have an uncanny way of regressing to the mean. 
That's why I always caution people when all of a sudden, someone thinks that they have this big decline in either workers' comp costs or health care cost, it usually doesn't work that way. There's usually something that explains it, and it usually regresses back to the mean. 
So I think if I can try to answer what I think is the implication of your question, there was a temporary decline in things like elective surgery and frankly, health care in general. People even stopped going to their primary care physicians and so forth. That decreased health care costs temporarily. And I hate to use that word, transitory, that is now the favorite word it seems to talk about inflation. But it's very clear that, that was transitory and that health care costs will come back. 
And so I think to the extent you had below-normal renewals, which would be our situation, right, because we don't take risk on health care. So we wouldn't see it in our margins and in our cost structure. But to the extent that we had below-normal renewals, we would expect those renewals to go back to normal because we would expect as health care costs go back to normal slowly, that those costs would have to be passed through. 
When you look at the health care insurance companies as much criticism as they get, they are largely pass-through entities. They're paying hospitals and providers and other health care costs, prescription drugs, et cetera. And it's really not a business where you can say, ""Oh, we can't pass this 10% increase in health care cost because their margins aren't even 10%."" 
And so that business is very, very straightforward, which is they try to earn a markup or a margin for doing what they do in terms of managing networks, et cetera. But in the end, they have to pass those costs through. We have to also because we're a pass-through entity as well. And I think those who take risk on health care, we'll probably see those costs go up over some period of time."

I want to thank Don for joining, and I think you're all going to be very happy to meet him and get the benefit of his experience in ADP more broadly besides just in the finance organization because he has kind of real-world business experience within ADP as well. 
The -- I just want to end the way I usually end, which is thanking our organization and particularly our frontline associates because I'm not sure what's going on in other companies, but we would not be able to get our goals accomplished without people going above and beyond. I think we mentioned the tight labor market and that we're a little bit behind in terms of our hiring. That means our people are working extra hard. 
An economist says that's an increase in productivity. I'd say that's just people working hard. And we really appreciate it. Our clients appreciate it. I think our shareholders appreciate it. I don't think a lot of them listen to this call, but you should be aware that whether it's here and other companies, there's a lot of people out there that are pushing really hard to deliver. And many of us, whether we are as consumers or buyers of products and businesses and so, we're frustrated by what's happening in terms of supply chain and some of these other things. 
But all I see is a bunch of people working really, really hard to try to like fulfill the needs of our clients. And I think that's happening across the whole economy. And I think we need to show a little bit of patience with each other because this will all, I think, normalize as this variant now recedes. I mean you're seeing already in some of the mobility data, things will slowly get back to normal. People will come back into the labor force. And this great economy that we have will function the way it's supposed to function. 
But in the meantime, I want to thank our associates for what they've done so far, whether it's this last quarter and what they're going to have to do to get through this year-end, which is going to be very challenging, given the volumes we have and the capacity we have. So for that, I thank them, but I also thank all of you for listening and for being supporters of ADP. Thank you."
