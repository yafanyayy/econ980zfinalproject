With me on today's call are WestRock's Chief Executive Officer, Steve Voorhees; our Chief Financial Officer, Ward Dickson; our Chief Commercial Officer and President of Corrugated Packaging, Jeff Chalovich; as well as our Chief Innovation Officer and President of Consumer Packaging, Pat Lindner. Following our prepared comments, we will open up the call for our question-and-answer session. 
During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs related to future events. These statements may involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those we discussed during the call. We describe these risks and uncertainties in our filings with the SEC, including our 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020.
In addition, we may be making forward-looking statements about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the recent ransomware attack on our operational and financial performance. The extent of these impacts, including the duration, scope and severity is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence at this time. We will also be referencing non-GAAP financial measures during the call. We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the Appendix of the slide presentation. As mentioned previously, the slide presentation is available on our website. 
With that said, I'll now turn it over to you, Steve."
33897,697876246,2183766,"WestRock Company, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2021",2021-01-28,"Earnings Calls","IRSM Media Ltd","Executives","Okay. Thanks, James. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. I'm going to start with an overview and update on the ransomware attack that we reported on Monday. We're following strict protocols laid out by industry-standard incident response dir",2120,"Okay. Thanks, James. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. I'm going to start with an overview and update on the ransomware attack that we reported on Monday. We're following strict protocols laid out by industry-standard incident response directives. Because of this, we're being careful not to share certain details around the incident at this time. 
However, following is information that I can share with you today. On Saturday, January 23, our systems identified what we quickly determined was a ransomware attack. We immediately implemented our business continuity processes and initiated our response containment protocols. These processes have been supported by cybersecurity experts, and these include Dallas SecureWorks, a global instant response leader. 
These actions included taking preventative measures, including shutting down certain systems out of an abundance of caution. We've been in active communication with law enforcement. While our incident response is still ongoing, we currently have no evidence that our customers' or teammates' data has been compromised. 
In addition to our containment, recovery and remediation efforts, we've taken steps to supplement the existing security monitoring, scanning and antivirus protocols already in place. We're committed to completing a full forensic investigation, and we're taking all appropriate actions in response to our findings. 
WestRock maintains a broad set of insurance coverages that provide protection for the business operations and assets of the company. Throughout this entire incident, we've been in constant communication with our customers to share with them the impact on their business. We've been very appreciative of their understanding and support as we work through this challenging situation. Our teammates and third-party experts have literally been working day and night to respond to this attack and safely restore our systems.
Our response is varied by operating the location. Most of our mills in converting locations have continued to produce and deliver. In locations where we've had systems issues, we have been and are using alternative and in Mines' manual methods to process and ship orders, and this has limited our shipments. The full restoration of the administrative processes of our business will take time. And we're implementing workarounds, including manual processes. We're doing all that we can, throughout our company, to respond to our customers' needs. 
We're only 5 days into this, and we're in the middle of our response. What I've shared with you represents the information that we can share at this point, given where we're at in the stage of our response. We'll provide additional detail on the impact of the attack at the appropriate time. 
Now let's turn to the quarter. WestRock remains very well positioned for long-term success, as demonstrated by our strong results in the quarter. Our markets continue to be shaped by changing customer habits and preferences that are driving increased demand for sustainable fiber-based packaging. These trends fit well with our strategy of increasing our participation in high value-added packaging solutions and away from sales of lower-margin commodity paper products.
Our overall packaging volumes increased by 5% in the fiscal -- in the first fiscal quarter, including e-commerce volume growth of 23% on a per day basis. North American corrugated box shipments increased more than 11% per day in December and over 8% for the quarter. Consumer shipments of packaging were also very strong, up 2.4% year-over-year. 
We executed our strategic projects during the quarter, despite immense challenges that the pandemic has presented for large construction projects. Our teams that are completing the projects at our Florence and Tres Barras mills have made tremendous progress. We successfully started up our 710,000 ton paper machine at Florence that has replaced 3 older obsolete paper machines. 
We successfully completed a major outage at our Tres Barras mill during the quarter, and this sets us up to complete our major expansion project in the spring. Our company generates strong free cash flow over the long term. 
This quarter's cash flow was exceptional. We generated $562 million of adjusted free cash flow in the quarter. We used the vast majority of this cash flow to reduce our net funded debt by $489 million. Our net leverage ratio declined sequentially from 3.03x to 2.86x. We expect that fiscal '21 will be the sixth consecutive year of strong free cash flow. We have increasing line of sight toward returning to our targeted leverage ratio of 2.25 to 2.5x. All of this performance is being delivered in very challenging circumstances by the incredibly resilient WestRock team. We recognized each one of our teammates in the quarter with a onetime payment that accumulated to a total of $22 million.
Let's turn to Slide 5. Sales of $4.4 billion, adjusted segment EBITDA of $670 million and adjusted EPS of $0.61 per share in the quarter were all in line with the prior year quarter. Our packaging business has proven to be resilient throughout the pandemic. Packaging volumes, measured in tons, were 5% higher compared to the prior year. Offsetting this were declines in shipments of export containerboard, especially SBS and pulp, that totaled 470,000 tons. This was a decline of approximately 180,000 tons or 27% lower than last year. The increase in sales of higher value-added packaging more than offset lower corrugated pricing from previously published index reductions.
RISI has published higher prices in multiple grades during the fiscal -- first fiscal quarter. This includes containerboard, specialty craft, CNK and CRB that we expect will benefit our results during the balance of the fiscal year. Cost inflation was driven primarily by higher OCC prices and ongoing wage and health care cost increases and was offset by continued productivity gains and KapStone synergies.
Our free cash flow was unusually strong in the first fiscal quarter, and this was aided by WestRock's pandemic action plan. We remain focused on increasing our share of higher value-added packaging and reducing our dependence on sales of paper to less attractive markets. We made progress during the quarter. 73% of our sales were packaging sales, an increase of 5% or approximately 100,000 tons compared to last year. The growth in packaging was driven by higher e-commerce demand, strong industrial shipments, including our Victory distribution channel as well as growth across our food, beverage, beauty and health care markets, with customers further utilizing our innovative solutions. 
Shipments of paper declined by 10% or 180,000 tons compared to last year. This included a reduction of 125,000 tons in shipments of export containerboard. Higher box demand in North America required us to shift production to serve higher-value integrated box and domestic containerboard customers. 
In Consumer, we had similar demand trends. Strong volumes in our domestic food and beverage packaging and paperboard business led to a production shift to those higher-value markets. The pricing environment has improved and record a RESI published price increases across several of our major grades, including a $50 per ton North American containerboard increase in November and a $40 per ton unbleached kraft price increase in December. We're in the process of implementing these published price increases in our business. 
Our integrated mill converting distribution and machinery capabilities provide us the platform to provide our customers with value-added packaging solutions. We placed more than 100 machinery solutions in the quarter, bringing our total machine replacements to more than 4,150. Customer demand for machinery solutions continues to grow, as they seek ways to improve their productivity and navigate the challenges caused by the pandemic. 
For instance, a number of large retailers are implementing our Pack on-demand and Box on-demand systems to grow their ship-from-store business. Our vision is to be the premier partner and unrivaled provider of sustainable winning solutions for our customers. 
Sustainable fiber-based packaging is a key component of the circular economy. We're partnering with our customers to help them achieve their sustainability goals. We've collaborated with the Home Depot to develop custom packaging for plants and horticulture products. This example highlights our ability to solve our customers' critical challenges and enhance their ability to participate in the e-commerce channel. 
We've collaborated with Kraft Heinz to launch the new Heinz eco-friendly sleeve multipack in the United Kingdom. By replacing plastic with fully recyclable fiber-based packaging, Kraft Heinz will remove over 500 tons of plastic from supermarket shelves and reduce their CO2 footprint by 18%.  This innovative project has incorporated the carton design, paperboard science and machinery capabilities of the WestRock Enterprise team.
For Titan Farms, our enterprise team has developed attractive folding carton containers for peaches that provide both ventilation and product protection. We're replacing plastic clam shelves with fiber-based packaging and helping our customers meet their sustainability goals. 
And for General Motors, we supplied them with a complete portfolio of packaging to rebrand their AC Delco product line, including very valuable counterfeit protection. This is an enterprise win that leverages our digital platform capability to bring our customers connected packaging solutions. 
The pandemic has brought many challenges and forced business to operate differently in through different channels. We're well positioned to support our customers with the packaging and supply chain solutions that help them succeed in their markets. 
Let's turn to Slide 8. Coordinated Packaging segment delivered adjusted EBITDA of $458 million in the first quarter. Corrugated box demand was strong across most end markets, highlighted by e-commerce year-over-year growth of 23% as well as strength in beverage, industrial and distribution through our Victory Packaging business. 
Higher box demand has allowed us to shift our containerboard shipments away from lower-margin export markets to serve our higher value box and domestic customers. Our export shipments fell by 125,000 tons compared to the prior year, and our integration rate increased to 80% in the quarter. 
Offsetting this favorable business mix was the continued flow-through of the total of $40 per ton of containerboard index price declines that occurred in late 2019 and early 2020 as well as the $36 per ton increase in recycled fiber costs as compared to last year. We've been implementing the $50 per ton containerboard index price increase that PPW published in November. [indiscernible] system operated well, with no economic downtime taken in the quarter. 
We completed the KapStone acquisition just over 2 years ago, and have achieved our target of $200 million in annual run rate synergies. This includes our reconfiguration of the North Charleston mill. When we acquired KapStone, we saw that we would be able to improve their operations and fill out the geographic footprint of our North American corrugated mill and box plant system to better serve our customers. This has worked well.
Victory Packaging, our distribution business, has worked out better than we anticipated due to our ability to integrate supply chain solutions into our service offerings. This has been even more important during the pandemic.
In Brazil, no outage reduced total mill production by approximately 48,000 tons. The production, sales and earnings decline was a direct result of the outage as market conditions remained strong in the region. 
The Consumer Packaging segment's adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was $234 million, so a $50 million increase from the prior year. Adjusted segment EBITDA margins increased by 270 basis points to 14.7% compared to the prior year. Strong demand across our core food, beverage and health care packaging end markets drove 2.4% higher converting shipments and $18 million higher EBITDA by shifting shipments away from lower-margin SBS and pulp markets.
Our mill and converting system ran well in the quarter. Cost reductions and efficiency improvements contributed $40 million of productivity and operational improvements in the quarter. While SBS demand in the foodservice and commercial print markets was lower compared to the prior year, we saw a sequential improvement in both markets compared to our fiscal 2020 fourth quarter. We took 39,000 tons of economic downtime primarily in the first 2 months of the quarter. This compares to 87,000 tons in our fiscal 2020 fourth quarter.
As we noted previously, we restarted our idled paper machine at Covington in the quarter due to increased demand. Backlogs increased in the quarter to between 4 and 6 weeks across all of our consumer grades, including SBS and inventories remained steady.
We're developing alternatives to capture more value from our current assets, and we made significant progress during the quarter. In addition to running containerboard at the Evadale mill, we're qualifying CNK from [indiscernible] to serve our customers' growing CNK needs while reducing SBS production. We're still in the process of trialing the Board with our customers as well as working through the engineering needed to ramp up production. 
So to our fiscal second quarter, we see strong demand across our core packaging markets. We're implementing the PPW paperboard price increases that were published during our fiscal first quarter.
Now I'll turn it over to Ward. Ward?"

Over the past 3 quarters, the plan has contributed an additional $600 million in cash. We are on track to achieve our goal of approximately $1 billion in additional cash available for debt reduction through the end of calendar year 2021.
We started the year with a strong first quarter. Going forward, we see opportunities to grow earnings given the strong demand for paper-based packaging, along with implementing the previously published price increases and recognizing the benefits of our strategic capital projects. We have a strong track record of generating free cash flow. Each of the past 5 years, we have generated more than $1 billion of adjusted free cash flow, and we have generated over $1.6 billion of adjusted free cash flow during the past 12 months.
With our ability to generate strong free cash flow, we have a road map to return our net leverage ratio to the targeted range of 2.25 to 2.5x. And as Steve mentioned, we continue to work on remediation and recovery from the ransomware attack. We will provide additional detail on the financial impact of the attack and provide an outlook for the quarter and the year at the appropriate time.
Turning to Slide 12. We've been very clear about our near-term focus on paying down debt, investing in our business and returning capital to our stockholders through our dividend. Over the past 12 months, we've reduced our adjusted net debt by more than $1.3 billion, and our net leverage ratio has improved from 3.01x to 2.86x.
Capital investment plans remain unchanged, and we still expect fiscal 2021 capital investments of $800 million to $900 million. Our Florence paper machine started up this past quarter, and we expect the Tres Barras project to be completed during the spring and begin ramping up in the second half of the fiscal year. These strategic investments, combined with our KapStone synergy realization, will contribute approximately $125 million of EBITDA in fiscal year '21 and a similar amount in fiscal year '22.
Longer term, we expect normal capital investment levels will be between $900 million and $1 billion. Our cash flows are resilient. We will continue to pay a competitive and growing dividend, and we also expect the potential for M&A opportunities that help us grow our packaging business and our integration rate. 
WestRock continues to operate from a position of financial strength and is supported by our significant cash flow generation. We have minimal near-term debt maturities and approximately $3.4 billion of liquidity and a road map to return our leverage to our targeted range of 2.25 to 2.5x.
I'll turn it back over to Steve to provide some closing remarks and prepare for Q&A. Thank you, Steve."

I remain very optimistic about WestRock for the long term. Here's why.
WestRock provides sustainable fiber-based packaging. It's a market that's benefited from recent trends and consumer preferences and buying behavior that we expect to continue in our favor. We're remarkably well positioned to meet our customers' needs. We see strong supply and demand conditions in almost every major grade as well as strong demand for our converting and machinery solutions.
Export markets are tightening. The need for packaging to serve the state at home economy as well as sustainable fiber-based packaging to replace plastic is growing. The investments that we've made in our box plant system, our mill system and our capabilities are benefiting our results, and we'll continue to do so as we bring our strategic projects online over the next year.
We're generating very attractive free cash flows, but over the near term, will be used to reduce debt and our leverage ratio, and longer term, will be used to return capital to our stockholders and grow our business. All of our success is due to the incredibly resilient WestRock team that is dealt with and is dealing with changing market conditions, COVID-19 and our ransomware attack. Our resilience gives me confidence in our ability to succeed and to create value for our customers, communities and stockholders.
That concludes my prepared remarks. James. We're ready for Q&A."

I want to hit first really on the leverage from volume in corrugated and whether it was where you had expected it to be. Obviously, you had a lot of ongoing productivity programs. 
But with the very strong volume you saw in a per work day basis and corrugated, I would have expected a bit more year-on-year improvement in EBITDA in the segment. And relatedly, in Brazil, even when I make the adjustments for Tres Barras and the $15 million, I think the EBITDA, guys, correct me if I'm wrong, was flat year-on-year. But it's been a booming market, you're getting 5% to 10% pricing in the marketing cargo. It's just interested if the leverage that you got out of the volume there was as expected?"

It sounds like you're considering moving more to coated or unbleached kraft as opposed to bleach? But could you talk a little bit more about how you expect to roll that through your system and the related work behind that?"

So we are expecting some changes in mix as we go forward, and we continue to focus on our packaging markets that tend to be much higher value and faster growth. So think of moving those products towards or the mix towards retail food and quick-serve restaurant, beverage and health care as well.
Now that takes a mix of our products across CNK, CRB as well as SBS, and so driving those packaging volumes is extremely important to us. And as you know, SBS has been more challenged, particularly during the COVID pandemic crisis and commercial print, liquid packaging and pay stock has been down significantly year-over-year. And part of our action plan there is to -- has been to reduce the amount of SBS capacity in our system. So we announced a $200,000 reduction -- or 200,000 ton reduction of capacity in SBS at our Evadale mill in the last quarter.
And as you pointed out and Steve commented, the shift of some SBS production at Evadale to CNK is very important because some of the growth that we're seeing in our packaging markets is both across food and beverage, and we want to be able to support that. So over time, we'll be moving this business towards a more favorable mix and packaging in those areas that are growing and reducing our exposure to some of those SBS -- specialty SBS markets.
And I think one last comment is around sustainable packaging. We have literally a dozen customers -- dozens of customers are making claims and setting goals towards 2025 and even beyond for 100% recyclable, compostable or reusable packaging. And fiber-based packaging has a really important component in that with some tailwinds you've seen in some of the examples we've shared recently in beverage, food and food service. So with those moves, we feel confident we're going to continue to improve the mix of the business."

So I think we've been -- when we look at -- we are seeing a return of inflation in our business, and I think a key component of it is recycled fiber cost.
When you look back at FY '20, we actually had a decline in recycled fiber on a year-over-year basis. So we actually had cost deflation from that component of our cost. What we're seeing is a normal level of cost inflation for us, if you just go back all the way back to the acquisition, it's about $225 million a year. 
We're expecting higher inflation this year because of the increase in recycled fiber cost. In fact, our outlook right now is that recycled fiber costs will potentially increase $15 to $20 sequentially from Q1 to Q2, and then maybe another $5 per quarter as we go out into Q3 and Q4. So that would be a meaningful increase on a year-over-year basis, driving cost inflation for that component of our business.
We are -- in the short term, we're seeing pressure in freight cost. And it's really been as a result of the pandemic. And then we have our normal wage and health care inflation.

I'm going to start with an overview and update on the ransomware attack that we reported on Monday. We're following strict protocols laid out by industry-standard incident response directives. Because of this, we're being careful not to share certain details around the incident at this time.  
However, following is information that I can share with you today. On Saturday, January 23, our systems identified what we've quickly determined was a ransomware attack. We immediately implemented our business continuity processes and initiated our response containment protocols. These processes have been supported by cybersecurity experts, and these include Dell SecureWorks, a global instant response leader.  
These actions included taking preventative measures, including shutting down certain systems out of an abundance of caution. We've been in active communication with law enforcement. While our incident response is still ongoing, we currently have no evidence that our customers' or teammates' data has been compromised.  
In addition to our containment, recovery and remediation efforts, we've taken steps to supplement the existing security monitoring, scanning and antivirus protocols already in place. We're committed to completing a full forensics investigation, and we're taking all appropriate actions in response to our findings.  
WestRock maintains a broad set of insurance coverages that provide protection for the business operations and assets of the company. Throughout this entire incident, we've been in constant communication with our customers to share with them the impact on their business. 
We've been very appreciative of their understanding and support as we work through this challenging situation. Our teammates and third-party experts have literally been working day and night to respond to this attack and safely restore our systems.  
Our response is varied by operating the location. Most of our mills and converting locations have continued to produce and deliver. In locations where we've had systems issues, we have been and are using alternative and, in many cases, manual methods to process and ship orders, and this has limited our shipments. 
The full restoration of the administrative processes of our business will take time, and we're implementing workarounds, including manual processes. We're doing all that we can throughout our company to respond to our customers' needs.  
We're only 5 days into this, and we're in the middle of our response. What I've shared with you represents the information that we can share at this point given where we're at in the stage of our response. We'll provide additional detail on the impact of the attack at the appropriate time.
Now let's turn to the quarter. WestRock remains very well positioned for long-term success, as demonstrated by our strong results in the quarter. Our markets continue to be shaped by changing customer habits and preferences that are driving increased demand for sustainable fiber-based packaging. These trends fit well with our strategy of increasing our participation in high value-added packaging solutions and away from sales of lower-margin commodity paper products.  
Our overall packaging volumes increased by 5% in the fiscal -- in the first fiscal quarter, including e-commerce volume growth of 23% on a per day basis. North American corrugated box shipments increased more than 11% per day in December and over 8% for the quarter. Consumer shipments of packaging were also very strong, up 2.4% year-over-year.  
We executed our strategic projects during the quarter, despite immense challenges that the pandemic has presented for large construction projects. Our teams that are completing the projects at our Florence and Tres Barras mills have made tremendous progress. We successfully started up our 710,000 ton paper machine at Florence that has replaced 3 older obsolete paper machines. We successfully completed a major outage at our Tres Barras mill during the quarter, and this sets us up to complete our major expansion project in the spring. 
Our company generates strong free cash flow over the long term. This quarter's cash flow was exceptional. We generated $562 million of adjusted free cash flow in the quarter. We used the vast majority of this cash flow to reduce our net funded debt by $489 million. 
Our net leverage ratio declined sequentially from 3.03x to 2.86x. We expect that fiscal '21 will be the sixth consecutive year of strong free cash flow. We have increasing line of sight toward returning to our targeted leverage ratio of 2.25 to 2.5x. 
All of this performance is being delivered in very challenging circumstances by the incredibly resilient WestRock team. We recognized each one of our teammates in the quarter with a onetime payment that accumulated to a total of $22 million.  
Let's turn to Slide 5. Sales of $4.4 billion, adjusted segment EBITDA of $670 million and adjusted EPS of $0.61 per share in the quarter were all in line with the prior year quarter. Our packaging business has proven to be resilient throughout the pandemic. Packaging volumes measured in tons were 5% higher compared to the prior year. 
Offsetting this were declines in shipments of export containerboard, especially SBS and pulp, that totaled 470,000 tons. This was a decline of approximately 180,000 tons or 27% lower than last year. The increase in sales of higher value-added packaging more than offset lower corrugated pricing from previously published index reductions.  
RISI has published higher prices in multiple grades during the fiscal -- first fiscal quarter. This includes containerboard, specialty kraft, CNK and CRB, that we expect will benefit our results during the balance of the fiscal year. Cost inflation was driven primarily by higher OCC prices and ongoing wage and health care cost increases and was offset by continued productivity gains and KapStone synergies.  
Our free cash flow was unusually strong in the first fiscal quarter, and this was aided by WestRock's pandemic action plan. We remain focused on increasing our share of higher value-added packaging and reducing our dependence on sales of paper to less attractive markets. 
We made progress during the quarter. 73% of our sales were packaging sales, an increase of 5% or approximately 100,000 tons compared to last year. The growth in packaging was driven by higher e-commerce demand, strong industrial shipments, including our Victory distribution channel, as well as growth across our food, beverage, beauty and health care markets, with customers further utilizing our innovative solutions.  
Shipments of paper declined by 10% or 180,000 tons compared to last year. This included a reduction of 125,000 tons in shipments of export containerboard. Higher box demand in North America required us to shift production to serve higher-value integrated box and domestic containerboard customers.  
In Consumer, we had similar demand trends. Strong volumes in our domestic food and beverage packaging and paperboard business led to a production shift to those higher-value markets. 
The pricing environment has improved and record a RISI published pricing increases across several of our major grades, including a $50 per ton North American containerboard price increase in November and a $40 per ton unbleached kraft price increase in December. We're in the process of implementing these published price increases in our business. 
Our integrated mill converting distribution and machinery capabilities provide us the platform to provide our customers with value-added packaging solutions. We placed more than 100 machinery solutions in the quarter, bringing our total machinery replacements to more than 4, 150. 
Customer demand for machinery solutions continues to grow, as they seek ways to improve their productivity and navigate the challenges caused by the pandemic. For instance, a number of large retailers are implementing our Pak On Demand and Box On Demand systems to grow their ship-from-store business. 
Our vision is to be the premier partner and unrivaled provider of sustainable winning solutions for our customers. Sustainable fiber-based packaging is a key component of the circular economy. We're partnering with our customers to help them achieve their sustainability goals. 
We've collaborated with The Home Depot to develop custom packaging for plants and horticulture products. This example highlights our ability to solve our customers' critical challenges and enhance their ability to participate in the e-commerce channel. 
We've collaborated with Kraft Heinz to launch the new Heinz eco-friendly sleeve multipack in the United Kingdom. By replacing plastic with fully recyclable fiber-based packaging, Kraft Heinz will remove over 500 tons of plastic from supermarket shelves and reduce their CO2 footprint by 18%. This innovative project has incorporated the carton design, paperboard science and machinery capabilities of the WestRock Enterprise team. 
For Titan Farms, Enterprise team has developed attractive folding carton containers for peaches that provide both ventilation and product protection. We're replacing plastic clamshells with fiber-based packaging and helping our customers meet their sustainability goals.  
And for General Motors, we supplied them with a complete portfolio of packaging to rebrand their ACDelco product line, including very valuable counterfeit protection. This is an enterprise win that leverages our digital platform capability to bring our customers' connected packaging solutions.  
The pandemic has brought many challenges and forced business to operate differently and through different channels. We're well positioned to support our customers with the packaging and supply chain solutions that help them succeed in their markets.
Let's turn to Slide 8. Corrugated Packaging segment delivered adjusted EBITDA of $458 million in the first quarter. Corrugated box demand was strong across most end markets, highlighted by e-commerce year-over-year growth of 23% as well as strength in beverage, industrial and distribution through our Victory Packaging business.  
Higher box demand has allowed us to shift our containerboard shipments away from lower-margin export markets to serve our higher-value box and domestic customers. Our export shipments fell by 125,000 tons compared to the prior year, and our integration rate increased to 80% in the quarter.  
Offsetting this favorable business mix was the continued flow through of the total of $40 per ton of containerboard index price declines that occurred in late 2019 and early 2020 as well as the $36 per ton increase in recycled fiber cost as compared to last year. We've been implementing the $50 per ton containerboard index price increase that PPW published in November. 
Our mill system operated well, with no economic downtime taken in the quarter. We completed the KapStone acquisition just over 2 years ago and have achieved our target of $200 million in annual run rate synergies. This includes our reconfiguration of the North Charleston mill. When we acquired KapStone, we saw that we would be able to improve their operations and fill out the geographic footprint of our North American corrugated mill and box plant system to better serve our customers. This has worked well.  
Victory Packaging, our distribution business, has worked out better than we anticipated due to our ability to integrate supply chain solutions into our service offerings. This has been even more important during the pandemic.  
In Brazil, mill outage reduced total mill production by approximately 48,000 tons. The production, sales and earnings decline was a direct result of the outage as market conditions remained strong in the region.  
The Consumer Packaging segment's adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was $234 million, so a $50 million increase from the prior year. Adjusted segment EBITDA margins increased by 270 basis points to 14.7% compared to the prior year. Strong demand across our core food, beverage and health care packaging end markets drove 2.4% higher converting shipments and $18 million higher EBITDA by shifting shipments away from lower-margin SBS and pulp markets.  
Our mill and converting system ran well in the quarter. Cost reductions and efficiency improvements contributed $40 million of productivity and operational improvements in the quarter. While SBS demand in the foodservice and commercial print markets was lower compared to the prior year, we saw a sequential improvement in both markets compared to our fiscal 2020 fourth quarter. 
We took 39,000 tons of economic downtime primarily in the first 2 months of the quarter. This compares to 87,000 tons in our fiscal 2020 fourth quarter. As we noted previously, we restarted our idled paper machine at Covington in the quarter due to increased demand. Backlogs increased in the quarter to between 4 and 6 weeks across all of our consumer grades, including SBS, and inventories remained steady.  
We're developing alternatives to capture more value from our current assets, and we made significant progress during the quarter. In addition to running containerboard at the Evadale mill, we're qualifying CNK from Evadale to serve our customers' growing CNK needs, while reducing SBS production. We're still in the process of trialing the board with our customers as well as working through the engineering needed to ramp up production.  
So we're in our fiscal second quarter. We see strong demand across our core packaging markets. We're implementing the PPW paperboard price increases that were published during our fiscal first quarter.  
Now I'll turn it over to Ward. Ward?"

Over the past 3 quarters, the plan has contributed an additional $600 million in cash. We are on track to achieve our goal of approximately $1 billion in additional cash available for debt reduction through the end of calendar year 2021.  
We started the year with a strong first quarter. Going forward, we see opportunities to grow earnings given the strong demand for paper-based packaging, along with implementing the previously published price increases and recognizing the benefits of our strategic capital projects. 
We have a strong track record of generating free cash flow. Each of the past 5 years, we have generated more than $1 billion of adjusted free cash flow, and we have generated over $1.6 billion of adjusted free cash flow during the past 12 months.  
With our ability to generate strong free cash flow, we have a road map to return our net leverage ratio to the targeted range of 2.25 to 2.5x. And as Steve mentioned, we continue to work on remediation and recovery from the ransomware attack. We will provide additional detail on the financial impact of the attack and provide an outlook for the quarter and the year at the appropriate time.  
Turning to Slide 12. We've been very clear about our near-term focus on paying down debt, investing in our business and returning capital to our stockholders through our dividend. Over the past 12 months, we've reduced our adjusted net debt by more than $1.3 billion, and our net leverage ratio has improved from 3.01x to 2.86x.  
Capital investment plans remain unchanged, and we still expect fiscal 2021 capital investments of $800 million to $900 million. Our Florence paper machine started up this past quarter, and we expect the Tres Barras project to be completed during the spring and begin ramping up in the second half of the fiscal year. 
These strategic investments, combined with our KapStone synergy realization, will contribute approximately $125 million of EBITDA in fiscal year '21 and a similar amount in fiscal year '22. Longer term, we expect normal capital investment levels will be between $900 million and $1 billion. 
Our cash flows are resilient. We will continue to pay a competitive and growing dividend, and we also expect the potential for M&A opportunities that help us grow our packaging business and our integration rate.  
WestRock continues to operate from a position of financial strength and is supported by our significant cash flow generation. We have minimal near-term debt maturities, and approximately $3.4 billion of liquidity and a road map to return our leverage to our targeted range of 2.25 to 2.5x.  
I'll turn it back over to Steve to provide some closing remarks and prepare for Q&A. Thank you, Steve."

While the ransomware attack on WestRock is receiving our immediate attention and urgent response, I remain very optimistic about WestRock for the long term. Here's why.  
WestRock provides sustainable fiber-based packaging. It's a market that's benefited from recent trends in consumer preferences and buying behavior that we expect to continue in our favor. We're remarkably well positioned to meet our customers' needs. We see strong supply and demand conditions in almost every major grade as well as strong demand for our converting and machinery solutions.  
Export markets are tightening. The need for packaging to serve the stay-at-home economy as well as sustainable fiber-based packaging to replace plastic is growing. The investments that we've made on our box plant system, our mill system and our capabilities are benefiting our results and will continue to do so as we bring our strategic projects online over the next year.  
We're generating very attractive free cash flows that, over the near term, will be used to reduce debt and our leverage ratio and, longer term, will be used to return capital to our stockholders and grow our business. All of our success is due to the incredibly resilient WestRock team that has dealt with and is dealing with changing market conditions, COVID-19 and our ransomware attack. Our resilience gives me confidence in our ability to succeed and to create value for our customers, communities and stockholders.  
That concludes my prepared remarks. James, we're ready for Q&A."

I want to hit first really on the leverage from volume in corrugated and whether it was where you had expected it to be. Obviously, you had a lot of ongoing productivity programs. But with the very strong volume you saw in a per work day basis in corrugated, I would have expected a bit more year-on-year improvement in EBITDA in the segment. 
And relatedly, in Brazil, even when I make the adjustments for Tres Barras and the $15 million, I think the EBITDA, guys, correct me if I'm wrong, was flat year-on-year. But it's been a booming market, you're getting 5% to 10% pricing in the market in corrugated. Just interested if the leverage that you got out of the volume there was as expected."

So we are expecting some changes in mix as we go forward, and we continue to focus on our packaging markets that tend to be much higher value and faster growth. So think of moving those products towards -- or the mix towards retail food and quick-serve restaurant, beverage and health care as well. Now that takes a mix of our products across CNK, CRB as well as SBS, and so driving those packaging volumes is extremely important to us. 
And as you know, SBS has been more challenged, particularly during the COVID pandemic crisis and commercial print, liquid packaging and paper cup stock has been down significantly year-over-year. And part of our action plan there is to -- has been to reduce the amount of SBS capacity in our system. So we announced a $200,000 reduction -- or a 200,000 ton reduction of capacity in SBS at our Evadale mill in the last quarter.  
And as you pointed out and Steve commented, the shift of some SBS production at Evadale to CNK is very important because some of the growth that we're seeing in our packaging markets is both across food and beverage, and we want to be able to support that. So over time, we'll be moving this business towards a more favorable mix and packaging in those areas that are growing and reducing our exposure to some of those SBS -- specialty SBS markets.
And I think one last comment is around sustainable packaging. We have literally a dozen customers -- dozens of customers are making claims and setting goals towards 2025 and even beyond for 100% recyclable, compostable or reusable packaging. And fiber-based packaging has a really important component in that with some tailwinds you've seen in some of the examples we've shared recently in beverage, food and food service. So with those moves, we feel confident we're going to continue to improve the mix of the business."

This is day 6 and it's -- as much as I'd like to be able to report something, we're just not in a position to where we can report anything.
I think our disclosure on Gondi is -- but we do have a 30-some-odd percent interest, and we do have a relationship with them. And there's the opportunity, obviously, to change our interest over time. And I just don't have anything to report on that either. 
And then, lastly, on Longview, I will say we look at our system strategically about how we want to position it long term. And we look at alternatives, and we continue to look at all the alternatives for our system. And I just don't have anything to report on Longview. So as much as I'd like to be able to respond to each one of the questions, that's what I can tell you, Mark."

I'll take this one. So I think we've been -- when we look at -- we are seeing a return of inflation in our business, and I think a key component of it is recycled fiber cost.
When you look back at FY '20, we actually had a decline in recycled fiber on a year-over-year basis, so we actually had cost deflation from that component of our cost. What we're seeing is a normal level of cost inflation for us, if you just go back all the way back to the acquisition, it's about $225 million a year. 
We're expecting higher inflation this year because of the increase in recycled fiber cost. In fact, our outlook right now is that recycled fiber cost will potentially increase $15 to $20 sequentially from Q1 to Q2, and then maybe another $5 per quarter as we go out into Q3 and Q4. So that would be a meaningful increase on a year-over-year basis, driving cost inflation for that component of our business.
We are -- in the short term, we're seeing pressure in freight cost, and it's really been as a result of the pandemic. And then we have our normal wage and health care inflation.

And so I think you would have seen a bigger deficit in our price mix, had we not shipped as much into the box segment, it's really about the overall being able to ship more volume, I think, into our domestic, and obviously, into the box system because we literally shift everything we could get on the floor to a corrugator and make -- and also to a domestic customer.

It's great to be joining you all today on my first earnings call as WestRock's CEO. I've been in this role now for 7 weeks and have spent that time meeting with our customers, our business leaders and teammates. With every interaction, I'm impressed with the capability and strength of the WestRock team and couldn't be more excited about our future prospects. 
It's still early in this process, but what I'd like to do today is share with you my initial observations since joining and my priorities going forward. Before doing that, though, let me touch briefly on our performance in the second quarter, which Ward will discuss in more detail shortly. Faced with dual issues of the ransomware incident and a significant weather disruption, the team focused, executed and delivered for our customers, generating revenue of $4.4 billion, adjusted segment EBITDA of $641 million, an adjusted EPS of $0.54 per share. The ransomware and weather incidents lowered our adjusted EPS by $0.23. Ward will provide additional detail about our performance. 
I am pleased to say that we have fully restored our IT systems with all sites up and running, and we continue to make excellent progress on restoring our supply chain and customer service levels. During the time we were dealing with this incident, we prioritize serving our customers and incurred additional costs that impacted earnings in the quarter. We are accelerating investments that were on our IT development time line to further strengthen our infrastructure. Throughout these events, the WestRock team demonstrated incredible resiliency and dedication, and we have made a remarkable recovery. 
I want to extend my sincere thanks to my WestRock teammates for all they have done and continue to do for the company and our customers. With all of this now behind us, I'm confident in our team, our markets and our path forward. 
I mentioned at the start that much of my time over these first 7 weeks has been spent getting to know our company. I've toured 12 facilities, met virtually or in person with hundreds of teammates and spoken with many of our top customers. WestRock has built a unique portfolio, successfully integrating acquisitions and investing to create a differentiated set of capabilities with incredible opportunities for growth. I've seen firsthand how the Consumer, Corrugated and Machinery businesses work together and believe we can do even more to maximize the performance of our platform. 
We serve diversified and growing packaging end markets and the demand for fiber-based paper and packaging continues to gain momentum. Key markets that we serve, such as food and beverage, e-commerce and health care continue to grow. For example, the demand from customers for safe and secure e-commerce solutions has only been accelerated by the pandemic, and I believe this remains a significant opportunity that WestRock solutions are well positioned to address. 
One of my visits was to our high-quality, low-cost facility in Florence, South Carolina, and it was great to see the new state of the art paper machine up and running. This slide includes a QR code you can use to view a video of the mill and the new equipment. This machine produces high-performance containerboard grades at low basis weights and replaces 3 machines in our system. This mill is well positioned to serve a diverse set of customers seeking these low basis weights to drive more sustainable packaging solutions. This investment makes Florence one of the lowest cost virgin containerboard mills in North America. We expect Florence to ramp up to full capacity by the end of our fiscal fourth quarter. The Florence mill is a great example of a strategic capital investment that improves our capabilities, lowers our costs and expand margins. 
Looking forward, there are a few key priorities that I want to focus on. WestRock has a unique portfolio of sustainable fiber-based packaging and great opportunities to leverage the enterprise and help our customers win in their markets. The path to long-term shareholder value creation is through a focus on attractive markets where our differentiated portfolio and combination of products and services are valued and rewarded. 
We will also focus on improving our productivity and operational excellence across the enterprise, which are both important levers to grow earnings and margins. I believe strongly in the leadership role that WestRock can play in improving the circular economy and helping our customers improve the sustainability of their products. We recently refined our sustainability platform to focus on people and communities, bettering the planet and innovating for our customers and their customers. Whether it's developing new fiber-based packaging solutions that enable our customers to meet their sustainability goals, initiatives to reduce our own environmental impact or our work to improve the diversity and inclusion of our company, WestRock has substantial capabilities and opportunities to help drive a more sustainable future. 
In a more sustainable future means that we must focus on innovation to develop new fiber-based packaging that meets the needs of customers and consumers. Removing plastic from packaging and developing more sustainable packaging solutions through design, material science, digital and automation, continue to be growth drivers in our industry. WestRock has a capability to create new recyclable, fiber-based solutions that are good for our customers and the environment. 
Next, I'd like to share my initial thoughts on capital allocation. I believe that disciplined balanced capital allocation is a key factor in creating sustainable shareholder value. I'm impressed by the strength and stability of WestRock's cash flows and believe this is a positive attribute for the company and our investors. 
We will invest in our business to maintain and improve our assets and investments in acquisitions and strategic capital projects will be tightly aligned to our strategy and deliver returns above our cost of capital. We will remain committed to returning capital to our dividend and intend to steadily increase it every year. We've already taken the first step today with the announcement of a 20% increase to our quarterly dividend. Today's increase reflects our confidence in the outlook and cash flow generation of our business. 
In addition, we will evaluate share repurchases in the future as another way to return capital to shareholders. We remain committed to our investment-grade credit profile and believe that our leverage target of 2.25 to 2.5x is appropriate. And in the coming months, I'll share more detail about my priorities and vision for WestRock's future. 
And now I'll turn it over to Ward to provide our financial detail about the quarter. Ward?"
33897,709365962,2270221,"WestRock Company, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, May 05, 2021",2021-05-05,"Earnings Calls","IRSM Media Ltd","Executives","Thanks, David. We were able to serve our customers, deliver solid earnings and continue to reduce our leverage despite the challenges in the quarter. We generated revenue of $4.4 billion, adjusted segment EBITDA of $641 million and adjusted EPS of $0.54 p",1248,"Thanks, David. We were able to serve our customers, deliver solid earnings and continue to reduce our leverage despite the challenges in the quarter. We generated revenue of $4.4 billion, adjusted segment EBITDA of $641 million and adjusted EPS of $0.54 per share. These results were impacted by both the ransomware incident and winter weather. The 2 events negatively impacted revenue by $189 million. Adjusted segment EBITDA by $80 million and adjusted segment EBITDA margins by approximately 110 basis points. Adjusted EPS was $0.23 lower as a result of these events. 
In addition to the impact of the ransomware incident that we show on the adjusted segment EBITDA bridge, we also incurred $20 million in ransomware recovery costs. The $20 million of recovery costs were excluded from our adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. We estimate that the total insurance claim will be approximately $75 million, and we expect to recover the claim from our cyber and business interruption insurance coverage in future periods. 
It's important to look beyond the events in the quarter, to see the underlying trends in our business. Demand is strong, and we continue to focus on improving our business mix. In addition, we are currently implementing the published price increases across all of our paper grades. The implementation of these price increases and improved business mix drove $88 million in year-over-year earnings improvement. Notably, we had record second quarter North American box shipments, which increased 5.5% year-over-year on a per day basis. Cost inflation was driven by a $43 per ton increase in recycled fiber from Q2 of the prior year, coupled with higher chemical and energy costs resulting from the winter storm. 
Transportation costs were also higher due to tight availability across all modes. We did not exercise the option to purchase an additional 18.7% equity interest in Grupo Gondi. As a result, we recorded a charge of $22.5 million that we excluded from adjusted EPS. As we indicated earlier in the quarter, the lag in customer invoicing from the period when our systems were down negatively impacted our working capital in Q2. As expected, accounts receivable increased in the second quarter, and we expect receivables to normalize in the third quarter. Despite this, our net funded debt declined $74 million from Q1, and our net leverage decreased to 2.8x. Due to the decisive actions we have taken over the past year to strengthen our balance sheet, we have reduced our adjusted net debt by $1.6 billion. 
Demand continues to increase for sustainable fiber based packaging, and we sell into an attractive set of end markets. Our overall packaging volumes increased by 3% in Q2. Including e-commerce box volume growth of 18.4% on a per day basis. Our paper sales represent 27% of our total revenue in the company, and we are focused on reducing our participation in the export containerboard and specialty SBS markets. The pricing environment has improved across our paper and packaging grades, we are implementing published increases across our paper and packaging businesses as expected. 
Turning to segment results. Our Corrugated Packaging segment reported revenue of $2.9 billion and adjusted segment EBITDA of $438 million. North American adjusted segment EBITDA would have been $54 million higher and margins approximately 140 basis points higher without the events in the quarter. Corrugated box demand is very strong across most of our end markets. And we reported record per day shipments for the second quarter. As I said earlier, Corrugated box shipments were up 5.5% per day year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the ransomware and weather incidents per day box shipments would have increased approximately 8%. 
We lost approximately 121,000 tons of containerboard production and revenue due to the disruptions in the quarter. This directly impacted our external containerboard channels sales as we could have sold all of the lost production. We highlighted the primary drivers of cost inflation earlier, higher recycled fiber, energy, chemical and transportation costs. However, we offset this inflation in the quarter through higher pricing and volume, excluding the impact of the events. 
We also continue to implement the previously published price increases and expect the benefit of these increases to more than outweigh inflation. Inventory levels remain low as we head into our peak mill outage quarter in Q3 with 112,000 tons of planned maintenance outage downtime. 
Finally, we are making great progress on our strategic capital projects. The Florence mill continues to increase its production and operate well. As David commented earlier, we expect the mill to be at full production levels at the end of the fourth fiscal quarter. The margins in Brazil have been lower in the past 2 quarters as a result of the maintenance and capital outage related to the Tres Barras expansion. Demand is strong in the Brazilian market, and we expect margins to improve in the second half of the fiscal year. 
Turning to Consumer Packaging. The segment reported revenue of $1.6 billion. And adjusted segment EBITDA of $212 million. EBITDA would have been $26 million higher and margins approximately 100 basis points higher without the events in the quarter. Our sales mix is improving by shifting to higher-margin food and beverage packaging sales. Food and beverage packaging revenues were up 4.7% year-over-year, driven by improved mix to quick service restaurants and beverage packaging. We lost approximately 46,000 tons of production and corresponding revenue due to the disruptions in the quarter.  In addition, we had approximately 20,000 tons of consumer paperboard shipments that were deferred into the third quarter due to these disruptions. Backlogs have increased across all substrates and are currently at 6 to 8 weeks. We are in the process of implementing the previously published price increases, the increased pricing improvement in our business mix and productivity more than offset inflation in the quarter. 
We continue to produce containerboard at our Evadale, Texas mill, given the strong demand and low inventory levels. In addition, we are making progress with CNK production at the Evadale mill and are on track to deliver 25,000 tons of CNK production in FY '21 and 50,000 tons of production in FY '22. We are able to flex the CNK and containerboard capacity from SBS with no additional capital investment. 
Turning to guidance. Here are some things to consider for our fiscal third quarter. We expect adjusted segment EBITDA of $775 million to $805 million and adjusted EPS of $0.88 to $0.97 per share. The primary drivers of our sequential increase include the implementation of the previously published price increases, continued strength in packaging demand and the return to normal operations for the third quarter. These items are partially offset by modest sequential inflation across recycled fiber, chemical and transportation costs. In addition, we will take approximately 112,000 tons of scheduled maintenance downtime across our North American containerboard mills. 
Finally, we expect higher incentive accruals due to a stronger earnings outlook. We want to share with you our current outlook for fiscal 2021. We expect the continued flow-through of the previously published price increases as well as packaging growth across our primary end markets. As a result, we expect full year adjusted segment EBITDA to be approximately $3.05 billion. Given our earnings outlook and continued strong cash flows, we fully expect to be within our leverage target of 2.25 to 2.5x by the end of the fiscal year. We will provide additional details on our next earnings call. 
And now I'll hand it back over to David for closing remarks.  David?"

I can't tell you how important it is to get our voice of the customer, I believe in a real outside in approach, customer-focused approach as we look at the business. One of my first meetings actually was with one of our largest customers, very strategic global account, and we happen to win the supplier of the year awards. So hopefully, all my customer meetings, go like that. 
But I would say several themes emerged when talking to a variety of customers. And I think it ties into what we need to do as a company. And the first one was sustainability. Our large strategic customers want their products to become more sustainable, and they want to partner with us to find those solutions. And this is really especially true with plastics replacement and the opportunity we have there. So concurrent to that, I think innovation is going to play a critical role in our growth and sustainability, but also innovation across all of our products and services and including digital in our machinery businesses. So we've got to get sustainability and innovation right, to your point earlier. And then the third thing I heard was service. I think with the pandemic, to your question, I think across multiple industries, it certainly accentuated the stress across supply chains worldwide. So reliable service and quality is critical for our customers and just take this opportunity to really thank our teammates at WestRock when we went through the ransomware attack, how well they communicated and kept our customers going. And as Ward alluded to, we did incur some costs to do that, but that was something we absolutely had to do to service our customers. 
And I think one last thing that I heard from our strategic customers was the value they placed in our enterprise. And the approach in bringing everything together and how that can help them be more effective. So I think all that fits exceptionally well into our future vision. And the way I look at it is we really want our customers to come to us with their biggest challenges, and we want to help them be more successful in achieving their goals. 
So as I talk about what we must do. I talked about sustainability and innovation. And the enterprise value proposition, the differentiation that we bring and it's not only from a customer growth standpoint, but I believe it's also from an operational standpoint, leveraging our manufacturing and supply chain, our footprint and our assets and just having a relentless drive on productivity. We're going to be really focused here to drive efficiency, lower our costs and improve our margins. 
And then finally, the last piece would be our acceleration around the discipline in our capital allocation. I talked about the importance of reinvesting in our business for safety and maintenance, but also capital projects that really drive that productivity that we talked about, really believe in a sustainable growing dividend. And I think today was the first step in doing and showing the ability to drive that increase. We have a wonderful ability to generate cash in this business. So we look forward to continuing to grow our dividend. 
Accelerating our leverage to our target range of 2.25 to 2.5, which Ward mentioned earlier, we will achieve by the end of our fiscal year. And we'll be opportunistic with share repurchases. We -- We're going to invest our cash. We don't intend to hold on to it. We wanted to fuel growth and create value for our shareholders. So we'll continue to do that. And we'll look at M&A as it aligns to our strategy, and those are the real priorities that we have. So I think I captured everything. And then the last piece of your question is, if I got it, George, was trends. A couple of things we've seen through the pandemic. We've seen a huge increase in e-commerce and some of our food and beverage and health care segments. We fully expect e-commerce to continue to grow. This is a new reality, we think of the market. But as we get through the pandemic and things come back, we do believe retail, brick-and-mortar, beauty, industrial will continue to come back as things open up. And that's why I'm so excited about the breadth of our portfolio because no matter where the markets take us, we feel confident in the products we have. And I'd love to have Jeff just reemphasize some of the volumes we've seen in April now that we've come out of this and just see the trends that we're seeing."

Overall, the demand in the business was strong across a broad base of end markets that David just outlined. So Ward commented, we were up 5.5% in the quarter. And actually, if it wasn't for weather and cyber would have been up almost 8%. We left April was not closed yet. So I don't have the final number, but we were up 12% in shipments year-over-year as we left the month, which is a record level for April shipments. And the demand is strong across almost all of our end markets still. So e-com remains strong, our distribution taper retail, industrial. Also, our backlogs remain strong coming into May. Our pipeline was up $90 million year-over-year coming into the quarter, almost 22% increase, and we continue to onboard new and incremental business. 
Domestic markets remain strong. You asked about lingering effects for us, it's really getting our inventories back in line. And with the outages this quarter, it's probably going to take this quarter into next to really get back to the inventories. And we took 160,000 tons out of export. So getting back to some of our direct being able to fully supply some of our contract customers, we need to make up tonnage as we've significantly reduced in our export markets even to some of our contract customers in the last 2 quarters. So that's been a lingering effect. But overall, integration rates are up to 82%, up from 78% last year, 80% in the first quarter. Demand is strong in all of our segments. And finally, thankfully, out of this last quarter, we're back to full operations, and we've operated well through April."

So I'll talk a little bit about consumer and what we're seeing. We still see strong demand even in last quarter and into this quarter and through the remainder of the year, the demand is continues to be strong and general folding carton as well as food and beverage. And certainly, the economy is going to shift a little bit with the preferences that people have in terms of getting back to the office and getting back out and being mobile again. But we still see these trends continuing. In fact, there was a conference here in mid-February, called the Consumer Analyst Group of New York conference. And the -- about 30 CPG companies were there, and they project over the near or midterm, about 2% to 3% growth in their businesses. So -- And that included kind of the end or slowing of the stay at home pandemics. So we're pretty robust and positive about that. I think health care is also one. We participate in COVID Test kits as well as in leaflets and inserts for the vaccine. So we're seeing good strength there. 
And I think the other driver for us that's really not dependent at all on the pandemic or recovery. Is this plastics replacement opportunity that David referred to and we've talked about before, we've already -- since July of 2018, commercialized over $200 million of plastics replacement. And we're envisioning right now. We're increasing our projection on that up to an incremental $300 million over the next few years. So we think that this is going to be really economically independent. It's really the sustainability trends that our customers have and our ability through new technology, through innovation to deliver new products for those customers. 
So David, I'll turn it back to you."

The way I look at the dividend is, first and foremost, I'm sure it's a sustainable and growing dividend. And then as part of our capital allocation principles is really allow for flexibility across the cyclicality in the markets that you mentioned. So if you think about it, the levers that we pull in regards to that, I mentioned the CapEx investments that are going to be constant. I think the team has done a terrific job deleveraging, so that gives us even more flexibility. So with that, we'll take a portion of how we -- of that available cash that we have and we'll look for the best return. It will be a steadily increasing dividend. If there's opportunistic share repurchases, we'll continue to look at that. And if there's M&A that aligns to our strategy, we'll look at that while remaining core to the rest of the principal. 
So the increase that we announced, we believe, was the right amount. We're very comfortable with it. We'll continue to assess it year-over-year. And we -- to give a specific number I don't think we're in a state to do that other than saying we're committed to a sustainable growing dividend despite market conditions.

And so we stopped that, obviously, on the call in January because of the timing of the ransomware event. But so what we thought it was important to do as we exited the quarter. And put these events behind us, we wanted to give you clarity for earnings for Q3, and then we gave you a reference point for the full year for earnings. But I'll shift to cash flow, and I'll talk about the strength in cash flow. So clearly, we had a really good first quarter from a cash flow point of view. Q2 was negatively impacted by the ransomware, as we had talked about during the quarter. And we're going to start to recover from that in Q3 and Q4. 
Seasonally, we always drive a large portion of our cash flow in the second half of the year. I'll just give you some reference points and let to demonstrate to you the power of the cash flow generation. So if you look over the last 2 years, we -- if you take our adjusted EBITDA, we convert 75% of that roughly to adjusted operating cash flow. You take that with the midpoint of the CapEx guidance that we've given you. And you see very, very strong cash flow generation for the full year and our ability to delever very quickly from where we are right now."

So we talked about in my prepared remarks, I think we said recycled fiber was up almost $43 a ton, I think, approximately year-over-year. So as you think going forward, remember, the comparison of recycled fiber, especially in Q2, is off a very low levels during FY '20. So my guidance as we think about Q3 and Q4 for inflation from where we are today is we're estimating that recycled fiber will be up approximately $15 from Q2 to Q3 and then another $5 from Q3 to Q4. If you look at the single biggest driver of inflation for us, and I've been signaling this all year-long was going to be recycled fiber. Recycled fiber on a year-over-year basis for the full year could be approximately $150 million based on the consumption of fiber that we have across our system. Then the other elements have been elevated energy costs off of last year's lows. And then the -- we've talked about the tightening freight markets. I gave guidance earlier in the year that I thought freight for the full year would be 3% to 5% on a year-over-year basis for the full year. We're on the high end of that range now. And then given the events that occurred in Texas related to the winter weather, that has had some impact on some of our chemicals. 
So historically, I've said that if you look at the average inflation for this business since the inception of WestRock's averaged about $225 million a year. It's going to be elevated this year simply because of the elevated energy and recycled fiber. And really, I've embedded those in our guidance. The sequential inflation outlook that I just talked about was included in our guidance for Q3 and then for the full year. And it just reinforces our need to drive productivity across the business."

And the piece on the multiple integration on the acquisitions we've made to your question, my observation is, it's critical that we extract all the value from bringing these businesses together. So I think about it, how do you make 1 plus 1 equal 3. So it's driving the productivity. It's ensuring our return on assets. It's leveraging the scale that we have and ensuring we get the return for the investments we've made.

It's great to be joining you all today on my first earnings call as WestRock's CEO. I've been in this role now for 7 weeks and have spent that time meeting with our customers, our business leaders and teammates. With every interaction, I'm impressed with the capability and strength of the WestRock team and couldn't be more excited about our future prospects. 
It's still early in this process, but what I'd like to do today is share with you my initial observations since joining and my priorities going forward. Before doing that, though, let me touch briefly on our performance in the second quarter, which Ward will discuss in more detail shortly. Faced with dual issues of the ransomware incident and a significant weather disruption, the team focused, executed and delivered for our customers, generating revenue of $4.4 billion, adjusted segment EBITDA of $641 million, an adjusted EPS of $0.54 per share. The ransomware and weather incidents lowered our adjusted EPS by $0.23. Ward will provide additional detail about our performance. 
I am pleased to say that we have fully restored our IT systems with all sites up and running, and we continue to make excellent progress on restoring our supply chain and customer service levels. During the time we were dealing with this incident, we prioritize serving our customers and incurred additional costs that impacted earnings in the quarter. We are accelerating investments that were on our IT development timeline to further strengthen our infrastructure. Throughout these events, the WestRock team demonstrated incredible resiliency and dedication, and we have made a remarkable recovery. 
I want to extend my sincere thanks to my WestRock teammates for all they have done and continue to do for the company and our customers. With all of this now behind us, I'm confident in our team, our markets and our path forward. 
I mentioned at the start that much of my time over these first 7 weeks has been spent getting to know our company. I've toured 12 facilities, met virtually or in person with hundreds of teammates and spoken with many of our top customers. WestRock has built a unique portfolio, successfully integrating acquisitions and investing to create a differentiated set of capabilities with incredible opportunities for growth. I've seen firsthand how the Consumer, Corrugated and Machinery businesses work together and believe we can do even more to maximize the performance of our platform. 
We serve diversified and growing packaging end markets and the demand for fiber-based paper and packaging continues to gain momentum. Key markets that we serve, such as food and beverage, e-commerce and health care continue to grow. For example, the demand from customers for safe and secure e-commerce solutions has only been accelerated by the pandemic, and I believe this remains a significant opportunity that WestRock solutions are well positioned to address. 
One of my visits was to our high-quality, low-cost facility in Florence, South Carolina, and it was great to see the new state of the art paper machine up and running. This slide includes a QR code you can use to view a video of the mill and the new equipment. This machine produces high-performance containerboard grades at low basis weights and replaces 3 machines in our system. This mill is well positioned to serve a diverse set of customers seeking these low basis weights to drive more sustainable packaging solutions. This investment makes Florence one of the lowest cost virgin containerboard mills in North America. We expect Florence to ramp up to full capacity by the end of our fiscal fourth quarter. The Florence mill is a great example of a strategic capital investment that improves our capabilities, lowers our costs and expands margins. 
Looking forward, there are a few key priorities that I want to focus on. WestRock has a unique portfolio of sustainable fiber-based packaging and great opportunities to leverage the enterprise and help our customers win in their markets. The path to long-term shareholder value creation is through a focus on attractive markets where our differentiated portfolio and combination of products and services are valued and rewarded. 
We will also focus on improving our productivity and operational excellence across the enterprise, which are both important levers to grow earnings and margins. I believe strongly in the leadership role that WestRock can play in improving the circular economy and helping our customers improve the sustainability of their products. We recently refined our sustainability platform to focus on people and communities, bettering the planet and innovating for our customers and their customers. Whether it's developing new fiber-based packaging solutions that enable our customers to meet their sustainability goals, initiatives to reduce our own environmental impact or our work to improve the diversity and inclusion of our company, WestRock has substantial capabilities and opportunities to help drive a more sustainable future. 
In a more sustainable future means that we must focus on innovation to develop new fiber-based packaging that meets the needs of customers and consumers. Removing plastic from packaging and developing more sustainable packaging solutions through design, material science, digital and automation, continue to be growth drivers in our industry. WestRock has a capability to create new recyclable, fiber-based solutions that are good for our customers and the environment. 
Next, I'd like to share my initial thoughts on capital allocation. I believe that disciplined balanced capital allocation is a key factor in creating sustainable shareholder value. I'm impressed by the strength and stability of WestRock's cash flows and believe this is a positive attribute for the company and our investors. 
We will invest in our business to maintain and improve our assets and investments in acquisitions and strategic capital projects will be tightly aligned to our strategy and deliver returns above our cost of capital. We will remain committed to returning capital to our dividend and intend to steadily increase it every year. We've already taken the first step today with the announcement of a 20% increase to our quarterly dividend. Today's increase reflects our confidence in the outlook and cash flow generation of our business. 
In addition, we will evaluate share repurchases in the future as another way to return capital to shareholders. We remain committed to our investment-grade credit profile and believe that our leverage target of 2.25x to 2.5x is appropriate. And in the coming months, I'll share more detail about my priorities and vision for WestRock's future. 
And now I'll turn it over to Ward to provide our financial detail about the quarter. Ward?"

We estimate that the total insurance claim will be approximately $75 million, and we expect to recover the claim from our cyber and business interruption insurance coverage in future periods. 
It's important to look beyond the events in the quarter, to see the underlying trends in our business. Demand is strong, and we continue to focus on improving our business mix. In addition, we are currently implementing the published price increases across all of our paper grades. The implementation of these price increases and improved business mix drove $88 million in year-over-year earnings improvement. Notably, we had record second quarter North American box shipments, which increased 5.5% year-over-year on a per day basis. Cost inflation was driven by a $43 per ton increase in recycled fiber from Q2 of the prior year, coupled with higher chemical and energy costs resulting from the winter storm. 
Transportation costs were also higher due to tight availability across all modes. We did not exercise the option to purchase an additional 18.7% equity interest in Grupo Gondi. As a result, we recorded a charge of $22.5 million that we excluded from adjusted EPS. As we indicated earlier in the quarter, the lag in customer invoicing from the period when our systems were down negatively impacted our working capital in Q2. As expected, accounts receivable increased in the second quarter, and we expect receivables to normalize in the third quarter. Despite this, our net funded debt declined $74 million from Q1, and our net leverage decreased to 2.8x. Due to the decisive actions we have taken over the past year to strengthen our balance sheet, we have reduced our adjusted net debt by $1.6 billion. 
Demand continues to increase for sustainable fiber-based packaging, and we sell into an attractive set of end markets. Our overall packaging volumes increased by 3% in Q2. Including e-commerce box volume growth of 18.4% on a per day basis. Our paper sales represent 27% of our total revenue in the company, and we are focused on reducing our participation in the export containerboard and specialty SBS markets. The pricing environment has improved across our paper and packaging grades, we are implementing published increases across our paper and packaging businesses as expected. 
Turning to segment results. Our Corrugated Packaging segment reported revenue of $2.9 billion and adjusted segment EBITDA of $438 million. North American adjusted segment EBITDA would have been $54 million higher and margins approximately 140 basis points higher without the events in the quarter. Corrugated box demand is very strong across most of our end markets. And we reported record per day shipments for the second quarter. As I said earlier, Corrugated box shipments were up 5.5% per day year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the ransomware and weather incidents per day box shipments would have increased approximately 8%. 
We lost approximately 121,000 tons of containerboard production and revenue due to the disruptions in the quarter. This directly impacted our external containerboard channels sales as we could have sold all of the lost production. We highlighted the primary drivers of cost inflation earlier, higher recycled fiber, energy, chemical and transportation costs. However, we offset this inflation in the quarter through higher pricing and volume, excluding the impact of the events. 
We also continue to implement the previously published price increases and expect the benefit of these increases to more than outweigh inflation. Inventory levels remain low as we head into our peak mill outage quarter in Q3 with 112,000 tons of planned maintenance outage downtime. 
Finally, we are making great progress on our strategic capital projects. The Florence mill continues to increase its production and operate well. As David commented earlier, we expect the mill to be at full production levels at the end of the fourth fiscal quarter. The margins in Brazil have been lower in the past 2 quarters as a result of the maintenance and capital outage related to the Tres Barras expansion. Demand is strong in the Brazilian market, and we expect margins to improve in the second half of the fiscal year. 
Turning to Consumer Packaging. The segment reported revenue of $1.6 billion. And adjusted segment EBITDA of $212 million. EBITDA would have been $26 million higher and margins approximately 100 basis points higher without the events in the quarter. Our sales mix is improving by shifting to higher-margin food and beverage packaging sales. Food and beverage packaging revenues were up 4.7% year-over-year, driven by improved mix to quick service restaurants and beverage packaging. We lost approximately 46,000 tons of production and corresponding revenue due to the disruptions in the quarter. In addition, we had approximately 20,000 tons of consumer paperboard shipments that were deferred into the third quarter due to these disruptions. Backlogs have increased across all substrates and are currently at 6 to 8 weeks. We are in the process of implementing the previously published price increases, the increased pricing improvement in our business mix and productivity more than offset inflation in the quarter. 
We continue to produce containerboard at our Evadale, Texas mill, given the strong demand and low inventory levels. In addition, we are making progress with CNK production at the Evadale mill and are on track to deliver 25,000 tons of CNK production in FY '21 and 50,000 tons of production in FY '22. We are able to flex the CNK and containerboard capacity from SBS with no additional capital investment. 
Turning to guidance. Here are some things to consider for our fiscal third quarter. We expect adjusted segment EBITDA of $775 million to $805 million and adjusted EPS of $0.88 to $0.97 per share. The primary drivers of our sequential increase include the implementation of the previously published price increases, continued strength in packaging demand and the return to normal operations for the third quarter. These items are partially offset by modest sequential inflation across recycled fiber, chemical and transportation costs. In addition, we will take approximately 112,000 tons of scheduled maintenance downtime across our North American containerboard mills. 
Finally, we expect higher incentive accruals due to a stronger earnings outlook. We want to share with you our current outlook for fiscal 2021. We expect the continued flow-through of the previously published price increases as well as packaging growth across our primary end markets. As a result, we expect full year adjusted segment EBITDA to be approximately $3.05 billion. Given our earnings outlook and continued strong cash flows, we fully expect to be within our leverage target of 2.25x to 2.5x by the end of the fiscal year. We will provide additional details on our next earnings call.

I appreciate the question and your comments. I'll try to answer each one of your questions. I'll start with customers. I can't tell you how important it is to get our voice of the customer, I believe in a real outside in approach, custo",796,"George, thank you. I appreciate the question and your comments. I'll try to answer each one of your questions. I'll start with customers. I can't tell you how important it is to get our voice of the customer, I believe in a real outside in approach, customer-focused approach as we look at the business. One of my first meetings actually was with one of our largest customers, very strategic global account, and we happen to win the supplier of the year awards. So hopefully, all my customer meetings, go like that. 
But I would say several themes emerged when talking to a variety of customers. And I think it ties into what we need to do as a company. And the first one was sustainability. Our large strategic customers want their products to become more sustainable, and they want to partner with us to find those solutions. And this is really especially true with plastics replacement and the opportunity we have there. So concurrent to that, I think innovation is going to play a critical role in our growth and sustainability, but also innovation across all of our products and services and including digital in our machinery businesses. So we've got to get sustainability and innovation right, to your point earlier. And then the third thing I heard was service. I think with the pandemic, to your question, I think across multiple industries, it certainly accentuated the stress across supply chains worldwide. So reliable service and quality is critical for our customers and just take this opportunity to really thank our teammates at WestRock when we went through the ransomware attack, how well they communicated and kept our customers going. And as Ward alluded to, we did incur some costs to do that, but that was something we absolutely had to do to service our customers. 
And I think one last thing that I heard from our strategic customers was the value they placed in our enterprise. And the approach in bringing everything together and how that can help them be more effective. So I think all that fits exceptionally well into our future vision. And the way I look at it is we really want our customers to come to us with their biggest challenges, and we want to help them be more successful in achieving their goals. 
So as I talk about what we must do. I talked about sustainability and innovation. And the enterprise value proposition, the differentiation that we bring and it's not only from a customer growth standpoint, but I believe it's also from an operational standpoint, leveraging our manufacturing and supply chain, our footprint and our assets and just having a relentless drive on productivity. We're going to be really focused here to drive efficiency, lower our costs and improve our margins. 
And then finally, the last piece would be our acceleration around the discipline in our capital allocation. I talked about the importance of reinvesting in our business for safety and maintenance, but also capital projects that really drive that productivity that we talked about, really believe in a sustainable growing dividend. And I think today was the first step in doing and showing the ability to drive that increase. We have a wonderful ability to generate cash in this business. So we look forward to continuing to grow our dividend. 
Accelerating our leverage to our target range of 2.25x to 2.5x, which Ward mentioned earlier, we will achieve by the end of our fiscal year. And we'll be opportunistic with share repurchases. We -- We're going to invest our cash. We don't intend to hold on to it. We wanted to fuel growth and create value for our shareholders. So we'll continue to do that. And we'll look at M&A as it aligns to our strategy, and those are the real priorities that we have. So I think I captured everything. And then the last piece of your question is, if I got it, George, was trends. A couple of things we've seen through the pandemic. We've seen a huge increase in e-commerce and some of our food and beverage and health care segments. We fully expect e-commerce to continue to grow. This is a new reality; we think of the market. But as we get through the pandemic and things come back, we do believe retail, brick-and-mortar, beauty, industrial will continue to come back as things open up. And that's why I'm so excited about the breadth of our portfolio because no matter where the markets take us, we feel confident in the products we have. And I'd love to have Jeff just reemphasize some of the volumes we've seen in April now that we've come out of this and just see the trends that we're seeing."

Overall, the demand in the business was strong across a broad base of end markets that David just outlined. So Ward commented, we were up 5.5% in the quarter. And actually, if it wasn't for weather and cyber, we would have been up almost 8%. We left April was not closed yet. So I don't have the final number, but we were up 12% in shipments year-over-year as we left the month, which is a record level for April shipments. And the demand is strong across almost all of our end markets still. So e-com remains strong, our distribution paper, retail, industrial. Also, our backlogs remain strong coming into May. Our pipeline was up $90 million year-over-year coming into the quarter, almost 22% increase, and we continue to onboard new and incremental business. 
Domestic markets remain strong. You asked about lingering effects for us, it's really getting our inventories back in line. And with the outages this quarter, it's probably going to take this quarter into next to really get back to the inventories. And we took 160,000 tons out of export. So getting back to some of our direct, being able to fully supply some of our contract customers, we need to make up tonnage as we've significantly reduced in our export markets even to some of our contract customers in the last 2 quarters. So that's been a lingering effect. But overall, integration rates are up to 82%, up from 78% last year, 80% in the first quarter. Demand is strong in all of our segments. And finally, thankfully, out of this last quarter, we're back to full operations, and we've operated well through April."

So I'll talk a little bit about consumer and what we're seeing. We still see strong demand even in last quarter and into this quarter and through the remainder of the year, the demand is continuing to be strong and general folding carton as well as food and beverage. And certainly, the economy is going to shift a little bit with the preferences that people have in terms of getting back to the office and getting back out and being mobile again. But we still see these trends continuing. In fact, there was a conference here in mid-February, called the Consumer Analyst Group of New York conference. And the -- about 30 CPG companies were there, and they project over the near or midterm, about 2% to 3% growth in their businesses. So -- And that included kind of the end or slowing of the stay-at-home pandemics. So we're pretty robust and positive about that. I think health care is also one. We participate in COVID Test kits as well as in leaflets and inserts for the vaccine. So we're seeing good strength there. 
And I think the other driver for us that's really not dependent at all on the pandemic or recovery. Is this plastics replacement opportunity that David referred to and we've talked about before, we've already -- since July of 2018, commercialized over $200 million of plastics replacement. And we're envisioning right now. We're increasing our projection on that up to an incremental $300 million over the next few years. So we think that this is going to be really economically independent. It's really the sustainability trends that our customers have and our ability through new technology, through innovation to deliver new products for those customers. 
So David, I'll turn it back to you."

And then as part of our capital allocation principles is really allow for flexibility across the cyclicality in the markets that you mentioned. So if you think about it, the levers that we pull in regards to that, I mentioned the CapEx investments that are going to be constant. I think the team has done a terrific job deleveraging, so that gives us even more flexibility. So with that, we'll take a portion of how we -- of that available cash that we have and we'll look for the best return. It will be a steadily increasing dividend. If there's opportunistic share repurchases, we'll continue to look at that. And if there's M&A that aligns to our strategy, we'll look at that while remaining core to the rest of the principal. 
So the increase that we announced, we believe, was the right amount. We're very comfortable with it. We'll continue to assess it year-over-year. And we -- to give a specific number I don't think we're in a state to do that other than saying we're committed to a sustainable growing dividend despite market conditions.

So the footprint there it's not just e-commerce, but e-commerce is a part of that, but there's a large broad base in that area. Our Midwest up in Michigan, our new plant from Box on Demand that we moved to Brownstone. We're actually going to make a box plant out of that plant. So we're going to continue to increase and invest in the eval platform, high-yield rotary die cutters. And then we're continuing to innovate in our machine business. So our 2.0 Pak On Demand, 2.0 our BoxSizer, those machinery investments are paying off, and we have great opportunity to expand on that. 
When we also expanded some investment in the Box on Demand sheet feeders where we have patents on tube technology on the corrugators. So we're actually making pouches coming off of our corrugators that had made fanfold so that's another investment that we're continuing to make. As far as new locations, we're going to look at and see what we might have to do in the future. And then also Victory, adding the 65 distribution centers for Victory, has put us in a good spot to help distribute into some of the retailers in to some of the e-com business for our customers who can't change their inventory or need quick turns through distribution, and that's a great way to work between the box plants and Victory. So a lot of positive things for us in our footprint investments and then Victory in our machine business."

And I mean, you heard Jeff talk about the machine. When you think about Machinery, Corrugated and Consumer for some of these customers, we can really tie all that together, and there's innovation to be had when we do that. And so when we have that ability to strategically align with our customers, for those complete solutions, that's where we'll focus. And there will certainly be some customers that separate the way you mentioned, and we'll treat them the way they want to buy. So it's not 100%, but there is significant value there. And just as a data point, I would tell you that our growth rate with enterprise customers is higher than non-enterprise customers. 
So we see this is a significant opportunity. It's already a multibillion-dollar sales platform for us. And then when you tie in the operational piece internally to really leverage our assets from an enterprise standpoint, we think there's tremendous value there. And that's something unique that we can bring to the market as we innovate in our approach in doing so."

And put these events behind us, we wanted to give you clarity for earnings for Q3, and then we gave you a reference point for the full year for earnings. But I'll shift to cash flow, and I'll talk about the strength in cash flow. So clearly, we had a really good first quarter from a cash flow point of view. Q2 was negatively impacted by the ransomware, as we had talked about during the quarter. And we're going to start to recover from that in Q3 and Q4. 
Seasonally, we always drive a large portion of our cash flow in the second half of the year. I'll just give you some reference points and let to demonstrate to you the power of the cash flow generation. So if you look over the last 2 years, we -- if you take our adjusted EBITDA, we convert 75% of that roughly to adjusted operating cash flow. You take that with the midpoint of the CapEx guidance that we've given you.

So we talked about in my prepared remarks, I think we said recycled fiber was up almost $43 a ton, I think, approximately year-over-year. So as you think going forward, remember, the comparison of recycled fiber, especially in Q2, is off a very low levels during FY '20. So my guidance as we think about Q3 and Q4 for inflation from where we are today is we're estimating that recycled fiber will be up approximately $15 from Q2 to Q3 and then another $5 from Q3 to Q4. If you look at the single biggest driver of inflation for us, and I've been signaling this all year-long was going to be recycled fiber. Recycled fiber on a year-over-year basis for the full year could be approximately $150 million based on the consumption of fiber that we have across our system. Then the other elements have been elevated energy costs off of last year's lows. And then the -- we've talked about the tightening freight markets. I gave guidance earlier in the year that I thought freight for the full year would be 3% to 5% on a year-over-year basis for the full year. We're on the high end of that range now. And then given the events that occurred in Texas related to the winter weather, that has had some impact on some of our chemicals. 
So historically, I've said that if you look at the average inflation for this business since the inception of WestRock's averaged about $225 million a year. It's going to be elevated this year simply because of the elevated energy and recycled fiber. And really, I've embedded those in our guidance. The sequential inflation outlook that I just talked about was included in our guidance for Q3 and then for the full year. And it just reinforces our need to drive productivity across the business."

It's leveraging the scale that we have and ensuring we get the return for the investments we've made.

It's great to be joining you all today on my first earnings call as WestRock's CEO. I've been in this role now for 7 weeks and have spent that time meeting with our customers, our business leaders and teammates. With every interaction, I'm impressed with the capability and strength of the WestRock team and couldn't be more excited about our future prospects. 
It's still early in this process, but what I'd like to do today is share with you my initial observations since joining and my priorities going forward. Before doing that, though, let me touch briefly on our performance in the second quarter, which Ward will discuss in more detail shortly. Faced with dual issues of the ransomware incident and a significant weather disruption, the team focused, executed and delivered for our customers, generating revenue of $4.4 billion, adjusted segment EBITDA of $641 million, an adjusted EPS of $0.54 per share. The ransomware and weather incidents lowered our adjusted EPS by $0.23. Ward will provide additional detail about our performance. 
I am pleased to say that we have fully restored our IT systems with all sites up and running, and we continue to make excellent progress on restoring our supply chain and customer service levels. During the time we were dealing with this incident, we prioritize serving our customers and incurred additional costs that impacted earnings in the quarter. We are accelerating investments that were on our IT development timeline to further strengthen our infrastructure. Throughout these events, the WestRock team demonstrated incredible resiliency and dedication, and we have made a remarkable recovery. 
I want to extend my sincere thanks to my WestRock teammates for all they have done and continue to do for the company and our customers. With all of this now behind us, I'm confident in our team, our markets and our path forward. 
I mentioned at the start that much of my time over these first 7 weeks has been spent getting to know our company. I've toured 12 facilities, met virtually or in person with hundreds of teammates and spoken with many of our top customers. WestRock has built a unique portfolio, successfully integrating acquisitions and investing to create a differentiated set of capabilities with incredible opportunities for growth. I've seen firsthand how the Consumer, Corrugated and Machinery businesses work together and believe we can do even more to maximize the performance of our platform. 
We serve diversified and growing packaging end markets and the demand for fiber-based paper and packaging continues to gain momentum. Key markets that we serve, such as food and beverage, e-commerce and health care continue to grow. For example, the demand from customers for safe and secure e-commerce solutions has only been accelerated by the pandemic, and I believe this remains a significant opportunity that WestRock solutions are well positioned to address. 
One of my visits was to our high-quality, low-cost facility in Florence, South Carolina, and it was great to see the new state of the art paper machine up and running. This slide includes a QR code you can use to view a video of the mill and the new equipment. This machine produces high-performance containerboard grades at low basis weights and replaces 3 machines in our system. This mill is well positioned to serve a diverse set of customers seeking these low basis weights to drive more sustainable packaging solutions. This investment makes Florence one of the lowest cost virgin containerboard mills in North America. We expect Florence to ramp up to full capacity by the end of our fiscal fourth quarter. The Florence mill is a great example of a strategic capital investment that improves our capabilities, lowers our costs and expands margins. 
Looking forward, there are a few key priorities that I want to focus on. WestRock has a unique portfolio of sustainable fiber-based packaging and great opportunities to leverage the enterprise and help our customers win in their markets. The path to long-term shareholder value creation is through a focus on attractive markets where our differentiated portfolio and combination of products and services are valued and rewarded. 
We will also focus on improving our productivity and operational excellence across the enterprise, which are both important levers to grow earnings and margins. I believe strongly in the leadership role that WestRock can play in improving the circular economy and helping our customers improve the sustainability of their products. We recently refined our sustainability platform to focus on people and communities, bettering the planet and innovating for our customers and their customers. Whether it's developing new fiber-based packaging solutions that enable our customers to meet their sustainability goals, initiatives to reduce our own environmental impact or our work to improve the diversity and inclusion of our company, WestRock has substantial capabilities and opportunities to help drive a more sustainable future. 
In a more sustainable future means that we must focus on innovation to develop new fiber-based packaging that meets the needs of customers and consumers. Removing plastic from packaging and developing more sustainable packaging solutions through design, material science, digital and automation, continue to be growth drivers in our industry. WestRock has a capability to create new recyclable, fiber-based solutions that are good for our customers and the environment. 
Next, I'd like to share my initial thoughts on capital allocation. I believe that disciplined balanced capital allocation is a key factor in creating sustainable shareholder value. I'm impressed by the strength and stability of WestRock's cash flows and believe this is a positive attribute for the company and our investors. 
We will invest in our business to maintain and improve our assets and investments in acquisitions and strategic capital projects will be tightly aligned to our strategy and deliver returns above our cost of capital. We will remain committed to returning capital to our dividend and intend to steadily increase it every year. We've already taken the first step today with the announcement of a 20% increase to our quarterly dividend. Today's increase reflects our confidence in the outlook and cash flow generation of our business. 
In addition, we will evaluate share repurchases in the future as another way to return capital to shareholders. We remain committed to our investment-grade credit profile and believe that our leverage target of 2.25x to 2.5x is appropriate. And in the coming months, I'll share more detail about my priorities and vision for WestRock's future. 
And now I'll turn it over to Ward to provide our financial detail about the quarter. Ward?"
33897,709365962,2285529,"WestRock Company, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, May 05, 2021",2021-05-05,"Earnings Calls","IRSM Media Ltd","Executives","Thanks, David. We were able to serve our customers, deliver solid earnings and continue to reduce our leverage despite the challenges in the quarter. We generated revenue of $4.4 billion, adjusted segment EBITDA of $641 million and adjusted EPS of $0.54 p",1247,"Thanks, David. We were able to serve our customers, deliver solid earnings and continue to reduce our leverage despite the challenges in the quarter. We generated revenue of $4.4 billion, adjusted segment EBITDA of $641 million and adjusted EPS of $0.54 per share. These results were impacted by both the ransomware incident and winter weather. The 2 events negatively impacted revenue by $189 million. Adjusted segment EBITDA by $80 million and adjusted segment EBITDA margins by approximately 110 basis points. Adjusted EPS was $0.23 lower as a result of these events. 
In addition to the impact of the ransomware incident that we show on the adjusted segment EBITDA bridge, we also incurred $20 million in ransomware recovery costs. The $20 million of recovery costs were excluded from our adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. We estimate that the total insurance claim will be approximately $75 million, and we expect to recover the claim from our cyber and business interruption insurance coverage in future periods. 
It's important to look beyond the events in the quarter, to see the underlying trends in our business. Demand is strong, and we continue to focus on improving our business mix. In addition, we are currently implementing the published price increases across all of our paper grades. The implementation of these price increases and improved business mix drove $88 million in year-over-year earnings improvement. Notably, we had record second quarter North American box shipments, which increased 5.5% year-over-year on a per day basis. Cost inflation was driven by a $43 per ton increase in recycled fiber from Q2 of the prior year, coupled with higher chemical and energy costs resulting from the winter storm. 
Transportation costs were also higher due to tight availability across all modes. We did not exercise the option to purchase an additional 18.7% equity interest in Grupo Gondi. As a result, we recorded a charge of $22.5 million that we excluded from adjusted EPS. As we indicated earlier in the quarter, the lag in customer invoicing from the period when our systems were down negatively impacted our working capital in Q2. As expected, accounts receivable increased in the second quarter, and we expect receivables to normalize in the third quarter. Despite this, our net funded debt declined $74 million from Q1, and our net leverage decreased to 2.8x. Due to the decisive actions we have taken over the past year to strengthen our balance sheet, we have reduced our adjusted net debt by $1.6 billion. 
Demand continues to increase for sustainable fiber-based packaging, and we sell into an attractive set of end markets. Our overall packaging volumes increased by 3% in Q2. Including e-commerce box volume growth of 18.4% on a per day basis. Our paper sales represent 27% of our total revenue in the company, and we are focused on reducing our participation in the export containerboard and specialty SBS markets. The pricing environment has improved across our paper and packaging grades, we are implementing published increases across our paper and packaging businesses as expected. 
Turning to segment results. Our Corrugated Packaging segment reported revenue of $2.9 billion and adjusted segment EBITDA of $438 million. North American adjusted segment EBITDA would have been $54 million higher and margins approximately 140 basis points higher without the events in the quarter. Corrugated box demand is very strong across most of our end markets. And we reported record per day shipments for the second quarter. As I said earlier, Corrugated box shipments were up 5.5% per day year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the ransomware and weather incidents per day box shipments would have increased approximately 8%. 
We lost approximately 121,000 tons of containerboard production and revenue due to the disruptions in the quarter. This directly impacted our external containerboard channels sales as we could have sold all of the lost production. We highlighted the primary drivers of cost inflation earlier, higher recycled fiber, energy, chemical and transportation costs. However, we offset this inflation in the quarter through higher pricing and volume, excluding the impact of the events. 
We also continue to implement the previously published price increases and expect the benefit of these increases to more than outweigh inflation. Inventory levels remain low as we head into our peak mill outage quarter in Q3 with 112,000 tons of planned maintenance outage downtime. 
Finally, we are making great progress on our strategic capital projects. The Florence mill continues to increase its production and operate well. As David commented earlier, we expect the mill to be at full production levels at the end of the fourth fiscal quarter. The margins in Brazil have been lower in the past 2 quarters as a result of the maintenance and capital outage related to the Tres Barras expansion. Demand is strong in the Brazilian market, and we expect margins to improve in the second half of the fiscal year. 
Turning to Consumer Packaging. The segment reported revenue of $1.6 billion. And adjusted segment EBITDA of $212 million. EBITDA would have been $26 million higher and margins approximately 100 basis points higher without the events in the quarter. Our sales mix is improving by shifting to higher-margin food and beverage packaging sales. Food and beverage packaging revenues were up 4.7% year-over-year, driven by improved mix to quick service restaurants and beverage packaging. We lost approximately 46,000 tons of production and corresponding revenue due to the disruptions in the quarter. In addition, we had approximately 20,000 tons of consumer paperboard shipments that were deferred into the third quarter due to these disruptions. Backlogs have increased across all substrates and are currently at 6 to 8 weeks. We are in the process of implementing the previously published price increases, the increased pricing improvement in our business mix and productivity more than offset inflation in the quarter. 
We continue to produce containerboard at our Evadale, Texas mill, given the strong demand and low inventory levels. In addition, we are making progress with CNK production at the Evadale mill and are on track to deliver 25,000 tons of CNK production in FY '21 and 50,000 tons of production in FY '22. We are able to flex the CNK and containerboard capacity from SBS with no additional capital investment. 
Turning to guidance. Here are some things to consider for our fiscal third quarter. We expect adjusted segment EBITDA of $775 million to $805 million and adjusted EPS of $0.88 to $0.97 per share. The primary drivers of our sequential increase include the implementation of the previously published price increases, continued strength in packaging demand and the return to normal operations for the third quarter. These items are partially offset by modest sequential inflation across recycled fiber, chemical and transportation costs. In addition, we will take approximately 112,000 tons of scheduled maintenance downtime across our North American containerboard mills. 
Finally, we expect higher incentive accruals due to a stronger earnings outlook. We want to share with you our current outlook for fiscal 2021. We expect the continued flow-through of the previously published price increases as well as packaging growth across our primary end markets. As a result, we expect full year adjusted segment EBITDA to be approximately $3.05 billion. Given our earnings outlook and continued strong cash flows, we fully expect to be within our leverage target of 2.25x to 2.5x by the end of the fiscal year. We will provide additional details on our next earnings call. 
And now I'll hand it back over to David for closing remarks.  David?"

I'll try to answer each one of your questions. I'll start with customers. I can't tell you how important it is to get our voice of the customer, I believe in a real outside in approach, customer-focused approach as we look at the business. One of my first meetings actually was with one of our largest customers, very strategic global account, and we happen to win the supplier of the year awards. So hopefully, all my customer meetings, go like that. 
But I would say several themes emerged when talking to a variety of customers. And I think it ties into what we need to do as a company. And the first one was sustainability. Our large strategic customers want their products to become more sustainable, and they want to partner with us to find those solutions. And this is really especially true with plastics replacement and the opportunity we have there. So concurrent to that, I think innovation is going to play a critical role in our growth and sustainability, but also innovation across all of our products and services and including digital in our machinery businesses. So we've got to get sustainability and innovation right, to your point earlier. And then the third thing I heard was service. I think with the pandemic, to your question, I think across multiple industries, it certainly accentuated the stress across supply chains worldwide. So reliable service and quality is critical for our customers and just take this opportunity to really thank our teammates at WestRock when we went through the ransomware attack, how well they communicated and kept our customers going. And as Ward alluded to, we did incur some costs to do that, but that was something we absolutely had to do to service our customers. 
And I think one last thing that I heard from our strategic customers was the value they placed in our enterprise. And the approach in bringing everything together and how that can help them be more effective. So I think all that fits exceptionally well into our future vision. And the way I look at it is we really want our customers to come to us with their biggest challenges, and we want to help them be more successful in achieving their goals. 
So as I talk about what we must do. I talked about sustainability and innovation. And the enterprise value proposition, the differentiation that we bring and it's not only from a customer growth standpoint, but I believe it's also from an operational standpoint, leveraging our manufacturing and supply chain, our footprint and our assets and just having a relentless drive on productivity. We're going to be really focused here to drive efficiency, lower our costs and improve our margins. 
And then finally, the last piece would be our acceleration around the discipline in our capital allocation. I talked about the importance of reinvesting in our business for safety and maintenance, but also capital projects that really drive that productivity that we talked about, really believe in a sustainable growing dividend. And I think today was the first step in doing and showing the ability to drive that increase. We have a wonderful ability to generate cash in this business. So we look forward to continuing to grow our dividend. 
Accelerating our leverage to our target range of 2.25x to 2.5x, which Ward mentioned earlier, we will achieve by the end of our fiscal year. And we'll be opportunistic with share repurchases. We -- We're going to invest our cash. We don't intend to hold on to it. We wanted to fuel growth and create value for our shareholders. So we'll continue to do that. And we'll look at M&A as it aligns to our strategy, and those are the real priorities that we have. So I think I captured everything. And then the last piece of your question is, if I got it, George, was trends. A couple of things we've seen through the pandemic. We've seen a huge increase in e-commerce and some of our food and beverage and health care segments. We fully expect e-commerce to continue to grow. This is a new reality; we think of the market. But as we get through the pandemic and things come back, we do believe retail, brick-and-mortar, beauty, industrial will continue to come back as things open up. And that's why I'm so excited about the breadth of our portfolio because no matter where the markets take us, we feel confident in the products we have. And I'd love to have Jeff just reemphasize some of the volumes we've seen in April now that we've come out of this and just see the trends that we're seeing."

And actually, if it wasn't for weather and cyber, we would have been up almost 8%. We left April was not closed yet. So I don't have the final number, but we were up 12% in shipments year-over-year as we left the month, which is a record level for April shipments. And the demand is strong across almost all of our end markets still. So e-com remains strong, our distribution paper, retail, industrial. Also, our backlogs remain strong coming into May. Our pipeline was up $90 million year-over-year coming into the quarter, almost 22% increase, and we continue to onboard new and incremental business. 
Domestic markets remain strong. You asked about lingering effects for us, it's really getting our inventories back in line. And with the outages this quarter, it's probably going to take this quarter into next to really get back to the inventories. And we took 160,000 tons out of export. So getting back to some of our direct, being able to fully supply some of our contract customers, we need to make up tonnage as we've significantly reduced in our export markets even to some of our contract customers in the last 2 quarters. So that's been a lingering effect. But overall, integration rates are up to 82%, up from 78% last year, 80% in the first quarter. Demand is strong in all of our segments. And finally, thankfully, out of this last quarter, we're back to full operations, and we've operated well through April."

And the -- about 30 CPG companies were there, and they project over the near or midterm, about 2% to 3% growth in their businesses. So -- And that included kind of the end or slowing of the stay-at-home pandemics. So we're pretty robust and positive about that. I think health care is also one. We participate in COVID Test kits as well as in leaflets and inserts for the vaccine. So we're seeing good strength there. 
And I think the other driver for us that's really not dependent at all on the pandemic or recovery. Is this plastics replacement opportunity that David referred to and we've talked about before, we've already -- since July of 2018, commercialized over $200 million of plastics replacement. And we're envisioning right now. We're increasing our projection on that up to an incremental $300 million over the next few years. So we think that this is going to be really economically independent. It's really the sustainability trends that our customers have and our ability through new technology, through innovation to deliver new products for those customers. 
So David, I'll turn it back to you."

The stay home categories for us are remaining sticky. And as people will continue to work from home, we see growth staying in processed food, frozen vegetables, meals cooked at home. 
You might see a falloff in some of the retail or some of the -- excuse me, some of the industrial that we have. But overall, I think we're well positioned as food service comes back online to serve broad markets through Consumer and Corrugated."

And then as part of our capital allocation principles is really allow for flexibility across the cyclicality in the markets that you mentioned. So if you think about it, the levers that we pull in regards to that, I mentioned the CapEx investments that are going to be constant. I think the team has done a terrific job deleveraging, so that gives us even more flexibility. So with that, we'll take a portion of how we -- of that available cash that we have and we'll look for the best return. It will be a steadily increasing dividend. If there's opportunistic share repurchases, we'll continue to look at that. And if there's M&A that aligns to our strategy, we'll look at that while remaining core to the rest of the principal. 
So the increase that we announced, we believe, was the right amount. We're very comfortable with it. We'll continue to assess it year-over-year. And we -- to give a specific number I don't think we're in a state to do that other than saying we're committed to a sustainable growing dividend despite market conditions.

As far as new locations, we're going to look at and see what we might have to do in the future.

And so when we have that ability to strategically align with our customers, for those complete solutions, that's where we'll focus. And there will certainly be some customers that separate the way you mentioned, and we'll treat them the way they want to buy. So it's not 100%, but there is significant value there. And just as a data point, I would tell you that our growth rate with enterprise customers is higher than non-enterprise customers. 
So we see this is a significant opportunity. It's already a multibillion-dollar sales platform for us.

Q2 was negatively impacted by the ransomware, as we had talked about during the quarter. And we're going to start to recover from that in Q3 and Q4. 
Seasonally, we always drive a large portion of our cash flow in the second half of the year. I'll just give you some reference points and let to demonstrate to you the power of the cash flow generation. So if you look over the last 2 years, we -- if you take our adjusted EBITDA, we convert 75% of that roughly to adjusted operating cash flow.

So we talked about in my prepared remarks, I think we said recycled fiber was up almost $43 a ton, I think, approximately year-over-year. So as you think going forward, remember, the comparison of recycled fiber, especially in Q2, is off a very low levels during FY '20. So my guidance as we think about Q3 and Q4 for inflation from where we are today is we're estimating that recycled fiber will be up approximately $15 from Q2 to Q3 and then another $5 from Q3 to Q4. If you look at the single biggest driver of inflation for us, and I've been signaling this all year-long was going to be recycled fiber. Recycled fiber on a year-over-year basis for the full year could be approximately $150 million based on the consumption of fiber that we have across our system. Then the other elements have been elevated energy costs off of last year's lows. And then the -- we've talked about the tightening freight markets. I gave guidance earlier in the year that I thought freight for the full year would be 3% to 5% on a year-over-year basis for the full year. We're on the high end of that range now. And then given the events that occurred in Texas related to the winter weather, that has had some impact on some of our chemicals. 
So historically, I've said that if you look at the average inflation for this business since the inception of WestRock's averaged about $225 million a year. It's going to be elevated this year simply because of the elevated energy and recycled fiber. And really, I've embedded those in our guidance. The sequential inflation outlook that I just talked about was included in our guidance for Q3 and then for the full year. And it just reinforces our need to drive productivity across the business."

And we've equipped our plants to be able to maximize whatever product we're running through those. And I think we'll continue to do that. And keep in mind, as we look at our 90% integration rate, the tons that we move into packaging are considerably better than export at any price in the cycle.

So you're getting upward pressure on that and then export into the Asia, India area. Not China, but it's all the places around China are also strong and robust because the global economy and for packaging paper right now is strong everywhere. So that's really what's putting some of the upward pressure on the pricing."

It's great to be joining you all today on my first earnings call as WestRock's CEO. I've been in this role now for 7 weeks and have spent that time meeting with our customers, our business leaders and teammates. With every interaction, I'm impressed with the capability and strength of the WestRock team and couldn't be more excited about our future prospects. 
It's still early in this process, but what I'd like to do today is share with you my initial observations since joining and my priorities going forward. Before doing that, though, let me touch briefly on our performance in the second quarter, which Ward will discuss in more detail shortly. Faced with dual issues of the ransomware incident and a significant weather disruption, the team focused, executed and delivered for our customers, generating revenue of $4.4 billion, adjusted segment EBITDA of $641 million, an adjusted EPS of $0.54 per share. The ransomware and weather incidents lowered our adjusted EPS by $0.23. Ward will provide additional detail about our performance. 
I am pleased to say that we have fully restored our IT systems with all sites up and running, and we continue to make excellent progress on restoring our supply chain and customer service levels. During the time we were dealing with this incident, we prioritized serving our customers and incurred additional costs that impacted earnings in the quarter. We are accelerating investments that were on our IT development timeline to further strengthen our infrastructure. Throughout these events, the WestRock team demonstrated incredible resiliency and dedication, and we have made a remarkable recovery. 
I want to extend my sincere thanks to my WestRock teammates for all they have done and continued to do for the company and our customers. With all of this now behind us, I'm confident in our team, our markets and our path forward. 
I mentioned at the start that much of my time over these first 7 weeks has been spent getting to know our company. I've toured 12 facilities, met virtually or in person with hundreds of teammates and spoken with many of our top customers. WestRock has built a unique portfolio, successfully integrating acquisitions and investing to create a differentiated set of capabilities with incredible opportunities for growth. I've seen firsthand how the Consumer, Corrugated and Machinery businesses work together and believe we can do even more to maximize the performance of our platform. 
We serve diversified and growing packaging end markets and the demand for fiber-based paper and packaging continues to gain momentum. Key markets that we serve, such as food and beverage, e-commerce and health care continue to grow. For example, the demand from customers for safe and secure e-commerce solutions has only been accelerated by the pandemic, and I believe this remains a significant opportunity that WestRock solutions are well positioned to address. 
One of my visits was to our high-quality, low-cost facility in Florence, South Carolina, and it was great to see the new state of the art paper machine up and running. This slide includes a QR code you can use to view a video of the mill and the new equipment. This machine produces high-performance containerboard grades at low basis weights and replaces 3 machines in our system. 
This mill is well positioned to serve a diverse set of customers seeking these low basis weights to drive more sustainable packaging solutions. This investment makes Florence one of the lowest cost virgin containerboard mills in North America. We expect Florence to ramp up to full capacity by the end of our fiscal fourth quarter. The Florence mill is a great example of a strategic capital investment that improves our capabilities, lowers our costs and expands margins. 
Looking forward, there are a few key priorities that I want to focus on. WestRock has a unique portfolio of sustainable fiber-based packaging and great opportunities to leverage the enterprise and help our customers win in their markets. The path to long-term shareholder value creation is through a focus on attractive markets where our differentiated portfolio and combination of products and services are valued and rewarded. 
We will also focus on improving our productivity and operational excellence across the enterprise, which are both important levers to grow earnings and margins. I believe strongly in the leadership role that WestRock can play in improving the circular economy and helping our customers improve the sustainability of their products. We recently refined our sustainability platform to focus on people and communities, bettering the planet and innovating for our customers and their customers. 
Whether it's developing new fiber-based packaging solutions that enable our customers to meet their sustainability goals, initiatives to reduce our own environmental impact or our work to improve the diversity and inclusion of our company, WestRock has substantial capabilities and opportunities to help drive a more sustainable future. 
And a more sustainable future means that we must focus on innovation to develop new fiber-based packaging that meets the needs of customers and consumers. Removing plastic from packaging and developing more sustainable packaging solutions through design, material science, digital and automation, continue to be growth drivers in our industry. WestRock has a capability to create new recyclable, fiber-based solutions that are good for our customers and the environment. 
Next, I'd like to share my initial thoughts on capital allocation. I believe that disciplined balanced capital allocation is a key factor in creating sustainable shareholder value. I'm impressed by the strength and stability of WestRock's cash flows and believe this is a positive attribute for the company and our investors. 
We will invest in our business to maintain and improve our assets and investments in acquisitions and strategic capital projects will be tightly aligned to our strategy and deliver returns above our cost of capital. We will remain committed to returning capital to our dividend and intend to steadily increase it every year. We've already taken the first step today with the announcement of a 20% increase to our quarterly dividend. Today's increase reflects our confidence in the outlook and cash flow generation of our business. 
In addition, we will evaluate share repurchases in the future as another way to return capital to shareholders. We remain committed to our investment-grade credit profile and believe that our leverage target of 2.25x to 2.5x is appropriate. And in the coming months, I'll share more detail about my priorities and vision for WestRock's future. 
And now I'll turn it over to Ward to provide our financial detail about the quarter. Ward?"

We were able to serve our customers, deliver solid earnings and continue to reduce our leverage despite the challenges in the quarter.

We were able to serve our customers, deliver solid earnings and continue to reduce our leverage despite the challenges in the quarter. We generated revenue of $4.4 billion, adjusted segment EBITDA of $641 million and adjusted EPS of $0.54 per share. These results were impacted by both the ransomware incident and winter weather. The 2 events negatively impacted revenue by $189 million. Adjusted segment EBITDA by $80 million and adjusted segment EBITDA margins by approximately 110 basis points. Adjusted EPS was $0.23 lower as a result of these events. 
In addition to the impact of the ransomware incident that we show on the adjusted segment EBITDA bridge, we also incurred $20 million in ransomware recovery costs. The $20 million of recovery costs were excluded from our adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. We estimate that the total insurance claim will be approximately $75 million, and we expect to recover the claim from our cyber and business interruption insurance coverage in future periods. 
It's important to look beyond the events in the quarter, to see the underlying trends in our business. Demand is strong, and we continue to focus on improving our business mix. In addition, we are currently implementing the published price increases across all of our paper grades. The implementation of these price increases and improved business mix drove $88 million in year-over-year earnings improvement. Notably, we had record second quarter North American box shipments, which increased 5.5% year-over-year on a per day basis. Cost inflation was driven by a $43 per ton increase in recycled fiber from Q2 of the prior year, coupled with higher chemical and energy costs resulting from the winter storm. 
Transportation costs were also higher due to tight availability across all modes. We did not exercise the option to purchase an additional 18.7% equity interest in Grupo Gondi. As a result, we recorded a charge of $22.5 million that we excluded from adjusted EPS. As we indicated earlier in the quarter, the lag in customer invoicing from the period when our systems were down negatively impacted our working capital in Q2. 
As expected, accounts receivable increased in the second quarter, and we expect receivables to normalize in the third quarter. Despite this, our net funded debt declined $74 million from Q1, and our net leverage decreased to 2.8x. Due to the decisive actions we have taken over the past year to strengthen our balance sheet, we have reduced our adjusted net debt by $1.6 billion. 
Demand continues to increase for sustainable fiber-based packaging, and we sell into an attractive set of end markets. Our overall packaging volumes increased by 3% in Q2. Including e-commerce box volume growth of 18.4% on a per day basis. Our paper sales represent 27% of our total revenue in the company, and we are focused on reducing our participation in the export containerboard and specialty SBS markets. The pricing environment has improved across our paper and packaging grades, we are implementing published increases across our paper and packaging businesses as expected. 
Turning to segment results. Our Corrugated Packaging segment reported revenue of $2.9 billion and adjusted segment EBITDA of $438 million. North American adjusted segment EBITDA would have been $54 million higher and margins approximately 140 basis points higher without the events in the quarter. Corrugated box demand is very strong across most of our end markets. And we reported record per day shipments for the second quarter. As I said earlier, Corrugated box shipments were up 5.5% per day year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the ransomware and weather incidents per day box shipments would have increased approximately 8%. 
We lost approximately 121,000 tons of containerboard production and revenue due to the disruptions in the quarter. This directly impacted our external containerboard channels sales as we could have sold all of the lost production. We highlighted the primary drivers of cost inflation earlier: higher recycled fiber, energy, chemical and transportation costs. However, we offset this inflation in the quarter through higher pricing and volume, excluding the impact of the events. 
We also continue to implement the previously published price increases and expect the benefit of these increases to more than outweigh inflation. Inventory levels remain low as we head into our peak mill outage quarter in Q3 with 112,000 tons of planned maintenance outage downtime. 
Finally, we are making great progress on our strategic capital projects. The Florence mill continues to increase its production and operate well. As David commented earlier, we expect the mill to be at full production levels at the end of the fourth fiscal quarter. The margins in Brazil have been lower in the past 2 quarters as a result of the maintenance and capital outage related to the Tres Barras expansion. Demand is strong in the Brazilian market, and we expect margins to improve in the second half of the fiscal year. 
Turning to Consumer Packaging. The segment reported revenue of $1.6 billion. And adjusted segment EBITDA of $212 million. EBITDA would have been $26 million higher and margins approximately 100 basis points higher without the events in the quarter. Our sales mix is improving by shifting to higher-margin food and beverage packaging sales. Food and beverage packaging revenues were up 4.7% year-over-year, driven by improved mix to quick service restaurants and beverage packaging. 
We lost approximately 46,000 tons of production and corresponding revenue due to the disruptions in the quarter. In addition, we had approximately 20,000 tons of consumer paperboard shipments that were deferred into the third quarter due to these disruptions. Backlogs have increased across all substrates and are currently at 6 to 8 weeks. We are in the process of implementing the previously published price increases. The increased pricing improvement in our business mix and productivity more than offset inflation in the quarter. 
We continue to produce containerboard at our Evadale, Texas mill, given the strong demand and low inventory levels. In addition, we are making progress with CNK production at the Evadale mill and are on track to deliver 25,000 tons of CNK production in FY '21 and 50,000 tons of production in FY '22. We are able to flex the CNK and containerboard capacity from SBS with no additional capital investment. 
Turning to guidance. Here are some things to consider for our fiscal third quarter. We expect adjusted segment EBITDA of $775 million to $805 million and adjusted EPS of $0.88 to $0.97 per share. The primary drivers of our sequential increase include the implementation of the previously published price increases, continued strength in packaging demand and the return to normal operations for the third quarter. These items are partially offset by modest sequential inflation across recycled fiber, chemical and transportation costs. In addition, we will take approximately 112,000 tons of scheduled maintenance downtime across our North American containerboard mills. 
Finally, we expect higher incentive accruals due to a stronger earnings outlook. We want to share with you our current outlook for fiscal 2021. We expect the continued flow-through of the previously published price increases as well as packaging growth across our primary end markets. As a result, we expect full year adjusted segment EBITDA to be approximately $3.05 billion. Given our earnings outlook and continued strong cash flows, we fully expect to be within our leverage target of 2.25x to 2.5x by the end of the fiscal year. We will provide additional details on our next earnings call. 
And now I'll hand it back over to David for closing remarks.  David?"

I'll try to answer each one of your questions. I'll start with customers. I can't tell you how important it is to get our voice of the customer, I believe in a real outside in approach, customer-focused approach as we look at the business. One of my first meetings actually was with one of our largest customers, very strategic global account, and we happen to win the supplier of the year awards. So hopefully, all my customer meetings, go like that. 
But I would say several themes emerged when talking to a variety of customers. And I think it ties into what we need to do as a company. And the first one was sustainability. Our large strategic customers want their products to become more sustainable, and they want to partner with us to find those solutions. And this is really especially true with plastics replacement and the opportunity we have there. So concurrent to that, I think innovation is going to play a critical role in our growth and sustainability, but also innovation across all of our products and services and including digital in our machinery businesses. 
So we've got to get sustainability and innovation right, to your point earlier. And then the third thing I heard was service. I think with the pandemic, to your question, I think across multiple industries, it certainly accentuated the stress across supply chains worldwide. So reliable service and quality is critical for our customers and just take this opportunity to really thank our teammates at WestRock when we went through the ransomware attack, how well they communicated and kept our customers going. And as Ward alluded to, we did incur some costs to do that, but that was something we absolutely had to do to service our customers. 
And I think one last thing that I heard from our strategic customers was the value they placed on our enterprise. And the approach in bringing everything together and how that can help them be more effective. So I think all that fits exceptionally well into our future vision. And the way I look at it is we really want our customers to come to us with their biggest challenges, and we want to help them be more successful in achieving their goals. 
So as I talk about what we must do. I talked about sustainability and innovation. And the enterprise value proposition, the differentiation that we bring and it's not only from a customer growth standpoint, but I believe it's also from an operational standpoint, leveraging our manufacturing and supply chain, our footprint and our assets and just having a relentless drive on productivity. We're going to be really focused here to drive efficiency, lower our costs and improve our margins. 
And then finally, the last piece would be our acceleration around the discipline in our capital allocation. I talked about the importance of reinvesting in our business for safety and maintenance, but also capital projects that really drive that productivity that we talked about, really believe in a sustainable growing dividend. And I think today was the first step in doing and showing the ability to drive that increase. We have a wonderful ability to generate cash in this business. So we look forward to continuing to grow our dividend. 
Accelerating our leverage to our target range of 2.25x to 2.5x, which Ward mentioned earlier, we will achieve by the end of our fiscal year. And we'll be opportunistic with share repurchases. We -- We're going to invest our cash. We don't intend to hold on to it. We want it to fuel growth and create value for our shareholders. So we'll continue to do that. And we'll look at M&A as it aligns to our strategy, and those are the real priorities that we have. So I think I captured everything. And then the last piece of your question is, if I got it, George, was trends. A couple of things we've seen through the pandemic. We've seen a huge increase in e-commerce in some of our food and beverage and health care segments. 
We fully expect e-commerce to continue to grow. This is a new reality; we think of the market. But as we get through the pandemic and things come back, we do believe retail, brick-and-mortar, beauty, industrial will continue to come back as things open up. And that's why I'm so excited about the breadth of our portfolio because no matter where the markets take us, we feel confident in the products we have. And I'd love to have Jeff just reemphasize some of the volumes we've seen in April now that we've come out of this and just see the trends that we're seeing."

Overall, the demand in the business was strong across a broad base of end markets that David just outlined. So Ward commented, we were up 5.5% in the quarter. And actually, if it wasn't for weather and cyber, we would have been up almost 8%. We left April was not closed yet. So I don't have the final number, but we were up 12% in shipments year-over-year as we left the month, which is a record level for April shipments. And the demand is strong across almost all of our end markets still. So e-com remains strong, our distribution paper, retail, industrial. Also, our backlogs remain strong coming into May. Our pipeline was up $90 million year-over-year coming into the quarter, almost 22% increase, and we continue to onboard new and incremental business. 
Domestic markets remain strong. You asked about lingering effects for us, it's really getting our inventories back in line. And with the outages this quarter, it's probably going to take this quarter into next to really get back to the inventories. And we took 160,000 tons out of export. So getting back to some of our direct, being able to fully supply some of our contract customers, we need to make up tonnage as we've significantly reduced in our export markets even to some of our contract customers in the last 2 quarters. So that's been a lingering effect. But overall, integration rates are up to 82%, up from 78% last year, 80% in the first quarter. Demand is strong in all of our segments. And finally, thankfully, out of this last quarter, we're back to full operations, and we've operated well through April."

So I'll talk a little bit about consumer and what we're seeing. We still see strong demand even in last quarter and into this quarter and through the remainder of the year, the demand is continuing to be strong in general folding carton as well as food and beverage. And certainly, the economy is going to shift a little bit with the preferences that people have in terms of getting back to the office and getting back out and being mobile again. But we still see these trends continuing. 
In fact, there was a conference here in mid-February, called the Consumer Analyst Group of New York conference. And the -- about 30 CPG companies were there, and they project over the near or midterm, about 2% to 3% growth in their businesses. So -- And that included kind of the end or slowing of the stay-at-home pandemics. So we're pretty robust and positive about that. I think health care is also one. We participate in COVID Test kits as well as in leaflets and inserts for the vaccine. So we're seeing good strength there. 
And I think the other driver for us that's really not dependent at all on the pandemic or recovery is this plastics replacement opportunity that David referred to and we've talked about before. We've already -- since July of 2018, commercialized over $200 million of plastics replacement. And we're envisioning right now. We're increasing our projection on that up to an incremental $300 million over the next few years. So we think that this is going to be really economically independent. It's really the sustainability trends that our customers have and our ability through new technology, through innovation to deliver new products for those customers. 
So David, I'll turn it back to you."

The way I look at the dividend is, first and foremost, ensure it's a sustainable and growing dividend. And then as part of our capital allocation principles is really allow for flexibility across the cyclicality in the markets that you mentioned. So if you think about it, the levers that we pull in regards to that, I mentioned the CapEx investments that are going to be constant. I think the team has done a terrific job deleveraging, so that gives us even more flexibility. So with that, we'll take a portion of how we -- of that available cash that we have and we'll look for the best return. It will be a steadily increasing dividend. If there's opportunistic share repurchases, we'll continue to look at that. And if there's M&A that aligns to our strategy, we'll look at that while remaining core to the rest of the principal. 
So the increase that we announced, we believe, was the right amount. We're very comfortable with it. We'll continue to assess it year-over-year. And we -- to give a specific number I don't think we're in a state to do that other than saying we're committed to a sustainable growing dividend despite market conditions.

Seasonally, we always drive a large portion of our cash flow in the second half of the year. I'll just give you some reference points and let -- to demonstrate to you the power of the cash flow generation. So if you look over the last 2 years, we -- if you take our adjusted EBITDA, we convert 75% of that roughly to adjusted operating cash flow. You take that with the midpoint of the CapEx guidance that we've given you. And you see very, very strong cash flow generation for the full year and our ability to delever very quickly from where we are right now."

So we talked about in my prepared remarks, I think we said recycled fiber was up almost $43 a ton, I think, approximately year-over-year. So as you think going forward, remember, the comparison of recycled fiber, especially in Q2, is off a very low levels during FY '20. So my guidance as we think about Q3 and Q4 for inflation from where we are today is we're estimating that recycled fiber will be up approximately $15 from Q2 to Q3 and then another $5 from Q3 to Q4. If you look at the single biggest driver of inflation for us, and I've been signaling this all year-long was going to be recycled fiber. 
Recycled fiber on a year-over-year basis for the full year could be approximately $150 million based on the consumption of fiber that we have across our system. Then the other elements have been elevated energy costs off of last year's lows. And then the -- we've talked about the tightening freight markets. I gave guidance earlier in the year that I thought freight for the full year would be 3% to 5% on a year-over-year basis for the full year. We're on the high end of that range now. And then given the events that occurred in Texas related to the winter weather, that has had some impact on some of our chemicals. 
So historically, I've said that if you look at the average inflation for this business since the inception of WestRock's averaged about $225 million a year. It's going to be elevated this year simply because of the elevated energy and recycled fiber. And really, I've embedded those in our guidance. The sequential inflation outlook that I just talked about was included in our guidance for Q3 and then for the full year. And it just reinforces our need to drive productivity across the business."

So it's driving the productivity. It's ensuring our return on assets. It's leveraging the scale that we have and ensuring we get the return for the investments we've made.

Then I'll turn it over to Ward, who will provide additional detail on our financial performance and outlook for the remainder of the year. 
We delivered very strong performance in our fiscal third quarter with demand for fiber-based packaging continuing to be robust. We generated record revenue of $4.8 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year. Adjusted segment EBITDA was up 15% to $811 million, and adjusted EPS rose 32% to $1 per share. This was terrific performance in a challenging inflationary environment and positions us well for the future. 
We had robust sales growth across all of our businesses, with packaging sales up 15% during the quarter. Demand continued to be strong in the key markets we serve, including e-commerce, food, beverage and industrial. North American per day box shipments were up 9% year-over-year. We are implementing the previously published price increases across our major paper grades. These pricing gains, combined with our volume growth and mix improvements, outpaced inflation and drove 15% adjusted EBITDA growth year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA margins of 16.8%. 
We continue to generate strong free cash flows that we used to strengthen our balance sheet while also investing in our business and delivering value to shareholders. Overall, net leverage at the end of Q3 is 2.54x, down from 3.3x at our peak. 
Last quarter, I talked about the key strategic priorities for WestRock: leveraging the power of the enterprise, leading in sustainability, accelerating innovation and executing a disciplined capital allocation program. And I'd like to take a minute to walk through some of our progress in each of these areas and our path ahead. 
We have been moving quickly in my first 4 months on the job. During this time, I've continued to visit our facilities and spend time with our customers. These visits have reinforced my belief in the unique opportunity we have to provide value through our broad portfolio of paper and packaging solutions and help our customers meet their most challenging needs for sustainable packaging solutions. 
We have initiated a detailed review across the business, looking at how to further enhance our focus on attractive end markets where our differentiated portfolio is rewarded. We are still in the early stages of this process but our recently announced team realignment is a significant step forward in fully leveraging the power of our enterprise. 
We are strengthening our focus on commercial excellence, innovation and sustainability across the enterprise and combining these functions. Bringing these critical activities together provides focus, integration, and alignment to the disciplines that will enable us to grow our company and lead in providing sustainable and innovative solutions for our customers. 
We are focused on growing our packaging business and maximizing opportunities across the portfolio. We have combined the former MPS and our food and beverage packaging business into one team, unifying these commercial teams and operations to better serve our customers and maximize the productivity of our global operations. We have also integrated the sales teams across our consumer paperboard and containerboard businesses. and combined our consumer and containerboard mills into one system. 
During the third quarter, we continued to implement our disciplined capital allocation strategy and further strengthened our balance sheet. Over the past 3 quarters, we've reduced adjusted net debt by $1 billion, raised our dividend by 20% and completed the investments in our strategic capital projects. 
So what's ahead for WestRock? The WestRock team is relentlessly focused on leveraging the power of the enterprise to improve margins and returns, while continuing to deliver excellent free cash flow. We will invest in our converting systems to support growth in packaging and in our mill system to improve our overall cost structure. These investments will further enhance our packaging capabilities to serve those markets where our customers value our differentiation. 
This also means working to reduce our exposure to markets where we don't see this potential, such as export containerboard and low-margin SBS businesses. We also remain disciplined in our capital allocation. We are working to ensure the strength and flexibility of our balance sheet as we invest to grow our business. We remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit profile and consistently growing our dividend. 
We will invest in our future through capital projects and tuck-in M&A opportunities that clearly align with our strategy and provide attractive returns on invested capital. And we will make opportunistic share repurchases to return value to shareholders. The significant progress we have made in reducing our leverage ratio provides additional optionality as we consider our capital allocation priorities going forward. 
We will be balanced in our approach, always seeking to maximize returns, while maintaining the financial strength and flexibility required to execute our strategy. 
As we strive to lead in sustainability, we announced our commitment to set a science-based target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. As we work to partner with our customers to improve their sustainability, we are also focused on improving our own. Sustainable fiber-based packaging is critical realizing the full potential of the circular economy, and we are working to accelerate our innovation pipeline to help our customers meet demand for sustainable packaging. 
Our new EverGrow product is a great example of leveraging the power of the WestRock enterprise with capabilities that no other packaging company can bring to the customer. This product leverages our design capability, consumer and corrugated packaging and our machinery expertise, and creates a sustainable fiber-based curbside recyclable alternative to plastic produce packaging. It has great shelf appeal, protects the produce and can be recycled into new packaging. You can use the QR code on this page for a closer look at this exciting new packaging. 
And with that, I'll now ask Ward to provide detail about our financial performance in the third quarter. Ward?"

We executed well in the third quarter, and our results reflect this. As David mentioned, we generated revenue of $4.8 billion, adjusted segment EBITDA of $811 million and adjusted EPS of $1 per share. These results exceeded the high end of our guidance range we outlined last quarter. 
Demand was strong with record net sales that increased 14% compared to the prior year. Our revenue grew across all of our businesses, and we continue to focus on improving our business mix. The implementation of published price increases and improved business mix drove $320 million in year-over-year earnings improvement and exceeded cost inflation by more than $100 million. 
Cost inflation was driven by higher transportation, energy, chemical and recycled fiber costs. Operating costs were higher year-over-year due to the nonrecurring nature of some of the cost actions taken last year as part of the pandemic action plan. In addition, Q3 was our peak maintenance outage quarter in FY '21. We generated more than $550 million in adjusted free cash flow in the quarter and used the majority of that cash to reduce debt. Our net leverage is approaching the high end of our 2.25 to 2.5x leverage target. 
Our packaging businesses continue to grow with sales increasing 15% year-over-year. This revenue increase is due to both strong demand and the implementation of published price increases. As you can see on this slide, our packaging sales were 71% of our total sales in the third quarter, while paper sales were 29% of total sales. Packaging volumes were up year-over-year, with strong demand in food and beverage, retail, e-commerce and distribution. Demand in markets such as cosmetics and spirits also improved as global economies continue to recover. 
External paper sales increased 10%, with price increases more than offsetting lower volumes. We are focused on growing our integrated packaging, domestic containerboard and paperboard businesses. We are also working to reduce our volumes in lower-margin specialty SBS and export containerboard markets. For reference, the combination of the adjusted EBITDA margins in our lower-margin specialty SBS and export containerboard markets is below 10% as compared to WestRock's 16.8% total company average. 
As we actively manage our mix, we will improve our profitability going forward. We look forward to updating you on our progress. We believe it's important to also discuss our results on a sequential basis to highlight current trends. We reported significant improvement in earnings with revenue up 8.5% and adjusted segment EBITDA up 27% quarter-over-quarter. Increases in pricing and improved mix enabled us to outpace inflation by approximately $100 million sequentially. While we had the sequential benefit from the ransomware and weather impact in the second quarter, third quarter was our peak maintenance outage period. Inventories in both of our business segments remain tight. 
Turning to the segment results. Our corrugated packaging segment reported revenue of $3.2 billion and adjusted segment EBITDA of $557 million. Adjusted EBITDA margins for our North American corrugated business were 19.3% and our Brazil adjusted EBITDA margins were 23.2%. As I mentioned before, demand remains strong across a broad set of end markets. Corrugated box shipments increased 3% sequentially. 
Sequential cost inflation was driven by higher recycled fiber costs, which were up $22 per ton versus Q2, along with increased transportation, energy and chemical costs. Corrugated packaging, pricing and mix outpaced inflation by $89 million from Q2 to Q3. Inventory levels remained low as we came out of our peak mill outage quarter. We have only 11,000 tons of planned maintenance outage downtime in the fourth quarter. 
Finally, the Florence mill continues to increase production and operate well, and we expect the mill to be at full production levels at the end of the fourth fiscal quarter. Demand is very strong in the Brazilian market, and we expect margins to improve in the fourth fiscal quarter as the Tres Barras mill continues to ramp up. 
Turning to Consumer Packaging. The segment reported revenue of $1.7 billion and adjusted segment EBITDA of $269 million. Adjusted segment EBITDA margins were 15.5% in the quarter and were up 210 basis points sequentially. Sales mix continues to improve, driven by strong demand in higher-margin food and beverage packaging and paperboard sales. Packaging sales increased in North America, Europe and Asia and paperboard sales were up in all substrates sequentially. Our backlogs remain very strong and are currently at 6 to 7 weeks across our grades. Our mill system performed exceptionally well with strong production and high operating rates. 
On price/mix, we saw the benefit of the flow-through of published price increases. Our sales mix improved as we sold less pulp and had higher sales of containerboard and CNK from the reconfiguration of our Evadale, Texas mill. In Q3, we produced 44,000 tons of kraftliner and 18,000 tons of CNK at this mill. 
Cost inflation has increased at higher-than-normal levels throughout the year. Many of our commodity input costs have increased significantly, including OCC, which is up -- July is up $77 per ton since the end of FY '20. However, we have been successful in implementing previously published price increases across our system, which have offset this inflation. In the fiscal third quarter, the spread between price and inflation turned significantly positive. 
The April containerboard published price increase should be fully implemented in our system at the end of August. We are also implementing published price increases in kraft paper and realizing higher pricing in export containerboard. Consumer price flow-through will continue accelerating into fiscal year 2022.  
We generated more than $1.1 billion in adjusted free cash flow in the first 3 quarters of this fiscal year. Following the Capstone acquisition, our adjusted net debt peaked in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 at $10.5 billion. We've made outstanding progress in reducing this debt quickly and exited the third quarter with $7.9 billion in adjusted net debt. We are quickly approaching the high end of our 2.25 to 2.5x net leverage target. 
We continue to reduce debt and strengthen our balance sheet. We recently announced the redemption of $400 million of our senior notes that mature in March of 2022. The redemption will occur in September using cash on hand, which will reduce our debt even further. 
Turning to fiscal fourth quarter guidance. we expect higher prices, stronger volumes, minimal scheduled maintenance downtime and improved productivity. This will be partially offset by sequentially higher recycled fiber, virgin fiber and energy costs. As a result, we expect adjusted segment EBITDA to be in the range of $870 million to $920 million, and adjusted earnings per share in the range of $1.15 to $1.29. 
And now I'll turn it back over to David."

We are making rapid progress on our strategic priorities. 
First, we are leveraging the power of the enterprise. This quarter, we made several commercial and operational leadership changes that further align our teams to our strategy. This new structure will enhance market alignment, enable greater agility and deliver efficiencies. And we are working to determine how we grow faster in high-value markets and minimize our exposure in export containerboard and low-margin specialty SBS markets. 
Second, we are striving to lead in sustainability and accelerate innovation. We remain excited about the growing opportunity to partner with our customers to improve the sustainability of their packaging. As I mentioned earlier, we have committed to setting a science-based target to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and are making excellent progress on the commercialization of our plastic replacement solutions. 
And finally, we will be disciplined in capital allocation. As we achieve our leverage target, we have more opportunities to utilize our strong cash flows to create shareholder value. 
The future is bright at WestRock and I want to thank our 50,000 team members for their incredible work. This is a team that is truly committed to solving our customers' most difficult challenges. I'm confident in our ability to successfully achieve our goals. And as we provide differentiated solutions that customers value, we will continue to deliver excellent performance. With our complete and differentiated portfolio, we have multiple levers to create value and grow sales and earnings. We are excited about the opportunities ahead. 
With that, that concludes my prepared remarks. James, we are now ready for Q&A."

And I will tell you there will be a few things to our approach which are really important. 
And I think it goes to the second part of your question is what's the strength that I've seen in the 4 months I've been here. And the biggest strength I see, other than the people who have been tremendous, is the value of our unique portfolio, how do we continue to leverage that, both from a growth standpoint and an efficiency standpoint, and we have tremendous opportunity to do that. Our enterprise customers who buy both corrugated and consumer are approaching $8 billion annually, and they want to partner up with us for solutions on innovation and sustainability, which is a huge demand from our customers. So we want to continue to push that. 
And we're excited to have Pat lead our innovation and sustainability, and focusing on the market growth where we can get rewarded, as well as continuing to be relentless in our productivity efforts. So I guess to answer your question, I'd say the timing will be throughout the rest of the year. I think the structure was the first piece of that. The strength is really our broad portfolio with our people and executing that. And we just -- the opportunity that I see is further integration and synergies from the acquisitions that we made. And I think we have an opportunity to continue to take cost out of our systems. So that's where I see it so far in the first 4 months, and I think you'll see a lot more here throughout the rest of the year."

So I'm going to challenge you a little bit. I think our -- if you look at our price inflation trends, both sequentially and year-over-year, we're actually driving more price realization than we are, it's a positive relationship between price and inflation. Moving into the fourth quarter, clearly, the largest inflationary item that we have is we've got the increase in OCC, and that's really [ 45 ]. But we also have the continued flow through and the full quarter flow-through of the PPW published price increases in containerboard from April and the accelerating momentum that we have in the realization of the -- all of the price increases across the published price increases across the consumer business. 
As we head into Q1, what -- I think if PPW does, in fact, publish, we'll start to generate the benefits really in Q1 pretty quickly. We won't get much in Q4. It will be -- it will ramp up in Q1 and then move into Q2. So I think our guidance is actually -- we're growing earnings sequentially from Q3 to Q4. And part of it's volume, part of it is the fact that we're -- we exited our peak maintenance outage, but it's also the price cost relationship as well. So we think we have earnings momentum as we move into next year, albeit in an environment where we have elevated transportation costs, recycled and virgin fiber costs."

So let me take the quarter first and then I'll give -- I'll spend a minute on the second half relative to the guidance that we gave you back in April. So our average OCC cost for Q3 was about $105 a ton, what's embedded in our guidance is about $145",332,"Yes. So let me take the quarter first and then I'll give -- I'll spend a minute on the second half relative to the guidance that we gave you back in April. So our average OCC cost for Q3 was about $105 a ton, what's embedded in our guidance is about $145 to $150 a ton for Q4. So that implies some sequential increases from August into September as well. But you can -- I've always tried to be very transparent about our OCC assumptions and I think I've done that here as well. 
What we have with price, the price realization has been very, very consistent from what we had in the April guidance for both Q3 and for the full year. Really, the driver of the midpoint being lower than the 3.05 full year guidance that we gave at the end of -- on the April call, has simply been the elevated inflation environment. So our assumptions back then, and I think you can probably go to the transcript, is we thought we would exit Q4 with OCC around $105 a ton. So it's going to be $45 to $50 higher than what we assumed back in April. And then we've had higher natural gas costs that we thought would start to moderate and they've remained elevated. And then virgin fiber is also a little bit higher. 
But we've been able to steer our way through this and still feel really good about the momentum that we have in FY '22, the cash flow generation that we have. And Adam, I have not -- we have filed our claim with our insurance carriers for  the ransomware recovery. Because I have not embedded any recovery in the current quarter guidance related to the business interruption portion of the claim, I just don't -- I'm very confident that we're going to recover or claim.

But what experience do you have in adjusting and consolidating operations and sales forces? There's frequently sensitivities around doing that. What do you think is key about enabling that effectively? And kind of the related point, I did not see the detail -- perhaps it's in the deck and I've missed it, on the number of accounts and combined revenue to customers who are buying over $1 million of both consumer and corrugated for you? If you can sort of update us on that in your answer, and then I had a quick question on the quarter itself coming up."

From an experience standpoint, going back to my previous life at Sherwin-Williams, being part of an $11 billion acquisition of Valspar, that's exactly what we did. We fully integrated that business. We segmented where appropriate. We brought teams together where we brought more value from a customer standpoint to bring solutions. And then on the infrastructure side, we brought operations into under one leader to really drive those efficiencies. And I'm really proud of the work -- I was a part of with that team to really drive a lot of value. 
So there's a playbook that I use when bringing on acquisitions to ensure that you just don't do a bolt-on, you do it for how do you drive more growth, bring more value to customers, where they get excited about it and then also drive the synergies on the infrastructure. And I think that's really important, and it's been a lot of what I've done throughout my career. And I'm excited about the opportunities here. There's just really good opportunities for us to continue to further integrate this business and bring value. 
As far as the enterprise piece, we have -- we will approach on a yearly basis about $8 billion in sales of customers that buy over $1 million in consumer and over $1 million in corrugated. So there is obviously, with that data tells us there is value in customers wanting to come to us with solutions for all of our products. And I thought EverGrow, which we highlighted, is a great example of that. When you tie in our machinery business, and even if you look at our Victory Packaging distribution business with e-commerce. 
So where we're focused is we know our customers want innovation and sustainability. They're looking for us to help them achieve their sustainability goals. Those enterprise customers are the ones pushing us the hardest. And when we can combine our complete solutions, we're seeing a lot of value in that, and we're getting rewarded for that. And Pat, maybe I'll turn it over to you just to extract a little bit about what we're doing on enterprise and the excitement we have there."

I was with a very important customer earlier this week, and they were commenting on the importance of WestRock providing unique solutions, particularly to optimize primary, secondary and tertiary packaging, and we're the only ones that can do that. I mean we have a unique ability to pull all of those together, mix it in with machinery, drive the automation, our digital capability. We don't often talk about the displays business, but that's a really important part of it, too, because every time you have a display in retail, which is gaining some strength now. So there's opportunities for us all the way throughout the value chain to optimize primary, secondary and tertiary packaging.

The other thing about that is we are reporting our paperboard sales in there. So if you extract the lower margin external SBS, our margins are even more attractive.

So we've made some really large investments in our mill systems and we continue to make investments in our conversion plants. 
One of the things that we really are looking at to is flexibility in our mill systems. So if you recall at Evadale, we converted SBS to CNK that provided us an ability to get into higher-margin businesses, and again, get into the strategy of exiting lower-margin SBS business. So with that, there was no capital needed to do that. But as we look at our footprint now that we have one mill system, we're going to continue to look at those flexibility options. Some of them may require CapEx.

Or is it everything you feel like you have you're going to keep and it's more about investing and figuring out the way to maximize returns?"

So as you mentioned, containerboard is a pretty good understanding of that. And majority of the corrugated box and containerboard is linked to PPW and pass us through in 3 to 4 months, as we've indicated in the past. Consumer is a bit more complicated because of the number of substrates and the different routes to market or different integration levels across those different substrates. And so we use a number of different value capture and pricing mechanisms in that -- in the consumer segment. 
In aggregate, I can say about half of that is tied to PPW, and those flow through in different time periods. The other models, pricing models are based on cost, and also a fair amount of open market, which gives us quite a bit of flexibility. And so the way we think about pricing overall is that it's just the price and the lag and the type of model that we have is just part of the overall value capture and negotiation and discussion with the customer. 
As far as timing is concerned, we start flowing through and you can see some of this starting in the third quarter and more in the fourth quarter, and as Ward indicated, accelerating into fiscal year '22, we start to see that right away. It will ramp up, and it's really based on a previously published price increase. It's usually about 6 to 9 months for that all to flow through. But again, it doesn't wait for the 6 to 9 months. It's flowing through and it will continue -- in our case, with the published price increases to date, it will continue to flow through into fiscal year '22."

I'd like to start today with a summary of WestRock's performance in the third quarter as well as provide some perspective on our progress and the work underway since I joined the company. Then I'll turn it over to Ward,",1000,"Thank you, James, and good morning. I'd like to start today with a summary of WestRock's performance in the third quarter as well as provide some perspective on our progress and the work underway since I joined the company. Then I'll turn it over to Ward, who will provide additional detail on our financial performance and outlook for the remainder of the year. 
We delivered very strong performance in our fiscal third quarter with demand for fiber-based packaging continuing to be robust. We generated record revenue of $4.8 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year. Adjusted segment EBITDA was up 15% to $811 million, and adjusted EPS rose 32% to $1 per share. This was terrific performance in a challenging inflationary environment and positions us well for the future. 
We had robust sales growth across all of our businesses, with packaging sales up 15% during the quarter. Demand continued to be strong in the key markets we serve, including e-commerce, food, beverage and industrial. North American per day box shipments were up 9% year-over-year. We are implementing the previously published price increases across our major paper grades. These pricing gains, combined with our volume growth and mix improvements, outpaced inflation and drove 15% adjusted EBITDA growth year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA margins of 16.8%. 
We continue to generate strong free cash flows that we used to strengthen our balance sheet while also investing in our business and delivering value to shareholders. Overall, net leverage at the end of Q3 is 2.54x, down from 3.13x at our peak. 
Last quarter, I talked about the key strategic priorities for WestRock: leveraging the power of the enterprise, leading in sustainability, accelerating innovation and executing a disciplined capital allocation program. And I'd like to take a minute to walk through some of our progress in each of these areas and our path ahead. 
We have been moving quickly in my first 4 months on the job. During this time, I've continued to visit our facilities and spend time with our customers. These visits have reinforced my belief in the unique opportunity we have to provide value through our broad portfolio of paper and packaging solutions and help our customers meet their most challenging needs for sustainable packaging solutions. 
We have initiated a detailed review across the business, looking at how to further enhance our focus on attractive end markets where our differentiated portfolio is rewarded. We are still in the early stages of this process but our recently announced team realignment is a significant step forward in fully leveraging the power of our enterprise.  
We are strengthening our focus on commercial excellence, innovation and sustainability across the enterprise and combining these functions. Bringing these critical activities together provides focus, integration, and alignment to the disciplines that will enable us to grow our company and lead in providing sustainable and innovative solutions for our customers. 
We are focused on growing our packaging business and maximizing our opportunities across the portfolio. We have combined the former MPS and our food and beverage packaging business into one team, unifying these commercial teams and operations to better serve our customers and maximize the productivity of our global operations. We have also integrated the sales teams across our consumer paperboard and containerboard businesses and combined our consumer and containerboard mills into one system. 
During the third quarter, we continued to implement our disciplined capital allocation strategy and further strengthened our balance sheet. Over the past 3 quarters, we've reduced adjusted net debt by $1 billion, raised our dividend by 20% and completed the investments in our strategic capital projects. 
So what's ahead for WestRock? The WestRock team is relentlessly focused on leveraging the power of the enterprise to improve margins and returns, while continuing to deliver excellent free cash flow. We will invest in our converting systems to support growth in packaging and in our mill system to improve our overall cost structure. These investments will further enhance our packaging capabilities to serve those markets where our customers value our differentiation. 
This also means working to reduce our exposure to markets where we don't see this potential, such as export containerboard and low-margin SBS businesses. We also remain disciplined in our capital allocation. We are working to ensure the strength and flexibility of our balance sheet as we invest to grow our business. We remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit profile and consistently growing our dividend.  
We will invest in our future through capital projects and tuck-in M&A opportunities that clearly align with our strategy and provide attractive returns on invested capital. And we will make opportunistic share repurchases to return value to shareholders. The significant progress we have made in reducing our leverage ratio provides additional optionality as we consider our capital allocation priorities going forward. We will be balanced in our approach, always seeking to maximize returns, while maintaining the financial strength and flexibility required to execute our strategy. 
As we strive to lead in sustainability, we announced our commitment to set a science-based target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. As we work to partner with our customers to improve their sustainability, we are also focused on improving our own. Sustainable fiber-based packaging is critical to realizing the full potential of the circular economy, and we are working to accelerate our innovation pipeline to help our customers meet demand for sustainable packaging. 
Our new EverGrow product is a great example of leveraging the power of the WestRock enterprise with capabilities that no other packaging company can bring to the customer. This product leverages our design capability, consumer and corrugated packaging and our machinery expertise, and creates a sustainable fiber-based curbside recyclable alternative to plastic produce packaging. It has great shelf appeal, protects the produce and can be recycled into new packaging. You can use the QR code on this page for a closer look at this exciting new packaging. 
And with that, I'll now ask Ward to provide detail about our financial performance in the third quarter. Ward?"

We executed well in the third quarter, and our results reflect this. As David mentioned, we generated revenue of $4.8 billion, adjusted segment EBITDA of $811 million and adjusted EPS of $1 per share. These results exceeded the high end of",1111,"Thanks, David. We executed well in the third quarter, and our results reflect this. As David mentioned, we generated revenue of $4.8 billion, adjusted segment EBITDA of $811 million and adjusted EPS of $1 per share. These results exceeded the high end of our guidance range we outlined last quarter. 
Demand was strong with record net sales that increased 14% compared to the prior year. Our revenue grew across all of our businesses, and we continue to focus on improving our business mix. The implementation of published price increases and improved business mix drove $320 million in year-over-year earnings improvement and exceeded cost inflation by more than $100 million. 
Cost inflation was driven by higher transportation, energy, chemical and recycled fiber costs. Operating costs were higher year-over-year due to the nonrecurring nature of some of the cost actions taken last year as part of the pandemic action plan. In addition, Q3 was our peak maintenance outage quarter in FY '21. 
We generated more than $550 million in adjusted free cash flow in the quarter and used the majority of that cash to reduce debt. Our net leverage is approaching the high end of our 2.25 to 2.5x leverage target. 
Our packaging businesses continue to grow with sales increasing 15% year-over-year. This revenue increase is due to both strong demand and the implementation of published price increases. As you can see on this slide, our packaging sales were 71% of our total sales in the third quarter, while paper sales were 29% of total sales. Packaging volumes were up year-over-year, with strong demand in food and beverage, retail, e-commerce and distribution. Demand in markets such as cosmetics and spirits also improved as global economies continue to recover. 
External paper sales increased 10%, with price increases more than offsetting lower volumes. We are focused on growing our integrated packaging, domestic containerboard and paperboard businesses. We are also working to reduce our volumes in lower-margin specialty SBS and export containerboard markets. For reference, the combination of the adjusted EBITDA margins in our lower-margin specialty SBS and export containerboard markets is below 10% as compared to WestRock's 16.8% total company average. As we actively manage our mix, we will improve our profitability going forward. We look forward to updating you on our progress. 
We believe it's important to also discuss our results on a sequential basis to highlight current trends. We reported significant improvement in earnings with revenue up 8.5% and adjusted segment EBITDA up 27% quarter-over-quarter. Increases in pricing and improved mix enabled us to outpace inflation by approximately $100 million sequentially. While we had the sequential benefit from the ransomware and weather impact in the second quarter, third quarter was our peak maintenance outage period. Inventories in both of our business segments remained tight. 
Turning to the segment results. Our corrugated packaging segment reported revenue of $3.2 billion and adjusted segment EBITDA of $557 million. Adjusted EBITDA margins for our North American corrugated business were 19.3% and our Brazil adjusted EBITDA margins were 23.2%. As I mentioned before, demand remains strong across a broad set of end markets. Corrugated box shipments increased 3% sequentially. 
Sequential cost inflation was driven by higher recycled fiber costs, which were up $22 per ton versus Q2, along with increased transportation, energy and chemical costs. Corrugated packaging, pricing and mix outpaced inflation by $89 million from Q2 to Q3. Inventory levels remained low as we came out of our peak mill outage quarter. We have only 11,000 tons of planned maintenance outage downtime in the fourth quarter. 
Finally, the Florence mill continues to increase production and operate well, and we expect the mill to be at full production levels at the end of the fourth fiscal quarter. Demand is very strong in the Brazilian market, and we expect margins to improve in the fourth fiscal quarter as the Tres Barras mill continues to ramp up. 
Turning to Consumer Packaging. The segment reported revenue of $1.7 billion and adjusted segment EBITDA of $269 million. Adjusted segment EBITDA margins were 15.5% in the quarter and were up 210 basis points sequentially. Sales mix continues to improve, driven by strong demand in higher-margin food and beverage packaging and paperboard sales. Packaging sales increased in North America, Europe and Asia and paperboard sales were up in all substrates sequentially. Our backlogs remain very strong and are currently at 6 to 7 weeks across our grades. Our mill system performed exceptionally well with strong production and high operating rates. 
On price/mix, we saw the benefit of the flow-through of published price increases. Our sales mix improved as we sold less pulp and had higher sales of containerboard and CNK from the reconfiguration of our Evadale, Texas mill. In Q3, we produced 44,000 tons of kraft liner and 18,000 tons of CNK at this mill. 
Cost inflation has increased at higher-than-normal levels throughout the year. Many of our commodity input costs have increased significantly, including OCC, which is up -- July is up $77 per ton since the end of FY '20. However, we have been successful in implementing previously published price increases across our system, which have offset this inflation. In the fiscal third quarter, the spread between price and inflation turned significantly positive. 
The April containerboard published price increase should be fully implemented in our system at the end of August. We are also implementing published price increases in kraft paper and realizing higher pricing in export containerboard. Consumer price flow-through will continue accelerating into fiscal year 2022.  
We generated more than $1.1 billion in adjusted free cash flow in the first 3 quarters of this fiscal year. Following the KapStone acquisition, our adjusted net debt peaked in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 at $10.5 billion. We've made outstanding progress in reducing this debt quickly and exited the third quarter with $7.9 billion in adjusted net debt. We are quickly approaching the high end of our 2.25 to 2.5x net leverage target. 
We continue to reduce debt and strengthen our balance sheet. We recently announced the redemption of $400 million of our senior notes that mature in March of 2022. The redemption will occur in September using cash on hand, which will reduce our debt even further. 
Turning to fiscal fourth quarter guidance. we expect higher prices, stronger volumes, minimal scheduled maintenance downtime and improved productivity. This will be partially offset by sequentially higher recycled fiber, virgin fiber and energy costs. As a result, we expect adjusted segment EBITDA to be in the range of $870 million to $920 million, and adjusted earnings per share in the range of $1.15 to $1.29. 
And now I'll turn it back over to David."

Second, we are striving to lead in sustainability and accelerate innovation. We remain excited about the growing opportunity to partner with our customers to improve the sustainability of their packaging. As I mentioned earlier, we have committed to setting a science-based target to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and are making excellent progress on the commercialization of our plastic replacement solutions. 
And finally, we will be disciplined in capital allocation. As we achieve our leverage target, we have more opportunities to utilize our strong cash flows to create shareholder value.

But we're really looking forward to announcing those. But the structure changes were the first step in supporting our strategy. And I will tell you there will be a few things to our approach which are really important. 
And I think it goes to the second part of your question is what's the strength that I've seen in the 4 months I've been here. And the biggest strength I see, other than the people who have been tremendous, is the value of our unique portfolio, how do we continue to leverage that, both from a growth standpoint and an efficiency standpoint, and we have tremendous opportunity to do that. Our enterprise customers who buy both corrugated and consumer are approaching $8 billion annually, and they want to partner up with us for solutions on innovation and sustainability, which is a huge demand from our customers. So we want to continue to push that. 
And we're excited to have Pat lead our innovation and sustainability, and focusing on the market growth where we can get rewarded, as well as continuing to be relentless in our productivity efforts. 
So I guess to answer your question, I'd say the timing will be throughout the rest of the year. I think the structure was the first piece of that. The strength is really our broad portfolio with our people and executing that. And we just -- the opportunity that I see is further integration and synergies from the acquisitions that we made. And I think we have an opportunity to continue to take cost out of our systems.

I think implicit in your fourth quarter guidance, price cost is still kind of the headwind. When we look at the Q1 and assuming the August increase is reflected by the indexes for containerboard, do you think you're still going to be behind the price/cost curve in fiscal 1Q?

So I'm going to challenge you a little bit. I think our -- if you look at our price inflation trends, both sequentially and year-over-year, we're actually driving more price realization than we are, it's a positive relationship between price and inflation. Moving into the fourth quarter, clearly, the largest inflationary item that we have is we've got the increase in OCC, and that's really $45 to $50 a ton embedded in our guidance. But we also have the continued flow-through and the full quarter flow-through of the PPW published price increases in containerboard from April and the accelerating momentum that we have in the realization of the -- all of the price increases across the published price increases across the consumer business. 
As we head into Q1, what -- I think if PPW does, in fact, publish, we'll start to generate the benefits really in Q1 pretty quickly. We won't get much in Q4. It will be -- it will ramp up in Q1 and then move into Q2. So I think our guidance is actually -- we're growing earnings sequentially from Q3 to Q4. And part of it's volume, part of it is the fact that we're -- we exited our peak maintenance outage, but it's also the price cost relationship as well. So we think we have earnings momentum as we move into next year, albeit in an environment where we have elevated transportation costs, recycled and virgin fiber costs."

So let me take the quarter first and then I'll give -- I'll spend a minute on the second half relative to the guidance that we gave you back in April. So our average OCC cost for Q3 was about $105 a ton, what's embedded in our guidance is about $145",332,"Yes. So let me take the quarter first and then I'll give -- I'll spend a minute on the second half relative to the guidance that we gave you back in April. So our average OCC cost for Q3 was about $105 a ton, what's embedded in our guidance is about $145 to $150 a ton for Q4. So that implies some sequential increases from August into September as well. But you can -- I've always tried to be very transparent about our OCC assumptions and I think I've done that here as well. 
What we have with price, the price realization has been very, very consistent from what we had in the April guidance for both Q3 and for the full year. Really, the driver of the midpoint being lower than the 3.05 full year guidance that we gave at the end of -- on the April call, has simply been the elevated inflation environment. So our assumptions back then, and I think you can probably go to the transcript, is we thought we would exit Q4 with OCC around $105 a ton. So it's going to be $45 to $50 higher than what we assumed back in April. And then we've had higher natural gas costs that we thought would start to moderate and they've remained elevated. And then virgin fiber is also a little bit higher. 
But we've been able to steer our way through this and still feel really good about the momentum that we have in FY '22, the cash flow generation that we have. And Adam, I have not -- we have filed our claim with our insurance carriers for the ransomware recovery. Because I have not embedded any recovery in the current quarter guidance related to the business interruption portion of the claim, I just know that I'm very confident that we're going to recover our claim.

From an experience standpoint, going back to my previous life at Sherwin-Williams, being part of an $11 billion acquisition of Valspar, that's exactly what we did. We fully integrated that business. We segmented where appropriate. We brought teams together where we brought more value from a customer standpoint to bring solutions. And then on the infrastructure side, we brought operations into -- under one leader to really drive those efficiencies. And I'm really proud of the work I was a part of with that team to really drive a lot of value. 
So there's a playbook that I use when bringing on acquisitions to ensure that you just don't do a bolt-on, you do it for how do you drive more growth, bring more value to customers, where they get excited about it and then also drive the synergies on the infrastructure. And I think that's really important, and it's been a lot of what I've done throughout my career. And I'm excited about the opportunities here. There's just really good opportunities for us to continue to further integrate this business and bring value. 
As far as the enterprise piece, we have -- we will approach on a yearly basis about $8 billion in sales of customers that buy over $1 million in consumer and over $1 million in corrugated. So there is obviously, with that data tells us there is value in customers wanting to come to us with solutions for all of our products. And I thought EverGrow, which we highlighted, is a great example of that. When you tie in our machinery business, and even if you look at our Victory Packaging distribution business with e-commerce. 
So where we're focused is we know our customers want innovation and sustainability. They're looking for us to help them achieve their sustainability goals. Those enterprise customers are the ones pushing us the hardest. And we can combine our complete solutions, we're seeing a lot of value in that, and we're getting rewarded for that.

I mean we have a unique capability to pull all of those together, mix it in with machinery, drive the automation, our digital capability. We don't often talk about the displays business, but that's a really important part of it, too, because every time you have a display in retail, which is gaining some strength now, you have a carton, a folding carton in that. So there's opportunities for us all the way throughout the value chain to optimize primary, secondary and tertiary packaging.

We'll look at opportunities with our capital allocation, though. So with the strong cash generation, we're going to look at with the excess cash we have, where do we provide the best return? So if there's great return with further CapEx to drive out costs, we'll look at that. We'll continue to look at other opportunities for bolt-on M&As, and we'll look at opportunities and share repurchases. 
So from a capital allocation standpoint, we want to be very disciplined in where we go with our Capex, with our sustainable and growing dividend. And then with the excess cash and where we are with our debt levels, we're excited about the opportunities that brings for flexibility."

When you talk about these investments in the mill and converting businesses, is it possible to give us some examples of what you're thinking about in both cases? I mean there has been a fair amount of money, as Ward mentioned, that's going into the converting business over the last 5 years. And really, if we go back over the last 8 to 10 years, there were a number of mill projects at Hodge, at Hopewell and then most recently at Florence. So trying to get a sense of what those projects might look going -- like going forward, how they might be different."

As Pat alluded to earlier, we continue to invest in EVOLs at our conversion plants. We think they really bring a great return for us. We look to do things like Florence. We obviously had the investment in Brazil as well. Tres Barras was, I believe, a $345 million investment. Florence was $400 million investment. So we've made some really large investments in our mill systems and we continue to make investments in our conversion plants.  
One of the things that we really are looking at to is flexibility in our mill systems. So if you recall at Evadale, we converted SBS to CNK that provided us an ability to get into higher-margin businesses, and again, get into the strategy of exiting lower-margin SBS business. So with that, there was no capital needed to do that. But as we look at our footprint now that we have one mill system, we're going to continue to look at those flexibility options. Some of them may require CapEx. But if we can invest in flexibility in what we want to produce depending on demand, which provides the best return for us in those high-margin growth segments, we'll continue to do that. Ward, I'll certainly turn it over to you as well."

So as you mentioned, containerboard is a pretty good understanding of that. And majority of the corrugated box and containerboard is linked to PPW and pass us through in 3 to 4 months, as we've indicated in the past. Consumer is a bit more complicated because of the number of substrates and the different routes to market or different integration levels across those different substrates. And so we use a number of different value capture and pricing mechanisms in that -- in the consumer segment. 
In aggregate, I can say about half of that is tied to PPW, and those flow through in different time periods. The other models, pricing models are based on cost, and also a fair amount of open market, which gives us quite a bit of flexibility. And so the way we think about pricing overall is that it's just the price and the lag and the type of model that we have is just part of the overall value capture and negotiation and discussion with the customer. 
As far as timing is concerned, we start flowing through and you can see some of this starting in the third quarter and more in the fourth quarter, and as Ward indicated, accelerating into fiscal year '22, we start to see that right away. It will ramp up, and it's really based on a previously published price increase. It's usually about 6 to 9 months for that all to flow through. But again, it doesn't wait for the 6 to 9 months. It's flowing through and it will continue. In our case, with the published price increases to date, it will continue to flow through into fiscal year '22."

In a moment, I'll walk you through our performance in the quarter, full year and our outlook for fiscal 2022 as we currently see it.

In a moment, I'll walk you through our performance in the quarter, full year and our outlook for fiscal 2022 as we currently see it. But first, I would like to make some personal observations as we approach the end of the calendar year. It's clear that WestRock is a great company with 50,000 dedicated employees who work tremendously hard everyday. Since I joined WestRock, I've had the opportunity to dig into the business and now have a much clear picture about the challenges and substantial opportunities for our company. 
We will outline our vision for the future in greater detail at our Investor Day on February 24, and we'll be taking a number of important steps between now and then to set us up for greater success in the future. Already, there are a number of things that are clear to me. To start, our business has been and remains very strong. WestRock serves customers in a wide range of end markets with the broadest portfolio of packaging solutions in the industry, and this provides us with greater opportunity and flexibility to focus on growing markets where our differentiation is valued. 
Looking forward, we have to be more efficient. We have to accelerate our innovation efforts, and we have to move faster and focus on our core strategy, and we are doing just that. 
Now turning to the fourth quarter. We achieved record sales growth in a dynamic environment. I want to thank our WestRock teammates for their continued hard work and dedication to serving our customers. In the quarter, sales of $5.1 billion were up 14% year-over-year. Adjusted segment EBITDA also improved significantly, rising to $878 million or 22% year-over-year and adjusted earnings per share of $1.23 increased 68% compared to prior year. In the quarter, we realized higher volumes along with higher pricing which more than offset the year-over-year inflation. 
We updated our guidance in September for the fourth quarter and achieved a bit better than we said we do. Packaging sales increased by 8% year-over-year, driven by the implementation of price increases across our business. Packaging volumes were down 1.6% year-over-year, with box volumes down 1%. Labor shortages and supply chain issues caused disruption in our production and shipments to our customers. We are making all possible efforts to improve these conditions where we can. 
Paper volumes increased 13% year-over-year on strong demand across all grades. Overall inflation was higher across the industry than widely anticipated, and therefore, results came in at the low end of our guidance. This inflation was driven by increased costs for recycled fiber, virgin fiber and natural gas. Our corrugated adjusted segment EBITDA margins of 18.4% increased sequentially and year-over-year. The Brazil business generated 35% EBITDA margins driven by strong demand and the positive impact of the ramp-up of our Trace Baja's mill after the completion of the expansion project. 
Our Consumer Packaging segment performed very well with adjusted segment EBITDA margins of 15.9%, up 220 basis points from prior year and 40 basis points sequentially. Overall, WestRock adjusted segment EBITDA margins of 17.2% were up 110 basis points versus prior year and 40 basis points sequentially. This adjusted segment EBITDA includes $5 million of proceeds from business interruption insurance. In the quarter, we generated adjusted free cash flow of $372 million. As part of our balanced capital allocation strategy, we repurchased $122 million of stock and redeemed $400 million of bonds that would have matured in March 2022. Cost inflation increased at higher-than-normal levels throughout the year. Our implementation of the previously published price increases more than offset inflation for fiscal 2021. The latest August containerboard published price increase is currently being implemented. We are also in the process of implementing published price increases in craft paper and realizing higher pricing and export containerboard. Consumer price flow through throughout and across all grades will continue into fiscal 2022, including the implementation of the most recent published price increases in October. As a result, we expect price realization to more than offset inflation to an even larger extent in fiscal 2022. Fiscal year 2021 was a year of opportunities as well as challenges. Demand was very strong across most of our end markets, and our team stepped up to meet the needs of our customers. Net sales for the year increased to $18.7 billion, and we reported adjusted segment EBITDA of $3 billion. Net sales and adjusted segment EBITDA were both up an impressive 7% year-over-year. 
Adjusted earnings per share of $3.39 was up 23% and we generated record adjusted free cash flow of $1.5 billion. We also hit our net leverage target of 2.25x to 2.5x ending the year at 2.38x. Looking forward, we have momentum entering fiscal 2022. We have a strong balance sheet and our strategic investments are now ramping up and are set to generate significant benefits in 2022. Our innovation pipeline continues to grow, and we have reached an annual run rate of more than $280 million of sales from plastic replacement opportunities. We are well positioned to help our customers with integrated packaging solutions that help them grow their sales, reduce their risk and improve their sustainability. 
Now turning to Slide 6. We generated $1.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow in fiscal 2021. The sixth straight year that WestRock has generated more than $1 billion in free cash flow. As we have shared before, our core capital allocation principles are very clear. We plan to reinvest in our business and maintain a sustainable and growing dividend. We will opportunistically repurchase shares and consider strategic investments and acquisitions when there is a clear line of sight to generate attractive returns on invested capital and our actions align with this strategy. 
During fiscal 2021, we invested $816 million into our business through capital investments that maintained our assets and support our growth in the future. Given our consistent cash flow generation over multiple business cycles, we increased our dividend, raising it 20% in May, and then again, as announced in October, for a total increase of 25% since February. We further strengthened our balance sheet as we reduced adjusted net debt by $1.3 billion to $7.7 billion and returned to our targeted leverage ratio. We repurchased $122 million of stock or 2.4 million shares. As noted earlier, we completed our investments at our Florence and Trace Baja's mills in fiscal 2021, we will continue to realize increasing benefits of these investments as we move into fiscal 2022. And as we enter the new year, we remain disciplined in our capital allocation strategy and are committed to retaining an investment-grade credit profile. 
Overall demand remains strong as we have highlighted, supply chain challenges negatively impacted our production and sales volumes. Looking at our markets, our demand for food and beverage products make up almost half of our packaging volumes. Within food and beverage, retail food demand continues to be strong with COVID-related market gains continuing. Food service trends are improving, especially in quick serve and fast casual, although these channels are experiencing ongoing labor challenges, which are impacting total consumption. Volumes in the retail and e-commerce channel were stable year-over-year. This channel makes up approximately 13% of our packaging volume, and our e-commerce remains a key driver of overall box demand. The holiday buying season should be lengthened due to supply chain disruptions. We anticipate total projected growth rates to be in line with our overall fiscal 2022 expectation. Sales to the beauty and health care markets are 12% of our packaging volume. These markets were significantly impacted by the pandemic, and they continue to recover as markets reopen. Our broad mix of end market participation enables us to remain resilient in the face of uncertainty, and our capabilities and manufacturing footprint allows us to quickly pivot to meet our customers' needs. We will continue to grow our packaging business, driven by our unique innovation portfolio and our ability to design solutions for our customers that optimize primary, secondary and tertiary packaging. 
Moving to Slide 8. One of the biggest challenges many of our consumer brand customers face is a demand for more sustainable packaging. WestRock is helping these customers meet this demand through our innovative material science and design capabilities. This slide includes a few of our most recent customer partnerships, which range from designing plastic-free packaging to machinery that produces shelf-ready recyclable packaging that helps reduce labor costs and meet sustainability goals. 
Tim Hortons recently announced our partnership to test a recyclable and compostable hot beverage cup. We look forward to this work with a valued customer to move the recyclability of cups forward. And these are just a few examples that have generated our current $280 million run rate of incremental sales from plastics replacement. We continue to believe this opportunity is in excess of $500 million incremental sales annually. 
I'd like to highlight a few of our award-winning packaging designs on Slide 9. The Paperboard Packaging Council recently held their annual awards, and I'm pleased to share that we won the Sustainability Award of the Year for our partnership with Coca-Cola Europe Pacific Partners on their use of WestRock's can collar and the product packaging. Can collar is a durable paperboard-based multipack solution for cans and it performs incredibly well throughout the supply chain. We also won 12 additional awards for sustainability, innovation and design. These awards are great recognition of the outstanding work of the WestRock team. Turning to Slide 10 and our financial guidance for the first quarter 2022, we continue to successfully implement all previously published price increases. We expect sequential cost inflation driven by higher natural gas, diesel and recycled and virgin fiber costs. This commodity cost inflation combined with our seasonal increase in health care cost is forecasted to be approximately $100 million higher than the fourth quarter. However, the good news is that we expect the flow through of the price increases that we are implementing to more than offset this inflation. And due to delays in mill maintenance earlier in fiscal 2021, along with our originally planned outages,  we have approximately 200,000 tons of scheduled downtime across our system that will negatively impact earnings by approximately $75 million. We have 10 major mill maintenance outages in the first fiscal quarter, one of the largest amounts in one quarter in WestRock's history. These assumptions, combined with 3 fewer shipping days and the normal seasonality in our consumer business results in forecasted adjusted segment EBITDA of $660 million to $700 million and adjusted EPS of $0.56 to $0.67 per share. 
In fiscal 2022, we expect solid demand across most of our end markets and continued flow-through of the previously published price increases. We expect a record fiscal year in sales and adjusted segment EBITDA. We anticipate some offset as a result of continued commodity input cost inflation. We fully anticipate the implementation of previously published price increases to outpace inflation. We also expect productivity to be unavoidably affected by ongoing supply chain challenges and higher labor costs that may persist through the fiscal year. Our planned mill maintenance outage schedule declines throughout the fiscal year, but will still be approximately 100,000 tons higher than in fiscal 2021. Given these assumptions, we forecast adjusted segment EBITDA to be in the range of $3.3 billion to $3.7 billion. This range is driven by varying levels of commodity inflation. 
Since the formation of WestRock, we've been able to grow sales, earnings and adjusted free cash flows across various business cycles at attractive compounded annual rates. We have a resilient business model, which was reinforced with record adjusted free cash flows in fiscal 2021 in the face of many challenges. Our outlook for fiscal 2022 continues the remarkable trend of growth in sales and adjusted segment EBITDA as well as strong cash flow. With the industry's broadest portfolio of paper and packaging solutions, we can bring unique value to our customers and our shareholders. 
As we turn to fiscal 2022, I've decided to update our reporting structure into 3 new segments: packaging, paper and distribution. As we move forward with our strategy, this new structure will better align our reporting to the way we will be running our company and provide clarity into the performance of each area. Our Packaging segment will include our converted packaging businesses that serve diverse end markets with attractive margins. This segment is well positioned for future growth, fueled by WestRock's unrivaled capabilities. WestRock has an unmatched portfolio of sustainable packaging solutions and the ability to drive innovation that helps our customers critical challenges. As market trends evolve in this dynamic environment, WestRock is uniquely positioned to adapt to these trends and our customers' changing needs. 
The Paper segment will be comprised of our external paper sales. We have strong customers in our attractive domestic containerboard and paperboard businesses, and we will continue to partner with these customers. And as we do this, we will seek to reduce our exposure to the export containerboard and specialty SBS markets. 
We are focused on driving cost reductions across our newly integrated supply chain and investing to improve the competitiveness of our mill system. And finally, the distribution segment will be made up of our Victory Packaging business. This differentiated service solution is an important channel for WestRock's products. The business provides local warehousing and distribution services that enhance efficiency and provide flexibility in serving our customers. We believe these new segments more closely align with our strategy and the way we will run our business going forward. I look forward to sharing more information on these segments when we report in this format in the first quarter. 
As we look to the future, we are investing in innovation with expansion of our research and development teams to bring an enhanced focus on innovation such as improvements in material science, converting and machinery and automation. Growth in digital technology and how smart packaging can drive sales and brand engagement is also an area on ongoing development at WestRock. We are also building a sales excellence platform that leverages our broad and differentiated portfolio that will bring all of these solutions to customers in a way that fully leverages the power of the WestRock enterprise. The opportunities for WestRock are unrivaled in the industry, and I look forward to all that is ahead. 
And as I wrap up today, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Ward Dickson for his contributions to the success of WestRock. As CFO, Ward has been instrumental in the growth and development of our company, overseeing more than 20 mergers and acquisitions, including the merger of Midwest Paco and Rock 10, the spin-off of Ingevity, the sale of our Home, Health and Beauty plastics business and the disposition of our land and development business. I have benefited from his assistance as I joined the company greatly and know we will all miss him here at WestRock. Ward, I wish you the very best in your retirement. At the same time, I also want to welcome Alex Pease, WestRock's incoming CFO, who is sitting in with us today. Alex, I look forward to working with you as well. 
We have great opportunities to grow our company and improve margins while providing value to our customers, teammates and shareholders. We are working to leverage the power of the enterprise and making the investments needed to lead in sustainability and accelerate our innovation platform. As we do this, we remain disciplined in our capital allocation strategy, and we'll look to use our strong cash flow to create shareholder value. As we implement our strategy, we have multiple levers to create value and grow sales and earnings. We are excited about the opportunities ahead and look forward to further discussing our strategy and long-term goals at our Investor Day in New York on February 24. 
Fiscal 2021 was a great year for WestRock. I want to thank our 50,000 team members for dedication and effort, and I look forward to the great things ahead for our company. That concludes my prepared remarks. James, we are now ready for Q&A."

I'll start with the quarter, Q4 to Q1, and then I'll try to walk you through some of the key assumptions for the range that we provided for the full fiscal year in FY '22. So the primary key drivers for Q1 is we have the benefit and th",998,"John, this is Ward. I'll start with the quarter, Q4 to Q1, and then I'll try to walk you through some of the key assumptions for the range that we provided for the full fiscal year in FY '22. So the primary key drivers for Q1 is we have the benefit and the pricing flow-through from the PPW increases. Price does in fact outpace inflation. We have seasonally lower volumes in our corrugated -- or our Consumer Packaging business. We have 3 fewer shipping days in our Corrugated Packaging business. This is the largest maintenance outage quarter since the merger. We have 200,000 tons of maintenance outages in the quarter. I think we're doing it across 10 mills in both our corrugated and consumer mill system. That accounts for $75 million worth of incremental costs from Q4 to Q1. And then we highlighted in the script that we have approximately $100 million worth of increased costs from Q4 to Q1, and that's driven by higher natural gas, higher virgin fiber because of the wet weather.  The increases -- the full quarter increases in OCC that we had. And then we always have in our fourth calendar quarter or our fiscal first quarter seasonally higher health care costs because everybody has passed their deductibles and they're trying to get discretionary health care in at the end of the year. 
And then finally, the supply chain challenges that we've had continue to hamper productivity. If you look at the impact of the outages and some of the start-up costs that aren't capitalized and amortized over our outage periods but are actually incurred in the quarter plus the challenges that we've had in moving material both around our system, from our mills to our converting operations and to our customers that our productivity has been -- will be lower in Q1 relative to Q4. So those are the primary drivers. 
And again, the quarter represents about 19% -- the midpoint of the guidance for the quarter represents about 19% of the total year midpoint of EBITDA. Last year, we generated about 21% or 22% of our full year in the first quarter. So we always have a seasonally slower start in the first half of the year relative to the second half of the year in our earnings generation. 
Now if that's okay, I will flip to the full year and walk you through the key elements of our guidance for the full year. So the midpoint of the guidance for the full year reflects record sales and EBITDA and strong cash flow generation. And what we are assuming is the full year impact and flow-through of the previously published price increases and that price increases will outpace inflation. In fact, the biggest significant driver of the earnings growth from year-to-year is the price and inflation relationship. So we will have the full year impact of all these published price increases across all of our grades. We have solid demand across both paper and packaging, and we'll have growth in our core markets. We have the ramp-up of the capital investment that we made in Brazil and its impact on volumes, both in our ability to sell external paper and to feed the ramp-up of our Portafolice box plant. Inflation really reflects the full year impact of the rapid increases that we had in fiber and energy cost during the second half of fiscal 2021. So I'm going to give you some very specific assumptions that we've got in the midpoint of our guidance related to OCC and some other costs. And I think everyone needs to remember, OCC exited fiscal '21 at $80 per ton higher than the average for the full year. And so in our midpoint for OCC, we assumed $166 per ton for the full year. That's a $60 per ton increase from FY '21. And our quarterly profile, Q1, we assume $175 a ton, which is up $8 a ton from Q4. In Q2 and Q3, we see some reduction of $165 a ton. And then in Q4, we see $160 a ton. So the recycled fiber inflation is -- on a year-over-year basis is more than $325 million. This approaches $350 million for the full year. And then natural gas is a similar story with September's cost as we exited FY '21, they're 40% higher than the average was for the full year. So the current strips reflect a 50% increase versus FY '21. So this is a material cost inflation element on a year-over-year basis. 
And then virgin fiber, chemicals and transportation costs, all ramped up during the second half of the year. And we do not see any real changes to the supply chain environment until we get into our fourth quarter or towards the end of the calendar year in FY '22. So again, I think the key driver is we're going to get sales growth from price and volume, price outpaces inflation. Supply chain disruptions continue and will impact productivity -- Our investments in Brazil ramp up and we start to get the benefits of that. And then we also get the benefit -- full year benefits from our investment in Florence. 
And then finally, I'll just really quickly talk about cash flow for the full year as well. Operating cash flow was flat on higher EBITDA, but that's really driven by the benefits of the pandemic action plan and their contribution to operating cash flow in FY '21. I'll remind everybody that we made -- our payments for our 401(k) match and our short-term incentive were made in stock during FY '21, where they've returned back to cash. And then the Cares Act payroll deferrals for which we got a deferral in FY '21, that now flips and we actually have to make those payments, our first payment in FY '22. And then we are assuming that we're going to invest $1 billion in capital investments in our

And durable and nondurable goods are also showing positive trends. Consumer spending is strong. So we feel pretty good about the full year. 
As Ward had mentioned, in the first quarter, we do have the fewer shipping days impacting especially core and also the seasonal slowdown as we look at highlights for the full year, continued growth in e-commerce with the return of brick-and-mortar is certainly a tailwind for us. The online and e-commerce market is really becoming a little bit blurred between the online and brick-and-mortar because you've got to buy online and pick up in store, pick up at curb side. And so that's kind of blurring which one is really e-commerce versus brick and mortar, but we do see growth there. We see some important COVID reopening dependent trends, duty-free retail in the travel market. COVID test kits depending on how things sort out around the world with COVID will also have an impact. 
Food service, we do see strength in that, especially with QSR and certainly, sporting events and concerts coming back open, have returned cup stock to the prepandemic levels. Commercial print, which was down last year has also returned to pre-pandemic levels. 
So we feel really good about that. And David mentioned in his introductory comments that the center of the store and packaged food and beverage is still holding the pre-pandemic gains, so up significantly over a 2-year trend. When we look at the start to the first quarter here and especially in corrugated box, I'll make just some brief comments. Traditionally, we see the holiday season picking up, and we see -- we're starting to see some of that. But the comps year-over-year are pretty difficult because of the peak last year. We -- and the labor challenges that we talked about in August and September certainly impacted us. We think the worst is behind us there. And we saw sequential improvement as September was better than August and October is better than September. Operating rates across the industry are high. Backlogs are strong and -- while there remains some uncertainty in the supply chain issues we've talked about, we're generally positive on seeing sequential improvement in our corrugated box business in the quarter."

So I think as we announced our new structure change as we focus on the high-value packaging segments, the paper markets that we want to focus on, on the domestic side, we're going to make sure we have world-class assets that align to that into the markets we want to grow. And as we've mentioned before, we're also looking at how do we provide more flexibility into our mill system to adapt to the broad portfolio that we have, so we can take advantage of market trends. And as your point, to different grades, where there's growth and then where we can deemphasize grades where we don't want to grow. So  that's how we're thinking about it. And we have multiple productivity programs underway right now.

So we really believe we're gaining market share in this segment. It continues to grow. We've consolidated our consumer and MPS business, and we're already starting to see efficiencies there.

Thanks, David. And yes, the consumer business has seen some nice margin enhancement over the last several quarters is David mentioned, we're almost 16% EBITDA margins and the -- it's up about 220 basis points year-over-year and 40 basis points sequentially. So good momentum there and a big part of that, an important part of that in addition to productivity and some of the changes that we've made in the footprint and the products are producing at EBITDA. But a big part of that is certainly what we're seeing on organic growth and sustainability is an important driver. Their connected packaging and digital solutions are also important and automation is critical there. So we've generated up to this point, a run rate of about $280 million worth of plastics replacement alone. As David said earlier, that's going to be over $500 million annually that we'll get to in the next few years. We've shared a number of those examples in the past, and we're coming out with new offerings. We've got the Tim Hortons cup trial, and that's not just a paperboard solution, that's actually producing cups for us for the first time, and we have 11 patents on that application. So great opportunity for us to have a sustainable solution there, sustainable in terms of long-term economic value as well as the environmental benefits we've talked about. 
We also have launched a new PACK EXPO. We just launched a new fiber-based package for frozen food. And this is one that I really want to highlight because it's perhaps one of our best examples coming forward of optimizing primary, secondary and tertiary packaging, which is something that only WestRock can do. Nobody else has a fiber-based packaging solution that can do this. And specifically, what we're doing as we're making a fiber-based bowl that's sustainable, recyclable and at some point, compostable. We're wrapping that bowl in a secondary package, and then we have a shelf-ready tertiary package, corrugated medium to go around all of that. And this is all automated from the beginning until the end. 
And so when you look at what we can do around design, material science, digitally connected solutions as well as automation, machinery and robotics. This is a tremendous advantage for company overall, and it's going to continue to deliver growth for the consumer segment."

Appreciate it. There's a couple of areas that we're really focused on. And you've probably heard me say in the past, the opportunities to better integrate the acquisitions that we've made over the past several years. So I'm going to highlight just a couple of areas that I believe we're going to have a material impact on our productivity. The first is supply chain. We recently hired a new Chief Supply Chain Officer, Peter Anderson, who came over from the Cummins that we're really excited about. If you go back to the way we were structured before in our businesses, we had unique supply chain aspects across several of them. 
So the productivity opportunity to consolidate our supply chain, consolidate our warehousing, get our S&OP right with the consolidation of our mills, our freight spend, as you know, is very high, so be able to look at that. We see tremendous opportunity to become more efficient in our supply chain. So that's one area that we think is going to drive material savings. The second piece is bringing together our mills together in one organization and highlighting new productivity initiatives across the mill. So to your point on previous productivity -- or previous productivity programs with standard inflation, we're now pushing to see how do we significantly improve our productivity on top of inflation. And so we have multiple projects, both at our mill system as well as our conversion sites. We've identified several areas where we can reduce our waste, get a little bit better with our digital manufacturing footprint as far as predictive analytics, improve our unscheduled downtime. So we see great opportunities there. And then the last piece I'll talk about is commercial. So we recently, in the first phase, consolidated our NPS and consumer business. And we've just recognized tremendous efficiencies there. We had multiple customer service teams. If you look at the backroom integration opportunities, as well as customer-facing opportunities where we can go is 1 phase with complete solutions to our customers. And now we'll expand that where customers want to buy across our portfolio with this new world that I've talked about in supply chain, primary, secondary, tertiary packaging. So now we'll be more efficient in how we do that and how we service them. 
So it really transcends across really, I think, our whole organization, and we are really going to drive further productivity and cost out but we're not going to cost our way out of this. We're also going to invest in innovation. We're going to invest in digital, both on the customer smart packaging side that Pat talked about as well as the manufacturing side. We think there's tremendous opportunity to modernize the company. So we get really excited about the opportunities. A lot of those projects are underway, and we'll look forward to sharing more detail about them with you at our Investor Day."

And so I think we're seeing a nice growth is in the omnichannel piece where there's those brick-and-mortars that are trying to get into more of an e-commerce channel.

Certainly, with the supply chain disruptions that we've talked about before, we saw some flattening of that in the fourth quarter, but we expect ongoing growth into next year. 
We think e-commerce, it's a huge spike, obviously, in fiscal year '20 with the stay-at-home economy, but we do expect it to continue to grow in that mid-teens range out in the future off of a much higher base than it was 2 years ago. And as David mentioned, it's a very dynamic marketplace with all the different omnichannel aspects. And kind of just to wrap up, we have corrugated solutions, a whole hostess folding carton solutions, paperboard solutions, craft paper. 
We've got digital and physical displays, whether it's in the store or through the e-commerce channel distribution, machinery and automation, box on demand and other solutions that we've introduced there, really, however, this market evolves in terms of the mix across the omnichannel, I really believe. And we really believe that we have the opportunity to provide unique solutions in this industry. So it will continue to be very important to us in the future, and we're well poised to capitalize."

In a moment, I'll walk you through our performance in the quarter, full year and our outlook for fiscal 2022 as we currently see it. But first, I would like to make some personal observations as we approach the end of the calendar year.",2692,"Thank you, James. In a moment, I'll walk you through our performance in the quarter, full year and our outlook for fiscal 2022 as we currently see it. But first, I would like to make some personal observations as we approach the end of the calendar year. 
It's clear that WestRock is a great company with 50,000 dedicated employees who work tremendously hard everyday. Since I joined WestRock, I've had the opportunity to dig into the business and now have a much clearer picture of both the challenges and substantial opportunities for our company.  
We will outline our vision for the future in greater detail at our Investor Day on February 24, and we'll be taking a number of important steps between now and then to set us up for greater success in the future. 
Already, there are a number of things that are clear to me. To start, our business has been and remains very strong. WestRock serves customers in a wide range of end markets with the broadest portfolio of packaging solutions in the industry, and this provides us with greater opportunity and flexibility to focus on growing markets where our differentiation is valued. Looking forward, we have to be more efficient. We have to accelerate our innovation efforts, and we have to move faster and focus on our core strategy, and we are doing just that.  
Now turning to the fourth quarter. We achieved record sales growth in a dynamic environment. I want to thank our WestRock teammates for their continued hard work and dedication to serving our customers. In the quarter, sales of $5.1 billion were up 14% year-over-year. Adjusted segment EBITDA also improved significantly, rising to $878 million or 22% year-over-year, and adjusted earnings per share of $1.23 increased 68% compared to prior year. In the quarter, we realized higher volumes along with higher pricing which more than offset the year-over-year inflation.  
We updated our guidance in September for the fourth quarter and achieved a bit better than we said we'd do. Packaging sales increased by 8% year-over-year, driven by the implementation of price increases across our business. Packaging volumes were down 1.6% year-over-year, with box volumes down 1%. Labor shortages and supply chain issues caused disruption in our production and shipments to our customers. We are making all possible efforts to improve these conditions where we can.  
Paper volumes increased 13% year-over-year on strong demand across all grades. Overall inflation was higher across the industry than widely anticipated, and therefore, results came in at the low end of our guidance. This inflation was driven by increased costs for recycled fiber, virgin fiber and natural gas. 
Our Corrugated adjusted segment EBITDA margins of 18.4% increased sequentially and year-over-year. The Brazil business generated 35% EBITDA margins driven by strong demand and the positive impact of the ramp-up of our Tres Barras Mill after the completion of the expansion project.  
Our Consumer Packaging segment performed very well with adjusted segment EBITDA margins of 15.9%, up 220 basis points from prior year and 40 basis points sequentially. 
Overall, WestRock adjusted segment EBITDA margins of 17.2% were up 110 basis points versus prior year and 40 basis points sequentially. This adjusted segment EBITDA includes $5 million of proceeds from business interruption insurance. 
In the quarter, we generated adjusted free cash flow of $372 million. As part of our balanced capital allocation strategy, we repurchased $122 million of stock and redeemed $400 million of bonds that would have matured in March 2022. 
Cost inflation increased at higher-than-normal levels throughout the year. Our implementation of the previously published price increases more than offset inflation for fiscal 2021. The latest August containerboard published price increase is currently being implemented. We are also in the process of implementing published price increases in craft paper and realizing higher pricing and export containerboard. Consumer price flow through throughout and across all grades will continue into fiscal 2022, including the implementation of the most recent published price increases in October. As a result, we expect price realization to more than offset inflation to an even larger extent in fiscal 2022. 
Fiscal year 2021 was a year of opportunities as well as challenges. Demand was very strong across most of our end markets, and our team stepped up to meet the needs of our customers. Net sales for the year increased to $18.7 billion, and we reported adjusted segment EBITDA of $3 billion. Net sales and adjusted segment EBITDA were both up an impressive 7% year-over-year. Adjusted earnings per share of $3.39 was up 23%, and we generated record adjusted free cash flow of $1.5 billion. We also hit our net leverage target of 2.25x to 2.5x ending the year at 2.38x. 
Looking forward, we have momentum entering fiscal 2022. We have a strong balance sheet and our strategic investments are now ramping up and are set to generate significant benefits in 2022. Our innovation pipeline continues to grow, and we have reached an annual run rate of more than $280 million of sales from plastic replacement opportunities. We are well positioned to help our customers with integrated packaging solutions that help them grow their sales, reduce their risk and improve their sustainability.  
Now turning to Slide 6. We generated $1.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow in fiscal 2021, the sixth straight year that WestRock has generated more than $1 billion in free cash flow. As we have shared before, our core capital allocation principles are very clear. We plan to reinvest in our business and maintain a sustainable and growing dividend. We will opportunistically repurchase shares and consider strategic investments and acquisitions when there is a clear line of sight to generate attractive returns on invested capital. 
And our actions align with this strategy. During fiscal 2021, we invested $816 million into our business through capital investments that maintained our assets and support our growth in the future. 
Given our consistent cash flow generation over multiple business cycles, we increased our dividend, raising it 20% in May, and then again, as announced in October, for a total increase of 25% since February. We further strengthened our balance sheet as we reduced adjusted net debt by $1.3 billion to $7.7 billion and returned to our targeted leverage ratio. We repurchased $122 million of stock or 2.4 million shares. 
As noted earlier, we completed our investments at our Florence and Tres Barras Mills in fiscal 2021. We will continue to realize increasing benefits of these investments as we move into fiscal 2022. 
And as we enter the new year, we remain disciplined in our capital allocation strategy and are committed to retaining an investment-grade credit profile.  
Overall demand remains strong. As we have highlighted, supply chain challenges negatively impacted our production and sales volumes. Looking at our markets, our demand for food and beverage products make up almost half of our packaging volumes. Within food and beverage, retail food demand continues to be strong with COVID-related market gains continuing. 
Foodservice trends are improving, especially in quick serve and fast casual, although these channels are experiencing ongoing labor challenges, which are impacting total consumption. 
Volumes in the retail and the e-commerce channel were stable year-over-year. This channel makes up approximately 13% of our packaging volume, and our e-commerce remains a key driver of overall box demand. The holiday buying season should be lengthened due to supply chain disruptions. We anticipate total projected growth rates to be in line with our overall fiscal 2022 expectation. 
Sales to the beauty and health care markets are 12% of our packaging volume. These markets were significantly impacted by the pandemic, and they continue to recover as markets reopen. 
Our broad mix of end market participation enables us to remain resilient in the face of uncertainty, and our capabilities and manufacturing footprint allows us to quickly pivot to meet our customers' needs. We will continue to grow our packaging business, driven by our unique innovation portfolio and our ability to design solutions for our customers that optimize primary, secondary and tertiary packaging.  
Moving to Slide 8. One of the biggest challenges many of our consumer brand customers face is a demand for more sustainable packaging. WestRock is helping these customers meet this demand through our innovative material science and design capabilities. 
This slide includes a few of our most recent customer partnerships, which range from designing plastic-free packaging to machinery that produces shelf-ready recyclable packaging that helps reduce labor costs and meet sustainability goals.  
Tim Hortons recently announced our partnership to test a recyclable and compostable hot beverage cup. We look forward to this work with a valued customer to move the recyclability of cups forward. And these are just a few examples that have generated our current $280 million run rate of incremental sales from plastics replacement. We continue to believe this opportunity is in excess of $500 million incremental sales annually.  
I'd like to highlight a few of our award-winning packaging designs on Slide 9. The Paperboard Packaging Council recently held their annual awards, and I'm pleased to share that we won the Sustainability Award of the Year for our partnership with Coca-Cola Europacific Partners on their use of WestRock's can collar and the product packaging. Can collar is a durable paperboard-based multipack solution for cans and it performs incredibly well throughout the supply chain. 
We also won 12 additional awards for sustainability, innovation and design. These awards are great recognition of the outstanding work of the WestRock team. 
Turning to Slide 10 and our financial guidance for the first quarter 2022. We continue to successfully implement all previously published price increases. We expect sequential cost inflation driven by higher natural gas, diesel and recycled and virgin fiber costs. This commodity cost inflation combined with our seasonal increase in health care cost is forecasted to be approximately $100 million higher than the fourth quarter. However, the good news is that we expect the flow-through of the price increases that we are implementing to more than offset this inflation. 
And due to delays in mill maintenance earlier in fiscal 2021, along with our originally planned outages, we have approximately 200,000 tons of scheduled downtime across our system that will negatively impact earnings by approximately $75 million. We have 10 major mill maintenance outages in the first fiscal quarter, one of the largest amounts in one quarter in WestRock's history. These assumptions, combined with 3 fewer shipping days and the normal seasonality in our consumer business, results in forecasted adjusted segment EBITDA of $660 million to $700 million and adjusted EPS of $0.56 to $0.67 per share.  
In fiscal 2022, we expect solid demand across most of our end markets and continued flow-through of the previously published price increases. We expect a record fiscal year in sales and adjusted segment EBITDA. We anticipate some offset as a result of continued commodity input cost inflation. We fully anticipate the implementation of previously published price increases to outpace inflation. We also expect productivity to be unavoidably affected by ongoing supply chain challenges and higher labor costs that may persist through the fiscal year. Our planned mill maintenance outage schedule declines throughout the fiscal year, but will still be approximately 100,000 tons higher than in fiscal 2021. 
Given these assumptions, we forecast adjusted segment EBITDA to be in the range of $3.3 billion to $3.7 billion. This range is driven by varying levels of commodity inflation.  
Since the formation of WestRock, we have been able to grow sales, earnings and adjusted free cash flows across various business cycles at attractive compounded annual rates. We have a resilient business model, which was reinforced with record adjusted free cash flows in fiscal 2021 in the face of many challenges. 
Our outlook for fiscal 2022 continues the remarkable trend of growth in sales and adjusted segment EBITDA as well as strong cash flow. With the industry's broadest portfolio of paper and packaging solutions, we can bring unique value to our customers and our shareholders.  
As we turn to fiscal 2022, I've decided to update our reporting structure into 3 new segments: Packaging, Paper and Distribution. As we move forward with our strategy, this new structure will better align our reporting to the way we will be running our company and provide clarity into the performance of each area. 
Our Packaging segment will include our converted packaging businesses that serve diverse end markets with attractive margins. This segment is well positioned for future growth, fueled by WestRock's unrivaled capabilities. WestRock has an unmatched portfolio of sustainable packaging solutions and the ability to drive innovation that helps our customers' critical challenges. As market trends evolve in this dynamic environment, WestRock is uniquely positioned to adapt to these trends and our customers' changing needs.  
The Paper segment will be comprised of our external paper sales. We have strong customers in our attractive domestic containerboard and paperboard businesses, and we will continue to partner with these customers. And as we do this, we will seek to reduce our exposure to the export containerboard and specialty SBS markets. We are focused on driving cost reductions across our newly integrated supply chain and investing to improve the competitiveness of our mill system. 
And finally, the Distribution segment will be made up of our Victory Packaging business. This differentiated service solution is an important channel for WestRock's products. The business provides local warehousing and distribution services that enhance efficiency and provide flexibility in serving our customers. 
We believe these new segments more closely align with our strategy and the way we will run our business going forward. I look forward to sharing more information on these segments when we report in this format in the first quarter.  
As we look to the future, we are investing in innovation with expansion of our research and development teams to bring an enhanced focus on innovation such as improvements in material science, converting and machinery and automation. Growth in digital technology and how smart packaging can drive sales and brand engagement is also an area on ongoing development at WestRock. 
We are also building a sales excellence platform that leverages our broad and differentiated portfolio that will bring all of these solutions to customers in a way that fully leverages the power of the WestRock enterprise. The opportunities for WestRock are unrivaled in the industry, and I look forward to all that is ahead.  
And as I wrap up today, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Ward Dickson for his contributions to the success of WestRock. As CFO, Ward has been instrumental in the growth and development of our company, overseeing more than 20 mergers and acquisitions, including the merger of MeadWestvaco and RockTenn, the spinoff of Ingevity, the sale of our Home, Health and Beauty Plastics business, and the disposition of our land and development business. 
I have benefited from his assistance as I joined the company greatly and know we will all miss him here at WestRock. Ward, I wish you the very best in your retirement. 
At the same time, I also want to welcome Alex Pease, WestRock's incoming CFO, who is sitting in with us today. Alex, I look forward to working with you as well.  
We have great opportunities to grow our company and improve margins while providing value to our customers, teammates and shareholders. We are working to leverage the power of the enterprise and making the investments needed to lead in sustainability and accelerate our innovation platform. 
As we do this, we remain disciplined in our capital allocation strategy, and we'll look to use our strong cash flow to create shareholder value. As we implement our strategy, we have multiple levers to create value and grow sales and earnings. We are excited about the opportunities ahead and look forward to further discussing our strategy and long-term goals at our Investor Day in New York on February 24.  
Fiscal 2021 was a great year for WestRock. I want to thank our 50,000 team members for dedication and effort, and I look forward to the great things ahead for our company. That concludes my prepared remarks. 
James, we are now ready for Q&A."

We have seasonally lower volumes in our Corrugated -- or our Consumer Packaging business. We have 3 fewer shipping days in our Corrugated Packaging business. This is the largest maintenance outage quarter since the merger. We have 200,000 tons of maintenance outages in the quarter. I think we're doing it across 10 mills in both our corrugated and consumer mill system. That accounts for $75 million worth of incremental costs from Q4 to Q1. 
And then we highlighted in the script that we have approximately $100 million worth of increased costs from Q4 to Q1, and that's driven by higher natural gas, higher virgin fiber because of the wet weather. The increases -- the full quarter increases in OCC that we had. 
And then we always have in our fourth calendar quarter or our fiscal first quarter seasonally higher health care costs because everybody has passed their deductibles and they're trying to get discretionary health care in at the end of the year.  
And then finally, the supply chain challenges that we've had continue to hamper productivity. If you look at the impact of the outages and some of the start-up costs that aren't capitalized and amortized over our outage periods but are actually incurred in the quarter plus the challenges that we've had in moving material both around our system, from our mills to our converting operations and to our customers, that our productivity has been -- will be lower in Q1 relative to Q4. So those are the primary drivers.  
And again, the quarter represents about 19% -- the midpoint of the guidance for the quarter represents about 19% of the total year midpoint of EBITDA. Last year, we generated about 21% or 22% of our full year in the first quarter. So we always have a seasonally slower start in the first half of the year relative to the second half of the year in our earnings generation.  
Now if that's okay, I will flip to the full year and walk you through the key elements of our guidance for the full year. So the midpoint of the guidance for the full year reflects record sales and EBITDA and strong cash flow generation. And what we are assuming is the full year impact and flow-through of the previously published price increases and that price increases will outpace inflation. In fact, the biggest significant driver of the earnings growth from year-to-year is the price and inflation relationship. 
So we will have the full year impact of all these published price increases across all of our grades. We have solid demand across both Paper and Packaging, and we'll have growth in our core markets. We have the ramp-up of the capital investment that we made in Brazil and its impact on volumes, both in our ability to sell external paper and to feed the ramp-up of our Porto Feliz box plant. 
Inflation really reflects the full year impact of the rapid increases that we had in fiber and energy cost during the second half of fiscal 2021. So I'm going to give you some very specific assumptions that we've got in the midpoint of our guidance related to OCC and some other costs. And I think everyone needs to remember, OCC exited fiscal '21 at $80 per ton higher than the average for the full year. 
And so in our midpoint for OCC, we assumed $166 per ton for the full year. That's a $60 per ton increase from FY '21. And our quarterly profile, Q1, we assume $175 a ton, which is up $8 a ton from Q4. In Q2 and Q3, we see some reduction of $165 a ton. And then in Q4, we see $160 a ton. 
So the recycled fiber inflation is -- on a year-over-year basis is more than $325 million. This approaches $350 million for the full year. 
And then natural gas is a similar story with September's cost as we exited FY '21, they're 40% higher than the average was for the full year. So the current strips reflect a 50% increase versus FY '21. So this is a material cost inflation element on a year-over-year basis.  
And then virgin fiber, chemicals and transportation costs all ramped up during the second half of the year. And we do not see any real changes to the supply chain environment until we get into our fourth quarter or towards the end of the calendar year in FY '22. 
So again, I think the key driver is we're going to get sales growth from price and volume. Price outpaces inflation. Supply chain disruptions continue and will impact productivity. Our investments in Brazil ramp up and we start to get the benefits of that. And then we also get the benefit -- full year benefits from our investment in Florence.  
And then finally, I'll just really quickly talk about cash flow for the full year as well. Operating cash flow was flat on higher EBITDA, but that's really driven by the benefits of the pandemic action plan and their contribution to operating cash flow in FY '21. 
I'll remind everybody that we made -- our payments for our 401(k) match and our short-term incentive were made in stock during FY '21, where they've returned back to cash. And then the CARES Act payroll deferrals for which we got a deferral in FY '21, that now flips and we actually have to make those payments, our first payment in FY '22. 
And then we are assuming that we're going to invest $1 billion in capital investments in our system. And that's what drives the cash flow generation. year-over-year."

So overall, our market conditions going into the fiscal year are generally stable and healthy across most segments. Economic fundamentals are pretty solid. 2002 (sic) [ 2022 ] GDP is expected to be about 4%. And durable and nondurable goods are also showing positive trends. Consumer spending is strong. So we feel pretty good about that for the full year. 
As Ward had mentioned, in the first quarter, we do have the fewer shipping days impacting us, especially Corrugated, and also the seasonal slowdown in Consumer Packaging, which happens every single year. 
But as we look at highlights for the full year, continued growth in e-commerce with the return of brick-and-mortar is certainly a tailwind for us. The online and e-commerce market is really becoming a little bit blurred between the online and brick-and-mortar because you've got to buy online and pick up in store, pick up at curb side. And so that's kind of blurring, which one is really e-commerce versus brick and mortar, but we do see growth there. 
We see some important COVID reopening dependent trends, duty-free retail in the travel market. With international travel, we'll return high-end spirits, beauty and cosmetics.
COVID test kits, depending on how things sort out around the world with COVID, will also have an impact.  
Foodservice, we do see strength in that, especially with QSR and certainly, sporting events and concerts coming back open, have returned cup stock to the pre-pandemic levels. Commercial print, which was down last year, has also returned to pre-pandemic levels.  
So we feel really good about that. And David mentioned in his introductory comments that the center of the store and packaged food and beverage is still holding the pre-pandemic gains, so up significantly over a 2-year trend. 
When we look at the start to the first quarter here and especially in corrugated box, I'll make just some brief comments. Traditionally, we see the holiday season picking up, and we see -- we're starting to see some of that. But the comps year-over-year are pretty difficult because of the peak last year. We -- and the labor challenges that we had talked about in August and September certainly impacted us. We think the worst is behind us there. And we saw sequential improvement as September was better than August and October is better than September. 
Operating rates across the industry are high. Backlogs are strong. And while there remains some uncertainty in the supply chain issues we've talked about, we're generally positive on seeing sequential improvement in our corrugated box business in the quarter."

So I think as we announced our new structure change, as we focused on the high-value packaging segments, the paper markets that we want to focus on, on the domestic side, we're going to make sure we have world-class assets that align to that into the markets we want to grow. 
And as we've mentioned before, we're also looking at how do we provide more flexibility into our mill system to adapt to the broad portfolio that we have, so we can take advantage of market trends. And as your point, to different grades, where there's growth and then where we can deemphasize grades where we don't want to grow. 
So that's how we're thinking about it. And we have multiple productivity programs underway right now. So we really believe that this focus on driving cost out, world-class assets, higher productivity, driving grades that match the strategy of where we want to grow is going to help give us an advantage as we move forward."

So good momentum there and a big part of that, an important part of that in addition to productivity and some of the changes that we've made in the footprint and the products we're producing at Evadale. But a big part of that is certainly what we're seeing on organic growth, and sustainability is an important driver. There, connected packaging and digital solutions are also important and automation is critical there. 
So we've generated up to this point, a run rate of about $280 million worth of plastics replacement alone. As David said earlier, that's going to be over $500 million annually that we'll get to in the next few years. 
We've shared a number of those examples in the past, and we're coming out with new offerings. We've got the Tim Hortons cup trial, and that's not just a paperboard solution, that's actually producing cups for us for the first time, and we have 11 patents on that application. So great opportunity for us to have a sustainable solution there, sustainable in terms of long-term economic value as well as the environmental benefits we've talked about. 
We also have launched a new PACK EXPO. We just launched a new fiber-based package for frozen food. And this is one that I really want to highlight because it's perhaps one of our best examples coming forward of optimizing primary, secondary and tertiary packaging, which is something that only WestRock can do. Nobody else has a fiber-based packaging solution that can do this. 
And specifically, what we're doing as we're making a fiber-based bowl that's sustainable, recyclable and at some point, compostable. We're wrapping that bowl in a secondary package, and then we have a shelf-ready tertiary package, corrugated medium, to go around all of that. And this is all automated from the beginning until the end. 
And so when you look at what we can do around design, material science, digitally connected solutions as well as automation, machinery and robotics. This is a tremendous advantage for the company overall, and it's going to continue to deliver growth for the Consumer segment."

So the seasonal pattern first half, second half, the ramp-up, the full ramp-up of Porto Feliz and Tres Barras. And then you'll start to see -- I mentioned it's not material, but you'll start to see some of the -- some sequential declines in some of the recycled fiber cost.

Appreciate it. There's a couple of areas that we're really focused on. And you've probably heard me say in the past, the opportunities to better integrate the acquisitions that we've made over the past several years. So I'm going to highlight just a couple of areas that I believe we're going to have a material impact on our productivity. 
The first is supply chain. We recently hired a new Chief Supply Chain Officer, Peter Anderson, who came over from Cummins, that we're really excited about. 
If you go back to the way we were structured before in our businesses, we had unique supply chain aspects across several of them. So the productivity opportunity to consolidate our supply chain, consolidate our warehousing, get our S&OP right with the consolidation of our mills. Our freight spend, as you know, is very high, so we'll be able to look at that. We see tremendous opportunity to become more efficient in our supply chain. So that's one area that we think is going to drive material savings. 
The second piece is bringing together our mills together in one organization and highlighting new productivity initiatives across the mill. So to your point on previous productivity -- or previous productivity programs with standard inflation. We're now pushing to see how do we significantly improve our productivity on top of inflation. And so we have multiple projects, both at our mill system as well as our conversion sites. 
We've identified several areas where we can reduce our waste, get a little bit better with our digital manufacturing footprint as far as predictive analytics, improve our unscheduled downtime. So we see great opportunities there. 
And then the last piece I'll talk about is commercial. So we recently, in the first phase, consolidated our MPS and consumer business. And we've just recognized tremendous efficiencies there. We had multiple customer service teams. If you look at the backroom integration opportunities as well as customer-facing opportunities where we can go is 1 phase with complete solutions to our customers. And now we'll expand that where customers want to buy across our portfolio with this new world that I've talked about in supply chain, primary, secondary, tertiary packaging. So now we'll be more efficient in how we do that and how we service them. 
So it really transcends across really, I think, our whole organization, and we are really going to drive further productivity and cost out but we're not going to cost our way out of this. We're also going to invest in innovation. We're going to invest in digital, both on the customer smart packaging side that Pat talked about as well as the manufacturing side. We think there's tremendous opportunity to modernize the company. So we get really excited about the opportunities. A lot of those projects are underway, and we'll look forward to sharing more detail about them with you at our Investor Day."

So what we try to do though is look at it from a customer perspective versus an internal perspective. And providing those solutions, to your point on the breadth of our portfolio, they may want more lightweight grades. They may want more recycled grades. They may want more plastics replacements. So the word that I like to use with our capability is flexibility. 
So with the resiliency of this company and if you look at that chart from back to 2016 to 2021, you can see through all different kinds of inflationary environments, capacity environments, we've grown top line very well. We've grown our EBITDA very well. And I just think this flexibility in this new world of supply chain and sustainability and innovation opportunities with our customers, I think our footprint just has us very well positioned to respond and adapt and innovate where we can drive great margin expansion and top line growth."
