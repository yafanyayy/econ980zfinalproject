As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we reported strong adjusted earnings per share for 2020 that exceeded our guidance range. In addition, we have a solid outlook for 2021, and importantly, we are raising our projected long-term earnings per share growth rate. 
But before we turn to more on our year-end business update, I'd like to share some thoughts on 2020. In 2020, we essentially saw 4 pandemics: health, economic, social and political. Southern Company demonstrated excellence and resilience on every front, including prioritizing the health and safety of our workforce and communities, overcoming decreased electric demand while delivering both strong financial and superior operating results and continuing to address racial injustice and working with policymakers to advance a cleaner energy future. 
First, the health pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic was, of course, the first and primary challenge that we faced last year and one that continues to impact our communities today. From developing a pandemic response reentry playbook that was ultimately leveraged by many peer companies to setting up a medical village at the Vogtle construction site and making heroic progress towards completion of those units, we placed the health and safety of our employees as a top priority. So by taking care of our workforce, we were able to continue taking care of our customers. 
The economic pandemic. Beginning in March and April of last year, the world has experienced significant economic duress. Southern Company originally projected a $250 million to $400 million loss in revenue as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Through thoughtful, disciplined O&M reductions, we were able to mitigate the estimated now $300 million revenue loss that we have experienced while still providing reliability and industry-leading customer satisfaction to our customers. As well, our long-term efforts with the states that we serve on economic development efforts continue, helping capital investment and job growth in the communities we're privileged to serve. 
The social pandemic. I am also proud of our ongoing commitment to foster racial justice. For years, this has been an effort of Southern's to focus on building a healthy culture. Even before the unrest last summer, we initiated an effort to donate $50 million to historically black colleges and universities. Last summer, I told you that meaningful discussions were underway across our company related to our actions and response. And while these conversations will continue, an initial outcome is that we have refocused our efforts towards a more holistic goal of diversity, equity and inclusion, ensuring that all groups are welcomed, well represented, engaged and fairly treated throughout the organization. 
As an example of this commitment, the Southern Company Foundation recently announced a partnership with Apple, where each are investing $25 million to launch the Propel Center, a new digital learning hub, business incubator and global innovation headquarters located in Atlanta for students throughout the nation of historically black colleges and universities. 
And finally, the political pandemic. I also want to address the political discord that our nation has experienced over the past several months. At Southern, we have consistently prioritized working with policymakers regardless of political party, and we have been working constructively with the Biden administration for months. In fact, we have already engaged in matters related to energy policy, especially the transition to a net zero carbon future as well as on matters related to national security. You'll see in the appendix a letter I sent to President-elect Biden pledging our support. 
As we continue to engage with the new administration as well as legislators and regulators at both federal and state levels, our positions will continue to focus on energy policies that can enable a smart transition and be informed by our key objectives of providing clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to our customers. 
So let's now turn to an update on plant Vogtle units 3 and 4. We remain focused on meeting the November 2021 and November 2022 regulatory approved in-service dates for units 3 and 4, respectively. With the start of hot functional testing expected in only a few weeks, we now expect a November completion for Unit 3. For Unit 4, we continue to utilize an aggressive site work plan as a tool to provide margin to the regulatory-approved November 2022 in-service date. Unit 4's current site work plan targets a third quarter 2022 in-service date. From a cost perspective, Georgia Power's share of the total project capital cost forecast increased by $176 million, largely reflecting estimated COVID-19 impacts and other costs, along with a replenishment of contingency to fund future expected risks that will include lower productivity rates and increased support costs. As a result, Georgia Power recorded an after-tax charge of $131 million during the fourth quarter. 
2020 marked another year of significant progress at the site. Throughout the year, as some other major projects around the country were shutting down or delayed due to COVID-19, Georgia Power and the Vogtle site team worked tirelessly to implement measures to keep the project progressing while prioritizing the safety of our workforce and the surrounding community. 
Similar to what was experienced across much of the United States during the last 2 months of the year and earlier this year, we saw a surge in COVID-19 cases at the Vogtle site, which, as you can see on Slide 6, peaked around the beginning of January. Since the onset of the pandemic and most acutely during the fourth quarter of 2020, the impact from COVID-19 have included high absenteeism and disruptions to planned or ongoing work as we isolated personnel. We estimate the pandemic has extended the schedule for both units by approximately 3 to 4 months, consuming much of the remaining margin to the November 2021 in-service date for Unit 3 and several months of margin for Unit 4. Unit 3 direct construction is now approximately 98% complete, and hot functional testing is expected to start in the coming weeks. 
On our last call, we identified 3 key risk factors to our time line: electrical productivity, subcontractor performance and what we call paper closure. Recall, paper closure relates to the turnover of systems to the testing group to help ensure that the as-built condition of the plant meets design specifications. Over the past few months, COVID-19 has hurt site productivity, negatively impacted electrical production and impaired our ability to close paper issues that facilitate timely system turnovers and ultimately, ITAAC submittals. The combination of these factors has delayed system turnovers and impacted our time line for the start of hot functional testing. Based on our recent production trends, we now expect to start hot functional testing during the second half of March and start loading fuel during July. Starting hot functional testing, and fuel load on this time line would support a November 2021 in-service date with up to 1 month of flexibility remaining in the schedule. 
Now certainly, risks remain to this schedule. These risks may be thought of in 4 segments: first, the completion of system turnovers leading up to hot functional testing; second, the successful completion of hot functional testing; third, the completion of system turnovers leading to fuel load; and fourth, an orderly transition from fuel load to an efficient startup of the unit. Successful completion of hot functional testing this spring would significantly decrease the remaining operational risk to Unit 3 completion, although certainly, challenges and risks will remain in focus as we focus to fuel load. 
ITAAC submittal and review is expected to continue to accelerate and will remain an area of focus. To date, 180 ITAAC have been submitted to the NRC. We expect approximately 20 additional ITAAC to be submitted by the start of hot functional testing and the remaining 200 to be submitted during hot functional testing and as we approach fuel load. 
Direct construction for Unit 4 is now over 75% complete. Last month, we started integrated flush, and we expect initial energization to occur during March. To support the November benchmark, we will need to average construction completion of approximately 1.5% per month, which is in line with the average rate achieved during the period from last November through January. As we progress in 2021, construction production is expected to increase in support of our upcoming testing milestones. And importantly, as Unit 3 nears hot functional testing, we expect to shift additional resources to unit 4 to increase our current pace of construction completion. 
Now turning to cost. During the fourth quarter, Georgia Power allocated its remaining contingency plus an additional $5 million and subsequently added new contingency of approximately $171 million to support completion of the project. We estimate the pandemic has extended the schedule for both units by approximately 3 to 4 months at an estimated cost to Georgia Power of between $150 million and $190 million. This cost is embedded in our updated total project cost estimate. While COVID-19-related impacts were significant drivers of the change of our capital cost forecast, future risks, including construction productivity, were contributing factors. 
Earlier this week, the Georgia Public Service Commission unanimously approved VCM 23, which included project capital costs through June 30, 2020. As a part of the order, Georgia Power was directed to work with the PSC staff to develop a mutually agreeable recommendation to the commission by the end of March regarding the process, timing and substance of filings related to the transition of Unit 3 costs into base rates. Additionally, Georgia Power files VCM 24 today. 
The months ahead represent a critical and exciting time for Vogtle. The project team has worked tirelessly amid conditions none of us could have imagined just a year ago. Our employees, contractors, co-owners and community partners should be commended for their perseverance and dedication to the completion of this important project. 
Drew, I'll turn it over to you now for an update of the financials and our outlook."

For the full year, our adjusted earnings per share was $3.25, $0.14 higher than last",1269,"Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. I hope you are all safe and healthy. As Tom mentioned, we had a very strong year in 2020 despite the many challenges we faced. For the full year, our adjusted earnings per share was $3.25, $0.14 higher than last year and $0.03 above the top of our guidance range. 2020 was certainly defined by milder weather and sales impacts due to COVID-19, and we were able to substantially overcome both, as evidenced in our solid results. 
Looking at the details. Retail electric sales on a weather-normalized basis were down by $0.14 year-over-year, including impacts related to COVID-19, offset by customer growth. Milder temperatures throughout 2020 resulted in an additional $0.21 negative earnings per share variance as compared to the prior year. We substantially mitigated both weather and COVID-19 impacts through thoughtful, disciplined O&M reductions as well as continued investment at our state-regulated utilities. On a combined basis, these factors allowed us to exceed our adjusted EPS guidance for the year. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results as compared to 2019 is included in today's release and earnings package. 
COVID-19 impacts reduced our projected weather normal kilowatt hour sales by 3% for the year. The slight uplift from the residential sector persisted throughout 2020 with more people working from home. In the fourth quarter, we continued to see improvement in kilowatt hour sales for both the commercial and industrial customer classes. However, we do not believe we have seen a full recovery in these sectors yet. Factoring in impacts across all customer classes, our nonfuel revenues declined by approximately $300 million, which was at the lower end of our original estimates as the pandemic began. 
As Tom mentioned, an important part of our COVID-19 response was, and continues to be, supporting our customers. We have worked closely with customers across our regulated utilities, offering special payment plans for those with past due account balances and have delayed disconnects. You can see the impact of our COVID-19-related protocols for disconnects in our customer counts for the year. 
Last year, our state-regulated utilities added just over 53,000 new residential electric customers and nearly 30,000 residential natural gas customers. Our electric customer growth was approximately 30% higher than our expectations. Overall, we estimate that about 80% of the residential electric customer growth in 2020 was due to continued and accelerating in migration to the region, particularly in Georgia. The remainder is likely related to the steps we have taken to keep customers connected during the pandemic, particularly through the use of extended payment plans. During this time, customer arrears have tended better than we anticipated across our operating companies. We also have constructive mechanisms approved by the commissions in many of our states, allowing us to address incremental COVID-19-related costs, including bad debt expense. Those will be considered in future regulatory proceedings. 
In a trend that differentiates our service territory, the pandemic has strengthened population and job growth in the Southeast, particularly in Georgia, which is one of the fastest-growing states in the United States. Robust economic development in the Southeast region is also a positive indicator that our key states are weathering the pandemic relatively well. In 2020, we saw new investment of nearly $6 billion and nearly 25,000 jobs created across Georgia and Alabama. In fact, Georgia was the #2 state in the country for job creation in December. And just last week, Microsoft confirmed Atlanta as a major East Coast hub, which is expected to bring significant job growth and investment. Our state-regulated operating companies play an integral role in leading economic development efforts in each of their states. 
Turning now to our expectation for 2021. Our guidance range for the year is $3.25 to $3.35 per share. In the first quarter of 2021, we expect -- we estimate that we will earn $0.84 per share. Included in our full year guidance is an assumption that we will see modest impacts -- continue to see modest impacts on retail sales from COVID-19, which we expect to continue to mitigate through thoughtful cost control. Additionally, we expect total retail sales growth normalized for any short-term COVID-19 impact to be flat to 1%. For this foreseeable future, this expected growth rate is driven by a combination of customer growth and ongoing improvements in energy efficiency. 
Moving now to our outlook for long-term growth. We see our long-term EPS growth rate in the 5% to 7% range, consistent with adjusted earnings in the range of $4 to $4.30 per share by 2024. With 90% of total projected earnings over the 5-year plan horizon coming from our state-regulated utilities, our expected EPS trajectory has a solid foundation. Likewise, our history of constructive regulation, stable credit metrics and ongoing focus on cost control serve to underscore the achievability of our plan. 
Looking more closely at our long-term capital investment plan, we continue to allocate 95% of our capital investment to our state-regulated utilities. Our capital investment plan of $40 billion for 2021 through 2025 includes annual projected rate base growth at our state-regulated utilities of greater than 5% with a continued emphasis on transmission, transportation and distribution, modernization and resilience. 
For Southern Power, the cumulative 5-year investment plan is comprised entirely of previously approved renewables projects and maintenance capital for the existing generation fleet, which is over 90% contracted for the next 10 years. Any incremental growth opportunities at Southern Power are expected to enhance the long-term financial plan and be largely self-funded and credit-neutral. Importantly, this CapEx projection for the whole company does not include amounts for accelerated fleet transition and any associated transmission growth nor does it account for new generation projects at Southern Power. We will be evaluating a number of paths over the next few years as it relates to the fleet transition, but we do not establish placeholders in our plan with virtually all projects being known in the process of or having already been engineered or have already begun. 
Taking a look at the balance sheet, we currently forecast no equity needs over our 5-year plan horizon, even when considering the potential increase in capital investment I just described. We believe we are well positioned to further strengthen our balance sheet and to improve our credit metrics materially during this time. 
I'll highlight that, in January, we became the first large-cap utility in the U.S. to publish a sustainable financing framework and the days that followed Southern Power issued a 5-year green bond under that framework that resulted in a record low coupon rate. This framework highlights Southern's ongoing commitment to a wide range of sustainability and social issues and should allow us to leverage our work in these areas to help optimize our balance sheet and benefit our customers. We will also continue our focus on societal priorities in the upcoming years. 
Before I turn it back to Tom, I'd like to echo his opening remarks. The resilience of our business has demonstrated amid the pandemic is a testament to the hard work our employees put forth every -- each and every day. The ability of our employees to continually provide outstanding service to our customers, combined with the support of our communities and the constructive relationships we maintain with regulators and public officials, underpin our ability to also deliver such solid performance. I would like to particularly thank the people who work for, and on behalf of, the customer -- our customers to meet our priorities even in light of a global pandemic. We are all grateful. Thank you. 
Tom, I'll turn it back over to you."

Southern has 2 primary goals related to our greenhouse gas emissions. The first is to achieve zero -- net zero emissions by 2050. We will work constructively with the Biden administration to accelerate this time frame as national policy evolves. The second one is to put in place an interim milestone to achieve a 50% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030. Regarding the intermediate goal, we achieved our 2030 goal in 2020 with preliminary greenhouse gas emissions now down 52%. Now certainly, 2020 was an unusual year, and we may see emissions reductions move around 50% for the next 2 years, but we believe we'll be sustainably above our 50% reduction level by 2023. 
While ESG issues have received increasing attention by investors over the past few years, at Southern Company, these issues have consistently received the heightened attention they deserve, and it's being recognized. We were once again ranked as one of the world's most admired companies by Fortune Magazine. The Diversity Inc. rated us as a top company for ESG. And for the fifth consecutive year, we've received a perfect Corporate Equality Index score by the human rights campaign. In addition, we're very proud of the A- rating we recently received from the carbon disclosure project for our environmental transparency and leadership. We recognize the value our investors and stakeholders place on transparency, and we are committed to continued enhancements. 
And before closing, I want to just take a moment to recognize our leadership transition announcement that we made at the end of last year. My trusted friend and one of my closest confidantes, Mark Lantrip, plans to retire in April after dedicating 40 years to Southern Company. Mark has helped position Southern Company as a leader that is building and shaping the future of energy. We are grateful for the many contributions Mark has made to our business, and we'll miss him dearly and wish him all the best. Mark is passing the baton to Chris Kaminski, who has been a valued member of the southern company leadership team for many years, holding key positions at both Georgia Power and Southern Power. 
In closing, over the past decade that I have been privileged to serve as CEO of Southern Company, I can think of no other year that I've been prouder of the way we've conducted ourselves and managed our business. Our engagement with and -- are employees customers and communities in 2020 demonstrates our enduring commitment to be a citizen wherever we serve.

The way you should think about the base here is kind of a 2024 number. That is $4 to $4.30 and then kind of reverse engineer back from that at the kind of top end of that range at a growth rate of 7% and the bottom end of that range at kind of 5%. That's how we come up with 5% to 7%. Certainly, as we move from 2021 to 2022, there's a step change, but I think you can see the math from there. With respect to that range, it's fascinating. As Drew pointed out, and I've said this before on other calls, the way we do CapEx forecasting, in my opinion, is really conservative. What we put out there, I know some companies -- I shouldn't say this, but perhaps some companies use CapEx forecast to plug to a growth rate. We do almost the opposite. We only put in our CapEx forecast what we know or what we firmly expect, and we do not put in placeholders. So what is absent in that CapEx forecast is capital allocated to future projects at Southern Power. You know that we allocate, on current practice, about $0.5 billion a year to that business unit but none of that is showing up in the CapEx forecast. Certainly, as you look at fleet transitions that I think, from a policy standpoint, are being pushed in Washington, you will see growth in renewables. And it wouldn't surprise me that there will be plenty of opportunities to do more solar and wind in the future. Right now, we think those markets are very tough. So we elect not to put anything in the forecast. 
Secondly, we don't include any fleet transition. I think it's been very clear and I've been in the press here recently, talking about the transition of the fleet and working with the Biden team to think about how to move net zero 2050 to something sooner. I know President Biden now would like to put out a marker of net zero by 2035 for this industry. We certainly -- I think we can certainly achieve that. There are certain policy choices that will have to be made along the way, but we are engaged constructively in that conversation. If you go to something like that, I think you will accelerate fleet transition. Again, nothing in this CapEx forecast is reflected, associated with any of retiring coal plants sooner and building more renewables or more gas assets in this time frame. Drew, what else would you add?"

We've had some changes in that pathway a little bit because we've taken penalty for Vogtle construction. We'll see a little bit of that change as we move Vogtle into service. And so you get a bit of a wag in the way our growth rate might be delineated on a linear basis. But what we're really trying to express is a longer-term potential for the business as we invest capital into it. 
Then I think the other important point that Tom made is that we have quite a bit of generation modernization to do that we have not yet quantified because I think there are a number of ways that, that could play out. If you think about broadly what that looks like, we've got about 10 gigawatts of coal-fired facilities in aggregate. We'll have to find some method of meeting the reliability requirements of our customer base without relying on coal as a primary source of megawatt hour production. And so I think we'll -- over the next couple of years, we'll take stock of emerging technology, different things that work within our system to meet the goals that we have, and we'll kind of lay those out for you as they reveal themselves to us."

The other thing you should know is that heading into this call, I guess, we showed 4% for electric, it was 5% probably a week ago, it's rounding, okay? So it's in the middle of 4% to 5%. The gas business is growing at like 10%. And so the overall kind of support the growth trajectory, that is supportive of 5% to 7%. And you're right. When you think about starting with $4 to $4.30, there is upside to a mid-range forecast there based on how we deploy capital over time. But I think even with the base forecast that we're showing you today, we're within that range, and we're comfortable at 5% to 7% within that range in 24."

And certainly, I think we're pretty good about letting people know when things change. We did the press release with the expressed intention of moving off of what we had thought, I guess, back in October, may have been July HFT. As this third wave of COVID hit, it really did just knock us for a loop in terms of productivity and pushed us now. And actually, the numbers continue to move just a wee bit but it puts us from February now into March. 
No, it really just has a function of cost, Steve, and it really depends on when you incur the costs, okay? So if it is a delay that causes us to get into hot functional tests, the amount of both units in Georgia Power dollars is about $40 million. If it's items -- I mean, Unit 3 only, it's about $25 million. If, however, we shift, and it is a delay kind of from fuel load to in-service, in other words, it's some punch list that causes us to have a delay in the in-service declaration of a unit, it goes way down. For both units, it's $25 million a month. For Unit 3, it's only $10 million a month. So depending on when the delay occurs, there would just be an additional cost that we're factoring in. 
And I will say that with this now new estimate on estimated cost to complete, this $176 million we've added this time, it includes a November in-service for both units. It includes a CPI number that is like 1.8. It includes a construction per month that is consistent for Unit 4 with our experience from November to January. Now my hope is that we can improve on those numbers but we wanted to put out what we thought was a thoughtful and kind of reasonably conservative estimate so we wouldn't have to come back to this number again. No assurances that won't happen, but that's where we are. 
As I think you know this -- I think the only thing mechanically that occurs is that we continue to function under a penalty ROE until we bring the unit into service, and so that would be the material thing to model."

You know I've been a f",457,"Yes. Let me offer up a few comments. I was on CNBC this morning, and it was a great topic of interest and discussion about what about Texas. And it really gets into this idea of organized markets versus integrated regulated markets. You know I've been a fan of integrated regulated markets. Through our integrated resource plans, we can effectively begin with optimal capacity portfolios and iterate around transmission that supports those optimal portfolios. We can also build in resilience requirements and socialize those costs over a large customer base. And we've been able to do that for a decade, and it has worked exceedingly well. 
A real criticism of the so-called organized markets is that they are set up -- and I think the people inside those markets operate quite rationally, but they either operate within punitive constraints or profit incentives that are broadly -- and every market is different, as you know, but they're broadly designed around maximizing short run marginal properties. So minimizing short run marginal cost, that's no way to build a portfolio. And I would argue that the outcome of those designs is, as you start to include other value attributes like transmission, like -- I'm sorry, not transition, like a backup generation, like resiliency, like other things, you get to really complex kind of approaches in a market. I think PJM has been wrestling with how to value all those things. 
I guess the second thing is that you really don't get a sense of valuing long-term baseload capacity as it should be. And I think we've seen that in the markets where, for heaven's sakes, very valuable nuclear generation is getting priced out of the market. And those valuable assets, especially as we consider a carbon-reduced future, are getting priced out of the market and getting turned down. I think there's better approaches here. And so it was interesting. Not only did I have this conversation on CNBC this morning, and I guess I'll just be a little obtrusive about this, but I was called by the Biden administration. From a national security standpoint, what can we do as an industry to avoid these things? Unfortunately, given the market structure of ERCOT, there's probably not a lot we can do in the near term. But I think long term, this notion of resilience versus reliability, reliability is how we handle the vagaries of weather and economic load and machine reliability under kind of known conditions. Resilience is the idea of keeping your system up under unknown and unexpected conditions. Whether they be operational, weather-driven or cyber related, these are things we must do as an industry. And I think Southern is in a good position to help lead that dialogue."

And we've adopted the practice of the UIN. That is we filed the form and substance of an ITAAC and have that approved. So really, all we have to do now is essentially fill in the blanks as to the result of a test. As a result, by working with the NRC in this constructive way, I think once we get the systems in place to submit the results in the ITAAC, I think the ITAAC process is going to go really well. Like I say, the NRC has been great in this regard. And recall, we got NRC personnel all over the plant, working with us to make sure all this happen. 
Paul, the issue was not ITAACs. The issue is getting the systems done, getting the turnover appropriate with the testing appropriate and, the paper, as we pointed out before, appropriate, so that we can file in -- put in the values in these ITAACs and submit them. So I said this, I think, on the last call, and I made a big deal about it, when I say paper, it almost feels too glib. This idea of having engineers present, this would be back to our own, the NRC, that will evaluate the as-built condition of the plant and harmonizing that to the design basis of the plant and making sure it exactly meets our standards, is really taking a lot of time, and it is a complex exercise. The most important thing we can do is assure that we have quality. That will permit the ITAAC process to go well. Frankly, it will permit the testing processes that we will do now at HFT to go well. So the filing of ITAAC is simply associated with system turnover of these important processes within the plant."

The one thing that is certain is that if you look at the technology that's available to us today, it's not a simple substitution of what we currently generate with to what the future might look like. There are certain changes in material science that need to occur. There are certain complexities related to clean, safe and reliable power that have to be met. There are transmission considerations that have to be taken into account. And -- but if you wanted to put a big, broad bow to wrap around it, if we have to do 10 gigawatts, and let's say that 7 of that is replacement or that 3 needs to be held in reserve for some period of time, you could think about numerically what the replacement of something like that amount of generation would require and make the assumption that we probably have to do 15% or 20% of that total CapEx in addition in transmission distribution.

So of the 10 segments that make up something like 80% of our industrial sales, 8 of them from a momentum standpoint are turning positive. So that tells me, and with a quote that has been put out there by me in the past, America is learning to live with COVID. A, I think COVID incidences are starting to decline. Maybe that's the normal sign wave we see from any surge, which we just went through. And maybe it's the longer-term effect of getting more people vaccinated. Didn't the Biden administration say recently, they want everybody vaccinated by July or sometime this summer? So surely, that will have an impact. But the economic data I see would show a recovery, I don't know, down 3% last year, maybe up 2% to 3% this year, with industrial starting to respond in a favorable manner."

I always worry about the long-term implications of something like this because the pressure that we put on folks on the margin or the COVID puts on folks on the margin  will reveal itself. We've been served 60 days away from COVID ending for now 10 months. And so it'll be interesting to see where we come out. Our expectation around how it would impact our particular customers actually was quite different than what we expected on the onset. So we expected that retail customer usage would increase as people stayed home. We actually expected industrial production would maintain itself -- would decline a little bit but not quite as drastically as it has and that commercial customers would be impacted most acutely, and it was very -- it was a very different outcome. Commercial customers found a way to do business in a different way, not all, but most. And industrial went through a period where there was sort of a reduction in output as -- because inventories were at a reasonable level and they could sort of pare down that inventory as they saw the economy progress. We've now seen sort of a tightening in supply in a number of the industrial segments, and production has started to pick up. And there have always been 2 or 3 standout weak segments in any particular 2- or 3-month period. But as Tom said today, the momentum is generally positive, and we're encouraged by the fact that people have adapted their businesses to earn profits in a way that they maybe hadn't anticipated 2 years ago. But yes. I or -- a year ago, I always worry that the longer anything goes, the more pressure you're going to put on somebody on the margin for sure."

As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we reported strong adjusted earnings per share for 2020 that exceeded our guidance range. In addition, we have a solid outlook for 2021, and importantly, we are raising our projected long-term earnings per share growth rate.  
But before we turn to more on our year-end business update, I'd like to share some thoughts on 2020. In 2020, we essentially saw 4 pandemics: health, economic, social and political. Southern Company demonstrated excellence and resilience on every front, including prioritizing the health and safety of our workforce and communities, overcoming decreased electric demand while delivering both strong financial and superior operating results and continuing to address racial injustice and working with policymakers to advance a cleaner energy future.  
First, the health pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic was, of course, the first and primary challenge that we faced last year and one that continues to impact our communities today. From developing a pandemic response reentry playbook that was ultimately leveraged by many peer companies, to standing up a medical village at the Vogtle construction site and making heroic progress towards completion of those units, we placed the health and safety of our employees as a top priority. So by taking care of our workforce, we were able to continue taking care of our customers.  
The economic pandemic. Beginning in March and April of last year, the world has experienced significant economic duress. Southern Company originally projected a $250 million to $400 million loss in revenue as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Through thoughtful, disciplined O&M reductions, we were able to mitigate the estimated now $300 million revenue loss that we have experienced while still providing reliability and industry-leading customer satisfaction to our customers. As well, our long-term efforts with the states that we serve on economic development efforts continue, helping capital investment and job growth in the communities we're privileged to serve.  
The social pandemic. I am also proud of our ongoing commitment to foster racial justice. For years, this has been an effort of Southern's to focus on building a healthy culture. Even before the unrest last summer, we initiated an effort to donate $50 million to historically black colleges and universities. Last summer, I told you that meaningful discussions were underway across our company related to our actions and response. And while these conversations will continue, an initial outcome is that we have refocused our efforts towards a more holistic goal of diversity, equity and inclusion, ensuring that all groups are welcomed, well represented, engaged and fairly treated throughout the organization.  
As an example of this commitment, the Southern Company Foundation recently announced a partnership with Apple, where each are investing $25 million to launch the Propel Center, a new digital learning hub, business incubator and global innovation headquarters located in Atlanta for students throughout the nation of historically black colleges and universities.  
And finally, the political pandemic. I also want to address the political discord that our nation has experienced over the past several months. At Southern, we have consistently prioritized working with policymakers regardless of political party, and we have been working constructively with the Biden administration for months. In fact, we have already engaged in matters related to energy policy, especially the transition to a net zero carbon future as well as on matters related to national security. You'll see in the appendix a letter I sent to President-elect Biden pledging our support.  
As we continue to engage with the new administration as well as legislators and regulators at both federal and state levels, our positions will continue to focus on energy policies that can enable a smart transition and be informed by our key objectives of providing clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to our customers.  
So let's now turn to an update on plant Vogtle units 3 and 4. We remain focused on meeting the November 2021 and November 2022 regulatory-approved in-service dates for units 3 and 4, respectively. With the start of hot functional testing expected in only a few weeks, we now expect a November completion for Unit 3. For Unit 4, we continue to utilize an aggressive site work plan as a tool to provide margin to the regulatory-approved November 2022 in-service date. Unit 4's current site work plan targets a third quarter 2022 in-service date. 
From a cost perspective, Georgia Power's share of the total project capital cost forecast increased by $176 million, largely reflecting estimated COVID-19 impact and other costs, along with a replenishment of contingency to fund future expected risks that will include lower productivity rates and increased support costs. As a result, Georgia Power recorded an after-tax charge of $131 million during the fourth quarter.  
2020 marked another year of significant progress at the site. Throughout the year, as some other major projects around the country were shutting down or delayed due to COVID-19, Georgia Power and the Vogtle site team worked tirelessly to implement measures to keep the project progressing while prioritizing the safety of our workforce and the surrounding community.  
Similar to what was experienced across much of the United States during the last 2 months of the year and earlier this year, we saw a surge in COVID-19 cases at the Vogtle site, which, as you can see on Slide 6, peaked around the beginning of January. Since the onset of the pandemic and most acutely during the fourth quarter of 2020, the impacts from COVID-19 have included high absenteeism and disruptions to planned or ongoing work as we isolated personnel. We estimate the pandemic has extended the schedule for both units by approximately 3 to 4 months, consuming much of the remaining margin to the November 2021 in-service date for Unit 3 and several months of margin for Unit 4. Unit 3 direct construction is now approximately 98% complete, and hot functional testing is expected to start in the coming weeks.  
On our last call, we identified 3 key risk factors to our time line: electrical productivity, subcontractor performance and what we call paper closure. Recall, paper closure relates to the turnover of systems to the testing group to help ensure that the as-built condition of the plant meets design specifications. Over the past few months, COVID-19 has hurt site productivity, negatively impacted electrical production and impaired our ability to close paper issues that facilitate timely system turnovers and, ultimately, ITAAC submittals. The combination of these factors has delayed system turnovers and impacted our time line for the start of hot functional testing. 
Based on our recent production trends, we now expect to start hot functional testing during the second half of March and start loading fuel during July. Starting hot functional testing and fuel load on this time line would support a November 2021 in-service date with up to 1 month of flexibility remaining in the schedule.  
Now certainly, risks remain to this schedule. These risks may be thought of in 4 segments: first, the completion of system turnovers leading up to hot functional testing; second, the successful completion of hot functional testing; third, the completion of system turnovers leading to fuel load; and fourth, an orderly transition from fuel load to an efficient startup of the unit. Successful completion of hot functional testing this spring would significantly decrease the remaining operational risk to Unit 3 completion, although certainly, challenges and risks will remain in focus as we focus to fuel load.  
ITAAC submittal and review is expected to continue to accelerate and will remain an area of focus. To date, 180 ITAAC have been submitted to the NRC. We expect approximately 20 additional ITAAC to be submitted by the start of hot functional testing and the remaining 200 to be submitted during hot functional testing and as we approach fuel load.  
Direct construction for Unit 4 is now over 75% complete. Last month, we started and integrated flush, and we expect initial energization to occur during March. To support the November benchmark, we will need to average construction completion of approximately 1.5% per month, which is in line with the average rate achieved during the period from last November through January. As we progress in 2021, construction and production is expected to increase in support of our upcoming testing milestones. And importantly, as Unit 3 nears hot functional testing, we expect to shift additional resources to unit 4 to increase our current pace of construction completion.  
Now turning to cost. During the fourth quarter, Georgia Power allocated its remaining contingency plus an additional $5 million and subsequently added new contingency of approximately $171 million to support completion of the project. We estimate the pandemic has extended the schedule for both units by approximately 3 to 4 months at an estimated cost to Georgia Power of between $150 million and $190 million. This cost is embedded in our updated total project cost estimate. While COVID-19-related impacts were significant drivers of the change of our capital cost forecast, future risks, including construction productivity, were contributing factors. 
Earlier this week, the Georgia Public Service Commission unanimously approved VCM 23, which included project capital costs through June 30, 2020. As a part of the order, Georgia Power was directed to work with the PSC staff to develop a mutually agreeable recommendation to the commission by the end of March regarding the process, timing and substance of filings related to the transition of Unit 3 costs into base rates. Additionally, Georgia Power files VCM 24 today.  
The months ahead represent a critical and exciting time for Vogtle. The project team has worked tirelessly amid conditions none of us could have imagined just a year ago. Our employees, contractors, co-owners and community partners should be commended for their perseverance and dedication to the completion of this important project.  
Drew, I'll turn it over to you now for an update of the financials and our outlook."

I hope you are all safe and healthy. As Tom mentioned, we had a very strong year in 2020 despite the many challenges we faced. For the full year, our adjusted earnings per share was $3.25, $0.14 higher than last",1270,"Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. I hope you are all safe and healthy. As Tom mentioned, we had a very strong year in 2020 despite the many challenges we faced. For the full year, our adjusted earnings per share was $3.25, $0.14 higher than last year and $0.03 above the top of our guidance range. 2020 was certainly defined by milder weather and sales impacts due to COVID-19, and we were able to substantially overcome both, as evidenced in our solid results.  
Looking at the details. Retail electric sales on a weather-normalized basis were down by $0.14 year-over-year, including impacts related to COVID-19, offset by customer growth. Milder temperatures throughout 2020 resulted in an additional $0.21 negative earnings per share variance as compared to the prior year. We substantially mitigated both weather and COVID-19 impacts through thoughtful, disciplined O&M reductions as well as continued investment at our state-regulated utilities. On a combined basis, these factors allowed us to exceed our adjusted EPS guidance for the year. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results as compared to 2019 is included in today's release and earnings package.  
COVID-19 impacts reduced our projected weather normal kilowatt hour sales by 3% for the year. The slight uplift from the residential sector persisted throughout 2020 with more people working from home. In the fourth quarter, we continued to see improvement in kilowatt hour sales for both the commercial and industrial customer classes. However, we do not believe we have seen a full recovery in these sectors yet.  
Factoring in impacts across all customer classes, our nonfuel revenues declined by approximately $300 million, which was at the lower end of our original estimates as the pandemic began.  
As Tom mentioned, an important part of our COVID-19 response was, and continues to be, supporting our customers. We have worked closely with customers across our regulated utilities, offering special payment plans for those with past due account balances and have delayed disconnects. You can see the impact of our COVID-19-related protocols for disconnects in our customer counts for the year.  
Last year, our state-regulated utilities added just over 53,000 new residential electric customers and nearly 30,000 residential natural gas customers. Our electric customer growth was approximately 30% higher than our expectations. Overall, we estimate that about 80% of the residential electric customer growth in 2020 was due to continued and accelerating in migration to the region, particularly in Georgia. The remainder is likely related to the steps we have taken to keep customers connected during the pandemic, particularly through the use of extended payment plans. During this time, customer arrears have tended better than we anticipated across our operating companies. We also have constructive mechanisms approved by the commissions in many of our states, allowing us to address incremental COVID-19-related costs, including bad debt expense. Those will be considered in future regulatory proceedings.  
In a trend that differentiates our service territory, the pandemic has strengthened population and job growth in the Southeast, particularly in Georgia, which is one of the fastest-growing states in the United States. Robust economic development in the Southeast region is also a positive indicator that our key states are weathering the pandemic relatively well. In 2020, we saw new investment of nearly $6 billion and nearly 25,000 jobs created across Georgia and Alabama. In fact, Georgia was the #2 state in the country for job creation in December. And just last week, Microsoft confirmed Atlanta as a major East Coast hub, which is expected to bring significant job growth and investment. Our state-regulated operating companies play an integral role in leading economic development efforts in each of their states.  
Turning now to our expectation for 2021. Our guidance range for the year is $3.25 to $3.35 per share. In the first quarter of 2021, we expect -- we estimate that we will earn $0.84 per share. Included in our full year guidance is an assumption that we will see modest impacts -- continue to see modest impacts on retail sales from COVID-19, which we expect to continue to mitigate through thoughtful cost control. Additionally, we expect total retail sales growth normalized for any short-term COVID-19 impact to be flat to 1%. For this foreseeable future, this expected growth rate is driven by a combination of customer growth and ongoing improvements in energy efficiency.  
Moving now to our outlook for long-term growth. We see our long-term EPS growth rate in the 5% to 7% range, consistent with adjusted earnings in the range of $4 to $4.30 per share by 2024. With 90% of total projected earnings over the 5-year plan horizon coming from our state-regulated utilities, our expected EPS trajectory has a solid foundation. Likewise, our history of constructive regulation, stable credit metrics and ongoing focus on cost control serve to underscore the achievability of our plan. 
Looking more closely at our long-term capital investment plan, we continue to allocate 95% of our capital investment to our state-regulated utilities. Our capital investment plan of $40 billion for 2021 through 2025 includes annual projected rate base growth at our state-regulated utilities of greater than 5%, with a continued emphasis on transmission, transportation and distribution, modernization and resilience.  
For Southern Power, the cumulative 5-year investment plan is comprised entirely of previously approved renewables projects and maintenance capital for the existing generation fleet, which is over 90% contracted for the next 10 years. Any incremental growth opportunities at Southern Power are expected to enhance the long-term financial plan and be largely self-funded and credit-neutral. Importantly, this CapEx projection for the whole company does not include amounts for accelerated fleet transition and any associated transmission growth, nor does it account for new generation projects at Southern Power. We will be evaluating a number of paths over the next few years as it relates to the fleet transition, but we do not establish placeholders in our plan with virtually all projects being known in the process of or having already been engineered or have already begun. 
Taking a look at the balance sheet, we currently forecast no equity needs over our 5-year plan horizon, even when considering the potential increase in capital investment I just described. We believe we are well positioned to further strengthen our balance sheet and to improve our credit metrics materially during this time.  
I'll highlight that, in January, we became the first large cap utility in the U.S. to publish a sustainable financing framework, and the days that followed, Southern Power issued a 5-year green bond under that framework that resulted in a record low coupon rate. This framework highlights Southern's ongoing commitment to a wide range of sustainability and social issues and should allow us to leverage our work in these areas to help optimize our balance sheet and benefit our customers. We will also continue our focus on societal priorities in the upcoming years.  
Before I turn it back to Tom, I'd like to echo his opening remarks. The resilience of our business has demonstrated amid the pandemic is a testament to the hard work our employees put forth every -- each and every day. The ability of our employees to continually provide outstanding service to our customers, combined with the support of our communities and the constructive relationships we maintain with regulators and public officials, underpin our ability to also deliver such solid performance. I would like to particularly thank the people who work for, and on behalf of the customer -- our customers to meet our priorities, even in light of a global pandemic. We are all grateful. Thank you.  
Tom, I'll turn it back over to you."

We will work constructively with the Biden administration to accelerate this time frame as national policy evolves. The second one is to put in place an interim milestone to achieve a 50% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030. Regarding the intermediate goal, we achieved our 2030 goal in 2020 with preliminary greenhouse gas emissions now down 52%. Now certainly, 2020 was an unusual year, and we may see emissions reductions move around 50% for the next 2 years, but we believe we'll be sustainably above our 50% reduction level by 2023.  
While ESG issues have received increasing attention by investors over the past few years, at Southern Company, these issues have consistently received the heightened attention they deserve, and it's being recognized. We were once again ranked as one of the world's most admired companies by Fortune Magazine. Diversity Inc. rated us as a top company for ESG. And for the fifth consecutive year, we've received a perfect Corporate Equality Index score by the Human Rights Campaign. In addition, we're very proud of the A- rating we recently received from the Carbon Disclosure Project for our environmental transparency and leadership. We recognize the value our investors and stakeholders place on transparency, and we are committed to continued enhancements. 
Now before closing, I want to just take a moment to recognize our leadership transition announcement that we made at the end of last year. My trusted friend and one of my closest confidantes, Mark Lantrip, plans to retire in April after dedicating 40 years to Southern Company. Mark has helped position Southern Company as a leader that is building and shaping the future of energy. We are grateful for the many contributions Mark has made to our business, and we'll miss him dearly and wish him all the best. Mark is passing the baton to Chris Kaminski, who has been a valued member of the southern company leadership team for many years, holding key positions at both Georgia Power and Southern Power. 
In closing, over the past decade that I have been privileged to serve as CEO of Southern Company, I can think of no other year that I've been prouder of the way we've conducted ourselves and managed our business.

You bet. We did it a little bit differently this year. The way you should think about the base here is kind of a 2024 number, that is $4 to $4.30, and then kind of reverse engineer back from that at the kind of top end of that range at a growth rate of 7% and the bottom end of that range at kind of 5%. That's how we come up with the 5% to 7%. Certainly, as we move from 2021 to 2022, there's a step change, but I think you can see the math from there. 
With respect to that range, it's fascinating. As Drew pointed out, and I've said this before on other calls, the way we do CapEx forecasting, in my opinion, is really conservative. What we put out there, I know some companies -- I shouldn't say this, but perhaps some companies use CapEx forecast to plug to a growth rate. We do almost the opposite. We only put in our CapEx forecast what we know or what we firmly expect, and we do not put in placeholders. So what is absent in that CapEx forecast is capital allocated to future projects at Southern Power. 
You know that we allocate, on current practice, about $0.5 billion a year to that business unit, but none of that is showing up in the CapEx forecast. Certainly, as you look at fleet transitions that I think, from a policy standpoint, are being pushed in Washington, you will see growth in renewables. And it wouldn't surprise me that there will be plenty of opportunities to do more solar and wind in the future. Right now, we think those markets are very tough. So we elect not to put anything in the forecast. 
Secondly, we don't include any fleet transition. I think it's been very clear and I've been in the press here recently, talking about the transition of the fleet and working with the Biden team to think about how to move net zero 2050 to something sooner. I know President Biden now would like to put out a marker of net zero by 2035 for this industry. We certainly -- I think we can certainly achieve that. There are certain policy choices that will have to be made along the way, but we are engaged constructively in that conversation. If you go to something like that, I think you will accelerate fleet transition. Again, nothing in this CapEx forecast is reflected, associated with any of retiring coal plants sooner and building more renewables or more gas assets in this time frame. 
Drew, what else would you add?"

We've had some changes in that pathway a little bit because we've taken penalty for Vogtle construction. We'll see a little bit of that change as we move Vogtle into service. And so you get a bit of a wag in the way our growth rate might be delineated on a linear basis. But what we're really trying to express is a longer-term potential for the business as we invest capital into it. 
And then I think the other important point that Tom made is that we have quite a bit of generation modernization to do that we have not yet quantified because I think there are a number of ways that, that could play out. If you think about broadly what that looks like, we've got about 10 gigawatts of coal-fired facilities in aggregate. We'll have to find some method of meeting the reliability requirements of our customer base without relying on coal as a primary source of megawatt hour production. And so I think we'll -- over the next couple of years, we'll take stock of emerging technology, different things that work within our system to meet the goals that we have, and we'll kind of lay those out for you as they reveal themselves to us."

One last thing, and I'm not often doing this, but complementing the analyst community, you guys have done the math. If you back out this penalty period, we have been earning about 6% EPS growth once you exit that period. And so that actually creates a nice line going into the future.

The other thing you should know is that heading into this call, I guess, we showed 4% for electric, it was 5% probably a week ago. It's rounding, okay? So it's in the middle of 4% to 5%. The gas business is growing at like 10%. So the overall kind of support the growth trajectory, that is supportive of 5% to 7%. And you're right, when you think about starting with $4 to $4.30, there is upside to a mid-range forecast there based on how we deploy capital over time. But I think even with the base forecast that we're showing you today, we're within that range, and we're comfortable at 5% to 7% within that range in '24."

And certainly, I think we're pretty good about letting people know when things change. We did the press release with the expressed intention of moving off of what we had thought, I guess, back in October, may have been July HFT. As this third wave of COVID hit, it really did just knock us for a loop in terms of productivity and pushed us now. And actually, the numbers continue to move just a wee bit, but it puts us from February now into March. 
No, it really just has a function of cost, Steve, and it really depends on when you incur the costs, okay? So if it is a delay that causes us to get into hot functional tests, the amount of both units in Georgia Power dollars is about $40 million. If it's items -- I mean, Unit 3 only, it's about $25 million. If, however, we shift, and it is a delay kind of from fuel load to in-service, in other words, it's some punch list that causes us to have a delay in the in-service declaration of a unit, it goes way down. For both units, it's $25 million a month. For Unit 3, it's only $10 million a month. So depending on when the delay occurs, there would just be an additional cost that we're factoring in. 
And I will say that with this now new estimate on estimated cost to complete, this $176 million we've added this time, it includes a November in-service for both units. It includes a CPI number that is like 1.8. It includes a construction per month that is consistent for Unit 4 with our experience from November to January. Now my hope is that we can improve on those numbers but we wanted to put out what we thought was a thoughtful and kind of reasonably conservative estimate so we wouldn't have to come back to this number again. No assurances that won't happen, but that's where we are."

And again, lots of differences between your service territory and ERCOT. But in light of what has happened, is it changing your perspective of what types of power plants your utilities should have? You talked about some generation replacement. How does, again, the last week play into this planning?"

I was on CNBC this morning, and it was a great topic of interest and discussion about what about Texas. And it really gets into this idea of organized markets versus integrated regulated markets. You know I've been a f",456,"Yes. Let me offer up a few comments. I was on CNBC this morning, and it was a great topic of interest and discussion about what about Texas. And it really gets into this idea of organized markets versus integrated regulated markets. You know I've been a fan of integrated regulated markets. Through our integrated resource plans, we can effectively begin with optimal capacity portfolios and iterate around transmission that supports those optimal portfolios. We can also build in resilience requirements and socialize those costs over a large customer base. And we've been able to do that for a decade, and it has worked exceedingly well. 
A real criticism of the so-called organized markets is that they are set up -- and I think the people inside those markets operate quite rationally, but they either operate within punitive constraints or profit incentives that are broadly -- and every market is different, as you know, but they're broadly designed around maximizing short run marginal properties. So minimizing short run marginal cost, that's no way to build a portfolio. And I would argue that the outcome of those designs is, as you start to include other value attributes like transmission, like -- I'm sorry, not transition, like a backup generation, like resiliency, like other things, you get to really complex kind of approaches in a market. I think PJM has been wrestling with how to value all those things. 
I guess the second thing is that you really don't get a sense of valuing long-term baseload capacity as it should be. And I think we've seen that in the markets where, for heaven's sakes, very valuable nuclear generation is getting priced out of the market. And those valuable assets, especially as we consider a carbon-reduced future, are getting priced out of the market and getting turned down. I think there's better approaches here. And so it was interesting, not only did I have this conversation on CNBC this morning, and I guess I'll just be a little abstruse about this, but I was called by the Biden administration. From a national security standpoint, what can we do as an industry to avoid these things? 
Unfortunately, given the market structure of ERCOT, there's probably not a lot we can do in the near term. But I think long term, this notion of resilience versus reliability, reliability is how we handle the vagaries of weather and economic load and machine reliability under kind of known conditions. Resilience is the idea of keeping your system up under unknown and unexpected conditions. Whether they be operational, weather-driven or cyber-related, these are things we must do as an industry. And I think Southern is in a good position to help lead that dialogue."

CNBC also did a segment just before mine with Bill Gates. He and I are on the American Energy Innovation Council, and we're working on several ideas. Whether they are storage-based, hydrogen-based, fourth generation nuclear-based or even energy efficiency-based, letting energy innovation work for us and maybe joining into a reimagined partnership with government to make that happen is, I think, a very wise energy policy to follow.

Like I say, the NRC has been great in this regard. And recall, we got NRC personnel all over the plant, working with us to make sure all this happen. 
Paul, the issue was not ITAACs. The issue is getting the systems done, getting the turnover appropriate, with the testing appropriate and, the paper, as we pointed out before, appropriate, so that we can file in -- put in the values in these ITAACs and submit them. So I said this, I think, on the last call, and I made a big deal about it, when I say paper, it almost feels too glib. This idea of having engineers present, this would be Bechtel, our own, the NRC, that will evaluate the as-built condition of the plant and harmonizing that to the design basis of the plant and making sure it exactly meets our standards, is really taking a lot of time, and it is a complex exercise. The most important thing we can do is assure that we have quality. That will permit the ITAAC process to go well. Frankly, it will permit the testing processes that we will do now at HFT to go well.

We're going to let those things play out, and then we'll reflect that in our plan as it shows up."

And Andy, I would just add that this is a complex topic, and I'll just start by saying ELG limitation guidelines, unlike you to use an acronym on the call, which will regulate sort of mercury and selenium and a couple of other things that come out of our facilities, and we'll have to make some choices about how we -- whether or not we control those facilities, put them into limited use or ultimately retire those facilities. The one thing that is certain is that if you look at the technology that's available to us today, it's not a simple substitution of what we currently generate with to what the future might look like. There are certain changes in material science that need to occur. There are certain complexities related to clean, safe and reliable power that have to be met. There are transmission considerations that have to be taken into account. 
And -- but if you wanted to put a big, broad bow wrap around it, if we have to do 10 gigawatts, and let's say that 7 of that is replacement or that 3 needs to be held in reserve for some period of time, you could think about numerically what the replacement of something like that amount of generation would require and make the assumption that we probably have to do 15% or 20% of that total CapEx in addition in transmission or distribution. So there are ways to kind of come around -- come to what's the size of this, ultimately, I think, for the company."

And it's easy to see that I think you could get to -- don't hold me to this, and we're not forecasting it flat, but added to the CapEx forecast, $5 billion to $8 billion over this time frame. I don't think that's unreasonable. And you can do the math on what that does to your growth rates. That's easy adjusted to it."

And you got to be proud of this industry through this crazy hurricane season we had last year, we were able to adopt kind of cutting-edge COVID protocols and get the lights back on, the wires up and the plants running again. 
So we've done a good job. I would argue that these guys, particularly the people that work hard to keep the lights on, and our hearts go out to them and thank them for their hard work this year. They should be treated as critical resources for this nation and, therefore, get a very high priority to receive vaccination. It is, though, at the end of the day, despite what the CDC will recommend, it is the option of each state to deploy those vaccines. Now we've got great relations in each state, particularly in Georgia, where Vogtle is, there's been a lot of discussion. And I have to make sure that the folks that can get the vaccines are -- it's available to the folks at the site. I'm going to guess that they may be able to get vaccines maybe within a month or so but that's highly uncertain and depends upon the ultimate deployment within the state."

And then not only do I look at period-versus-period results. Virtually all of it is still negative compared to a year ago, obviously, pre-COVID. But the momentum statistics are really illuminating now, and they have turned positive. 
So of the 10 segments that make up something like 80% of our industrial sales, 8 of them from a momentum standpoint are turning positive. So that tells me, and with a quote that has been put out there by me in the past, America is learning to live with COVID. A, I think COVID incidences are starting to decline. Maybe that's the normal sign wave we see from any surge, which we just went through. And maybe it's the longer-term effect of getting more people vaccinated. Didn't the Biden administration say recently, they want everybody vaccinated by July or sometime this summer? So surely, that will have an impact. But the economic data I see would show a recovery, I don't know, down 3% last year, maybe up 2% to 3% this year, with industrial starting to respond in a favorable manner."

I always worry about the long-term implications of something like this because the pressure that we put on folks on the margin, or the COVID puts on folks on the margin, will reveal itself. We've been served 60 days away from COVID ending for now 10 months. And so it'll be interesting to see where we come out. Our expectation around how it would impact our particular customers actually was quite different than what we expected on the onset. So we expected that retail customer usage would increase as people stayed home. We actually expected industrial production would maintain itself -- would decline a little bit but not quite as drastically as it has and that commercial customers would be impacted most acutely, and it was very -- it was a very different outcome. Commercial customers found a way to do business in a different way, not all, but most. And industrial went through a period where there was sort of a reduction in output as -- because inventories were at a reasonable level and they could sort of pare down that inventory as they saw the economy progress. 
We've now seen sort of a tightening in supply in a number of the industrial segments, and production has started to pick up. And there have always been 2 or 3 standout weak segments in any particular 2- or 3-month period. But as Tom said today, the momentum is generally positive, and we're encouraged by the fact that people have adapted their businesses to earn profits in a way that they maybe hadn't anticipated 2 years ago. But yes, I -- or a year ago, I always worry that the longer anything goes, the more pressure you're going to put on somebody on the margin, for sure."

As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we reported a strong start to the year with adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2021 ahead of our estimate. The economies in our service territories are starting to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, and though customer demand remains mildly lower than prepandemic levels during the first quarter, it exceeded our expectation. 
Importantly, many of the programs we implemented to keep customers connected during the pandemic have proven to be very effective. We have reliably provided energy to our customers and facilitated alternative payment arrangements for those in need. I continue to be proud of our employees and the ways we have partnered with our communities throughout this pandemic. This past February parts of our nation were contending with the effects of devastating winter weather that cripple generating units in power Grids in Texas and beyond. 
At Southern Company, each of our businesses, including those with our operations in Texas and the Southwest region performed well during this event. Our regulated electric and gas utilities did not experience any operational issues or related service disruptions. 
Southern Power was minimally impacted due to its highly contracted business model. Our wholesale gas services subsidiary, Sequent Energy effectively served customers in need, utilizing, in large part, natural gas held in storage. 
And micro grids provided by PowerSecure had a 98 run time reliability, producing over 2,260 megawatt hours of reliable energy for customers during the storm. The winter season's atypical temperatures have also caused utilities across the country to evaluate their own system resilience under similar conditions. For Southern Company, our vertically integrated structure and integrated resource planning processes we utilize across our Southeast electric utilities have beneficial for years in allowing us, along with our regulators, to carefully consider plan for and invest in, infrastructure needed to address a range of extreme circumstances and improve resilience. We will continue to leverage the rigorous analysis and stakeholder input provided by these proceedings as we evaluate the potential for additional system enhancements across our footprint. Let's turn now to an update on plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. 
Unit 3 hot functional testing started on April 25, marking the last milestone in a series of major tests. Hot functional testing is conducted to verify the successful operation of reactor components and systems together and to confirm that the reactor is ready for fuel load. 
As part of the testing, the site team will run Unit 3 plant systems without nuclear fuel and advance through the testing process to reach normal operating pressure and temperature. Starting hot functional testing represents a significant step towards the operation of Unit 3 and ultimately, providing customers with a reliable, carbon-free energy source for the next 60 to 80 years. 
The site's work plan now targets fuel load in the third quarter and late December 2021 in-service date for Unit 3. Of course, any delays could result in a first quarter 2022 Unit 3 in-service date. Now as we have stated in prior calls, an important step in the system turnover process is to assure that the as built state of the plant aligns with the design basis and to resolve any differences. 
Before we close systems, declare them ready for testing and submit ITAC, we are committed to the notion of getting it right. In recent months, Southern Nuclear identified certain construction remediation work, primarily electrical in nature, that was necessary to ensure that quality and design standards were met prior to the start of high functional testing. 
We reviewed the project's construction quality programs prior to hot functional testing, we implemented improvement plans, and we believe Southern Nuclear's construction quality program is effective. 
Furthermore, the improvement plans we are implementing are designed to help drive successful completion of Unit 3 and improve performance for Unit 4. As the operator of these units, we are committed to getting it right, striving to ensure that our safety and quality standards are met prior to significant testing and operations activities. 
We will not sacrifice that commitment to meet schedule our milestone dates. With Unit 3 direct construction nearing completion and hot functional testing in progress, our primary system focus include going forward: one, successful completion of hot functional testing; two, completion of the remaining construction, system turnovers and testing leading to fuel load; and three, an orderly transition from fuel load to an efficient start-up of the unit. 
The ITAAC submittal and review process is expected to accelerate as we move into and beyond the hot functional test sequence. To date, 188 ITAAC have been submitted to the NRC. We will submit the remaining 211 during hot functional testing as we approach fuel load. 
Turning to Unit 4. Direct construction is now approximately 80% complete, and the current site work plan targets completion in the third quarter of 2022, which would provide margin to the regulatory approved November 22 in-service date. Earlier this week, the site team placed the water tank on top of the Unit 4 containment vessel and shield building roof, representing the last major crane lift at the project site. 
Integrated flush is in progress and initial energization is expected in the coming weeks. The site is focused on increasing craft labor resources and electrical productivity. We will continue adding incremental resources while also shifting resources from Unit 3 to Unit 4, which is expected to increase our current pace of construction completion. 
Construction completion has averaged 1.5% per month since the start of the year. In order to achieve the November 22 regulatory approved in-service dates, we estimate we would need to average construction completion of approximately 2% per month through the end of this year. 
And as a reference point, Unit 3 averaged approximately 2% during the second half of 2019 and through the first half of 2020, which did include periods heavily impacted by COVID-19. 
Looking now at cost. During the first quarter, Georgia Power allocated $84 million of contingency into the base capital forecast related to extending the schedule for Unit 3, performing construction remediation work and increasing support resources across both units. 
As a result, Georgia Power replenished its contingency by $48 million, recording an after-tax charge of $36 million at the end of the first quarter. While there was contingency remaining prior to this increase, we believe providing this additional amount of contingency is appropriate when considering the extended time necessary to reach the start of Unit 3 hot functional testing and the potential cost risk remaining as we complete both units. 
The major risks that remain to our cost estimate are similar to those for schedule, namely: one, our ability to increase earned hours and improve productivity, or CPI, at Unit 4; successful completion of the Unit 3 hot functional testing; and three, completion of the system turnovers and subsequent testing leaded to the Unit 3 fuel load. 
Notably, at this time last year, the onset of COVID-19 led to many uncertainties at the project site. The site team has responded in exemplary fashion, maintaining safety and progress toward completion of both units during what has been an unprecedented year. 
With effective COVID protocols in place and now the broader availability of vaccines, the impact on the site has decreased in recent months, as active cases and isolation rates are trending significantly lower. 
We are very pleased that Unit 3 hot functional testing is underway. We've consistently said that both the commencement and successful completion of this testing sequence will reduce risk for the project. 
And as always, I want to thank our employees, contractors, co-owners and community partners for their unwavering dedication to this important project. 
Drew, I'll turn it over to you now for an update on the financials."

I hope you're all safe and well. As Tom mentioned, we had a very strong start to the year. Our adjusted EPS for the first quarter of 2021 was $0.98, $0.20 higher than last year and $0.14 above our estimate. The",1165,"Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. I hope you're all safe and well. As Tom mentioned, we had a very strong start to the year. Our adjusted EPS for the first quarter of 2021 was $0.98, $0.20 higher than last year and $0.14 above our estimate. 
The primary drivers compared to last year was strong performance at our state-regulated utilities despite a comparative quarter that had very limited COVID-19 impacts. The lessons we learned during COVID-19 allowed us to maintain a relatively static cost structure as we saw withdrawal of COVID-19 impacts from their peak. 
We saw a year-over-year benefit of $0.06 from weather due to the extremely mild first quarter we experienced in 2020. Further, retail electric revenues increased in aggregate due to strong customer growth in the Southeast and constructive state regulatory actions. 
When looking at an adjusted EPS as compared to our estimate for the quarter, the main drivers of the positive variance were continued expense discipline, retail sales impacts from COVID-19 that were nearly [ 60% ] better than our forecast across all customer classes and significantly lower than their peak. And residential customer growth that has continued to exceed our expectation by almost 50%. 
We added nearly 60,000 customers last year. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted quarterly results as compared to 2020 is included in today's release and the earnings package. Looking more closely at sales in the first quarter, weather normal retail sales were only approximately 1.5% lower than last year's largely unaffected quarter. This decrease was driven by the continued trends of higher residential sales, offset by lower commercial and industrial sales compared to normal times. While residential sales remained elevated, commercial and industrial sales continue to be depressed by about 3%. As you would expect, the commercial subsectors most impacted by the pandemic continue to be office, restaurant and education. These are meaningful declines, and we expect recovery to be very gradual even with improving economic conditions. For industrial sales during the quarter, supply chain constraints appear to be affecting the automotive sector with primary metals and chemicals also down, but construction in lumber, in particular, are demonstrating early strength. 
In general, all industrial segments have moved stronger since the COVID-19 peak. The economies in our service territory are showing strong signs of recovery, with retail sales exceeding our expectations in the first quarter by roughly 3 percentage points. A recent analysis produced by IHS Markit estimates that most southeastern states, including Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi are predicted to return to their pre-pandemic peak employment levels by 2022 while other states may not return to these levels until 2025 and beyond. 
We have certainly learned that the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts are unpredictable, but the potential for more near-term recovery is encouraging. We mentioned on our last call that economic development trends are strong in our region, particularly in Georgia. And in fact, in the first quarter of 2021 alone, economic development announcements in Southern Company's retail electric service territory included the addition of over 3,600 new jobs and investments of more than $2.2 billion. 
We saw strong activity in both nonmanufacturing and manufacturing segments with new project announcements across a variety of industries, including warehousing, distribution, scientific and transportation equipment, among others. 
For the second quarter of 2021, our estimated EPS -- our adjusted EPS estimate is $0.78. I would also like to call your attention to our recent dividend increase. At its last meeting, the Southern Company Board of Directors approved an $0.08 per share increase in our common dividend raising our annualized rate to $2.64 per share. 
This action marks our 20th consecutive annual increase and for 73 years, dating back to 1948, Southern Company has paid a dividend that was equal to or greater than that of the previous year. The Board's decision to increase the dividend reinforces the strength and sustainability of Southern Company's business. 
This dedication to continuing our dividend increases, combined with our projected long-term EPS growth rate of 5% to 7% supports our objective of providing superior, risk-adjusted total shareholder return to investors over the long term. 
Before I turn the call back to Tom, I'd like to spend a few minutes providing an update on some of our strategic priorities. On our ESG efforts, recall in January, Southern Company became the first major U.S. utility to publish a sustainability financing -- sustainable financing framework. 
Our first issuance was a green bond related to Southern Power's Renewable Investments, further solidifying Southern Power as 1 of the largest green bond issuers in the United States. In February, we issued our inaugural sustainable bond at Georgia Power with net proceeds to be used for sustainable projects such as our spending with diverse and small business suppliers and our investment in renewable energy projects. 
The Georgia Power issuance aligns with our ongoing commitments to the community and the continued growth of Georgia Power's solar portfolio. We look forward to leveraging our sustainable financing framework for future financings by all of our issuers as appropriate. 
Also, I'd mention that Southern Power has been very active over the last few years, establishing itself as one of the nation's largest renewable generation owners with a total renewable portfolio of nearly 5,000 megawatts in operation or under construction. 
Within the last month, Southern Power announced the acquisition of the 300-megawatt dual harvest wind facility located in South Dakota and the 118-megawatt Glass Sands wind facility located in Oklahoma. With these acquisitions, Southern Power now owns 15 wind projects and approximately 2,500 megawatts of solar across the U.S., along with approximately 160 megawatts of battery storage. 
The existing generation fleet comprised of both renewables and natural gas is over 90% contracted for the next 10 years. Finally, over the past 3 years, we have strategically simplified our business in order to focus our time and investments in our core operations. 
As another example of that commitment, yesterday, we entered into an agreement to sell our wholesale gas trading and services business comprised of Sequent Energy Management and Sequent Energy in Canada, and we expect to complete the transaction in the third quarter of 2021. We do not expect a material gain or loss on the sale of the business, though it will provide a return of the associated working capital and the elimination of certain credit supports of approximately $1 billion. As a reminder, we have always excluded sequence earnings from our adjusted results due to its quarterly variability. So the sale of this business both reduces risk and has no impact on our adjusted EPS expectations for the remainder of the year. 
I'd like to personally thank the team at Sequent for their years of dedication and service to the company. I can tell you that it's been my pleasure working with all of those individuals at Sequent for more than 20 years, and I really look forward to their continued success. 
Tom, with that, I'll turn it back over to you."

As I noted last quarter, we achieved a 50% reduction in GHG emissions in 2020, beating our 2030 goal by a decade. Earlier this month, we filed an integrated resource plan in Mississippi that includes the retirement of Mississippi's last coal unit in 2027. Both Alabama Power and Georgia Power will work with their respective regulators over the next year and responding to the affluent limitation guideline rules, which they will reflect in their next integrated resource plans. 
We will also continue to work with all stakeholders in developing these strategies. Another note. We have historically worked in partnership with municipalities and co-ops in our region. We work hard on mutual respect and constructive collaboration. As an example of the wisdom of this approach, Alabama Power recently signed a long-term agreement with PowerSouth, a valued customer in Alabama, which is expected to create energy savings and enhanced system reliability from coordinated planning and operations. 
As a part of this agreement, Alabama Power has the right to participate in a portion of PowerSouth future incremental load growth. In closing, our strong first quarter positions us well to deliver on the financial objectives for the year. With the summer months and storm season ahead, our operating companies are well prepared to support the needs of our customers. And of course, all eyes remain on progress at Vogtle. And we look forward to providing continued updates as we approach fuel load and in service for Unit 3. 
Thank you for joining us this afternoon. Operator, we are now ready to take questions."

Well, look, number one, we're basically modeling forward experience on 3 for 4. So let's think about it.

Well, look, number one, we're basically modeling forward experience on 3 for 4. So let's think about it. Do you remember last year, it really started about the last 6 months of '19 through the first 6 months of '20. Remember when we were staffing up effectively, that's what we're doing now on four. We've delayed that, and we've accounted for all this in the revised estimate [indiscernible] and everything else because we didn't want to release all these people to 4 until effectively we finished 3. 
So what we have done is just estimated that we can hit November with experience similar to last year, we'll get CPI up to, I don't know, about [ 165 ] for the remainder of the project. We'll be completing at least 2%. Now here's where I think we have room for improvement. 
Remember the period I just told you, last 6 months of '19, first 6 months of '20. Included in that were 3 waves of COVID. Now who knows what's going to happen with COVID. But we have some reason for optimism, given that we've expanded vaccines. It appears that the waves have gotten smaller, certainly, our experience right now is way less than it has been. 
And so our view is productivity should rise. And so we have some level of optimism. Obviously, we can't guarantee it that we'll at least meet or beat what we did on Unit 3 with Unit 4. One last thing. There are always lessons learned on Unit 3. And some of the quality measures we just talked about going into hot functional tests, we're applying all of those lessons to Unit 4 so that we won't have to repeat them there. 
In fact, our good friends from [ Vogtle ] came to our last board meeting and reiterated the notion that we should see better performance on 4 than 3. All we're saying is right now, Julien, that even if we did just what we did on Unit 3, we can hit November. We frankly believe and expect we'll do better."

I guess the predicate is you got to have a successful [ HFT ], right? I think the biggest risk factor, however, going forward is after HFT to fuel load, there's 2 segments of work left that we still have to do and do well. 
One is completing the work that really is related to nuclear fuel, right? HFT in that we're going to use the affluent heat off the reactor cooler pumps to heat up the project. So it would be things related to nuclear fuel like the systems required to remove the fuel from the fuel pool and move it over to the reactor core. 
It would include systems like finishing up the [indiscernible] facility. The second segment would relate to what I would call broadly support systems, recall that we're going to have about 800 permanent employees at the site. So support systems for those folks. 
So let's think about HVAC, communications, but a lot of the water, things like that, that will support the people that are going to be working at the plant. And just to give you 1 more frame of reference, it's taken a lot to get to HFT, something like the latest work we've been doing, 60% of those systems are what we would call safety related. 
And by that, you should hear complexity. The amount of work to be done in between HFT completion and fuel road is significantly less, maybe 60% of that work and only about 10% or less of those systems are safety related. So I will say this to you. I believe that, that's the next riskiest thing we have to do. But it's not as big a deal as it has been getting to HFT. 
And then the third final thing is having a successful run from fuel load in service. We feel pretty confident about that. Last point. So I think, Julien, that you were starting to see people move now, frankly, from Unit 3 to Unit 4 certainly, that will get accelerated into the summer. 
Probably, it will start to max out around June, and then we'll hit our numbers at Unit 4."

And I use this vernacular, but I always caution you, it's just vernacular, paper. But effectively, that involved assuring that there was in the evaluation of the as built site -- as built condition of the plan as compared to the design basis of the plant that was harmonized. And where there were differences that we made adjustments. Some of that was work that needed to be remediated. When we saw this starting to delay beyond what we thought, recall, that we were calling for a last 2 weeks in March kind of start of HFT. 
We decided to really stop and take a good look at the system. It appears that while there were some issues elsewhere in the plant, the concentration of issues really dealt with the electrical systems. And then when you think about what it takes to turn over a system, effectively, when we saw these problems start to manifest itself, we caught it ultimately with our quality control program. 
And so in effect, we had -- we sat back and looked at it and said, no, our quality control program does work. We have identified the systems. We have remediated them in order to start HFT. There are some things that we did catch that will continue to be remediated from the finish of HFT to fuel load. But we've sketched all that out, and we're pretty confident that everything that we know we're dealing with. All of this is a part of our current cost and schedule estimates. 
I would say, too, that and [ Vogtle ] would agree with this. We talked about this with our Board that for what we have found, we think we are making adjustments to Unit 4 so that we will not -- we should not repeat any of these issues going forward.

We've always exed them out as extraordinary items, but just too variable and it's fascinating. I just have some quick data to show how variable we are. 
If you look at Sequent even prior to when Southern made the acquisitions, say, from 2010 forward, they've averaged about $40 million in net income. They had 2 years. One was $260 million and one was $163 million, where they really blew out earnings. 
Other than that, the earnings were near 0. If you exclude those big years, so over 9 years, they averaged about $4 million of net income. And since we've owned Sequent, there's been 1 big year, the $163 million in 2019 and then this year. And then otherwise, the earnings were around $23 million in net income. 
And so if you step back and look at it, number one, we ex any earnings. Number two, because of the balance sheet we are bringing up $1 billion, that reduces our risk profile. So net-net to corporation value, we think this is a clear winner. 
I think 1 more thing I just ought to point out. Sequent had a really good earnings year in the first quarter. Thankfully, they had gas and storage which supported the needs of the state of Texas primarily. Remember, there were constrained gas flow. Sequent was able to step into the breach and sell a lot of gas in storage and made a lot of -- made some profits off of the volumes that they were able to provide, thank goodness to Texas' customers. That produced net income of around $200 million. In recognition of our commitment to communities, we took $75 million or so of that $200 million and put it into our foundation. That is going to get [indiscernible] back into communities. 
So you'll see net income for Sequent in the first quarter of around $133 million or so. So look, we had a good year. I do think that the buyer is, as Drew said, a better owner. And I've said that for years. A lot of M&A is all about who's the best owner of any particular asset. And I think for what we bought and what we've sold, I think we've demonstrated our ability to bring value to shareholders every time."

We keep the same thresholds in place. And rather than comment on any specific deal, in general, what we look for is significant contract coverage. 
So in this case, 90% over 10 years, we look for those things. And we generally get profits that are, say, ROES, plus $150 million over our regulated business.

So we've talked, in fact, about a Venn diagram in the past, the 3 circles of a Venn diagram, in this case, would have been Southern Power, PowerSecure and Sequent. And let's think about that for a minute. Sequent -- o let's start with PowerSecure. PowerSecure has really been focused on kind of mostly the retail side of the business, particularly commercial and industrial customers where resilience is particularly important. 
And in keeping with this 100-year-old model of central station, make, move and sell projects at scale, PowerSecure essentially represents the idea of miniaturizing that century old business model and putting the make, move and sell premise at the customer premises. So when you think about some of our major customers who do value resilience at an exceptional level, we can put microgrid. 
We are by far the largest share of micro grids in the United States through PowerSecure. We can put distributed generation there. We can put proprietary switchgear and storage. And so this has been a wonderful kind of window on the world. Add to the Vienn diagram, what we've seen lately at Southern Power. Southern Power grew up selling to other utilities or other co-ops or other munis. And lately, a great kind of target zone for Southern Power has been companies desiring green attributes. So General Mills, General Motors, Carnival cruise lines, people like that, that want to have renewables as part of their generation portfolio, so to speak. The union of what we're seeing at Southern Power in respect of that business, that market, with the market that is served primarily by PowerSecure. There's great overlap and great mutual synergy. Now we used to have Sequent as part of that Venn diagram, where we would, in fact, take over fuel management for some of the distributed generation at all serviced by our customers. 
We feel we can do that ourselves now and selling Sequent doesn't impact to a significant degree our ability to serve that need of our customers. And if we can't do it, we'll find somebody that can. 
So -- and look at the -- and 1 last thing I just want to leave you with. Look at the data over the past few earnings calls we've done, through hurricanes, winter storm Uri and others, Sequent -- I mean PowerSecure is able to provide reliability in excess of 98% in general terms across these very devastating storms. 
This idea does work. I will say PowerSecure remain kind of a peanut to our earnings. We don't talk about PowerSecure in terms of being a contributor to earnings even though it is earning a little bit of money. I think the bigger value we see is as an option to what may be happening in the future, and that is because of technology, because of changing customer requirements, it gives us a window on the world that allows us not only to learn about this new market, but also to influence how it emerges, and to position our franchise businesses optimally."

I think our best example most recently is that we'll do constructions at the Atlanta airport to produce the kind of reliability that's required there. But in terms of distributed generation, I think it demonstrates that folks are not really all that interested in prime power, but more interested in the kinds of backup and [ surety ] that you can get out of the PowerSecure product line."

We're building the 2 facilities we named as part of -- as complements to our existing solar facilities in California. 
But storage itself is probably the single biggest complication with the transition to renewables over the next couple of decades, whether it's going to be lithium ion, which is relatively short duration, if you think about how our system operates today or something more complex like compressed air energy or liquid air or liquid metal. Pump hydro is probably another great example. 
We're going to have to find ways for long duration storage to complement the kinds of assets that we're talking about on the renewable side. One of the nice arrangements that we have within Alabama power with PowerSource is that they actually operate today a case facility that can deliver battery power for 26 hours. It's been operating for almost 20 years. These are great experiments and understanding things for us to learn. I do think that battery will be an increasing area of investment for us.

And so on that cold winter peak day, you're going to need a whole lot more megawatts to be able to meet those needs. Some storage, some [ CTs ] with CCS, you name it. So hydrogen is important in that regard. So these are important projects, too, that's helping us understand better how to meet the aspirations of this administration. 
And just a little more [indiscernible]. So we're supportive of the bipartisan policy center and I'm a member of the net 0 business alliance. We've had a session already with some other CEOs from Tyson Foods, Occidental Petroleum, United Airlines, [ Warehouse ], ConocoPhillips, we're meeting again Tuesday with [ Jeanne McCarthy ]. 
And so part of our whole premise here is engaging constructively with the administration with the concept of yes and that is we're going to need to support. We're going to need the administration in the boat with us to achieve that aspiration, assuming we have a supply chain availability, assuming we have labor available. The big issue for us to hit these kinds of numbers is that. Over the next 15 years, we will triple the amount of generation we will put on the ground as compared to any other 15-year period in our corporate history. It is a big list. Assuming we get the support, can we do it? Yes, I think so. There are lots of policy choices along the way that make this a very complex decision."

And this is part of the conversations we've been having on an ongoing basis with this administration. As I mentioned, talked with [ Gene McCarthy ] before on a different level. We'll talk -- I'll be talking with her again next Tuesday. 
I think the administration gets it that there needs to be a whole different level of public-private cooperation and collaboration, carrots and sticks in order to get this done. I will say, talking the book of nuclear that it's important for the United States to keep nuclear as a priority. And so anything they can do to help to keep the nuclear assets alive really helps the United States broadly with their long-term goal. And that not only includes projects like ours, current nuclear assets in operation that are at risk because of an imperfect market design, but also providing R&D support for the so-called Gen 4 reactors, that may appear in the 2030 time frame. All of this is an important part to achieving net 0 for the economy by 2050."

And when you think about renewables being so important, we need to think about reevaluating our long-term transmission plan in order to hit those kinds of objectives. 
And it may be that retired coal plants could be prime areas to locate some of those resources and built by our host companies.

We actually did some work in advance of declaring in service. 
But I would assume that you're going to be 45 days. If it's 50 days, it's no big deal, okay? But that's kind of the plan, 45 days. Then we opened the hood up, just like you bought a car and drove it for a month, now you're going to look at it and see, did everything work like it was supposed to. 
So there are stages along the way. As you think about -- I don't have it with me right here, but there is a detailed path of different checkpoints along the way. I think, in fact, it's imminent we're going to raise temperature to 175 degrees. I mean that might happen tonight, it might happen Friday. I mean but that's the first level. 
And then every incremental rise, they start checking system. I think the real thing I'm looking for that goes to risk is really the integration of everything, like, for example, we have tested all of our RCPs, reactor coolant pumps. We've tested them briefly, all 4 of them running together. Now we're going to run together for some period of time. Do all of the support systems work. So not only do we have primary power in the integration of the plant, we have external backup sources that have to work. So this is the final crews, if you will, before fuel load, that make sure that the integration of all of the pieces we've checked so far do work. The culmination of all this is we're going to raise temperatures up to about 560 degrees, and we will create steam, and we will send it to the turbine and we will spin the turbine. Okay. So this is kind of big stuff. The only thing that will remain then, finish the construction on some of these support systems and then load fuel."

So I just kind of have a thought about you guys and about where the industry is going. And Tom, you and I go way back as far as the industry. And back in the '90s when deregulation was starting, it was caused by very, very high electric rates. And there was something called the Super Southeast and those stocks traded at a premium. And then you've had companies like Kentucky Utilities and other companies with lower rates that traded at a premium. 
So fast forward to now and fast forward to what the Biden administration is proposing and where the industry is headed. Now you have very high rates in the Northeast, mainly [ T&D ] companies that really don't have any levers to reduce their rates or to keep rates flat. But then I look at like Southern Company, again, we've got to get through this nuclear plant build. But once that is done, can you maybe talk about -- and you had at a very high level, but the opportunity to transform your fleet. And obviously, you've talked about that, but maybe the cost savings around that the opportunity there. And what will happen to your electric rates longer-term relative to other parts of the country, and also basically, what that will do longer term, again, I'm thining longer-term for your growth opportunities?"

I think the wisdom of the integrated regulated model will bear fruit significantly as we consider some of these issues. In the so-called organized markets, there is very little control as to constructing an optimal portfolio, number one. Number two, when you think about the portfolio, we should consider that it includes transmission. Number three, I think the fact that part of the secret sauce here is reconfiguring the portfolio absent coal. Coal carries with it a whole lot of O&M. And so not only is there optionality in terms of the generation and transmission we will provide. I think by our planning process is we can do that in a way that's much more orderly and effective and efficient than the organized market. And then finally, when you consider the O&M that could be freed up, by closing down some of these O&M intensive facilities like coal plants. We have the ability to use that O&M to keep rates lower than you'll find elsewhere in the country certainly even compared to those companies that are just wires only. Their ability to deliver the kind of price shock absorbers doesn't exist because they will be takers of cost from the market. So I can assure you that we've already been talking about these issues with our regulators, with our stockholders, I mean, our stakeholders. And I can think that we -- it's my earnings call, but I think we're better positioned in this kind of model in this region than elsewhere in the United States."

As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we reported a strong start to the year with adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2021 ahead of our estimate. The economies in our service territories are starting to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, and though customer demand remains mildly lower than prepandemic levels during the first quarter, it exceeded our expectation. 
Importantly, many of the programs we implemented to keep customers connected during the pandemic have proven to be very effective. We have reliably provided energy to our customers and facilitated alternative payment arrangements for those in need. I continue to be proud of our employees and the ways we have partnered with our communities throughout this pandemic. This past February, parts of our nation were contending with the effects of devastating winter weather that crippled generating units and power grids in Texas and beyond. 
At Southern Company, each of our businesses, including those with our operations in Texas and the Southwest region performed well during this event. Our regulated electric and gas utilities did not experience any operational issues or related service disruptions. 
Southern Power was minimally impacted due to its highly contracted business model. Our wholesale gas services subsidiary, Sequent Energy effectively served customers in need, utilizing, in large part, natural gas held in storage. 
And microgrids provided by PowerSecure had a 98 run time reliability, producing over 2,260 megawatt hours of reliable energy for customers during the storm. The winter season's atypical temperatures have also caused utilities across the country to evaluate their own system resilience under similar conditions. For Southern Company, our vertically integrated structure and integrated resource planning processes we utilize across our Southeast electric utilities have beneficial for years in allowing us, along with our regulators, to carefully consider, plan for and invest in, infrastructure needed to address a range of extreme circumstances and improve resilience. We will continue to leverage the rigorous analysis and stakeholder input provided by these proceedings as we evaluate the potential for additional system enhancements across our footprint. Let's turn now to an update on plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. 
Unit 3 hot functional testing started on April 25, marking the last milestone in a series of major tests. Hot functional testing is conducted to verify the successful operation of reactor components and systems together and to confirm that the reactor is ready for fuel load. 
As part of the testing, the site team will run Unit 3 plant systems without nuclear fuel and advance through the testing process to reach normal operating pressure and temperature. Starting hot functional testing represents a significant step towards the operation of Unit 3 and ultimately, providing customers with a reliable, carbon-free energy source for the next 60 to 80 years. 
The site's work plan now targets fuel load in the third quarter and late December 2021 in-service date for Unit 3. Of course, any delays could result in a first quarter 2022 Unit 3 in-service date. Now as we have stated in prior calls, an important step in the system turnover process is to assure that the as-built state of the plant aligns with the design basis and to resolve any differences. 
Before we close systems, declare them ready for testing and submit ITAAC, we are committed to the notion of getting it right. In recent months, Southern Nuclear identified certain construction remediation work, primarily electrical in nature, that was necessary to ensure that quality and design standards were met prior to the start of hot functional testing. 
We reviewed the project's construction quality programs prior to hot functional testing, we implemented improvement plans, and we believe Southern Nuclear's construction quality program is effective. 
Furthermore, the improvement plans we are implementing are designed to help drive successful completion of Unit 3 and improve performance for Unit 4. As the operator of these units, we are committed to getting it right, striving to ensure that our safety and quality standards are met prior to significant testing and operations activities. 
We will not sacrifice that commitment to meet schedule our milestone dates. With Unit 3 direct construction nearing completion and hot functional testing in progress, our primary system focus include going forward: one, successful completion of hot functional testing; two, completion of the remaining construction, system turnovers and testing leading to fuel load; and three, an orderly transition from fuel load to an efficient start-up of the unit. 
The ITAAC submittal and review process is expected to accelerate as we move into and beyond the hot functional test sequence. To date, 188 ITAAC have been submitted to the NRC. We will submit the remaining 211 during hot functional testing as we approach fuel load. 
Turning to Unit 4. Direct construction is now approximately 80% complete, and the current site work plan targets completion in the third quarter of 2022, which would provide margin to the regulatory approved November 22 in-service date. Earlier this week, the site team placed the water tank on top of the Unit 4 containment vessel and shield building roof, representing the last major crane lift at the project site. 
Integrated flush is in progress, and initial energization is expected in the coming weeks. The site is focused on increasing craft labor resources and electrical productivity. We will continue adding incremental resources while also shifting resources from Unit 3 to Unit 4, which is expected to increase our current pace of construction completion. 
Construction completion has averaged 1.5% per month since the start of the year. In order to achieve the November 22 regulatory approved in-service dates, we estimate we would need to average construction completion of approximately 2% per month through the end of this year. 
And as a reference point, Unit 3 averaged approximately 2% during the second half of 2019 and through the first half of 2020, which did include periods heavily impacted by COVID-19. 
Looking now at cost. During the first quarter, Georgia Power allocated $84 million of contingency into the base capital forecast related to extending the schedule for Unit 3, performing construction remediation work and increasing support resources across both units. 
As a result, Georgia Power replenished its contingency by $48 million, recording an after-tax charge of $36 million at the end of the first quarter. While there was contingency remaining prior to this increase, we believe providing this additional amount of contingency is appropriate when considering the extended time necessary to reach the start of Unit 3 hot functional testing and the potential cost risk remaining as we complete both units. 
The major risks that remain to our cost estimate are similar to those for schedule, namely: one, our ability to increase earned hours and improve productivity or CPI at Unit 4; successful completion of the Unit 3 hot functional testing; and three, completion of the system turnovers and subsequent testing leaded to the Unit 3 fuel load. 
Notably, at this time last year, the onset of COVID-19 led to many uncertainties at the project site. The site team has responded in exemplary fashion, maintaining safety and progress toward completion of both units during what has been an unprecedented year. 
With effective COVID protocols in place and now the broader availability of vaccines, the impact on the site has decreased in recent months, as active cases and isolation rates are trending significantly lower. 
We are very pleased that Unit 3 hot functional testing is underway. We've consistently said that both the commencement and successful completion of this testing sequence will reduce risk for the project. 
And as always, I want to thank our employees, contractors, co-owners and community partners for their unwavering dedication to this important project. 
Drew, I'll turn it over to you now for an update on the financials."

I hope you're all safe and well. As Tom mentioned, we had a very strong start to the year. Our adjusted EPS for the first quarter of 2021 was $0.98, $0.20 higher than last year and $0.14 above our estimate. The",1163,"Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. I hope you're all safe and well. As Tom mentioned, we had a very strong start to the year. Our adjusted EPS for the first quarter of 2021 was $0.98, $0.20 higher than last year and $0.14 above our estimate. 
The primary drivers compared to last year was strong performance at our state-regulated utilities despite a comparative quarter that had very limited COVID-19 impacts. The lessons we learned during COVID-19 allowed us to maintain a relatively static cost structure as we saw withdrawal of COVID-19 impacts from their peak. 
We saw a year-over-year benefit of $0.06 from weather due to the extremely mild first quarter we experienced in 2020. Further, retail electric revenues increased in aggregate due to strong customer growth in the Southeast and constructive state regulatory actions. 
When looking at an adjusted EPS as compared to our estimate for the quarter, the main drivers of the positive variance were continued expense discipline, retail sales impacts from COVID-19 that were nearly 60% better than our forecast across all customer classes and significantly lower than their peak and residential customer growth that has continued to exceed our expectation by almost 50%. We added nearly 60,000 customers last year. 
A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted quarterly results as compared to 2020 is included in today's release and the earnings package. Looking more closely at sales in the first quarter, weather normal retail sales were only approximately 1.5% lower than last year's largely unaffected quarter. This decrease was driven by the continued trends of higher residential sales, offset by lower commercial and industrial sales compared to normal times. While residential sales remained elevated, commercial and industrial sales continue to be depressed by about 3%. As you would expect, the commercial subsectors most impacted by the pandemic continue to be office, restaurant and education. These are meaningful declines, and we expect recovery to be very gradual even with improving economic conditions. For industrial sales during the quarter, supply chain constraints appear to be affecting the automotive sector with primary metals and chemicals also down, but construction and lumber, in particular, are demonstrating early strength. 
In general, all industrial segments have moved stronger since the COVID-19 peak. The economies in our service territory are showing strong signs of recovery, with retail sales exceeding our expectations in the first quarter by roughly 3 percentage points. A recent analysis produced by IHS Markit estimates that most southeastern states, including Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi are predicted to return to their pre-pandemic peak employment levels by 2022 while other states may not return to these levels until 2025 and beyond. 
We have certainly learned that the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts are unpredictable, but the potential for more near-term recovery is encouraging. We mentioned on our last call that economic development trends are strong in our region, particularly in Georgia. And in fact, in the first quarter of 2021 alone, economic development announcements in Southern Company's retail electric service territory included the addition of over 3,600 new jobs and investments of more than $2.2 billion. 
We saw strong activity in both nonmanufacturing and manufacturing segments with new project announcements across a variety of industries, including warehousing, distribution, scientific and transportation equipment, among others. 
For the second quarter of 2021, our estimated EPS -- our adjusted EPS estimate is $0.78. I would also like to call your attention to our recent dividend increase. At its last meeting, the Southern Company Board of Directors approved an $0.08 per share increase in our common dividend raising our annualized rate to $2.64 per share. 
This action marks our 20th consecutive annual increase and for 73 years, dating back to 1948, Southern Company has paid a dividend that was equal to or greater than that of the previous year. The Board's decision to increase the dividend reinforces the strength and sustainability of Southern Company's business. 
This dedication to continuing our dividend increases, combined with our projected long-term EPS growth rate of 5% to 7% supports our objective of providing superior, risk-adjusted total shareholder return to investors over the long term. 
Before I turn the call back to Tom, I'd like to spend a few minutes providing an update on some of our strategic priorities. On our ESG efforts, recall in January, Southern Company became the first major U.S. utility to publish a sustainability financing -- sustainable financing framework. 
Our first issuance was a green bond related to Southern Power's Renewable Investments, further solidifying Southern Power as one of the largest green bond issuers in The United States. In February, we issued our inaugural sustainable bond at Georgia Power with net proceeds to be used for sustainable projects such as our spending with diverse and small business suppliers and our investment in renewable energy projects. 
The Georgia Power issuance aligns with our ongoing commitments to the community and the continued growth of Georgia Power's solar portfolio. We look forward to leveraging our sustainable financing framework for future financings by all of our issuers as appropriate. 
Also, I'd mention that Southern Power has been very active over the last few years, establishing itself as one of the nation's largest renewable generation owners with a total renewable portfolio of nearly 5,000 megawatts in operation or under construction. 
Within the last month, Southern Power announced the acquisition of the 300-megawatt Deuel Harvest wind facility located in South Dakota and the 118-megawatt Glass Sands wind facility located in Oklahoma. With these acquisitions, Southern Power now owns 15 wind projects and approximately 2,500 megawatts of solar across the U.S., along with approximately 160 megawatts of battery storage. 
The existing generation fleet comprised of both renewables and natural gas is over 90% contracted for the next 10 years. Finally, over the past 3 years, we have strategically simplified our business in order to focus our time and investments in our core operations. 
As another example of that commitment, yesterday, we entered into an agreement to sell our wholesale gas trading and services business comprised of Sequent Energy Management and Sequent Energy in Canada, and we expect to complete the transaction in the third quarter of 2021. We do not expect a material gain or loss on the sale of the business, though it will provide a return of the associated working capital and the elimination of certain credit supports of approximately $1 billion. As a reminder, we have always excluded Sequent's earnings from our adjusted results due to its quarterly variability. So the sale of this business both reduces risk and has no impact on our adjusted EPS expectations for the remainder of the year.

I'd like to personally thank the team at Sequent for their years of dedication and service to the company. I can tell you that it's been my pleasure working with all of those individuals at Sequent for more than 20 years, and I really look forward to their continued success. 
Tom, with that, I'll turn it back over to you."

As I noted last quarter, we achieved a 50% reduction in GHG emissions in 2020, beating our 2030 goal by a decade. Earlier this month, we filed an integrated resource plan in Mississippi that includes the retirement of Mississippi's last coal unit in 2027. Both Alabama Power and Georgia Power will work with their respective regulators over the next year in responding to the effluent limitation guideline rules, which they will reflect in their next integrated resource plans. 
We will also continue to work with all stakeholders in developing these strategies. Another note. We have historically worked in partnership with municipalities and co-ops in our region. We work hard on mutual respect and constructive collaboration. As an example of the wisdom of this approach, Alabama Power recently signed a long-term agreement with PowerSouth, a valued customer in Alabama, which is expected to create energy savings and enhanced system reliability from coordinated planning and operations. 
As a part of this agreement, Alabama Power has the right to participate in a portion of PowerSouth's future incremental load growth. In closing, our strong first quarter positions us well to deliver on the financial objectives for the year. With the summer months and storm season ahead, our operating companies are well prepared to support the needs of our customers. And of course, all eyes remain on progress at Vogtle.

Well, look, number one, we're basically modeling forward experience on 3 for 4. So let's think about it.

Well, look, number one, we're basically modeling forward experience on 3 for 4. So let's think about it. Do you remember last year, it really started about the last 6 months of '19 through the first 6 months of '20. Remember when we were staffing up effectively, that's what we're doing now on 4. We've delayed that, and we've accounted for all this in the revised estimates,  [indiscernible] and everything else because we didn't want to release all these people to 4 until effectively we finished 3. 
So what we have done is just estimated that we can hit November with experience similar to last year, we'll get CPI up to, I don't know, about [indiscernible] [ 1.65 ] for the remainder of the project. We'll be completing at least 2%. 
Now here's where I think we have room for improvement. Remember the period I just told you, last 6 months of '19, first 6 months of '20. Included in that, were 3 waves of COVID. Now who knows what's going to happen with COVID. But we have some reason for optimism, given that we've expanded vaccines. It appears that the waves have gotten smaller, certainly, our experience right now is way less than it has been. 
And so our view is productivity should rise. And so we have some level of optimism. Obviously, we can't guarantee it that we'll at least meet or beat what we did on Unit 3 with Unit 4. One last thing. There are always lessons learned on Unit 3. And some of the quality measures we just talked about going into hot functional tests, we're applying all of those lessons to Unit 4 so that we won't have to repeat them there. 
In fact, our good friends from Vogtle came to our last board meeting and reiterated the notion that we should see better performance on 4 than 3. All we're saying is right now, Julien, that even if we did just what we did on Unit 3, we can hit November. We frankly believe and expect we'll do better."

I guess the predicate is you got to have a successful HFT, right? I think the biggest risk factor, however, going forward is after HFT to fuel load, there's 2 segments of work left that we still have to do and do well. 
One is completing the work that really is related to nuclear fuel, right? HFT means that we're going to use the effluent heat of the reactor coolant pumps to heat up the project. So it would be things related to nuclear fuel like the systems required to remove the fuel from the fuel pool and move it over to the reactor core. 
It would include systems like finishing up the rad waste facility. The second segment would relate to what I would call broadly support systems, recall that we're going to have about 800 permanent employees at the site. So support systems for those folks. 
So let's think about HVAC, communications, but a lot of the water, things like that, that will support the people that are going to be working at the plant. And just to give you one more frame of reference, it's taken a lot to get to HFT, something like the latest work we've been doing, 60% of those systems are what we would call safety related. 
And by that, you should hear complexity. The amount of work to be done in between HFT completion and fuel load is significantly less, maybe 60% of that work and only about 10% or less of those systems are safety related. So I will say this to you. I believe that, that's the next riskiest thing we have to do. But it's not as big a deal as it has been getting to HFT. 
And then the third final thing is having a successful run from fuel load in service. We feel pretty confident about that.

And I use this vernacular, but I always caution you, it's just vernacular, paper. But effectively, that involved assuring that there was in the evaluation of the as-built site -- as-built condition of the plan as compared to the design basis of the plant that was harmonized. And where there were differences that we made adjustments. Some of that was work that needed to be remediated. When we saw this starting to delay beyond what we thought, recall, that we were calling for a last 2 weeks in March kind of start of HFT. 
We decided to really stop and take a good look at the system. It appears that while there were some issues elsewhere in the plant, the concentration of issues really dealt with the electrical systems. And then when you think about what it takes to turn over a system, effectively, when we saw these problems start to manifest itself, we caught it ultimately with our quality control program. 
And so in effect, we had -- we sat back and looked at it and said, no, our quality control program does work. We have identified the systems, we have remediated them in order to start HFT. There are some things that we did catch that will continue to be remediated from the finish of HFT to fuel load. But we've sketched all that out, and we're pretty confident that everything that we know we're dealing with. All of this is a part of our current cost and schedule estimates. 
I would say, too, that and Vogtle would agree with this. We talked about this with our Board that for what we have found, we think we are making adjustments to Unit 4 so that we will not -- we should not repeat any of these issues going forward. That gives us more confidence in schedule and cost."

We've always exed them out as extraordinary items. They're just too variable, and it's fascinating. I just have some quick data to show how variable we are. 
If you look at Sequent even prior to when Southern made the acquisitions, say, from 2010 forward, they've averaged about $40 million in net income. They had 2 years. One was $260 million, and one was $163 million, where they really blew out earnings. 
Other than that, the earnings were near 0. If you exclude those big years, so over 9 years, they averaged about $4 million of net income. And since we've owned Sequent, there's been 1 big year, the $163 million in 2019 and then this year. And then otherwise, the earnings were around $23 million in net income. 
And so if you step back and look at it, number one, we ex any earnings. Number two, because of the balance sheet we are bringing up $1 billion, that reduces our risk profile. So net-net to corporation value, we think this is a clear winner. 
I think one more thing I just ought to point out. Sequent had a really good earnings year in the first quarter. Thankfully, they had gas and storage which supported the needs of the state of Texas primarily. Remember, there were constrained gas flow. Sequent was able to step into the breach and sell a lot of gas in storage and made a lot -- made some profits off of the volumes that they were able to provide, thank goodness to Texas' customers. That produced net income of around $200 million. In recognition of our commitment to communities, we took $75 million or so of that $200 million and put it into our foundation. That is going to get reploughed back into communities. 
So you'll see net income for Sequent in the first quarter of around $133 million or so. So look, we had a good year. I do think that the buyer is, as Drew said, a better owner. And I've said that for years. A lot of M&A is all about who's the best owner of any particular asset. And I think for what we bought and what we've sold, I think we've demonstrated our ability to bring value to shareholders every time."

So in this case, 90% over 10 years, we look for those things. And we generally get profits that are, say, ROEs, plus $150 million over our regulated business.

So we've talked, in fact, about a Venn diagram in the past, the 3 circles of a Venn diagram, in this case, would have been Southern Power, PowerSecure and Sequent. Now let's think about that for a minute. Sequent -- no, let's start with PowerSecure. PowerSecure has really been focused on kind of mostly the retail side of the business, particularly commercial and industrial customers where resilience is particularly important. 
And in keeping with this 100-year-old model of central station, make, move and sell projects at scale, PowerSecure essentially represents the idea of miniaturizing that century old business model and putting the make, move and sell premise at the customer premises. So when you think about some of our major customers who do value resilience at an exceptional level, we can put microgrid. 
We are by far the largest share of microgrids in The United States through PowerSecure. We can put distributed generation there. We can put proprietary switchgear and storage. And so this has been a wonderful kind of window on the world. Add to the Venn diagram, what we've seen lately at Southern Power. Southern Power grew up selling to other utilities or other co-ops or other munis. And lately, a great kind of target zone for Southern Power has been companies desiring green attributes. So General Mills, General Motors, Carnival Cruise Lines, people like that, that want to have renewables as part of their generation portfolio, so to speak. 
The union of what we're seeing at Southern Power in respect of that business, that market, with the market that is served primarily by PowerSecure, there's great overlap and great mutual synergy. Now we used to have Sequent as part of that Venn diagram, where we would, in fact, take over fuel management for some of the distributed generation at all serviced by our customers. We feel we can do that ourselves now and selling Sequent doesn't impact to a significant degree our ability to serve that need of our customers. And if we can't do it, we'll find somebody that can. 
So -- and look at the -- and one last thing I just want to leave you with. Look at the data over the past few earnings calls we've done, through hurricanes, winter storm Uri and others. Sequent -- I mean PowerSecure is able to provide reliability in excess of 98% in general terms across these very devastating storms. 
This idea does work. I will say PowerSecure remains kind of a peanut to our earnings. We don't talk about PowerSecure in terms of being a contributor to earnings even though it is earning a little bit of money. I think the bigger value we see is as an option to what may be happening in the future, and that is because of technology, because of changing customer requirements, it gives us a window on the world that allows us not only to learn about this new market, but also to influence how it emerges, and to position our franchise businesses optimally."

I think our best example most recently is that we'll do constructions at the Atlanta airport to produce the kind of reliability that's required there. But in terms of distributed generation, I think it demonstrates that folks are not really all that interested in prime power, but more interested in the kinds of backup and a surety that you can get out of the PowerSecure product line."

I think it's an absolute requirement.

We're building the 2 facilities we named as part of -- as complements to our existing solar facilities in California. 
But storage itself is probably the single biggest complication with the transition to renewables over the next couple of decades, whether it's going to be lithium ion, which is relatively short duration, if you think about how our system operates today or something more complex like compressed air energy or liquid air or liquid metal. Pump hydro is probably another great example. 
We're going to have to find ways for long duration storage to complement the kinds of assets that we're talking about on the renewable side. One of the nice arrangements that we have within Alabama Power -- with power source is that they actually operate today a case facility that can deliver battery power for 26 hours. It's been operating for almost 20 years. These are great experiments and understanding things for us to learn. I do think that battery will be an increasing area of investment for us. We just have to figure out what technology is most pertinent for the circumstance."

It's very clear to us that storage in some form, whether it's short duration, intermediate, seasonal, that's going to become important to support the intermittent profile of renewables. Gosh, I think to achieve net zero for us, we're going to need about 50% penetration, mostly of solar. And so on that cold winter peak day, you're going to need a whole lot more megawatts to be able to meet those needs. Some storage, some CTs,  some CTs with CCS, you name it. So hydrogen is important in that regard. So these are important projects, too, that's helping us understand better how to meet the aspirations of this administration. 
And just a little more [indiscernible]. So we're supportive of the bipartisan policy center and I'm a member of the net zero business alliance.

And so part of our whole premise here is engaging constructively with the administration with the concept of yes hand that is we're going to need to support, we're going to need the administration in the boat with us to achieve that aspiration, assuming we have a supply chain availability, assuming we have labor available. The big issue for us to hit these kinds of numbers is that over the next 15 years, we will triple the amount of generation we will put on the ground as compared to any other 15-year period in our corporate history.

The administration, if they're going to hit their aspiration of 80% removal by 2030 and 100% net zero by 2035 and then move the whole economy to net zero by 2050. This is an important and awfully complex and difficult undertaking. And we are ready to support them however we can. And this is part of the conversations we've been having on an ongoing basis with this administration. As I mentioned, talked with Gina McCarthy before on a different level. We'll be talking -- I'll be talking with her again next Tuesday. 
I think the administration gets it that there needs to be a whole different level of public-private cooperation and collaboration, carrots and sticks in order to get this done. I will say, talking the book of nuclear that it's important for the United States to keep nuclear as a priority. And so anything they can do to help to keep the nuclear assets alive really helps the United States broadly with their long-term goal. And that not only includes projects like ours, current nuclear assets in operation that are at risk because of an imperfect market design, but also providing R&D support for the so-called Gen 4 reactors, that may appear in the 2030 time frame. All of this is an important part to achieving net zero for the economy by 2050."

We actually did some work in advance of declaring in-service. 
But I would assume it's going to be 45 days. If it's 50 days, it's no big deal, okay? But that's kind of the plan, 45 days. Then we opened the hood up, just like you bought a car and drove it for a month. Now you're going to look at it and see, did everything work like it was supposed to?
So there are stages along the way. As you think about -- I don't have it with me right here, but there is a detailed path of different checkpoints along the way. I think, in fact, it's imminent we're going to raise temperature to 175 degrees. I mean it might happen tonight, it might happen Friday, I mean, but that's the first level. 
And then every incremental rise, they start checking system. I think the real thing I'm looking for that goes to risk is really the integration of everything, like, for example, we have tested all of our RCPs, reactor coolant pumps. We've tested them briefly, all 4 of them running together. Now we're going to run together for some period of time. Do all of the support systems work? 
So not only do we have primary power in the integration of the plant, we have external backup sources that have to work. So this is the final crews, if you will, before fuel load, that make sure that the integration of all of the pieces we've checked so far do work. The culmination of all this is we're going to raise temperatures up to about 560 degrees, and we will create steam, and we will send it to the turbine, and we will spin the turbine, okay? 
So this is kind of big stuff. The only thing that will remain then, finish the construction on some of these support systems and then load fuel."

I mean, there's a tiny bit of what I would call construction lift following HFT, and it's for the support systems and the little bit associated with nuclear fuel.

When you think about the remaining systems between, say, hot functional and fuel load, everyone of those remaining 50 systems are over 90% complete. So it's not like we're starting from ground zero.

So I just kind of have a thought about you guys and about where the industry is going. And Tom, you and I go way back as far as the industry.

And then you've had companies like Kentucky Utilities and other companies with lower rates that traded at a premium. 
So fast forward to now and fast forward to what the Biden administration is proposing and where the industry is headed. Now you have very high rates in the Northeast, mainly T&D companies that really don't have any levers to reduce their rates or to keep rates flat. But then I look at like Southern Company, again, we've got to get through this nuclear plant build. But once that is done, can you maybe talk about -- and you had at a very high level, but the opportunity to transform your fleet. And obviously, you've talked about that, but maybe the cost savings around that, the opportunity there. And what will happen to your electric rates longer-term relative to other parts of the country, and also basically, what that will do longer term, again, I'm thinking longer term for your growth opportunities?"

I think the wisdom of the integrated regulated model will bear fruit significantly as we consider some of these issues. In the so-called organized markets, there is very little control as to constructing an optimal portfolio, number one. Number two, when you think about the portfolio, we should consider that it includes transmission. Number three, I think the fact that part of the secret sauce here is reconfiguring the portfolio absent coal. Coal carries with it a whole lot of O&M. 
And so not only is there optionality in terms of the generation and transmission we will provide, I think by our planning processes, we can do that in a way that's much more orderly and effective and efficient than the organized market. And then finally, when you consider the O&M that could be freed up, by closing down some of these O&M intensive facilities like coal plants, we have the ability to use that O&M to keep rates lower than you'll find elsewhere in the country certainly even compared to those companies that are just wires only. Their ability to deliver the kind of price shock absorbers doesn't exist because they will be takers of cost from the market. 
So I can assure you that we've already been talking about these issues with our regulators, with our stockholders -- I mean, our stakeholders.

Drew and I will cover our usual business updates in a few moments, but first, let me provide a date on Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Unit 3 hot functional testing is complete. Through testing, we have validated the operation of critical primary and secondary systems at full temperature and pressure and demonstrated that the design basis is sound. The completion of hot functional testing marks the last major milestone before fuel load and represents a significant step towards placing Unit 3 in service. Though the duration of high functional testing was longer than we originally anticipated, we remain committed to getting it right for all aspects of the project. 
Taking into account the length of hot functional testing for Unit 3, the remaining activities for both units and recent productivity trends, we now project placing Unit 3 in service during the second quarter of 2022, and Unit 4 in service during the first quarter of 2023. 
From a cost perspective, Georgia Power's share of the total project capital cost forecast increased by $460 million, largely driven by our updated schedule, recent productivity trends and replenishment of contingency to fund expected future risks. As a result, Georgia Power recorded an after-tax charge of $343 million during the second quarter. With Unit 3 hot functional testing complete, our next and final major milestone for Unit 3 is fuel load. We project fuel load to occur sometime near year-end 2021 or early in 2022. As we approach fuel load, our commitment to get it right remains our top priority. As the operator of these units, safety is our paramount objective and we strive to meet first-time quality standards prior to significant testing and operations activities. We will not sacrifice those commitments to meet schedule or milestone dates. 
The scope and time required for the work remain to prior to fuel load includes: one, completion of the nuclear fuel systems and the associated documentation, or paper, as I referred to it in the past. Two, completion of remediation work and additional work identified during hot functional testing. Three, completion of the work necessary to implement our plant support systems. And four, a reduction in productivity levels consistent with recent site performance. The Unit 3 ITAAC's middle and review process is ongoing and continues to follow our construction and testing activities on site. To date, 208 ITAAC have been submitted to the NRC. We will submit the remaining 191 as we approach fuel load. Recently,  the Nuclear Regulatory Commission conducted a special inspection of electrical quality issues that we had identified earlier this year and the remediation efforts that are underway. The on-site inspection is complete, and we expect the NRC's report to be published within a couple of months, though that exact timing will, of course, be determined by the NRC. 
Turning to Unit 4. Direct construction is now approximately 84% complete, and we achieved initial energization in May. Our revised construction productivity assumptions are consistent with recent trends. And as I mentioned, we now project an in-service date during the first quarter of 2023 for Unit 4. Our updated time line for Unit 4 is reflective of several factors. First, Unit 4 has experienced a slower-than-expected recovery from our COVID-19-related staffing reductions in early 2020. Recall, at the time the staffing reduction disproportionately impacted Unit 4 as we shifted our focus to Unit 3 critical path work front. Recall, we reduced the density of personnel on the site and effectively moved people from Unit 4 to Unit 3. Second, Unit 3's time line leading up to enduring hot functional testing delayed our plans to transition resources to Unit 4. More recently, we have staffed Unit 4 independently as work on Unit 3 continues. And third, over the past 3 months, the growing economy and demand for skilled labor has impacted our ability to attract and retain electricians. And as a result, we experienced higher-than-expected attrition. Attaining the necessary levels of craft labor to meet construction milestones for Unit 4 has been more challenging than expected. In recent weeks, we have seen positive staffing trends, driven in part by offering the enhanced electrician compensation, which has helped to mitigate further schedule impacts. Construction completion for Unit 4 has averaged 1.4% per month since the start of this year. To achieve in November 2022 in-service, we estimate Unit 4 would need to average 1.9% construction completion per month. And to support a first quarter 2023 in-service, Unit 4 would need to average construction completion of approximately 1.3% per month for the rest of this year. 
Looking now at costs, the $460 million pretax charge recorded during the second quarter reflects the scheduled updates for both units including updated assumptions for construction activity and support resources as well as replenishing the contingency for potential cost risk associated with completing both units. 
In conclusion, while the timing of Unit 3 hot functional testing took longer than originally expected, I am encouraged by the success of the test. Even so, with completion of this enormous milestone, we still have a lot of important work ahead of us to get to fuel load. For Unit 4,  we are focused on progressing through the next several milestones while continuing to navigate through the COVID-19 pandemic and broader economic recovery efforts that have impacted productivity at both sites. 
As a company and a management team, we remain focused on bringing Vogtle Units 3 in 4 safely online to provide Georgia with a reliable, carbon-free energy resource for the next 60 to 80 years. As always, I want to thank our employees, contractors, co-owners and community partners for their unwavering dedication to this important statewide project. 
Drew, I'll turn it over to you now for an update on the financials."

I hope you all are well. First, I want to touch on the financial impacts of today's Vogtle update. We continue to be very committed to credit quality for both Georgia Power and Southern Company. Therefore, Southe",816,"Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. I hope you all are well. First, I want to touch on the financial impacts of today's Vogtle update. We continue to be very committed to credit quality for both Georgia Power and Southern Company. Therefore, Southern Company will contribute capital down to Georgia Power to maintain its target capital structure and credit profile. We expect to fund the cash need at the parent company as it is incurred by reinstating new issuances under our internal equity plans, primarily the dividend reinvestment plan. which is expected to produce approximately $400 million over the next year. Importantly, with this financing strategy, we expect to maintain Southern Company's credit profile with consolidated credit metrics above current downgrade thresholds. This has a de minimis impact on earnings given our size, and we continue to see our long-term EPS growth rate in the 5% to 7% range, and we are also reiterating our 2024 projected EPS range of $4 to $4.30. 
Turning now to earnings. We had strong performance in the second quarter of 2021 with adjusted earnings per share of $0.84, $0.06 higher than both last year's second quarter and our estimate. Recall in the second quarter of last year, we were experiencing the peak impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our kilowatt hour sales. This peak was primarily related to shelter-in-place mandates in working remote. And in response, we implemented significant cost savings initiatives. Therefore, it is no surprise that the primary drivers of our quarterly earnings this year as compared to last year, were increased customer usage at our state-regulated utilities, coupled with strong customer growth in the Southeast as well as constructive state regulatory actions. As you would expect, with rising kilowatt hour sales versus last year, our nonfuel O&M was higher due to increased maintenance and planned outages that are generating units.  Weather impacts for the quarter were negligible year-over-year. 
When looking at adjusted EPS as compared to our estimates for the quarter, the main drivers of the increased earnings were customer growth that remains higher than our expectation, new connects are exceeding forecast by 25% and continued expense discipline. 
Year-to-date through June 2021, adjusted EPS is higher by $0.26 compared to the first 6 months of last year. Drivers are similar to those for the second quarter, increased usage, stronger customer growth, constructive state regulatory actions and are partially offset by higher nonfuel O&M. Year-to-date, weather impacts were $0.08 favorable compared to the prior year and $0.05 unfavorable as compared to normal. A detailed reconciliation of these reported an adjusted quarterly and year-to-date results as compared to 2020 are included in today's release and the earnings package. 
Turning to the economies in our service territory. We continue to see significant improvement from the lows we were experiencing at this time last year related to the pandemic. In the second quarter, weather-normal retail sales in aggregate were up by 6% compared to last year, with commercial and industrial segments up sharply and modest declines in residential sales. We have been analyzing retail sales compared to pre-COVID levels to assess recovery relative to historical norms, and early data indicate that, in aggregate, our retail sales have recovered to between 97% and 98% of 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Sales in the residential segment remained elevated due to continued hybrid working while industrial and commercial sales remain slightly below the 2019 comparable, something like 97% of the 2019 level. 
In the industrial segment, we are seeing strong momentum across nearly all subsegments. Commercial sales are also improving, though sales may be -- may take longer to reach historical norms. As the COVID-19 Delta variant becomes more widespread in the service territories, we will closely monitor for any signs of change but have yet to see any material impacts. Underpinning these positive sales trends is a strong labor market, evidenced by shrinking unemployment rates that are below 4% in both Georgia and Alabama. In addition, customer growth remains robust with new connects significantly outpacing our expectations across the electric utilities, reflecting construction new homes as well as new commercial businesses and continued in-net migration. 
Economic development continues to be very active in the Southeast. In Georgia alone, there are over 200 active projects with the potential to bring over 30,000 jobs in the coming years. Capital investment and job announcements are far outpacing what we experienced even before the pandemic. These are positive signals for continued improvement in both customer growth and sales. 
With our solid adjusted results through the first half of the year, we are well positioned as we head into the peak electric load season. Our estimate for the third quarter of 2021 is $1.22 per share on an adjusted basis, and consistent with historical practice, we will address earnings for the year relative to this EPS guidance after the third quarter. With that, Tom, I'll turn it back to you."

We understand that Vogtle News often dominates our earnings calls, but I think it's important that we also focus on the terrific performance we see across our businesses. As Drew highlighted, our adjusted financial results through the first half are outstanding. And operationally, we are performing well. We have already endured a tropical storm in Georgia earlier this summer, and our system has demonstrated resilience during the extreme temperatures experienced throughout this week in the Southeast. 
I would like to mention one more topic before we take your questions. Five years ago this month, we closed on our acquisition of AGL Resources, now known as Southern Company Gas. Our objective with the transaction was to deliver even greater customer and shareholder value by continuing to invest in high-quality, predominantly state-regulated utility assets. And we have done just that. We bolstered investment at the regulated gas utilities, continued to strengthen the position of our retail natural gas franchise in Georgia and divested nonregulated assets. 
Over the past 5 years, Southern Company Gas has one, increased its J.D. Power customer satisfaction scores; two, increased its regulated business mix to 90%; and three, increased its authorized equity ratios to 55%; four, increase our annual growth in-rate base by 14% -- by an average of 14% annually; fifth, raised $3 billion from the sale of nonstrategic assets, some at all-time high PE multiples and reduce risk by selling assets like the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Sequent asset management business; and then seven, all while increasing opportunities for talented leaders to take on new and important roles across the Southern Company enterprise. A great example of that is sitting right next to me, Drew Evans, our Chief Financial Officer, is doing a terrific job, and his breadth of experience and engaging thought process has helped us all. 
In summary,  the acquisition has far exceeded our own expectations. The positive results at our gas business are indicative of the approach we take across all of our businesses and to the 9 million customers and communities we are privileged to serve. This approach best positions our state regulated utility-centric business model for the future as we seek to maximize our return to shareholders on a risk-adjusted basis. Once again, I want to thank everyone for being with us this afternoon.

Number one is everything is progressing right now as we said it would. In other words, now that we've completed HFT, effectively, we take the car and lift the hood and look at the engine and see what happened. The experience in China show that there shouldn't be any big things happen. That's our experience in China. But certainly, that's an important part of work. The other thing I just want to point out because I know this has been a topic on prior calls. I just want to raise this. If you recall, I want to say it was the first unit that went through HFT in China actually had to reperform their HFT because they had significant operational issues concerning vibrations and a variety of other things. And that took over 6 months. We have passed through those issues. We learned from them. And for the issues they experienced, our plant worked great. So we are as we thought we would be. And of course, between now and fuel load, as we called out in the script, there are certainly 4 big areas we do have to work on. I love Page 5, I think, Slide 5 on the information we've given you guys this morning. You see Vogtle Unit 3 cooling tower actually have water vapor coming out of it. That was such a wonderful site to see. I was on-site, frankly, when that was going on. But look, we got -- it was heated with affluent heat from the reactor cooler pumps who performed beautifully during the test. Now we're going to heat it with nuclear fuel. So we got to put all the systems necessary to get nuclear fuel in there and use that as the heat source. Secondly, as we went through the process of starting HFT and then through HFT, we found some things we can do better to improve the long-term operation of the plant. We will do those things. And then I called this out on the last call. We call them plant support systems. But this is essentially bounce of plant activities, HVAC, potable water, some signage, things like that, that are necessary to support an operating workforce as the plant goes live. And then finally, we made an adjustment. We reduced actually our estimate of productivity of the workforce on site to more closely match our recent experience. But that's what's left to get to fuel load. All of these things represent a significant effort. But I will say that the biggest risk was getting to HFT and completing HFT in an excellent manner, and we did that."

Further, some of the quality issues we recognize, we want to make sure that we fully understood the scope of everything that we were finding so that we didn't repeat those mistakes on Unit 4, which I think we've done. At one point, during our meetings with co-owners and the NRC and the PSC staff and Dr. Jacobs and everybody that we deal with, we were seeing greater-than-expected attrition. And we really lay that out to, I think, the improving economy in the Southeast, particularly big data centers that were attracting electricians. So we actually did 2 stages of compensation increases that really arrested that. So I want to say, 1 week we hired 25 electricians and we lost like 72. And when we saw that, we were going, oh man, we got to fix that. And I think now we have. Recent experience would say that since the adjustment in June -- so this would be maybe 4 weeks of activity, we've net added now. So these are net adds, 350 people. So we have about 1,000 now, and we'd like to get to 1,200. So there's still some hiring activity going forward for Unit 4, but we feel good about our ability to do that. And the other important point here is Unit 4 now is on an independent track from Unit 3, okay? And we used to -- and in fact, in prior earnings calls, we talked about, oh, an optimal relationship is 9 months and 12 months. And we have stopped the idea. It no longer is applicable. So think about the track for Unit 3, Unit 4 is now on an independent path from Unit 3."

The other thing we're seeing is that for those that are impacted, the severity of the illness associated with the virus has been less significant, okay? One other thing I do want to say, I don't think we have a slide here that shows the progression of HFT. It took us a while to get to full temperature, flow pressure. But once we got there, the plant is running like a champion. It really has been stable. So lots of little things along the way, we fixed them. And once we got there, it's been very stable."

So these are incremental to budgets that really begin sometime next April. The sum total of those things led to the write-down that we reported today of $343 million. We are incredibly focused on credit and felt like there was a necessity to fulfill commitments that we've made to the rating agencies related to our coverage ratios in particular. And so the simplest thing for us to do is to turn on the DRIP plan, whether that's temporary or permanent, we'll just sort of monitor as we continue to monitor construction. The intent is for it to be quite temporary. But a single year of that program generates about $400 million, which I think what we've just described to you as a [indiscernible] by this expectation that's only 3/4 of what we could issue under those plans in a particular year.

So we have processes in place. All of our companies have embraced to some degree, the idea of renewables. Recall in the past, Georgia Power was cited as the Investor-Owned Utility of the Year by the solar industry. Recently, Alabama Power has embraced the idea of solar being part of their mix. Everybody has a different way to approach the problem. But I would say all of our utilities have a very constructive, effective way of addressing the problem.  And in a way where we're accountable, whether it's fuel procurement, generation, transmission, distribution, sales, we are accountable, and we work with the commission to develop optimal answers for our customers. That is the best market structure, and we've been able to do it for years, my sense will continue."

We've given you a part of a chart package, I guess, Page 11. It shows that the pre-pandemic residential is still up. So here's one of the interesting things to consider.  When we evaluate our workforce pre-pandemic, roughly 80% were kind of permanently in the office, with about 20%, maybe 25% mostly virtual, think call centers and things like that. Okay. When we've tried to analyze what the new normal will be, the numbers are changing pretty significantly, and it varies by local location. It varies by work function, but kind of wrap your head around this. I think we're going to be between 20% and 25% kind of permanently in the office with about round numbers, 50% being hybrid. Sometimes they're in the office, sometimes they're working virtually. And then we'll have that 20%, 25% completely virtually. If the rest of the world starts to follow this idea of a new normal, then I would expect residential sales to be up prior to 2019 levels. Okay. 
Industrial appears to me to be racing back to pre-COVID. So we're kind of at 98% there. And the economic development activity that we see, especially -- I mean, I'll give you one, Amazon, I think it's Amazon, is bringing 1,000 jobs and investment of $250 million. That's one. I said, if you guys watch Squadox this morning, I told him that in the economic development data, in forward-looking investment now. So this hasn't happened, but these are announced projects, versus 2020 are up 85% and versus 2019 are up 65%. So there's this burst of activity from investment. And jobs created is somewhere in the mid-20s. So what's happening? Residential may remain elevated. Industrial was going to catch up. Commercial is still a little bit of a question. We'll see. Drew, what would you state all that?"

And so we normally add something like 40,000 customers in a given year. This is largely residential. And we've probably added 3/4 of that in just the first half of this year. So net in-migration is a little bit difficult to separate from sort of use per customer, which is kind of what we represent here. But residential is at 3% higher than what we would have expected pre-pandemic. And I think as you described, that's probably here to stay. Industrial segments, we've had a couple of large industrial customers move in and out of a more global productivity or based on global economics, not a lot based on the region not being a good employer. And there are a couple of really strong sectors like automotive where there could be huge transitions that really benefit the Southeast. And so as with you, I'm very bullish on residential and industrial, in particular. Commercial is going to take a little bit longer to normalize."

I think there have been a number of interesting arguments that follow your question. One that has been a consistent difference we have had with the staff.

One that has been a consistent difference we have had with the staff. For example, it has been our dogma in doing this project to fail quickly. And so it was, I think, a big risk mitigator from our standpoint to test early, find problems and fix them before they became a bigger problem later. And also the alternative to that would have been completely construct a system and only test it kind of when everything is done. I think that would have exacerbated the [ bow wave ] of work. The criticism, well, the way you're doing it costs more money. Yes, we would agree. But I would also say, value is a function of risk and return. For the additional costs we have followed in testing early and failing early, the risk mitigation characteristics overwhelm the value. Remember, it is our posture to get it right. Okay. We found a lot of issues going in, not deal killer, not huge issues, but issues we had to deal with going into HFT, we found more during HFT and we finished HFT. We don't think we will repeat those in Unit 4. And so we'll deal with that. We did go through a very rigorous argument on Unit 4 about whether we should estimate it being completed in the first quarter or the second quarter. And I remember we came back and had another argument about it. And this is like a 2-hour, 3-hour long argument with people on the site, everybody that is involved with the project. And we landed on the first quarter. Now let's just go through the math. Ultimately, from where we are to in service, we're kind of projecting -- I guess, the fuel load, we're projecting -- no, in-service, we're projecting 16 months, okay? We've added 4 months. So adding 4 months on top of 16 is in round numbers, something like 17 -- I mean 25% or more. And so my sense is that's a good place to be. If you were to add another quarter, holy smokes, now you're in the -- you're getting near 50% contingency. And to me and the people on site, that felt like too much. So listen, we had good rigorous arguments. I think we've landed in a good spot. One of the things that we're particularly watching is -- so if you say, what is the riskiest thing you're thinking about right now? So the work ahead of us, the big work is getting the nuclear fuel ready to go to be inserted into the reactor vessel. When we look at the testing of our spent fuel pool, we found greater than acceptable leak in the pool. We tested Unit 4, and while that testing is still ongoing, we believe the Unit 4 is looking good. So this is not a design problem. We think it is a welding problem frankly, on Unit 3. And so we're undertaking a complete remake of the bed of the spent fuel pool in order to assure the floor of the pool, to assure that it will work when it's called upon. That kind of is the biggest thing in my mind right now that I know about, okay? I feel very confident that what we've learned on 3 through the HFT and how it works, we'll apply that on 4 in a good way. And I will say this, I'm sorry, I would go on here, but let me just finish with this. We completely respect the staff opinion. And we completely respect Dr. Jacobs. We respect our co-owners, anybody that has an opinion on this, they all have a point of view that is valid. I'm giving you what we think is the best answer and the best outcome. And the thing that is so beautiful about this process and anybody will talk about. Everybody sees everything. There are no secrets, there's no smoking gun. Everybody knows everything as we build this plant. I think that transparency has worked so much to our advantage."

My question is what was Steve doing on the phone? For those of you who is he's terrific.

Guy named Chick has been a hero of Southern working so hard to make this thing a success. Here's the thing I would leave you with. And I think the feedback we're getting from the analyst community is right on point. I think I'm telling you what you already know. But listen, we personally, we all -- sometimes we get frustrated with the tactics of hitting a milestone and a schedule. And the integration of the entire plant and making it work with a heat source that's not nuclear, but still making it work as it did was prolonged and frustrating at times. But you know what, once we got it solved and once we got the plant at pressure, at temperature, it worked great, and it was very stable. So we fix those things. And we continue to work hard to make sure we don't repeat them on 4. Still a good bit of work ahead between now and fuel load. I think we've outlined that carefully for you. And so we look forward to getting the fuel load for Unit 3. Unit 4, for the kind of productivity that we have suggested to you, let's just deal with the percent complete per month. So the 1.9 to 1.3 right, 1.9 to 1.3, we have done already at Unit 4, 1.4, and we have done kind of the 1.9 level on Unit 3 for 7 to 9 months at time. So these are levels we have done in the past. In the estimate we have given you, we have estimated, however, lower productivity. That's to give ourselves a little more margin on cost and schedule. So we're trying to be sensitive to really hit these numbers. 
Outside of Vogtle, we're very excited about the progress. But outside of Vogtle, this franchise, whether we're transitioning the fleet to a low-carbon future, whether we're running the business to make it more resilient to extreme weather or attacks in the cyber and physical realm to preserve our national security, we are doing great. And we will continue to do great. And so we're making progress on all of those functional fronts. 
Last thing I'll just mention. When I think about our DE&I efforts, when I think about diversity and when I think about the improvement of culture. We mentioned to bringing Southern Company Gas into the fold, I guess, bringing AGL in the fold now becoming Southern Company Gas, we have cross-populated. Southern Company Gas now run by Kim Green, Drew Evans is over here, being CFO at Southern. The cross population, the learning has strengthened our culture and increased, if you will, our cultural bandwidth. This company is better off in the long run for all of these efforts. And I think now when we renewed our efforts on diversity and inclusion, we'll be even better. So thank you. Exciting day today, and look forward to talking with you in the future. Thanks, everyone, for listening."

Unit 3 hot functional testing is complete. Through te",972,"Thank you, Scott. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today. Drew and I will cover our usual business updates in a few moments, but first, let me provide an update on Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Unit 3 hot functional testing is complete. Through testing, we have validated the operation of critical primary and secondary systems at full temperature and pressure and demonstrated that the design basis is sound. 
The completion of hot functional testing marks the last major milestone before fuel load and represents a significant step towards placing Unit 3 in service. Though the duration of high functional testing was longer than we originally anticipated, we remain committed to getting it right for all aspects of the project.  
Taking into account the length of hot functional testing for Unit 3, the remaining activities for both units and recent productivity trends, we now project placing Unit 3 in service during the second quarter of 2022, and Unit 4 in service during the first quarter of 2023.  
From a cost perspective, Georgia Power's share of the total project capital cost forecast increased by $460 million, largely driven by our updated schedule, recent productivity trends and replenishment of contingency to fund expected future risks. As a result, Georgia Power recorded an after-tax charge of $343 million during the second quarter. 
With Unit 3 hot functional testing complete, our next and final major milestone for Unit 3 is fuel load. We project fuel load to occur sometime near year-end 2021 or early in 2022. As we approach fuel load, our commitment to get it right remains our top priority. As the operator of these units, safety is our paramount objective and we strive to meet first-time quality standards prior to significant testing and operations activities.  We will not sacrifice those commitments to meet schedule or milestone dates.  
The scope and time required for the work remain to prior to fuel load includes: one, completion of the nuclear fuel systems and the associated documentation, or paper, as I referred to it in the past. Two, completion of remediation work and additional work identified during hot functional testing. Three, completion of the work necessary to implement our plant support systems. And four, a reduction in productivity levels consistent with recent site performance. 
The Unit 3 ITAAC's middle and review process is ongoing and continues to follow our construction and testing activities on site. To date, 208 ITAAC have been submitted to the NRC. We will submit the remaining 191 as we approach fuel load. Recently,  the Nuclear Regulatory Commission conducted a special inspection of electrical quality issues that we had identified earlier this year and the remediation efforts that are underway. The on-site inspection is complete, and we expect the NRC's report to be published within a couple of months, though that exact timing will, of course, be determined by the NRC.  
Turning to Unit 4. Direct construction is now approximately 84% complete, and we achieved initial energization in May. Our revised construction productivity assumptions are consistent with recent trends. And as I mentioned, we now project an in-service date during the first quarter of 2023 for Unit 4. Our updated time line for Unit 4 is reflective of several factors. 
First, Unit 4 has experienced a slower-than-expected recovery from our COVID-19-related staffing reductions in early 2020. Recall, at the time the staffing reduction disproportionately impacted Unit 4 as we shifted our focus to Unit 3 critical path work front. Recall, we reduced the density of personnel on the site and effectively moved people from Unit 4 to Unit 3. 
Second, Unit 3's time line leading up to enduring hot functional testing delayed our plans to transition resources to Unit 4. More recently, we have staffed Unit 4 independently as work on Unit 3 continues. 
And third, over the past 3 months, the growing economy and demand for skilled labor has impacted our ability to attract and retain electricians. And as a result, we experienced higher-than-expected attrition. Attaining the necessary levels of craft labor to meet construction milestones for Unit 4 has been more challenging than expected. In recent weeks, we have seen positive staffing trends, driven in part by offering the enhanced electrician compensation, which has helped to mitigate further schedule impacts. 
Construction completion for Unit 4 has averaged 1.4% per month since the start of this year. To achieve in November 2022 in-service, we estimate Unit 4 would need to average 1.9% construction completion per month. And to support a first quarter 2023 in-service, Unit 4 would need to average construction completion of approximately 1.3% per month for the rest of this year.  
Looking now at costs, the $460 million pretax charge recorded during the second quarter reflects the scheduled updates for both units including updated assumptions for construction activity and support resources as well as replenishing the contingency for potential cost risk associated with completing both units.  
In conclusion, while the timing of Unit 3 hot functional testing took longer than originally expected, I am encouraged by the success of the test. Even so, with completion of this enormous milestone, we still have a lot of important work ahead of us to get to fuel load. 
For Unit 4,  we are focused on progressing through the next several milestones while continuing to navigate through the COVID-19 pandemic and broader economic recovery efforts that have impacted productivity at both sites.  
As a company and a management team, we remain focused on bringing Vogtle Units 3 and 4 safely online to provide Georgia with a reliable, carbon-free energy resource for the next 60 to 80 years. As always, I want to thank our employees, contractors, co-owners and community partners for their unwavering dedication to this important statewide project.  
Drew, I'll turn it over to you now for an update on the financials."

I hope you all are well. First, I want to touch on the financial impacts of today's Vogtle update. We continue to be very committed to credit quality for both Georgia Power and Southern Company. Therefore, Southe",816,"Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. I hope you all are well. First, I want to touch on the financial impacts of today's Vogtle update. We continue to be very committed to credit quality for both Georgia Power and Southern Company. Therefore, Southern Company will contribute capital down to Georgia Power to maintain its target capital structure and credit profile. 
We expect to fund the cash need at the parent company as it is incurred by reinstating new issuances under our internal equity plans, primarily the dividend reinvestment plan. which is expected to produce approximately $400 million over the next year. Importantly, with this financing strategy, we expect to maintain Southern Company's credit profile with consolidated credit metrics above current downgrade thresholds. This has a de minimis impact on earnings given our size, and we continue to see our long-term EPS growth rate in the 5% to 7% range, and we are also reiterating our 2024 projected EPS range of $4 to $4.30.  
Turning now to earnings. We had strong performance in the second quarter of 2021 with adjusted earnings per share of $0.84, $0.06 higher than both last year's second quarter and our estimate. Recall in the second quarter of last year, we were experiencing the peak impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our kilowatt hour sales. This peak was primarily related to shelter-in-place mandates in working remote. 
And in response, we implemented significant cost savings initiatives. Therefore, it is no surprise that the primary drivers of our quarterly earnings this year as compared to last year, were increased customer usage at our state-regulated utilities, coupled with strong customer growth in the Southeast as well as constructive state regulatory actions. As you would expect, with rising kilowatt hour sales versus last year, our nonfuel O&M was higher due to increased maintenance and planned outages that are generating units.  Weather impacts for the quarter were negligible year-over-year.  
When looking at adjusted EPS as compared to our estimates for the quarter, the main drivers of the increased earnings were customer growth that remains higher than our expectation, new connects are exceeding forecast by 25% and continued expense discipline.  
Year-to-date through June 2021, adjusted EPS is higher by $0.26 compared to the first 6 months of last year. Drivers are similar to those for the second quarter, increased usage, stronger customer growth, constructive state regulatory actions and are partially offset by higher nonfuel O&M. Year-to-date, weather impacts were $0.08 favorable compared to the prior year and $0.05 unfavorable as compared to normal. A detailed reconciliation of these reported an adjusted quarterly and year-to-date results as compared to 2020 are included in today's release and the earnings package.  
Turning to the economies in our service territory. We continue to see significant improvement from the lows we were experiencing at this time last year related to the pandemic. In the second quarter, weather-normal retail sales in aggregate were up by 6% compared to last year, with commercial and industrial segments up sharply and modest declines in residential sales. We have been analyzing retail sales compared to pre-COVID levels to assess recovery relative to historical norms, and early data indicate that, in aggregate, our retail sales have recovered to between 97% and 98% of 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Sales in the residential segment remained elevated due to continued hybrid working while industrial and commercial sales remain slightly below the 2019 comparable, something like 97% of the 2019 level.  
In the industrial segment, we are seeing strong momentum across nearly all subsegments. Commercial sales are also improving, though sales may be -- may take longer to reach historical norms. As the COVID-19 Delta variant becomes more widespread in the service territories, we will closely monitor for any signs of change but have yet to see any material impacts. 
Underpinning these positive sales trends is a strong labor market, evidenced by shrinking unemployment rates that are below 4% in both Georgia and Alabama. In addition, customer growth remains robust with new connects significantly outpacing our expectations across the electric utilities, reflecting construction new homes as well as new commercial businesses and continued in-net migration.  
Economic development continues to be very active in the Southeast. In Georgia alone, there are over 200 active projects with the potential to bring over 30,000 jobs in the coming years. Capital investment and job announcements are far outpacing what we experienced even before the pandemic. These are positive signals for continued improvement in both customer growth and sales.  
With our solid adjusted results through the first half of the year, we are well positioned as we head into the peak electric load season. Our estimate for the third quarter of 2021 is $1.22 per share on an adjusted basis, and consistent with historical practice, we will address earnings for the year relative to this EPS guidance after the third quarter. With that, Tom, I'll turn it back to you."

We understand that Vogtle news often dominates our earnings calls, but I think it's important that we also focus on the terrific performance we see across our businesses. As Drew highlighted, our adjusted financial results through the first half are outstanding. And operationally, we are performing well. We have already endured a tropical storm in Georgia earlier this summer, and our system has demonstrated resilience during the extreme temperatures experienced throughout this week in the Southeast. 
I would like to mention one more topic before we take your questions. Five years ago this month, we closed on our acquisition of AGL Resources, now known as Southern Company Gas. Our objective with the transaction was to deliver even greater customer and shareholder value by continuing to invest in high-quality, predominantly state-regulated utility assets. And we have done just that. We bolstered investment at the regulated gas utilities, continued to strengthen the position of our retail natural gas franchise in Georgia and divested nonregulated assets. 
Over the past 5 years, Southern Company Gas has, one, increased its J.D. Power customer satisfaction scores; two, increased its regulated business mix to 90%; three, increased its authorized equity ratios to 55%; four, increase our annual growth in-rate base by 14% -- by an average of 14% annually; fifth, raised $3 billion from the sale of nonstrategic assets, some at all-time high PE multiples and reduce risk by selling assets like the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Sequent asset management business; and then seven, all while increasing opportunities for talented leaders to take on new and important roles across the Southern Company enterprise. A great example of that is sitting right next to me, Drew Evans, our Chief Financial Officer, is doing a terrific job, and his breadth of experience and engaging thought process has helped us all. 
In summary,  the acquisition has far exceeded our own expectations. The positive results at our gas business are indicative of the approach we take across all of our businesses and to the 9 million customers and communities we are privileged to serve. This approach best positions our state regulated utility-centric business model for the future as we seek to maximize our return to shareholders on a risk-adjusted basis. Once again, I want to thank everyone for being with us this afternoon. 
Operator, we'll go ahead and open the floor for questions."

Number one is everything is progressing right now as we said it would. In other words, now that we've completed HFT, effectively, we take the car and lift the hood and look at the engine and see what happened. 
The experience in China show that there shouldn't be any big things happen. That's our experience in China. But certainly, that's an important part of work. The other thing I just want to point out because I know this has been a topic on prior calls. I just want to raise this. 
If you recall, I want to say it was the first unit that went through HFT in China actually had to reperform their HFT because they had significant operational issues concerning vibrations and a variety of other things. And that took over 6 months. We have passed through those issues. We learned from them. And for the issues they experienced, our plant worked great. 
So we are as we thought we would be. And of course, between now and fuel load, as we called out in the script, there are certainly 4 big areas we do have to work on. I love Page 5, I think, Slide 5 on the information we've given you guys this morning. You see Vogtle Unit 3's cooling tower actually have water vapor coming out of it. That was such a wonderful site to see. I was on-site, frankly, when that was going on. 
But look, we got -- it was heated with affluent heat from the reactor cooler pumps who performed beautifully during the test. Now we're going to heat it with nuclear fuel. So we got to put all the systems necessary to get nuclear fuel in there and use that as the heat source. Secondly, as we went through the process of starting HFT and then through HFT, we found some things we can do better to improve the long-term operation of the plant. We will do those things. 
And then I called this out on the last call. We call them plant support systems. But this is essentially bounce of plant activities, HVAC, potable water, some signage, things like that, that are necessary to support an operating workforce as the plant goes live. 
And then finally, we made an adjustment. We reduced actually our estimate of productivity of the workforce on site to more closely match our recent experience. But that's what's left to get to fuel load. All of these things represent a significant effort. But I will say that the biggest risk was getting to HFT and completing HFT in an excellent manner, and we did that."

Further, some of the quality issues we recognize, we want to make sure that we fully understood the scope of everything that we were finding so that we didn't repeat those mistakes on Unit 4, which I think we've done. 
At one point, during our meetings with co-owners and the NRC and the PSC staff and Dr. Jacobs and everybody that we deal with, we were seeing greater-than-expected attrition. And we really lay that out to, I think, the improving economy in the Southeast, particularly big data centers that were attracting electricians. So we actually did 2 stages of compensation increases that really arrested that. 
So I want to say, 1 week we hired 25 electricians and we lost like 72. And when we saw that, we were going, oh man, we got to fix that. And I think now we have. Recent experience would say that since the adjustment in June -- so this would be maybe 4 weeks of activity, we've net added now. So these are net adds, 350 people. 
So we have about 1,000 now, and we'd like to get to 1,200. So there's still some hiring activity going forward for Unit 4, but we feel good about our ability to do that. And the other important point here is Unit 4 now is on an independent track from Unit 3, okay? And we used to -- and in fact, in prior earnings calls, we talked about, oh, an optimal relationship is 9 months and 12 months. And we have stopped the idea. It no longer is applicable. So think about the track for Unit 3, Unit 4 is now on an independent path from Unit 3."

So yes, it is picking up. The other thing we're seeing is that for those that are impacted, the severity of the illness associated with the virus has been less significant, okay? One other thing I do want to say, I don't think we have a slide here that shows the progression of HFT. It took us a while to get to full temperature, full pressure. But once we got there, the plant is running like a champion. It really has been stable. So lots of little things along the way, we fixed them. And once we got there, it's been very stable."

So when I say paper, it's actually a big deal, and I've said that in the past 3 or 4 calls, what a big deal it was, and it has been a big deal. So we put in processes in place to improve that effort.

Maybe I can give you a couple of -- sort of boundaries on this. I understand that what we'll experience or what we just reported in terms of increased cost, we won't actually experience until we start to move later into construction. So these are incremental to budgets that really begin sometime next April. The sum total of those things led to the write-down that we reported today of $343 million. 
We are incredibly focused on credit and felt like there was a necessity to fulfill commitments that we've made to the rating agencies related to our coverage ratios in particular. And so the simplest thing for us to do is to turn on the DRIP plan, whether that's temporary or permanent, we'll just sort of monitor as we continue to monitor construction. The intent is for it to be quite temporary. 
But a single year of that program generates about $400 million, which I think what we've just described to you as a divot by this expectation that's only 3/4 of what we could issue under those plans in a particular year. But I would say that our single biggest purpose for this is that we have made commitments to rating agencies and to bondholders to maintain credit through construction, and that is our singular intent."

So we have processes in place. All of our companies have embraced to some degree, the idea of renewables. Recall in the past, Georgia Power was cited as the Investor-Owned Utility of the Year by the solar industry. Recently, Alabama Power has embraced the idea of solar being part of their mix. Everybody has a different way to approach the problem.

So Paul, let Drew and I double team this because I think each -- he brings a different perspective than me. But we've given you a part of a chart package, I guess, Page 11. It shows that the pre-pandemic residential is still up. So here's one",331,"Yes, yes. So Paul, let Drew and I double team this because I think each -- he brings a different perspective than me. But we've given you a part of a chart package, I guess, Page 11. It shows that the pre-pandemic residential is still up. 
So here's one of the interesting things to consider.  When we evaluate our workforce pre-pandemic, roughly 80% were kind of permanently in the office, with about 20%, maybe 25% mostly virtual, think call centers and things like that. Okay. When we've tried to analyze what the new normal will be, the numbers are changing pretty significantly, and it varies by local location. 
It varies by work function, but kind of wrap your head around this. I think we're going to be between 20% and 25% kind of permanently in the office with about round numbers, 50% being hybrid. Sometimes they're in the office, sometimes they're working virtually. And then we'll have that 20%, 25% completely virtually. If the rest of the world starts to follow this idea of a new normal, then I would expect residential sales to be up prior to 2019 levels. Okay. 
Industrial appears to me to be racing back to pre-COVID. So we're kind of at 98% there. And the economic development activity that we see, especially -- I mean, I'll give you one, Amazon, I think it's Amazon, is bringing 1,000 jobs and investment of $250 million. That's one. I said, if you guys watch Squawk Box this morning, I told him that in the economic development data, in forward-looking investment now. 
So this hasn't happened, but these are announced projects, versus 2020 are up 85% and versus 2019 are up 65%. So there's this burst of activity from investment. And jobs created is somewhere in the mid-20s. So what's happening? Residential may remain elevated. Industrial was going to catch up. Commercial is still a little bit of a question. We'll see. Drew, what would you say to all that?"

And so we normally add something like 40,000 customers in a given year. This is largely residential. And we've probably added 3/4 of that in just the first half of this year. So net in-migration is a little bit difficult to separate from sort of use per customer, which is kind of what we represent here. 
But residential is at 3% higher than what we would have expected pre-pandemic. And I think as you described, that's probably here to stay. Industrial segments, we've had a couple of large industrial customers move in and out of a more global productivity or based on global economics, not a lot based on the region not being a good employer. 
And there are a couple of really strong sectors like automotive where there could be huge transitions that really benefit the Southeast. And so as with you, I'm very bullish on residential and industrial, in particular. Commercial is going to take a little bit while -- longer to normalize."

Would you say with this hot functional testing that if they were to look at the situation now after that, given what you guys have found, how the plant performed with hot functional testing that perhaps those issues have -- would probably be diminished? If you follow my question. In other words, you mentioned that it performed very well. And I was just wondering whether or not that sort of may indicate that this quality of work issue that they were bringing up would be -- would it be as a significant issue maybe as we move forward?"
120623,1672674291,2354879,"The Southern Company, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","The Southern Company","Executives","So here's kind of my view on that. I think there have been a number of interesting arguments that follow your question. One that has been a consistent difference we have had with the staff. For example, it has been our dogma in doing this project to fail",700,"So here's kind of my view on that. I think there have been a number of interesting arguments that follow your question. One that has been a consistent difference we have had with the staff. For example, it has been our dogma in doing this project to fail quickly. And so it was, I think, a big risk mitigator from our standpoint to test early, find problems and fix them before they became a bigger problem later. 
And also the alternative to that would have been completely construct a system and only test it kind of when everything is done. I think that would have exacerbated the bow wave of work. The criticism, well, the way you're doing it costs more money. Yes, we would agree. But I would also say, value is a function of risk and return. 
For the additional costs we have followed in testing early and failing early, the risk mitigation characteristics overwhelm the value. Remember, it is our posture to get it right. Okay. We found a lot of issues going in, not deal killer, not huge issues, but issues we had to deal with going into HFT, we found more during HFT and we finished HFT. We don't think we will repeat those in Unit 4. 
And so we'll deal with that. We did go through a very rigorous argument on Unit 4 about whether we should estimate it being completed in the first quarter or the second quarter. And I remember we came back and had another argument about it. And this is like a 2-hour, 3-hour long argument with people on the site, everybody that is involved with the project. 
And we landed on the first quarter. Now let's just go through the math. Ultimately, from where we are to in service, we're kind of projecting -- I guess, the fuel load, we're projecting -- no, in-service, we're projecting 16 months, okay? We've added 4 months. So adding 4 months on top of 16 is in round numbers, something like 17 -- I mean 25% or more. 
And so my sense is that's a good place to be. If you were to add another quarter, holy smokes, now you're in the -- you're getting near 50% contingency. And to me and the people on site, that felt like too much. So listen, we had good rigorous arguments. I think we've landed in a good spot. One of the things that we're particularly watching is -- so if you say, what is the riskiest thing you're thinking about right now? 
So the work ahead of us, the big work is getting the nuclear fuel ready to go to be inserted into the reactor vessel. When we look at the testing of our spent fuel pool, we found greater than acceptable leaks in the pool. We tested Unit 4, and while that testing is still ongoing, we believe the Unit 4 is looking good. So this is not a design problem. We think it is a welding problem frankly, on Unit 3. 
And so we're undertaking a complete remake of the bed of the spent fuel pool in order to assure the floor of the pool, to assure that it will work when it's called upon. 
That kind of is the biggest thing in my mind right now that I know about, okay? I feel very confident that what we've learned on 3 through the end of HFT and how it works, we'll apply that on 4 in a good way. And I will say this, I'm sorry, I would go on here, but let me just finish with this. We completely respect the staff opinion. And we completely respect Dr. Jacobs. We respect our co-owners, anybody that has an opinion on this, they all have a point of view that is valid. 
I'm giving you what we think is the best answer and the best outcome. And the thing that is so beautiful about this process and anybody will talk about it. Everybody sees everything. There are no secrets, there's no smoking gun. Everybody knows everything as we build this plant. I think that transparency has worked so much to our advantage."

My question is what was Steve doing on the phone? For those of you who don't know Steve is, he's terrific. He is the CEO of our nuclear business, and he has direct management council oversight for the construction of Vogtle 3 and 4. And of course, there is a staff of people there. Guy named Glen Chick has been a hero of Southern working so hard to make this thing a success. 
Here's the thing I would leave you with. And I think the feedback we're getting from the analyst community is right on point. I think I'm telling you what you already know. But listen, we personally, we all -- sometimes we get frustrated with the tactics of hitting a milestone and a schedule. And the integration of the entire plant and making it work with a heat source that's not nuclear, but still making it work as it did was prolonged and frustrating at times. 
But you know what, once we got it solved and once we got the plant at pressure, at temperature, it worked great, and it was very stable. So we fix those things. And we continue to work hard to make sure we don't repeat them on 4. Still a good bit of work ahead between now and fuel load. I think we've outlined that carefully for you. 
And so we look forward to getting the fuel load for Unit 3. Unit 4, for the kind of productivity that we have suggested to you, let's just deal with the percent complete per month. So the 1.9 to 1.3 right, 1.9 to 1.3, we have done already at Unit 4, 1.4, and we have done kind of the 1.9 level on Unit 3 for 7 to 9 months at time. 
So these are levels we have done in the past. In the estimate we have given you, we have estimated, however, lower productivity. That's to give ourselves a little more margin on cost and schedule. So we're trying to be sensitive to really hit these numbers. 
Outside of Vogtle, we're very excited about the progress. But outside of Vogtle, this franchise, whether we're transitioning the fleet to a low-carbon future, whether we're running the business to make it more resilient to extreme weather or attacks in the cyber and physical realm to preserve our national security, we are doing great. And we will continue to do great. And so we're making progress on all of those functional fronts. 
Last thing I'll just mention. When I think about our DE&I efforts, when I think about diversity and when I think about the improvement of culture. We mentioned to bringing Southern Company Gas into the fold, I guess, bringing AGL in the fold now becoming Southern Company Gas, we have cross-populated. Southern Company Gas now run by Kim Green, Drew Evans is over here, being CFO at Southern. 
The cross population, the learning has strengthened our culture and increased, if you will, our cultural bandwidth. This company is better off in the long run for all of these efforts. And I think now when we renewed our efforts on diversity and inclusion, we'll be even better. So thank you. Exciting day today, and look forward to talking with you in the future. Thanks, everyone, for listening."

As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we reported strong adjusted results for the third quarter. The economies in our service territories continue to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, and in particular, customer growth continues to exceed our expectations. Given results through September, we expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be above the top end of our guidance range. Dan will share more on this in a moment.
So let's begin with an update on Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Two weeks ago, we updated our expected completion time line for both units, extending the in-service dates by 3 months. For Unit 3, following the completion of hot functional testing, we completed walkdowns of the 158 safety-related rooms within the nuclear island to assess the extent of remediation work required consistent with the electrical installation quality issues we highlighted earlier this year. The number of instances of items needing remediation found during our full assessment process, however, exceeded our estimate from July. The change in the Unit 3 schedule into the third quarter of 2022 is primarily a function of the time needed to address the full scope of the remaining remediation work, and to account for the impact on productivity resulting from higher-than-expected attrition and slower-than-expected onboarding of new electricians, field engineers and supervisors.
For Unit 4, recent progress has slowed as craft labor and support resources have been temporarily shifted to support Unit 3's completion effort. Considering this decrease in available resources over the next several months, plus recent productivity trends, we now expect Unit 4 in service during the second quarter of 2023. Importantly, with the corrective actions the site has implemented after discovery of the unit quality issues, including reinforcement of the importance of first-time quality with craft personnel and improvements to the application of Bechtel's quality program, we believe that as we turn systems over on Unit 4, the amount of remediation work required will be less than what we experienced on Unit 3.
During the third quarter, consistent with the surrounding areas, the site experienced a spike in COVID-19 cases that approached the peak of cases we experienced early in 2021. While the availability of vaccines and well-established protocols help preclude the same degree of disruption experienced during the first waves of COVID-19, the pandemic was certainly a contributing factor to overall productivity and resource availability.
For Unit 3, repairs to the spent fuel pool, system turnovers and ITaC submittals continued throughout the third quarter. Repairs to the spent fuel pool are now complete and the next major milestone for Unit 3 will be the receipt of the 103G letter from the NRC. To date, 242 ITAAC have been submitted to the NRC with 156 remaining. On Slide 7 of today's earnings call deck, we have included a forecast of the remaining ITAAC submittals required to support a projected May 2022 fuel load and third quarter 2022 projected in-service date.
Now considering our recent volume of ITAAC submittals in October, and the expected completion and turnover of significant systems in the months ahead, the site is targeting ITAAC completion earlier than what is indicated in this forecast, which would provide margin to Unit 3's remaining schedule. We expect to use the time between ITAAC completion and fuel load to finalize the non-safety-related elements of the plant and to complete any remaining prefuel load testing.
Turning now to Unit 4. Direct construction is now approximately 89% complete. Our revised projected in-service date of the second quarter 2023 reflects the temporary shift of services to Unit 3, recent productivity trends on bulk electrical work and ongoing efforts to add craft labor and nonmanual field support resources in support of first-time quality and productivity. Construction completion for Unit 4 has averaged 1.4% per month since the start of the year. To achieve a second quarter 2023 in-service date, we estimate that Unit 4 would need to average approximately 1% construction completion per month through the end of 2022.
From a cost perspective, Georgia Power's share of the total project capital cost forecast increased by $264 million, largely driven by our updated schedule, productivity consistent with recent trends, the cost of additional resources to complete the full scope for remaining work with necessary focus on quality, and the replenishment of contingency. As a result, Georgia Power recorded an after-tax charge of $197 million during the third quarter. We remain committed to the credit quality of Georgia Power and Southern Company, and we will continue to seek to maintain strong credit metrics for both entities.
Our priority is bringing unit -- Vogtle Units 3 and 4 safely online to provide Georgia with a reliable, carbon-free energy resource for the next 60 to 80 years. We are committed to taking the time to get it right and will not sacrifice safety or quality to meet schedule. At Unit 3, we are working to submit remaining ITAAC to support receipt of the 103G letter prior to fuel load and commercial operations in 2022. For Unit 4, we remain focused on attracting and retaining necessary craft labor and support resources, as well as first-time quality as we work to increase productivity and progress towards the start of open vessel testing, which is now projected by the second quarter of 2022.
Dan, I'll turn the call over now to you for an update on the financials."
120623,1684751859,2425661,"The Southern Company, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","The Southern Company","Executives","Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, all of our major subsidiaries had a solid quarter, and our adjusted consolidated earnings are trending extremely well through the third quarter. For the",860,"Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, all of our major subsidiaries had a solid quarter, and our adjusted consolidated earnings are trending extremely well through the third quarter. For the third quarter of 2021, we reported earnings per share of $1.23 on an adjusted basis, $0.01 higher than both our estimate for the quarter and our adjusted third quarter 2020 earnings per share. For the 9 months ended September 30, 2021, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.05 compared with adjusted earnings per share of $2.78 for the same period in 2020. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results is included in this morning's release and earnings package.
Major drivers for our adjusted earnings results for the third quarter of 2021 included higher retail kilowatt-hour sales at our state-regulated utilities, as we continue to see recovery from the pandemic, strong customer growth, and impacts of several constructive regulatory outcomes. Partially offsetting these impacts, nonfuel O&M reflects a trend towards more normal operating conditions relative to 2020. Milder than normal summer temperatures in the Southeast also negatively impacted earnings per share by $0.02 compared to our estimate and by $0.07 compared to the third quarter of 2020.
Turning now to customer growth. Through September, we have added over 40,000 new residential electric customers and over 20,000 residential natural gas customers across our regulated utilities. This level of customer growth has exceeded our forecast year-to-date and puts us on track to surpass last year's customer growth levels, which were also above historical norms. Customer growth continues to be driven by a strong labor market recovery, which is on track to reach pre-pandemic levels of employment in our Southeast service territory next year.
For the third quarter, weather-adjusted retail electric sales were up 3% compared to last year and were in line with our expectations. Residential sales remained higher than expected due to extended remote work practices and commercial sales showed continued improvement coming in slightly better than our forecast. Industrial electricity usage lagged other customer groups, primarily driven by production cuts from a single large customer in the Chemical segment. Absent this customer-specific event, Industrial sales have been in line with our forecast for the quarter.
We continue to analyze retail sales and in aggregate through the third quarter, our retail sales have essentially recovered to 2019 pre-pandemic levels. We are encouraged by these positive signals while we also continue to monitor the potential impacts of COVID-19 variant, supply chain constraints, and labor force participation.
The economic development pipeline in the Southeast remains robust. Job announcements and business investment in Georgia in the third quarter of 2021 were higher than pre-pandemic levels for 2019 and the average of 5 years ending 2020. In Georgia alone, there are currently over 200 active projects with the potential to bring in nearly 40,000 jobs and $13 billion in capital investment in the coming years.
Next, I'd like to provide you with an update on our outlook for the remainder of 2021. With adjusted earnings per share through September of $3.05, we expect to achieve adjusted full year earnings above the top end of our guidance range of $3.35 per share. Our estimate for the fourth quarter is $0.35 per share, which implies an estimated full year result of $3.40 on an adjusted basis.
Before turning the call back over to Tom, I'd like to follow up briefly on Tom's update on Vogtle 3 and 4. First, I want to reiterate our commitment to credit quality, which has been constant. In our last call, we reinforced that commitment by announcing we would turn on our dividend reinvestment plans in the near future. As we have done so well over the last several years, we also continue to evaluate opportunities for asset sales. Within a portfolio the size of Southern Company, we have several investments, which warrant continuous review for whether or not a better owner exists. Whether such potential transactions serve to offset our near-term equity needs or ultimately fund our long-term capital investment plans, we will remain disciplined to the benefit of equity holders and bondholders alike as we execute our financing plans.
And finally, let me briefly highlight the Vogtle Unit 3 rate adjustment stipulation that was unanimously approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission on Tuesday. Consistent with the framework the PSC established with their order for the 17th VCM process, this most recent order allows $2.1 billion of investment in Vogtle Unit 3, and the Vogtle Units 3 and 4 common facilities to be moved from the nuclear construction cost recovery tariff or NCCR into retail rate base the month after Unit 3 goes into service, where it will earn Georgia Power's full allowed rate of return. Additionally, Georgia Power will be allowed to recover the related operating expenses and depreciation on this portion of Unit 3, which is an important credit supportive aspect of the stipulation. The entire process, which struck an appropriate balance for all stakeholders, was a great affirmation of the constructive Georgia's regulatory environment.
Tom, I'll now turn the call back over to you."

Let me wrap up with an update on the Southeastern Energy Exchange Market, or SEEM, and our fleet transition. Subject to resolution of any rehearing requests, SEEM is moving forward after clearing the approval process. SEEM is a region-wide automated intra-hour platform consisting of nearly 20 entities across 11 states with the goal of more efficient bilateral trading in the Southeast. It is not an energy imbalance market or an RTO. Benefiting from robust integrated planning by the individual states, municipalities and utilities, the region represented by SEEM members scores very favorably on all important metrics compared to the RTOs across the country. SEEM will improve electric service to customers in the Southeast, a reason that is already an industry leader for customer satisfaction and reliability. The members of SEEM electricity market also provide low retail prices for residential and business customers using a mix of carbon-free energy resources similar to the rest of the country. We believe SEEM is good for our customers and we're excited to be a part of this new platform, which is expected to launch in mid-2022.
Turning now to our fleet transition. In our most recent climate report named Implementation and Action Toward Net Zero, we reaffirmed our long-term goal of achieving net 0 greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. As an important step in the transition of our fleet, earlier this month, Alabama Power and Georgia Power filed plans with their respective state environmental authorities detailing how each would comply with the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Effluent Limitation guidelines. With these expected changes and the recent retirement announcement of 2 coal units at Mississippi Power's Plant Daniel, since 2007, Southern Company will have announced total decreases in its coal generating capacity from more than 20,000 megawatts across nearly 70 generating units to less than 4,500 megawatts of coal capacity remaining at 8 generating units. This equates to a reduction of nearly 80%.
The final resolution for many of the actions outlined in the ELG compliance filings, including the exact timing of retirement and any other actions we may recommend, remains subject to the approval of our State Public Service Commission through the integrated resource planning processes or IRPs. These proceedings are intended to comprehensively address transmission and generation resource needs over the long term, which could include additional decisions regarding the future of the remaining coal units. As always, part of our planning process for transitioning these units will include placing a high priority on protecting the interest of our employees and the communities we are privileged to serve.
The transition of our generating fleet and the important regulatory proceedings that will play out over the next 9 months will significantly inform our capital investment opportunities. As we always do, we will update our capital investment plans during our fourth quarter earnings call early next year, which will include known fleet transition opportunities. It is likely that further transparency on our long-term capital plan will unfold throughout 2022, and we will update our forecast as appropriately.
Importantly, our current 2024 earnings per share base of $4 to $4.30 is based upon our current 5-year capital plan with potential incremental investments providing the opportunity to strengthen our position, both within that 2024 range and within our 5% to 7% long-term growth range.
Now before we move to the Q&A portion, which we always love here, this just came across the wires. Next week is Veterans Day, and a publication that I'm sure you all know well, Military Times came out with their Best for Vets ranking of employers. And we've typically been on the list. It shows the top 15 companies across America and it includes well-known companies like Bank of America, Booz Allen Hamilton, The Hilton Group, Johnson & Johnson and others. They just have named Southern Company, the #1 company in America that's best for vets. That included evaluations of recruiting practices, retention and support programs, and a higher emphasis on employers, who provide assistance and flexibility for individuals in the guard and the reserves.
We certainly respect the contribution that these folks make. They are a significant part of our employment base. I think amounting to over 11% of employees today. We respect their service, and we want to make sure that they have the best work environment that they could have. We are honored beyond belief to be named the #1 company in America, Best for Vets as named by the Military Times.
Thank you for joining us this afternoon. Operator, we are now ready to take questions."

But I think, as I said, to the extent there are impacts, the current capital forecast formulated our range in 2022 of $4 to $4.30, to the extent there is an increase in CapEx. Certainly, that strengthens our place within that range and the longer-term 5% to 7% growth rate.
The other thing that we should remember about rates is that as you retire coal, you free up a whole lot of O&M. We intend to use that O&M to basically allow for cost recovery, account for the incremental revenue requirements associated with new generation that will replace that and keep rates as low as possible for our customers."

So given the results at the Georgia Public Service Commission earlier this week, that will mean that rates will go into place for $2.1 billion of Unit 3 in the common facilities, earning Georgia Power's full cost of capital. If you think about it, relative to what we're earning today, that's going to add about 1/3 of cent EPS for every month. So for October, November and December relative to what you would have forecasted under current conditions, it's about 1/3 of $0.01 per month. The important thing is that $2.1 billion is not the full cost of Unit 3 in the common facilities. Of what remains, will remain earning a return under NCCR or will be deferred for future recovery with the commission. And at the same time, we'll be recovering currently the operating cost of Unit 3 and the depreciation at least associated with the $2.1 billion."

Beyond that, we still see a long-term plan, even in light of the incremental CapEx opportunities that we're alluding to where we don't need incremental equity. I think it's important point towards a post Vogtle kind of forecast period and our credit metrics out there are about 200 basis points for FFO to debt higher than they are today, and that's a position of strength for us and gives us a lot of flexibility as to how we finance our growth.

It's an important point to raise as the tides have both ebbed and flowed here, let me explain that a little bit.

It's an important point to raise as the tides have both ebbed and flowed here, let me explain that a little bit. We believe that Bechtel has had the responsibility to attract skilled personnel, skilled craft work, especially electricians, engineers, to assess the work that's being done and field site personnel, supervisory personnel to oversee the work that's going on. We have not kept pace with the requirements to advance these units in terms of attracting the people and you name the reason why we've had more attrition. I think certainly, the amount of attrition is potentially associated with the COVID response and everything else.
So we've had to do a couple of different things. We have said in the past that we were moving to delink the progress at Unit 4 from Unit 3. And so therefore, this 12-month kind of margin didn't matter. One of the ways that we serve to continue to advance Unit 3 was again to borrow personnel from Unit 4. So we didn't really want to do that, but it was a necessary move to continue to advance the work at Unit 3. Now as we finish that work, we will send those people back to Unit 4. And once again, they will be delinked. But for the period of time in which we have borrowed personnel from 4 to 3, a delay in 3 means a delay in 4. And so that has happened.
The other thing that we have done is to augment Bechtel's sourcing efforts with our own efforts. We've had a very deep engineering and construction services group in Birmingham. Our own resources that we could attract personnel. And so we have significantly augmented Bechtel's efforts to increase the flow of people necessary to promote skilled labor, electricians and field supervisory personnel. All of those things are in progress. All of those things are consistent with the new schedules we've given you.
And I will say 1 more thing. There was a lot of conversation about this. I can tell you, Chris Womack and I, in particular, were really watching the trends. If I just looked at current data, we still have margin, 6 weeks or so to Unit 3, 3 months or so to Unit 4, on the existing not extended schedules. We looked at the trend, however, and the trends to me were troubling. And so we all kind of stepped back and said, I would rather take the conservative posture of evaluating these trends and adding more time, because, frankly, we didn't believe that we had 6 months of scheduled margin left on 3 and 3 months of schedule margin left on 4. And we could have quibbled on adding a month or 2 months, we said, let's go ahead and add a quarter for both, and that's where we came out on this decision."

He attends the same meetings we attend. He sees the same stuff we see. He's a really bright guy. I think if I had to highlight something that will come under some discussion, and I think it's absolutely correct. You want to look at scheduled kind of variability at this point. We believe we see a pretty clear track to receiving the 103G letter, which allows us to load nuclear fuel, allows us to go hot on the site. There is a certain amount of work that will occur between the receipt of the letter and the actual loading of nuclear fuel. In my opinion, that work that is from 103 G receipt to loading the fuel is probably the remaining biggest risk to schedule that remains on Unit 3.
Recall, in the script, we talked about finding more remediation. And I know in some other media, we've talked about these items, none of them being deal killers and all that stuff. But there's no such thing as a little issue in nuclear. Everything we take seriously, everything must be done effectively with perfection. And so it is that time that we're looking at right now that I would say to you is probably the shared view of Dr. Jacobs in particular and us as the biggest risk to schedule that remains.
Right now, our assessment of that work -- if we get the 103G letter early, let's say, January, then I'm going to guess, and this is just a guess on my part, so don't hold me to it. But I'm going to guess there may be 6 weeks of work left from receipt of the letter to the actual loading of the fuel. If the 103G letter is delayed, then that 6 weeks reduces, because this is work that can be done in parallel with some of the other stuff that's required to get 103G. Remember, we've talked about 3 buckets of work that we identified post HFT. One bucket deals with the issues we identified during a hot functional test. The second deals is with remediation that frankly has increased since we passed the 103G letter and really was subsequent to the July call we had with you guys. The last bucket really dealt with human performance systems, HVAC, signage, a variety of other things.
So that work margin is bigger. So let me just say it again. If we get receipt of 103G kind of early, let's say, it's January, I mean, who knows? It could be as much as 6 weeks. If we get 103G later, that work time will shrink to 2 weeks or something. We'll see. Steve, that's where I think you will see a lot of discussion between us and the commission."

So Jeremy, the way to think about it, and this has really been what has occurred both in the second quarter and this most recent announcement here in the third quarter. The cost increases have really been a function of 2 things. One is the schedule itself. And so that's kind of that notion of hotel load that we talk about, right? And so for Unit 3, that is $35 million a month, I believe, and for Unit 4 about $25 million a month, and about $15 million a month for Unit 4. So for every month for each unit, that's just the infrastructure that supports construction and the cost of that. With this most recent increase, and again, much like the second quarter increase, it also came with new assumptions on the number of personnel necessary to complete the work. And so that's where that incremental cost is coming from. Both increases really represented about half pure schedule or hotel costs and the other half, personnel and productivity assumptions to complete the work."

And we keep those things just as we're talking about buying and selling, and we want to kind of keep our our Kimono closed at this point. As we see those opportunities, we'll certainly work on them. That's just another evidence of something. The other kind of good thing about buying used assets that way, as you think about transitioning the fleet, I think I said this in the past, to get to net 0 for us, we're going to have a profile in the 2040 to 2050 that will look something like 50% renewables, maybe 20% nuclear, maybe 25% natural gas, a lot of that natural gas will have CCS on it. The kind of tail end of that, the 5% remaining could be something different. It could be hydrogen, it could be a variety of other things.
Hydrogen doesn't appear to be all that viable until maybe in the 30s. You do know that the plant Alabama is building has the capability to blend hydrogen into its fuel mix. So you may see hydrogen occur in an indirect sort of way prior to the 40s and 50s. But anyway, my sense is that you're going to have a lot of opportunity to buy some natural gas. The good thing about buying used units is they may have a remaining life of 10 to 15 years. That fits in with retirement schedules that are consistent with adding more renewables. So those assets look like bridging assets and very attractive economically and important to our strategy of replacing it with renewables."

If in 3 months, we turned over 11, 17 to go. I just said 3 to 4 months. That's a little inaccurate, because all the systems are being worked on, and we're getting closer to complete all the systems. So there's probably a little bit less than that.
In order to get to 103G, we need the completion of 8 system turnovers. We have 7 to get to fuel load. So that's the delta between 103G and fuel load, and I said that can expand and contract how we think about that. Those 7 are being done in parallel with it. The 8 required to get 103G. So those are not sequential. They are parallel.
And then even after fuel load, there are some things that will continue to be worked on. I think there's like 2 systems that you can do even after fuel load. So let me just say that again. Of the 17 systems that remain to turn over, 8 are required to get 103G. 7 are required to get to fuel load, 2 can be continued to be worked on even after fuel load."

What you'll note is that there's nothing showing in November, because in order to support that schedule, you don't need any November. Our expectation is there absolutely will be some in November. In fact, I believe we've already submitted 2 since the month has begun. So everyone in November that gets completed, reduces the number that need to be completed between December and April to support 103G."

He was actually located on site. Now he's the CFO of Georgia Power. In order to give you the schedule that you saw in your package, effectively, what he did, he started with a September in-service date, we believe we have margin on that. But he started with September in-service. And then he reversed engineered back in a conservative way to say, well, this would be the ITAAC completion schedule consistent with September. We believe we have margin to that. As we get ITAAC filed in November algin say we expect to get about 20. Well, this -- the schedule we gave you indicates nothing in November, and not much work in December. We think we'll have that exceeded by a pretty good margin. And so we'll be ahead of the schedule. Well, that just suggests our belief that, in fact, there is margin to the schedule we're giving you now.
It was important in this -- the reason why we went to all this trouble was we thought you guys would want to have a way to measure our progress in hitting 103G and ultimately, fuel load. And we thought this was kind of a good way to measure our progress. So look and see how many ITAAC we file in November and December, and compare it to this schedule. And I think you'll see that I think we'll beat the schedule pretty handily at least early on, for sure."

It also deals with the industry's response to major storms. We call those national response events. And so I've kind of helped organize the national response to a hurricane or a snowstorm or what have you. Clearly, as you introduce new operating requirements into those gigantic magnitude events, we've got to make sure that we serve the interest of customers and not only get the wires up and the plants running, but restore hope to the communities we're privileged to serve.
We don't want to let any of these new requirements interfere with our ability to really serve the American economy during those times. So all of those conversations are going on right now.

As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we reported strong adjusted results for the third quarter. The economies in our service territories continue to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, and in particular, customer growth continues to exceed our expectations. Given results through September, we expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be above the top end of our guidance range. Dan will share more on this in a moment. 
So let's begin with an update on Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Two weeks ago, we updated our expected completion time line for both units, extending the in-service dates by 3 months. For Unit 3, following the completion of hot functional testing, we completed walk downs of the 158 safety-related rooms within the nuclear island to assess the extent of remediation work required consistent with the electrical installation quality issues we highlighted earlier this year. The number of instances of items needing remediation found during our full assessment process, however, exceeded our estimate from July. The change in the Unit 3 schedule into the third quarter of 2022 is primarily a function of the time needed to address the full scope of the remaining remediation work, and to account for the impact on productivity resulting from higher-than-expected attrition and slower-than-expected onboarding of new electricians, field engineers and supervisors.
For Unit 4, recent progress has slowed as craft labor and support resources have been temporarily shifted to support Unit 3's completion effort. Considering this decrease in available resources over the next several months, plus recent productivity trends, we now expect Unit 4 in service during the second quarter of 2023. Importantly, with the corrective actions the site has implemented after discovery of the unit quality issues, including reinforcement of the importance of first-time quality with craft personnel and improvements to the application of Bechtel's quality program, we believe that as we turn systems over on Unit 4, the amount of remediation work required will be less than what we experienced on Unit 3. 
During the third quarter, consistent with the surrounding areas, the site experienced a spike in COVID-19 cases that approached the peak of cases we experienced early in 2021. While the availability of vaccines and well-established protocols help preclude the same degree of disruption experienced during the first waves of COVID-19, the pandemic was certainly a contributing factor to overall productivity and resource availability.
For Unit 3, repairs to the spent fuel pool, system turnovers and ITAAC submittals continued throughout the third quarter. Repairs to the spent fuel pool are now complete and the next major milestone for Unit 3 will be the receipt of the 103G letter from the NRC. To date, 242 ITAAC have been submitted to the NRC with 156 remaining.
On Slide 7 of today's earnings call deck, we have included a forecast of the remaining ITAAC submittals required to support a projected May 2022 fuel load and third quarter 2022 projected in-service date. 
Now considering our recent volume of ITAAC submittals in October, and the expected completion and turnover of significant systems in the months ahead, the site is targeting ITAAC completion earlier than what is indicated in this forecast, which would provide margin to Unit 3's remaining schedule. We expect to use the time between ITAAC completion and fuel load to finalize the non-safety-related elements of the plant and to complete any remaining pre-fuel load testing. 
Turning now to Unit 4. Direct construction is now approximately 89% complete. Our revised projected in-service date of the second quarter 2023 reflects the temporary shift of services to Unit 3, recent productivity trends on bulk electrical work and ongoing efforts to add craft labor and nonmanual field support resources in support of first-time quality and productivity. Construction completion for Unit 4 has averaged 1.4% per month since the start of the year. To achieve a second quarter 2023 in-service date, we estimate that Unit 4 would need to average approximately 1% construction completion per month through the end of 2022. 
From a cost perspective, Georgia Power's share of the total project capital cost forecast increased by $264 million, largely driven by our updated schedule, productivity consistent with recent trends, the cost of additional resources to complete the full scope for remaining work with necessary focus on quality, and the replenishment of contingency. As a result, Georgia Power recorded an after-tax charge of $197 million during the third quarter. We remain committed to the credit quality of Georgia Power and Southern Company, and we will continue to seek to maintain strong credit metrics for both entities. 
Our priority is bringing unit -- Vogtle Units 3 and 4 safely online to provide Georgia with a reliable, carbon-free energy resource for the next 60 to 80 years. We are committed to taking the time to get it right and will not sacrifice safety or quality to meet schedule. At Unit 3, we are working to submit remaining ITAAC to support receipt of the 103G letter prior to fuel load and commercial operations in 2022. For Unit 4, we remain focused on attracting and retaining necessary craft labor and support resources, as well as first-time quality as we work to increase productivity and progress towards the start of open vessel testing, which is now projected by the second quarter of 2022. 
Dan, I'll turn the call over now to you for an update on the financials."
120623,1684751859,2425832,"The Southern Company, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","The Southern Company","Executives","Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, all of our major subsidiaries had a solid quarter, and our adjusted consolidated earnings are trending extremely well through the third quarter. For the",860,"Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, all of our major subsidiaries had a solid quarter, and our adjusted consolidated earnings are trending extremely well through the third quarter. For the third quarter of 2021, we reported earnings per share of $1.23 on an adjusted basis, $0.01 higher than both our estimate for the quarter and our adjusted third quarter 2020 earnings per share. For the 9 months ended September 30, 2021, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.05 compared with adjusted earnings per share of $2.78 for the same period in 2020. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results is included in this morning's release and earnings package.
Major drivers for our adjusted earnings results for the third quarter of 2021 included higher retail kilowatt-hour sales at our state-regulated utilities, as we continue to see recovery from the pandemic, strong customer growth, and impacts of several constructive regulatory outcomes. Partially offsetting these impacts, non-fuel O&M reflects a trend towards more normal operating conditions relative to 2020. Milder than normal summer temperatures in the Southeast also negatively impacted earnings per share by $0.02 compared to our estimate and by $0.07 compared to the third quarter of 2020. 
Turning now to customer growth. Through September, we have added over 40,000 new residential electric customers and over 20,000 residential natural gas customers across our regulated utilities. This level of customer growth has exceeded our forecast year-to-date and puts us on track to surpass last year's customer growth levels, which were also above historical norms. Customer growth continues to be driven by a strong labor market recovery, which is on track to reach pre-pandemic levels of employment in our Southeast service territory next year. 
For the third quarter, weather-adjusted retail electric sales were up 3% compared to last year and were in line with our expectations. Residential sales remained higher than expected due to extended remote work practices and commercial sales showed continued improvement coming in slightly better than our forecast. Industrial electricity usage lagged other customer groups, primarily driven by production cuts from a single large customer in the Chemical segment. Absent this customer-specific event, Industrial sales have been in line with our forecast for the quarter. 
We continue to analyze retail sales and in aggregate through the third quarter, our retail sales have essentially recovered to 2019 pre-pandemic levels. We are encouraged by these positive signals while we also continue to monitor the potential impacts of COVID-19 variant, supply chain constraints, and labor force participation. 
The economic development pipeline in the Southeast remains robust. Job announcements and business investment in Georgia in the third quarter of 2021 were higher than pre-pandemic levels for 2019 and the average of 5 years ending 2020. In Georgia alone, there are currently over 200 active projects with the potential to bring in nearly 40,000 jobs and $13 billion in capital investment in the coming years. 
Next, I'd like to provide you with an update on our outlook for the remainder of 2021. With adjusted earnings per share through September of $3.05, we expect to achieve adjusted full year earnings above the top end of our guidance range of $3.35 per share. Our estimate for the fourth quarter is $0.35 per share, which implies an estimated full year result of $3.40 on an adjusted basis.
Before turning the call back over to Tom, I'd like to follow up briefly on Tom's update on Vogtle 3 and 4. First, I want to reiterate our commitment to credit quality, which has been constant. In our last call, we reinforced that commitment by announcing we would turn on our dividend reinvestment plans in the near future. As we have done so well over the last several years, we also continue to evaluate opportunities for asset sales. Within a portfolio the size of Southern Company, we have several investments, which warrant continuous review for whether or not a better owner exists. Whether such potential transactions serve to offset our near-term equity needs or ultimately fund our long-term capital investment plans, we will remain disciplined to the benefit of equity holders and bondholders alike as we execute our financing plans.
And finally, let me briefly highlight the Vogtle Unit 3 rate adjustment stipulation that was unanimously approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission on Tuesday. Consistent with the framework the PSC established with their order for the 17th VCM process, this most recent order allows $2.1 billion of investment in Vogtle Unit 3, and the Vogtle Units 3 and 4 common facilities to be moved from the nuclear construction cost recovery tariff or NCCR into retail rate base the month after Unit 3 goes into service, where it will earn Georgia Power's full allowed rate of return.
Additionally, Georgia Power will be allowed to recover the related operating expenses and depreciation on this portion of Unit 3, which is an important credit supportive aspect of the stipulation. The entire process, which struck an appropriate balance for all stakeholders, was a great affirmation of the constructive Georgia's regulatory environment.
Tom, I'll now turn the call back over to you."

Let me wrap up with an update on the Southeastern Energy Exchange Market, or SEEM, and our fleet transition. Subject to resolution of any rehearing requests, SEEM is moving forward after clearing the approval process. SEEM is a region-wide automated intra-hour platform consisting of nearly 20 entities across 11 states with the goal of more efficient bilateral trading in the Southeast. It is not an energy imbalance market or an RTO. Benefiting from robust integrated planning by the individual states, municipalities and utilities, the region represented by SEEM members scores very favorably on all important metrics compared to the RTOs across the country. 
SEEM will improve electric service to customers in the Southeast, a reason that is already an industry leader for customer satisfaction and reliability. The members of SEEM electricity market also provide low retail prices for residential and business customers using a mix of carbon-free energy resources similar to the rest of the country. We believe SEEM is good for our customers and we're excited to be a part of this new platform, which is expected to launch in mid-2022. 
Turning now to our fleet transition. In our most recent climate report named Implementation and Action Toward Net Zero, we reaffirmed our long-term goal of achieving net 0 greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. As an important step in the transition of our fleet, earlier this month, Alabama Power and Georgia Power filed plans with their respective state environmental authorities detailing how each would comply with the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Effluent Limitation guidelines. 
With these expected changes and the recent retirement announcement of 2 coal units at Mississippi Power's Plant Daniel, since 2007, Southern Company will have announced total decreases in its coal generating capacity from more than 20,000 megawatts across nearly 70 generating units to less than 4,500 megawatts of coal capacity remaining at 8 generating units. This equates to a reduction of nearly 80%.
The final resolution for many of the actions outlined in the ELG compliance filings, including the exact timing of retirement and any other actions we may recommend, remains subject to the approval of our State Public Service Commission through the integrated resource planning processes or IRPs. These proceedings are intended to comprehensively address transmission and generation resource needs over the long term, which could include additional decisions regarding the future of the remaining coal units. As always, part of our planning process for transitioning these units will include placing a high priority on protecting the interest of our employees and the communities we are privileged to serve. 
The transition of our generating fleet and the important regulatory proceedings that will play out over the next 9 months will significantly inform our capital investment opportunities. As we always do, we will update our capital investment plans during our fourth quarter earnings call early next year, which will include known fleet transition opportunities. It is likely that further transparency on our long-term capital plan will unfold throughout 2022, and we will update our forecast as appropriately.
Importantly, our current 2024 earnings per share base of $4 to $4.30 is based upon our current 5-year capital plan with potential incremental investments providing the opportunity to strengthen our position, both within that 2024 range and within our 5% to 7% long-term growth range. 
Now before we move to the Q&A portion, which we always love here, this just came across the wires. Next week is Veterans Day, and a publication that I'm sure you all know well, Military Times came out with their Best for Vets ranking of employers. And we've typically been on the list. It shows the top 15 companies across America and it includes well-known companies like Bank of America, Booz Allen Hamilton, The Hilton Group, Johnson & Johnson and others. They just have named Southern Company, the #1 company in America that's best for vets. That included evaluations of recruiting practices, retention and support programs, and a higher emphasis on employers, who provide assistance and flexibility for individuals in the guard and the reserves. 
We certainly respect the contribution that these folks make. They are a significant part of our employment base. I think amounting to over 11% of employees today. We respect their service, and we want to make sure that they have the best work environment that they could have. We are honored beyond belief to be named the #1 company in America, Best for Vets as named by the Military Times.

But I think, as I said, to the extent there are impacts, the current capital forecast formulated our range in 2022 of $4 to $4.30, to the extent there is an increase in CapEx. Certainly, that strengthens our place within that range and the longer-term 5% to 7% growth rate. 
The other thing that we should remember about rates is that as you retire coal, you free up a whole lot of O&M.

So let's just make the assumption for the sake of describing all this, Shar, that the third quarter means September of 2022. So given the results at the Georgia Public Service Commission earlier this week, that will mean that rates will go into place for $2.1 billion of Unit 3 in the common facilities, earning Georgia Power's full cost of capital. If you think about it, relative to what we're earning today, that's going to add about 1/3 of $0.01 of EPS for every month. So for October, November and December relative to what you would have forecasted under current conditions, it's about 1/3 of $0.01 per month. The important thing is that $2.1 billion is not the full cost of Unit 3 in the common facilities. What remains -- will remain earning a return under NCCR or will be deferred for future recovery with the commission. And at the same time, we'll be recovering currently the operating cost of Unit 3 and the depreciation at least associated with the $2.1 billion."

It's an important point to raise as the tides have both ebbed and flowed here, let me explain that a little bit. We believe that Bechtel has had the responsibility to attract skilled personnel, skilled craft work, especially electricians, engineers, to assess the work that's being done and field site personnel, supervisory personnel to oversee the work that's going on. We have not kept pace with the requirements to advance these units in terms of attracting the people and you name the reason why we've had more attrition. I think certainly, the amount of attrition is potentially associated with the COVID response and everything else.
So we've had to do a couple of different things. We have said in the past that we were moving to de-link the progress at Unit 4 from Unit 3. And so therefore, this 12-month kind of margin didn't matter. One of the ways that we serve to continue to advance Unit 3 was again to borrow personnel from Unit 4. So we didn't really want to do that, but it was a necessary move to continue to advance the work at Unit 3. Now as we finish that work, we will send those people back to Unit 4. And once again, they will be de-linked. But for the period of time in which we have borrowed personnel from 4 to 3, a delay in 3 means a delay in 4. And so that has happened.
The other thing that we have done is to augment Bechtel's sourcing efforts with our own efforts. We've had a very deep engineering and construction services group in Birmingham. Our own resources that we could attract personnel. And so we have significantly augmented Bechtel's efforts to increase the flow of people necessary to promote skilled labor, electricians and field supervisory personnel. All of those things are in progress. All of those things are consistent with the new schedules we've given you.
And I will say one more thing. There was a lot of conversation about this. I can tell you, Chris Womack and I, in particular, were really watching the trends. If I just looked at current data, we still have margin, 6 weeks or so to Unit 3, 3 months or so to Unit 4, on the existing not extended schedules. We looked at the trends, however, and the trends to me were troubling. And so we all kind of stepped back and said, I would rather take the conservative posture of evaluating these trends and adding more time, because, frankly, we didn't believe that we had 6 months of scheduled margin left on 3 and 3 months of schedule margin left on 4. And we could have quibbled on adding a month or 2 months, we said, let's go ahead and add a quarter for both, and that's where we came out on this decision."

He attends the same meetings we attend. He sees the same stuff we see. He's a really bright guy. I think if I had to highlight something that will come under some discussion, and I think it's absolutely correct. You want to look at scheduled kind of variability at this point. We believe we see a pretty clear track to receiving the 103G letter, which allows us to load nuclear fuel, allows us to go hot on the site. There is a certain amount of work that will occur between the receipt of the letter and the actual loading of nuclear fuel. In my opinion, that work that is from 103G receipt to loading the fuel is probably the remaining biggest risk to schedule that remains on Unit 3.
Recall, in the script, we talked about finding more remediation. And I know in some other media, we've talked about these items, none of them being deal killers and all that stuff. But there's no such thing as a little issue in nuclear. Everything we take seriously, everything must be done effectively with perfection. And so it is that time that we're looking at right now that I would say to you is probably the shared view of Dr. Jacobs in particular and us as the biggest risk to schedule that remains.
Right now, our assessment of that work -- if we get the 103G letter early, let's say, January, then I'm going to guess, and this is just a guess on my part, so don't hold me to it. But I'm going to guess there may be 6 weeks of work left from receipt of the letter to the actual loading of the fuel. If the 103G letter is delayed, then that 6 weeks reduces, because this is work that can be done in parallel with some of the other stuff that's required to get 103G. Remember, we've talked about 3 buckets of work that we identified post HFT. One bucket deals with the issues we identified during a hot functional test. The second deals with remediation that frankly has increased since we passed the 103G letter and really was subsequent to the July call we had with you guys. The last bucket really dealt with human performance systems, HVAC, signage, a variety of other things.
So that work margin is bigger. So let me just say it again. If we get receipt of 103G kind of early, let's say, it's January, I mean, who knows? It could be as much as 6 weeks. If we get 103G later, that work time will shrink to 2 weeks or something. We'll see. Steve, that's where I think you will see a lot of discussion between us and the commission."

So Jeremy, the way to think about it, and this has really been what has occurred both in the second quarter and this most recent announcement here in the third quarter. The cost increases have really been a function of 2 things. One is the schedule itself. And so that's kind of that notion of hotel load that we talked about, right? And so for Unit 3, that is $35 million a month, I believe, and for Unit 4 about $25 million a month, and about $15 million a month for Unit 4. 
So for every month for each unit, that's just the infrastructure that supports construction and the cost of that. With this most recent increase, and again, much like the second quarter increase, it also came with new assumptions on the number of personnel necessary to complete the work. And so that's where that incremental cost is coming from. Both increases really represented about half pure schedule or hotel costs and the other half, personnel and productivity assumptions to complete the work."

So it is important for the nation. It is important for our customers to keep prices low and to provide incentives to do that. That's kind of thing one. Thing two, Dan can correct me here or whatever, but we've looked at this minimum tax proposal. And we think it doesn't have that much of an impact to us.

That's just another evidence of something. The other kind of good thing about buying used assets that way, as you think about transitioning the fleet, I think I said this in the past, to get to net 0 for us, we're going to have a profile in the 2040 to 2050 that will look something like 50% renewables, maybe 20% nuclear, maybe 25% natural gas, a lot of that natural gas will have CCS on it. The kind of tail end of that, the 5% remaining could be something different. It could be hydrogen, it could be a variety of other things.
Hydrogen doesn't appear to be all that viable until maybe in the 30s. You do know that the plant Alabama is building has the capability to blend hydrogen into its fuel mix. So you may see hydrogen occur in an indirect sort of way prior to the 40s and 50s. But anyway, my sense is that you're going to have a lot of opportunity to buy some natural gas. The good thing about buying used units is they may have a remaining life of 10 to 15 years. That fits in with retirement schedules that are consistent with adding more renewables. So those assets look like bridging assets and very attractive economically and important to our strategy of replacing it with renewables."

So there's probably a little bit less than that.
In order to get to 103G, we need the completion of 8 system turnovers. We have 7 to get to fuel load. So that's the delta between 103G and fuel load, and I said that can expand and contract how we think about that. Those 7 are being done in parallel with it. The 8 required to get 103G. So those are not sequential. They are parallel.
And then even after fuel load, there are some things that will continue to be worked on. I think there's like 2 systems that you can do even after fuel load. So let me just say that again. Of the 17 systems that remain to turn over, 8 are required to get 103G, 7 are required to get to fuel load, 2 can be continued to be worked on even after fuel load."

We always have the health and safety of our employees foremost in our minds. And I think if you look at the way we've handled the site through the epidemic, I think it's been amazing, the accomplishments that those folks have done even under restrictive protocols. We were just on a call here as we've just gotten more granularity, I guess, from OSHA about what their expectations are. 
It's 400 pages long. We're kind of diving through it. We know there are legal challenges to come. It's really too early for us to say right now, what we think the impacts will be. So I know even EEI has requested a 90-day delay. Look, there's a lot to digest right now. Let's keep our eyes on that. And just as a final thought, you folks know that I've been leading the ESCC, the Electricity Subsector Coordinating Council. I know that deals with cyber and physical threats. It also deals with the industry's response to major storms. We call those national response events. And so I've kind of helped organize the national response to a hurricane or a snowstorm or what have you. Clearly, as you introduce new operating requirements into those gigantic magnitude events, we've got to make sure that we serve the interest of customers and not only get the wires up and the plants running, but restore hope to the communities we're privileged to serve.
We don't want to let any of these new requirements interfere with our ability to really serve the American economy during those times. So all of those conversations are going on right now. And Sophie, I wish I could give you more granular stuff, but it's all just very timely conversation we're working through. I'm very confident by our next earnings call, we'll have more to say there."

And this phrase we use, ""get it right,"" is so important to us. We will always work to get it right. So thank you for your understanding and all of that.
As we move through these issues, we've had good progress. The regulatory construct we had on the first $2.1 billion at all. I think it was more evident that I think we do have a constructive working relationship. And that post Vogtle, the numbers are essentially irrefutable. I mean I think that cash flow, earnings trajectory, overall financial integrity of the company is truly outstanding, and we think warrants anyone's interest as an investment.
So thank you for your time, and we look forward to talking with you next week at EEI. Dan, any closing comments?"
