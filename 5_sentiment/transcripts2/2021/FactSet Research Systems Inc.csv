I'm pleased with our solid second quarter and overall first half results, and the investments we've made to further advance our offerings in both content and workflow solutions are resonating. Over the past 12 mon",926,"Thanks, Rima, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased with our solid second quarter and overall first half results, and the investments we've made to further advance our offerings in both content and workflow solutions are resonating. Over the past 12 months, we've proven our resilience and our ability to strengthen our value to clients, and we begin the second half of this fiscal year with good momentum, greater visibility and continued confidence in our ability to execute. Our investments in content and technology are progressing at pace, and we see market validation of our strategy with some key wins this quarter. Our content advances, particularly in deep sector, are being well received by clients, especially across the sell side, supporting workstation growth. And our focus on digital transformation allows us to offer more personalized solutions and an increasing number of ways to deliver value to clients. 
The market is looking for solutions that are both easy to integrate and unite the front, middle and back office, and we are well positioned to capitalize on this trend. Our shift to the public cloud is progressing according to plan, with the majority of our new storage and collection centers successfully migrated. This quarter, we are particularly pleased to see growth in our core workstation offering. The efforts we've made through our investment strategy are starting to drive our top line, and we delivered a strong first half due to our ability to execute on our product line with continued discipline. 
In our second quarter, our organic ASV plus professional services growth rate accelerated to 5.5%. This acceleration was led by our sales team effectively growing wallet share with existing clients as well as capturing a higher price increase in the Americas. This was partially offset by cancellations, largely across asset management firms. We're pleased that our performance resulted in increased adjusted operating margin and EPS, and we have good momentum going into our second half. We have reaffirmed our ability to deliver results within our guidance of fiscal '21 and are raising the lower end of our full year organic ASV growth range to $70 million from $55 million. Helen will explain in more detail shortly. 
Turning now to the performance in our regions. The Americas growth accelerated to 6%, driven by strong sales of workstations in research and wealth solutions and data feeds in CTS Solutions. Our research solutions had a particularly good quarter, supported by our digital transformation and the expansion of our deep sector content offering. This was evident from wins with our large existing banking clients who benefited from our tailored workflows, which allow them a more connected and personalized experience. CTS also had a successful quarter as clients bought more of our core and premium data feeds. And in wealth, we're extremely pleased with the RBC win. This was an entirely virtual rollout, and I'm proud of how quickly and seamlessly our team integrated our adviser dashboard workflow and CRM Solutions for RBC's entire wealth management team. 
Asia Pac accelerated its growth rate to 9% due to strong performance in Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia. We saw wins at institutional asset managers and data providers with our research and CTS solutions. EMEA's growth remained at 4% with wins across the region, most notably in France and the Nordics. The region benefited from increased sales of CTS and wealth solutions to asset owners and institutional asset managers as well as accelerating new business. 
Our diversifying client base continues to seek mission critical data, and we see strong demand for our growing content offering. We're pleased with the progress we are making in the ESG market as we further integrate our ESG products into clients' everyday workflows. We've already expanded our ESG content suite with the launch of True Value's UN Sustainable Development Gold Monitor. This is in addition to a new joint offering with Ping An Insurance Group, which offers ESG metrics on companies incorporated in Mainland China. 
Overall, we see a long runway for growth as we execute more enterprise-wide deals and believe that every touch point with clients today represents an opportunity to cross-sell in the future. The conversations we are having, combined with our sales team's execution make us optimistic that we will continue to grow our market share long term. 
In summary, our focus continues to be on achieving higher growth and providing clients with effective and efficient solutions across the entire investment workflow. We remain committed to our investment strategy and to living our purpose, which is to drive the investment community to see more, think bigger and do their best work. And we are starting to see the rollout of the efforts we are making. 
We continue to push ourselves to be a more diverse, inclusive and impactful organization. To that end, I'm pleased to say we recently hired our first Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer as part of our strategy to strengthen our organizational accountability increased diversity across all levels of our company and ensure workforce equity. We know we have more work to do and remain committed to furthering our efforts. 
I'm pleased with our progress as we strive to be the best place to work and give our employees the flexibility they need to thrive in the new normal. I'm proud of the ways in which we are showing up for one another and for our clients every day. With that, I'll now turn things over to Helen, who will take you through the specifics of our second quarter and first half 2021 performance."

I am proud of the FactSet team for finding new ways this past year to support both our clients and each other. Today, I will share more details on our performance to date and to provide an update to our annual outlook. 
For the first half of fiscal 2021, we grew our revenue by 6%, expanded our adjusted operating margin by 60 basis points and increased our adjusted EPS by 9% year-over-year. Our multi-year investment plan is on track and beginning to materialize in top line growth. 
Last quarter, we welcome True Value add to FactSet. I am pleased to report that the integration of the team and of the ESG technology assets is largely complete. As with our previous acquisitions, we will exclude any revenue and [indiscernible] associated with [indiscernible] while reporting out on organic related metrics for the fiscal year 2021. 
As Phil stated earlier, we improved organic ASV plus professional services by 5.5%, an acceleration from the first quarter that reflects the diligent execution of our pipeline, powered by healthy demand for workstations and data sets. Ongoing investments in our core solutions continue to resonate with clients. As reflected in our annual Americas [indiscernible] increase, which totaled $14 million, $2 million more than the prior year. As a previous years, our annual price increase was a contributor to and again this year, further accelerating our growth rate. 
For the second quarter, GAAP revenue increased by 6% to $392 million. While organic revenue, which excludes any impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and deferred revenue amortization, declined 20% to $389 million. Growth was driven primarily by our analytics and CTS solutions. 
[indiscernible] segment revenue growth for the Americas was at 7%, EMEA at 3% and Asia Pacific at 10%. All regions primarily benefited from increases in our analytics and CTS solutions. GAAP operating expenses grew 5% in the second quarter to $276 million impacted by a higher cost of sales. Compared to the previous year, our GAAP operating margin [indiscernible] by 90 basis points to 30%, and our adjusted operating margin increased by 80 basis points to 33%. These improvements were largely due to net savings from continued productivity for workforce mix and a reduction in discretionary expenses, including those related to travel, office and professional services. These benefits were partially offset by higher spend in both compensation and technology. 
As a percentage of revenue, our cost of sales was 230 basis points higher than last year on a GAAP basis and 170 basis points higher on an adjusted basis. This increase is driven by higher technology spend related to our shift to the public cloud and increased compensation expense for existing employees as well as new talent to support a multiyear investment plan. 
When expressed as a percentage of revenue, SG&A improved year-over-year by 320 basis points on a GAAP basis and 250 basis points on an adjusted basis. The primary drivers include materially lower travel and entertainment costs and reduced spend due to office closures, offset in part by higher compensation costs. These results are in line with our expectations, as noted in our full year guidance. 
As discussed on previous calls, we plan for an incremental investment spend of $15 million each year starting in 2020 through 2022. While realizing full benefits from productivity and a delayed ramp-up in hiring last year, we are on track to spend around $26 million in our fiscal FY '21. As noted on last quarter's call, we are also using a portion of the pandemic savings [indiscernible] we invest further in both sales and new product development. 
Moving on, our tax rate for the quarter was 16% compared to last year's rate of 14%, primarily due to lower tax benefits realized from stock option exercises this quarter. GAAP EPS increased 9% to $2.50 this quarter versus $2.30 in the prior year. The adjusted diluted EPS grew 7% at $2.72. Both EPS figures were largely driven by improved operating results, partially offset by higher tax rates. A reconciliation of our adjustments to GAAP EPS is disclosed at the end of our press release. 
Free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations plus capital spending, was $130 million for the quarter, an increase of 75% over the same period last year. This increase is primarily due to the timing of certain tax payments and lower capital expenditures as we have completed the majority of our office build-out. In the first quarter, our ASV retention continued to be above 95%. 
We grew our total number of clients by 7% compared to the prior year, reaching over 6,000 clients for the first time in our history. This growth reflects the addition of Royal Wealth and corporate clients as well as data providers and asset owners, an ongoing trend we continue to -- as we continue to diversify our client base. Our client retention improved to 90% year-over-year, which [indiscernible] to the mission [indiscernible] of our solutions and solid efforts of our sales teams. Our user count grew 12% year-over-year and cost of a total of $150,000, largely due to additional wealth and research workstation users. 
As noted in our press release this morning, we revised the methodology for how we define our users to capture more expansive across all our solutions. We have provided revised use accounts will [indiscernible] for the last 8 quarters at the end of the press release. 
For the second quarter, we repurchased over 221,000 shares of our common stock for a total of $72 million at an average share price of $322. Our Board of Directors recently authorized an additional $206 million to our share repurchase program, bringing our total size to $350 million, in line with recent years. We remain disciplined and a buyback program and committed to returning long-term value to our shareholders. 
Given our solid first half performance and improved visibility for the rest of the year, we are bringing up the lower end of our organic ASV post productional services growth guidance range from $55 million to $70 million. So our full range is now $70 million to $85 million. This raises our midpoint from when -- what we set first at this guidance 6 months ago. Client demand for our enhanced solutions alongside the momentum built, [indiscernible] sales team gives us greater conviction in our [indiscernible] Based on the first half results, we are encouraged by the client response to our enhanced product suite, reflected in both growth and new clients as well as increased expansion with existing clients. 
We do remain in an uncertain environment as different parts of the world begin to recover from this pandemic. Our full year views take into account our clients continue to performance in current market conditions and that additional delays in decision making and taking client budgets could impact our short-term performance. The global environment will continue to present challenges, but we believe we are well positioned for the longer term. With that, we're now ready for your questions. I'll turn this over to Joelle."

So I'd say we're on pace. We're halfway through that journey. We're already beginning to see a lot of the benefits from being in the public cloud. So that is a major piece of the move from a technology standpoint. 
I would say the second thing is opening up the platform. So providing APIs to access FactSet content and analytics, whether or not you're our clients and you want to just program directly against our database or if you want to access it through some other means through some other channel, we're making that available as well. And it should also make FactSet easier to integrate with other third party systems. So that's another important aspect of that. So overall, we're pleased. I'd say we're halfway through that original plan. We're a technology company. So of course, that never ends.

So for us, making sure that you can access ESG directly or as an overlay, whether you're a research analyst, you're a quants, maybe you want to look at your portfolios and group things a certain way or add in some metrics, we want to make sure that all of that's available through our platform. And one of the advantages, again, of using FactSet is you can seamlessly stitch together all those workflows. So we've learned a lot in terms of integration during our lifetime.

So if you're an adviser and you're managing the assets at 200 families or individuals, being able to kind of get around quickly is important. And service has been a big piece of this, Toni. So as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we were able to virtually roll out this offering to, I think, 8,000 advisers really quickly. And in some ways, doing it virtually was easier than how we might have done it 2 years ago, which would be literally to fly around to almost every city we could to train people in person. So we've learned a lot about efficiency over the last year, and that's been a good experience on both sides. So I think it's that classic FactSet combo of the product and the service that's really allowing us to win here.

And we're beginning to explore new ways of how to double down on that in terms of how we can get more of those clients at the smaller end more efficiently so that we can focus the rest of our resources on the larger, more enterprise-wide deployments."

So in terms of where we're beginning to see some of that impact, we're seeing that in our workstation growth. We're going to talk about a bit more. So the investments we're making in sector is really resonating with banking clients, for example. And in fact, some of the digital improvements we've made has been part of one of the key wins and the availability that they've got through the cloud and the integration there. 
And then when you talk about CTS as well as on the analytics front, we're seeing pick up in APIs in our signals and CRM, APIs and concordance. And then the benefit from the  cost perspective, some of the improvements we've made is helping us on the automation on content collection, for example.

We're optimistic that we'll be able to execute on our Q3 price increase in EMEA and Asia Pac, which comes after the Q2 price increase in the Americas. 
The one area of our business that slowed a little bit is analytics. It has, I think, the highest absolute ASC contribution in most years. And what's happening there, I believe, is that because of the COVID environment, these longer sales cycle, more complicated implementations are taking a little bit longer. The analytics pipeline is very healthy. It's comparable to last year. So if we're able to execute on that well, I'm optimistic about what that means in terms of ASV for the full year."

I'll touch a bit on Q2 and then talk about H2, which will be more of the same, so it might be helpful. So we've been very pleased with the improvement that we've driven year-over-year as it relates to the operating results. Part of that is clearly to higher revenue as well. But if we think about the uptick on the cost, it reflects in a couple of different ways. The increased investments that we've made in our deep sector of content collection, digital capabilities, those are coming through in higher salary and technology costs. We also have made additional hiring in sales and product development as we talked about last quarter, and that's reflected in the 8% growth in our headcount year-over-year. 
In terms of a headwind that we had this quarter, it was a bit on FX, which impacted our margin about 30, 35 basis points. And then offsetting all of that is the continued efficiencies that we're getting through the workforce mix. We moved shift again to help lower cost countries by another 1%. We've had reduced professional fees this quarter, services cost this quarter. We do expect that to pick back up in the second half. So that might be -- that is more of a timing issue. And of course, we're getting the benefit of being out of the office and [indiscernible] After this quarter, we're going to start to lap the previous year. 
So when we think about the second half, you're exactly right, Alex, we do expect costs to ramp up further. And that's in part driven by the investment plan for sure. As I mentioned in my remarks, we are -- we believe we'll have around $26 million of costs related to the investment in this year versus more like $15 million last year. And we're seeing that salary run rate start to really pick up. And a lot of the investments that we're needing are more specialized, so they tend to be a little higher cost country. So we see that pick up. Professional fees, we believe, as we're employing levers to help us on the execution implementation front that's going to pick up. And we're still having the double carrying costs between the cloud and the data centers. 
And then we also have the full absorption of the dilution from the TBL acquisition as well. We will see what kind of costs we'll have to have as relate to the  offices, hopefully, reopening as business starts to get closer to whatever that level of normal is so that could be an offset. And we continue to be focused, of course, on managing the spend and any discretionary costs that we have. So we will be focused on driving that as we have over the past 2.5 years."

More will come later, I believe, on both the products and the cost side as we complete that work. So that's one good example. 
The APIs and the endpoints that we're setting up, those are also getting some pretty good adoption, particularly in analytics. So that's a great example. And then I think when you consider some of the work we're doing with firms like Snowflake, for example, where we're able to sort of work with them and provide our data feeds and our concordance as a service, all of this is wrapped up into our digital transformation efforts.

The equation for them gets more and more complicated in terms of how do they rationalize their spend across a large number of vendors and how do they make sense out of that technology stack and how they are managing their own data throughout their workflows.

And there's a pretty short list, frankly, of firms that are able to do that for them. And FactSet is one of the funds on the shortlist. So there's some consolidation, there are other people kind of moving into the space, as you mentioned. But in terms of firms that have the number of workflows and a critical massive content for the clients, that's a pretty short list."

I'm pleased with our solid second quarter and overall first half results, and the investments we've made to further advance our offerings in both content and workflow solutions are resonating. Over the past 12 mon",925,"Thanks, Rima, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased with our solid second quarter and overall first half results, and the investments we've made to further advance our offerings in both content and workflow solutions are resonating. Over the past 12 months, we've proven our resilience and our ability to strengthen our value to clients, and we begin the second half of this fiscal year with good momentum, greater visibility and continued confidence in our ability to execute. Our investments in content and technology are progressing at pace, and we see market validation of our strategy with some key wins this quarter. Our content advances, particularly in deep sector, are being well received by clients, especially across the sell side, supporting workstation growth. And our focus on digital transformation allows us to offer more personalized solutions and an increasing number of ways to deliver value to clients. 
The market is looking for solutions that are both easy to integrate and unite the front, middle and back office, and we are well positioned to capitalize on this trend. Our shift to the public cloud is progressing according to plan, with the majority of our new storage and collection centers successfully migrated. This quarter, we are particularly pleased to see growth in our core workstation offering. The efforts we've made through our investment strategy are starting to drive our top line, and we delivered a strong first half due to our ability to execute on our product line with continued discipline. 
In our second quarter, our organic ASV plus professional services growth rate accelerated to 5.5%. This acceleration was led by our sales team effectively growing wallet share with existing clients as well as capturing a higher price increase in the Americas. This was partially offset by cancellations, largely across asset management firms. We're pleased that our performance resulted in increased adjusted operating margin and EPS, and we have good momentum going into our second half. We have reaffirmed our ability to deliver results within our guidance of fiscal '21 and are raising the lower end of our full year organic ASV growth range to $70 million from $55 million. Helen will explain in more detail shortly. 
Turning now to the performance in our regions. The Americas growth accelerated to 6%, driven by strong sales of workstations in research and wealth solutions and data feeds in CTS solutions. Our research solutions had a particularly good quarter, supported by our digital transformation and the expansion of our deep sector content offering. This was evident from wins with our large existing banking clients who benefited from our tailored workflows, which allow them a more connected and personalized experience. CTS also had a successful quarter as clients bought more of our core and premium data feeds. And in wealth, we're extremely pleased with the RBC win. This was an entirely virtual rollout, and I'm proud of how quickly and seamlessly our team integrated our adviser dashboard workflow and CRM solutions for RBC's entire wealth management team. 
Asia Pac accelerated its growth rate to 9% due to strong performance in Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia. We saw wins at institutional asset managers and data providers with our research and CTS solutions. EMEA's growth remained at 4% with wins across the region, most notably in France and the Nordics. The region benefited from increased sales of CTS and wealth solutions to asset owners and institutional asset managers as well as accelerating new business. 
Our diversifying client base continues to see mission critical data, and we see strong demand for our growing content offering. We're pleased with the progress we are making in the ESG market as we further integrate our ESG products into clients' everyday workflows. We've already expanded our ESG content suite with the launch of Truvalue's UN Sustainable Development Goals monitor. This is in addition to a new joint offering with Ping An Insurance Group, which offers ESG metrics on companies incorporated in Mainland China. 
Overall, we see a long runway for growth as we execute more enterprise-wide deals and believe that every touch point with clients today represents an opportunity to cross-sell in the future. The conversations we are having, combined with our sales team's execution, make us optimistic that we will continue to grow our market share long term. 
In summary, our focus continues to be on achieving higher growth and providing clients with effective and efficient solutions across the entire investment workflow. We remain committed to our investment strategy and to living our purpose, which is to drive the investment community to see more, think bigger and do their best work. And we are starting to see the rewards of the efforts we are making. We continue to push ourselves to be a more diverse, inclusive and impactful organization. To that end, I'm pleased to say we recently hired our first Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer as part of our strategy to strengthen our organizational accountability, increase diversity across all levels of our company and ensure workforce equity. We know we have more work to do and remain committed to furthering our efforts. 
I'm pleased with our progress as we strive to be the best place to work and give our employees the flexibility they need to thrive in the new normal. I'm proud of the ways in which we are showing up for one another and for our clients every day. With that, I'll now turn things over to Helen, who will take you through the specifics of our second quarter and first half 2021 performance."

I am proud of the FactSet team for finding new ways this past year to support both our clients and each other. Today, I will share more details on our performance to date and to provide an update to our annual outlook. 
For the first half of fiscal 2021, we grew our revenue by 6%, expanded our adjusted operating margin by 60 basis points and increased our adjusted EPS by 9% year-over-year. Our multiyear investment plan is on track and beginning to materialize in top line growth. 
Last quarter, we welcome Truvalue add to FactSet. I am pleased to report that the integration of the team and of the ESG technology assets is largely complete. As with our previous acquisitions, we will exclude any revenue and [indiscernible] associated with [indiscernible] while reporting out on organic-related metrics for the fiscal year 2021. 
As Phil stated earlier, we improved organic ASV plus professional services by 5.5%, an acceleration from the first quarter that reflects the diligent execution of our pipeline, powered by healthy demand for workstations and data sets. Ongoing investments in our core solutions continue to resonate with clients. As reflected in our annual Americas [indiscernible] increase, which totaled $14 million, $2 million more than the prior year. As the previous years, our annual price increase was a contributor to ASV and again this year, further accelerating our growth rate. 
For the second quarter, GAAP revenue increased by 6% to $392 million. While organic revenue, which excludes any impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and deferred revenue amortization, declined 20% to $389 million. Growth was driven primarily by our analytics and CTS solutions. 
For our geographic segment, revenue growth for the Americas was at 7%, EMEA at 3% and Asia Pacific at 10%. All regions primarily benefited from increases in our analytics and CTS solutions. GAAP operating expenses grew 5% in the second quarter to $276 million and impacted by a higher cost of sales. Compared to the previous year, our GAAP operating margin [indiscernible] by 90 basis points to 30%, and our adjusted operating margin increased by 80 basis points to 33%. These improvements were largely due to net savings from continued productivity for workforce mix and a reduction in discretionary expenses, including those related to travel, office and professional services. These benefits were partially offset by higher spend in both compensation and technology. 
As a percentage of revenue, our cost of sales was 230 basis points higher than last year on a GAAP basis and 170 basis points higher on an adjusted basis. This increase is driven by higher technology spend related to our shift to the public cloud and increased compensation expense for existing employees as well as new talent to support a multiyear investment plan. 
When expressed as a percentage of revenue, SG&A improved year-over-year by 320 basis points on a GAAP basis and 250 basis points on an adjusted basis. The primary drivers include materially lower travel and entertainment costs and reduced spend due to office closures, offset in part by higher compensation costs. These results are in line with our expectations, as noted in our full year guidance. 
As discussed on previous calls, we plan for an incremental investment spend of $15 million each year starting in 2020 through 2022, while realizing full benefits from productivity and a delayed ramp-up in hiring last year, we are on track to spend around $26 million in our fiscal FY '21. As noted on last quarter's call, we are also using a portion of the pandemic savings to invest further in both sales and new product development. 
Moving on, our tax rate for the quarter was 16% compared to last year's rate of 14%, primarily due to lower tax benefits realized from stock option exercises this quarter. GAAP EPS increased 9% to $2.50 this quarter versus $2.30 in the prior year. The adjusted diluted EPS grew 7% at $2.72. Both EPS figures were largely driven by improved operating results, partially offset by higher tax rates. A reconciliation of our adjustments to GAAP EPS is disclosed at the end of our press release. 
Free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations plus capital spending, was $130 million for the quarter, an increase of 75% over the same period last year. This increase is primarily due to the timing of certain tax payments and lower capital expenditures. As we have completed the majority of our office build-out. In the first quarter, our ASV retention continued to be above 95%. We grew our total number of clients by 7% compared to the prior year, reaching over 6,000 clients for the first time in our history. This growth reflects the addition of more wealth and corporate clients as well as data providers and asset owners, an ongoing trend we continue to -- as we continue to diversify our client base. 
Our client retention improved to 90% year-over-year, which speaks both to the mission criticality of our solutions and the solid efforts of our sales teams. Our user count grew 12% year-over-year and cost of total of $150,000, largely due to additional wealth and research workstation users. As noted in our press release this morning, we revised the methodology for how we define our users to capture more [indiscernible] across all our solutions. We have provided revised user counts for the last 8 quarters at the end of the press release. 
For the second quarter, we repurchased over 221,000 shares of our common stock for a total of $72 million at an average share price of $322. Our Board of Directors recently authorized an additional $206 million to our share repurchase program, bringing our total size to $350 million, in line with recent years. We remain disciplined in our buyback program and committed to returning long-term value to our shareholders. 
Given our solid first half performance and improved visibility for the rest of the year, we are bringing up the lower end of our organic ASV post productional services growth guidance range from $55 million to $70 million. So our full range is now $70 million to $85 million. This raises our midpoint and when -- what we set first at this guidance 6 months ago. Client demand for our enhanced solutions alongside the momentum built by our sales team gives us greater conviction in our second halfway point. 
Based on the first half results, we are encouraged by the client response to our enhanced product suite, reflected in both growth and new clients as well as increased expansion with existing clients. We do remain in an uncertain environment as different parts of the world begin to recover from this pandemic. Our full year views take into account our clients continue to performance in current market conditions and that additional delays in decision making and taking client budgets could impact our short-term performance. The global environment will continue to present challenges, but we believe we are well positioned for the longer term. 
With that, we're now ready for your questions. I'll turn this over to Joelle."

Thanks, Manav. Yes, when we published our 3-year plan 6 quarters ago, we have a 3-year window to get 80% into the public cloud, which will just give us, I think, a lot of advantages in terms of speed and agility across how we develop products and how we deliver product to our clients. So I'd say we're on pace. We're halfway through that journey. We're already beginning to see a lot of the benefits from being in the public cloud. So that is a major piece of the move from a technology standpoint. 
I would say the second thing is opening up the platform. So providing APIs to access FactSet content and analytics, whether or not you're our clients and you want to just program directly against our database or if you want to access it through some other means through some other channel, we're making that available as well. And it should also make FactSet easier to integrate with other third party systems. So that's another important aspect of that. So overall, we're pleased. I'd say we're halfway through that original plan. We're a technology company. So of course, that never ends. But we are beginning to definitely see some of the benefits of the work that we've been doing."

So we certainly have a fantastic product there that we can sell today as its own offering. That will continue. Very often, that's to feed these days. However, we've done a lot of work already to integrate the Truvalue Labs data through the FactSet workflows. So I think we all sort of recognize that ESG is very important and will be a piece of just about everybody's workflow in some way, shape or form. 
So for us, making sure that you can access ESG directly or as an overlay, whether you're a research analyst, you're a quants, maybe you want to look at your portfolios and group things a certain way or add in some metrics, we want to make sure that all of that's available through our platform. And one of the advantages, again, of using FactSet is you can seamlessly stitch together all those workflows. So we've learned a lot in terms of integration during our lifetime. And this has been one of the faster integrations of both the people and the technology and the content that I've seen. So we're well on our way. We're very optimistic about ESG as a theme, and we think we'll begin to see the benefits of that before too long."

It's one of our fastest-growing firm types that we sell into. Obviously, these big wins are very important because I think it gets us more noticed in the marketplace. And as advisers move around from firm to firm over the years, I think they will get used to using FactSet as a tool. So we think there's a ton of runway here. We see that there are a lot of interesting trends going on in the wealth space. And today, we own a small piece of the workflow. One thing that we're excited about is our Adviser Dashboard product, which essentially helps an adviser think about what their next best action is. So we're beginning to introduce cognitive computing to look at the clients' portfolios and the news associated with the holdings they have to really help them organize their day and so on. So we think that's unique and good opportunity for us. And we just think that in terms of the wealth space, there are lots of other places over time that we could begin to move into that would be accretive to FactSet."

So it's very easy for an adviser to come into our wealth offering and find what it is they're looking for very quickly. That has been a big winner. And our web offering is seamless to navigate as well just in terms of sort of navigating from screen to screen. The speed of the product is really good. So if you're an adviser and you're managing the assets at 200 families or individuals, being able to kind of get around quickly is important. And service has been a big piece of this, Toni. 
So as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we were able to virtually roll out this offering to, I think, 8,000 advisers really quickly. And in some ways, doing it virtually was easier than how we might have done it 2 years ago, which would be literally to fly around to almost every city we could to train people in person. So we've learned a lot about efficiency over the last year, and that's been a good experience on both sides. So I think it's that classic FactSet combo of the product and the service that's really allowing us to win here. And it's the investments that we made in technology that I just spoke about that are allowing us to scale, upload more portfolios and support more people than we might have been able to do on our old tech set."

So the core workstation and core web offerings are doing very well. So yes, obviously, it was a really nice win. And a lot of the users you see there in terms of the increase were driven from that. But we're also doing exceptionally well with our large banking clients in terms of renewals and the adoption, just more usage through our deep sector offering so that certainly has been a driver. And we've seen, I think, good uplift in terms of buy side as well in terms of the research offering. So I think it's that core FactSet workstation that is performing well in this environment, given the investments that we've made and some of the trends that are out there. So that's the main thing that I would attribute it to. 
And revenue always takes a long time to catch up to ASV. So a lot of our ASV comes in the second half. And the amount of revenue that we capture from that isn't as much as we would from stuff that we closed in Q1. And you knew that in the Q1, we were sort of minus 7% on the ASV side."

So the investments we're making in deep sector is really resonating with banking clients, for example.

I would say, for us to -- and we certainly have a pipeline that could support the top end of our range.

We're optimistic that we'll be able to execute on our Q3 price increase in EMEA and Asia Pac, which comes after the Q2 price increase in the Americas. 
The one area of our business that slowed a little bit is analytics. It has, I think, the highest absolute ASC contribution in most years. And what's happening there, I believe, is that because of the COVID environment, these longer sales cycle, more complicated implementations are taking a little bit longer. The analytics pipeline is very healthy. It's comparable to last year. So if we're able to execute on that well, I'm optimistic about what that means in terms of ASV for the full year."

I'll touch a bit on Q2 and then talk about H2, which will be more of the same, so it might be helpful. So we've been very pleased with the improvement that we've driven year-over-year as it relates to the operating results. Part of that is clearly due to higher revenue as well. But if we think about the uptick on the cost, it reflects in a couple of different ways. The increased investments that we've made in our deep sector of content collection, digital capabilities, those are coming through in higher salary and technology costs. We also have made additional hiring in sales and product development as we talked about last quarter, and that's reflected in the 8% growth in our headcount year-over-year. 
In terms of a headwind that we had this quarter, it was a bit on FX, which impacted our margin about 30, 35 basis points. And then offsetting all of that is the continued efficiencies that we're getting through the workforce mix. We moved shift again to help lower cost countries by another 1%. We've had reduced professional fees this quarter, services cost this quarter. We do expect that to pick back up in the second half. So that might be -- that is more of a timing issue. And of course, we're getting the benefit of being out of the office and [indiscernible]. After this quarter, we're going to start to lap the previous year. 
So when we think about the second half, you're exactly right, Alex, we do expect costs to ramp up further. And that's in part driven by the investment plan for sure. As I mentioned in my remarks, we are -- we believe we'll have around $26 million of costs related to the investment in this year versus more like $15 million last year. And we're seeing that salary run rate start to really pick up. And a lot of the investments that we're needing are more specialized, so they tend to be in the little higher cost country. So we see that pick up. Professional fees, we believe, as we're employing others to help us on the execution implementation front that's going to pick up. And we're still having the double carrying costs between the cloud and the data centers. 
And then we also have the full absorption of the dilution from the TVL acquisition as well. We will see what kind of costs we'll have to have as it relates to the offices, hopefully, reopening as business starts to get closer to whatever that level of normal is so that could be an offset. And we continue to be focused, of course, on managing the spend and any discretionary costs that we have. So we will be focused on driving that as we have over the past 2.5 years."

So one of the things that I mentioned in my comments was moving our content collection efforts to the cloud.

So that was a very important piece of work that we've been undergoing. So we're beginning to see some of the benefits of that. More will come later, I believe, on both the products and the cost side as we complete that work. So that's one good example. 
The APIs and the endpoints that we're setting up, those are also getting some pretty good adoption, particularly in analytics. So that's a great example. And then I think when you consider some of the work we're doing with firms like Snowflake, for example, where we're able to sort of work with them and provide our data feeds and our concordance as a service, all of this is wrapped up into our digital transformation efforts. So -- there's a lot of foundational work here, a lot of costs associated with moving, but there -- the real payoff will come when the work is completed over the next year or 2."

So very often now, we'll be talking to CTOs, CIOs about FactSet's overall offering from research, all the way through the client reporting. And as these firms are consolidating. The equation for them gets more and more complicated in terms of how do they rationalize their spend across a large number of vendors and how do they make sense out of that technology stack and how they are managing their own data throughout their workflows. So we are so well positioned for these conversations now, given the offerings we have all the way across the portfolio life cycle and the integration that we've done and our move to the cloud. 
So when we sit down with our clients now and talk about the trends in the marketplace that they're dealing with, which in some ways are the same trends we're dealing with as a technology company, we're having really good conversations about how we can help them. So there's a big push, I believe, within the asset management space for these larger asset managers, particularly that are stitching together different entities to really simplify their lives, which means simplify the number of technology providers they deal with and simplify the number of data providers they deal with. So we're running towards those conversations. And these are longer-term efforts with our clients, but I'm very encouraged by the level of conversations that our sales and technology teams are having with clients on the buy side."

So pretty much across the board, we're adding new names, which I think is a great indication of the strength there. And then you're seeing it as already described, within the existing clients in terms of just adding more seats.

So we are selling more to existing clients. I think that just helps us feel better certainly on the lower half of that range, and that's why we moved it up.

Thanks for joining us today. I'm pleased to share our third quarter results, headlined by strong top line growth.

I'm pleased to share our third quarter results, headlined by strong top line growth. This has allowed us to increase our organic ASV plus professional services guidance for this fiscal year. Building on last quarter's momentum, we grew organic ASV plus professional services by 5.8% this quarter. The investments made in both content and technology over the past 7 quarters have strengthened our product portfolio. And as a result, demand for our solutions is increasing, further supported by our clients' own digital transformation needs. 
Our growth this quarter was strongest with wealth managers, banking clients and asset owners. The acceleration in ASV reflects solid execution from the sales team who increased wallet share with existing accounts and further improve client retention. Our strategy to build the industry's leading open content and analytics platform continues to make an impact in the market. 
We remain on track with our multiyear investment plan. We continue to build out our content offering with particular focus on deep sector, private markets, ESG and data for wealth managers. Growth in workstations this quarter was driven by deep sector and private markets data, especially with banks and corporate clients. The expansion of our Street account coverage in Canada and Asia as well as more fund data collection has generated greater demand from wealth managers. And clients are using our data management solutions which include entity mapping and data concordance services to manage their own content. These offerings are key differentiators, often sought by asset management clients. 
Our migration to the cloud is progressing as planned and gives us the opportunity to build new products that support ASV growth. One example is the adviser dashboard, which is being well received by wealth managers as evidenced by new wins and solid pipeline. Clients are seeking personalized tools like the adviser dashboard that can surface insights, increase efficiency and help users identify the next best action. In addition, we provide greater flexibility to clients by further opening up our platform. Our broad API offerings allow clients to leverage core and alternative data sets, tap into our robust portfolio analytics engine build digital portals and gain access to proprietary signals. We have seen strong demand for our analytics APIs as well as fundamental company data APIs for CTS. We are also seeing more data sales through cloud based platforms, such as Snowflake and having success with CRM integrations. This growth in our digital solutions can be attributed to our technology investments. 
Looking at our regions, I'm pleased to say that our ASV growth rate increased in the Americas and EMEA across the majority of our business lines. The Americas growth rate increased to 6% with strength across CTS, research and analytics. Acceleration was driven primarily by strong workstation sales to our banking clients on overall demand for premium and core data feeds. We've benefited from an increase in hiring at middle market and bulk bracket banks due to robust M&A and equity capital markets. 
EMEA's growth rate accelerated to 5%, improving over the past 2 quarters. We experienced stronger results in research and analytics, reflected in part by higher retention of our asset management and wealth funds. In addition, we captured greater international price increases as clients continue to affirm the value of our solutions. 
Asia Pac's growth remained at 9%, driven largely by research and analytics, results include strong cross-sales to asset management firms as well as increases to global banks who are hiring more to accommodate increased capital markets activity. The region also benefited from higher price increases. 
In summary, we enter the end of fiscal '21 with good momentum and have good visibility into our fourth quarter. We have a strong pipeline weighted most heavily towards institutional asset managers, broker-dealers and wealth managers and are increasing our organic ASV guidance to $85 million to $95 million for this fiscal year. 
Overall, we are encouraged by market trends. Clients are showing more willingness to spend against the backdrop of anticipated economic recovery. Decisions on more complex deals that have been delayed are now beginning to be reconsidered as clients look to execute on their own digital transformations. We see increased demand for enterprise-wide technology upgrades and data management as CIOs and CTOs look to future-proof their technology stacks. This gives us conviction in the long-term benefit of our multiyear investment plan and our path to higher growth. 
This month marks FactSet's 25th year as a public company. I'm proud to reflect on our team's strong performance, the culture of continuous innovation we have fostered and the significant value to shareholders we have created over the years. We will continue to push ourselves to create smarter, more adaptive and more personalized solutions that make us the trusted enterprise partner for clients. 
I'll now turn it over to Helen, who, as many of you know, has taken over the leadership of our sales organization as Chief Revenue Officer, while continuing to serve as our CFO. She will take you through the quarter in more detail."

As you've seen from our press release this morning, we are pleased to report an acceleration in our top line, both in terms of revenue and organic ASV plus professional services. Our quarterly results also reflect increased year-over-year spending in people and technology, in line with our investment plan as well as anticipated higher ASV performance. We believe the progress made in our own digital transformation is enhancing our ability to help clients do the same. 
I will now share more details on our third quarter performance and provide an update to our annual outlook. We grew organic ASV plus professional services by 5.8%, reflecting in part the client demand for our solutions driven by their own digital transformation needs. In addition, our ability to realize higher pricing is a direct reflection of the value our products provide to clients. To that point, in line with the $14 million captured last quarter with the Americas' price increase, we added $8 million from our international price increase this quarter. 
Our investments in content and technology have further strengthened our product offerings with clients as reflected in both higher levels of client retention and cross-selling. Focused execution from our sales team in delivering key workflow solutions also accelerated our growth. All of these factors underpin our results year-to-date. 
For the quarter, GAAP revenue increased by 7% to $400 million. Organic revenue, which excludes any impact from foreign exchange, acquisitions and deferred revenue amortization, increased 6% to $397 million. Growth was driven primarily by our analytics and CTS solutions, which have been the drivers of ASV in prior quarters. As a reminder, ASV represents the next 12 months of revenue. So there is a lag between the recording of ASV and the realization of revenue. 
For our geographic segments, organic revenue growth for the Americas grew to 6%, EMEA grew to 5% and Asia Pacific to 11%. All regions primarily benefited from increases in our analytics and CTS solutions. GAAP operating expenses grew 12% in the third quarter to $282 million, impacted by a higher cost of services. Compared to the previous year, our GAAP operating margin decreased by 300 basis points to 29.5%, and our adjusted operating margin decreased by 390 basis points to 31.6%. As a percentage of revenue, our cost of services was 570 basis points higher than last year on a GAAP basis and 560 basis points higher on an adjusted basis. This increase is driven by higher compensation and technology costs. 
Compensation growth is comprised of higher salary expenses for existing employees, new hires to support our multiyear investment plan, and higher bonus accrual in line with stronger-than-anticipated ASV performance. This higher technology spend relates to our planned migration to the public cloud. We have been experiencing higher cloud usage and costs due to increased client trials, enterprise hosting and new product development. We anticipate this level of elevated expenses to continue as clients adopt our digital solutions. 
SG&A expenses, when expressed as a percentage of revenue, improved year-over-year by 270 basis points on a GAAP basis and 170 basis points on an adjusted basis. The primary drivers include reduced facilities expenses, lower spend due to office closures and a decrease in professional fees, offset in part by higher compensation costs reflecting the same factors as noted in the cost of services. 
Moving on, our tax rate for the quarter was 12% compared to last year's rate of 15%, primarily due to lower operating income this quarter and a tax benefit related to finalizing prior year's tax returns. GAAP EPS was almost flat to last year at $2.62 this quarter versus $2.63 in the prior year. Adjusted diluted EPS decreased 5% to $2.72. Both EPS figures were largely driven by higher operating expenses, partially offset by higher revenue. A reconciliation of our adjustments to GAAP EPS is included at the end of our press release. 
Free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations less capital spending, was $122 million for the quarter, a decrease of 13% over the same period last year. This decrease is primarily due to higher capital expenditure from higher investment in internal software and the timing of certain tax items. For the third quarter, our ASV retention continued to be above 95%, and our client retention improved to 91%, which speaks both to the mission criticality of our solutions and the solid efforts and focused execution of our sales teams. We grew our total number of clients by 7% compared to the prior year to over 6,100 clients, largely due to the addition of more wealth and corporate clients, including private equity and venture capital firms. And our user count grew 11% year-over-year and crossed the total of 155,000, primarily driven by wealth and corporate users. 
For the third quarter, we repurchased over 178,000 shares of our common stock for a total of $58 million at an average share price of $323. We also increased our quarterly dividend by 6.5% to $0.82 per share, marking the 22nd consecutive year that we have increased our dividend. We remain disciplined in our buyback program and committed to returning long-term value to our shareholders. 
The impact of our multiyear investment plan is reflected in our results. The demand for our strong content offerings, digital solutions and open platform is accelerating growth. Given our strong performance this quarter and our confidence that we will execute successfully on a healthy pipeline as we close out the fiscal year, we are increasing our full year organic ASV plus professional services guidance range to $85 million to $95 million. 
We are also reaffirming the other metrics in our annual outlook. Given its timing and nature, an increase in ASV in the fourth quarter will not materially change revenue in fiscal year '21, but would result in a higher bonus accrual. The related expense would impact our margins by an incremental 60 to 75 basis points. We believe that we will remain within our stated annual guidance ranges. 
In closing, from the vantage point of now overseeing FactSet sales and marketing organization, I can attest to the diligent focus and efforts we have made this year, helping clients leverage our offerings, building a stronger and broader pipeline and converting opportunities to sales. I have confidence in our ability to continue to execute on all these fronts and grow our market share as we finish the year.

And I do believe we're taking market share on the wealth side. I think it's pretty well understood who we're competing with there. And for the desktop business, that's a combination of firms. And analytics, again, it's a combination of firms. But overall, I feel really good about the top line and how we're stacking up versus the competitors in the marketplace. And overall, yes, I think we're seeing that clients are -- we can all see a return to some sort of normalcy in terms of how we're working, and the underlying trends in the market are definitely positive."

When we think about the higher cost and technology, I would say, in part, it's really driven also by higher cloud-related costs. And the drivers of the cloud costs include the migration of our existing data and applications, which is always planned; client-related activities, such as hosting and trials; and then new product development as we're doing new products, which is going directly to the cloud. And we monitor these pretty closely, but we're learning along the way. And the cloud allows us monitor our usage better. 
I would say most of the higher costs are really related to client activity and new product development. And I think that reflects the faster adoption, probably a bit faster than we had planned. So it's in line with clients who also need to make their own digital transformation. And so we would expect all of this to give us an indication really linked to future ASV growth as opposed to this year specifically. But I would say, if we think about the higher cost on the cloud side, a portion of it is just related to future top line growth."

So a couple of other things I'd point out for the sell-side. One is we're beginning to monetize feeds and analytics in the sell-side which previously we've not done much of. So that is supporting some of the growth. And then in terms of new logos, we're positive this quarter for the sell-side firms, whereas Q3 of last year, we were negative.

Thanks for joining us today.  I'm pleased to share our third quarter results, headlined by strong top line growth. This has allowed us to increase our organic ASV plus professional services guidance for this fiscal",845,"Thank you, Rima, and hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us today.  
I'm pleased to share our third quarter results, headlined by strong top line growth. This has allowed us to increase our organic ASV plus professional services guidance for this fiscal year. Building on last quarter's momentum, we grew organic ASV plus professional services by 5.8% this quarter. The investments made in both content and technology over the past 7 quarters have strengthened our product portfolio. And as a result, demand for our solutions is increasing, further supported by our clients' own digital transformation needs.  
Our growth this quarter was strongest with wealth managers, banking clients and asset owners. The acceleration in ASV reflects solid execution from the sales team who increased wallet share with existing accounts and further improved client retention. Our strategy to build the industry's leading open content and analytics platform continues to make an impact in the market.  
We remain on track with our multiyear investment plan. We continue to build out our content offering with particular focus on deep sector, private markets, ESG and data for wealth managers. Growth in workstations this quarter was driven by deep sector and private markets data, especially with banks and corporate clients. The expansion of our Street account coverage in Canada and Asia as well as more fund data collection has generated greater demand from wealth managers. And clients are using our data management solutions which include entity mapping and data concordance services to manage their own content. These offerings are key differentiators, often sought by asset management clients.  
Our migration to the cloud is progressing as planned and gives us the opportunity to build new products that support ASV growth. One example is the adviser dashboard, which is being well received by wealth managers as evidenced by new wins and solid pipeline. Clients are seeking personalized tools like the adviser dashboard that can surface insights, increase efficiency and help users identify the next best action. In addition, we provide greater flexibility to clients by further opening up our platform. Our broad API offerings allow clients to leverage core and alternative data sets, tap into our robust portfolio analytics engine build digital portals and gain access to proprietary signals. We have seen strong demand for our analytics APIs as well as fundamental company data APIs for CTS. We are also seeing more data sales through cloud based platforms, such as Snowflake and having success with CRM integrations. This growth in our digital solutions can be attributed to our technology investments.  
Looking at our regions, I'm pleased to say that our ASV growth rate increased in the Americas and EMEA across the majority of our business lines. The Americas growth rate increased to 6% with strength across CTS, research and analytics. Acceleration was driven primarily by strong workstation sales to our banking clients on overall demand for premium and core data feeds. We've benefited from an increase in hiring at middle market and bulk bracket banks due to robust M&A and equity capital markets.  
EMEA's growth rate accelerated to 5%, improving over the past 2 quarters. We experienced stronger results in research and analytics, reflected in part by higher retention of our asset management and wealth funds. In addition, we captured greater international price increases as clients continue to affirm the value of our solutions.  
Asia Pac's growth remained at 9%, driven largely by research and analytics. Results include strong cross-sales to asset management firms as well as increases to global banks who are hiring more to accommodate increased capital markets activity. The region also benefited from higher price increases.  
In summary, we enter the end of fiscal '21 with good momentum and have good visibility into our fourth quarter. We have a strong pipeline weighted most heavily towards institutional asset managers, broker-dealers and wealth managers, and are increasing our organic ASV guidance to $85 million to $95 million for this fiscal year.  
Overall, we are encouraged by market trends. Clients are showing more willingness to spend against the backdrop of anticipated economic recovery. Decisions on more complex deals that have been delayed are now beginning to be reconsidered as clients look to execute on their own digital transformations. We see increased demand for enterprise-wide technology upgrades and data management as CIOs and CTOs look to future-proof their technology stacks. This gives us conviction in the long-term benefit of our multiyear investment plan and our path to higher growth.  
This month marks FactSet's 25th year as a public company. I'm proud to reflect on our team's strong performance, the culture of continuous innovation we have fostered, and the significant value to shareholders we have created over the years. We will continue to push ourselves to create smarter, more adaptive and more personalized solutions that make us the trusted enterprise partner for clients.  
I'll now turn it over to Helen, who, as many of you know, has taken over the leadership of our sales organization as Chief Revenue Officer, while continuing to serve as our CFO. She will take you through the quarter in more detail."

As you've seen from our press release this morning, we are pleased to report an acceleration in our top line, both in terms of revenue and organic ASV plus professional services. Our quarterly results also reflect",1090,"Thank you, Phil, and hello, everyone.  
As you've seen from our press release this morning, we are pleased to report an acceleration in our top line, both in terms of revenue and organic ASV plus professional services. Our quarterly results also reflect increased year-over-year spending in people and technology, in line with our investment plan as well as anticipated higher ASV performance. We believe the progress made in our own digital transformation is enhancing our ability to help clients do the same.  
I will now share more details on our third quarter performance and provide an update to our annual outlook. 
We grew organic ASV plus professional services by 5.8%, reflecting in part the client demand for our solutions driven by their own digital transformation needs. In addition, our ability to realize higher pricing is a direct reflection of the value our products provide to clients. To that point, in line with the $14 million captured last quarter with the Americas' price increase, we added $8 million from our international price increase this quarter.  
Our investments in content and technology have further strengthened our product offerings with clients as reflected in both higher levels of client retention and cross-selling. Focused execution from our sales team in delivering key workflow solutions also accelerated our growth. All of these factors underpin our results year-to-date.  
For the quarter, GAAP revenue increased by 7% to $400 million. Organic revenue, which excludes any impact from foreign exchange, acquisitions and deferred revenue amortization, increased 6% to $397 million. Growth was driven primarily by our analytics and CTS solutions, which have been the drivers of ASV in prior quarters. As a reminder, ASV represents the next 12 months of revenue. So there is a lag between the recording of ASV and the realization of revenue.  
For our geographic segments, organic revenue growth for the Americas grew to 6%, EMEA grew to 5% and Asia Pacific to 11%. All regions primarily benefited from increases in our analytics and CTS solutions. GAAP operating expenses grew 12% in the third quarter to $282 million, impacted by a higher cost of services. Compared to the previous year, our GAAP operating margin decreased by 300 basis points to 29.5%, and our adjusted operating margin decreased by 390 basis points to 31.6%. As a percentage of revenue, our cost of services was 570 basis points higher than last year on a GAAP basis and 560 basis points higher on an adjusted basis. This increase is driven by higher compensation and technology costs.  
Compensation growth is comprised of higher salary expenses for existing employees, new hires to support our multiyear investment plan, and higher bonus accrual in line with stronger-than-anticipated ASV performance. This higher technology spend relates to our planned migration to the public cloud. We have been experiencing higher cloud usage and costs due to increased client trials, enterprise hosting and new product development. We anticipate this level of elevated expenses to continue as clients adopt our digital solutions.  
SG&A expenses, when expressed as a percentage of revenue, improved year-over-year by 270 basis points on a GAAP basis and 170 basis points on an adjusted basis. The primary drivers include reduced facilities expenses, lower spend due to office closures, and a decrease in professional fees, offset in part by higher compensation costs reflecting the same factors as noted in the cost of services.  
Moving on, our tax rate for the quarter was 12% compared to last year's rate of 15%, primarily due to lower operating income this quarter and a tax benefit related to finalizing prior year's tax returns. GAAP EPS was almost flat to last year at $2.62 this quarter versus $2.63 in the prior year. Adjusted diluted EPS decreased 5% to $2.72. Both EPS figures were largely driven by higher operating expenses, partially offset by higher revenue. A reconciliation of our adjustments to GAAP EPS is included at the end of our press release.  
Free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations less capital spending, was $122 million for the quarter, a decrease of 13% over the same period last year. This decrease is primarily due to higher capital expenditure from higher investment in internal software and the timing of certain tax items. For the third quarter, our ASV retention continued to be above 95%, and our client retention improved to 91%, which speaks both to the mission criticality of our solutions and the solid efforts and focused execution of our sales teams. We grew our total number of clients by 7% compared to the prior year to over 6,100 clients, largely due to the addition of more wealth and corporate clients, including private equity and venture capital firms. And our user count grew 11% year-over-year and crossed the total of 155,000, primarily driven by wealth and corporate users.  
For the third quarter, we repurchased over 178,000 shares of our common stock for a total of $58 million at an average share price of $323. We also increased our quarterly dividend by 6.5% to $0.82 per share, marking the 22nd consecutive year that we have increased our dividend. We remain disciplined in our buyback program and committed to returning long-term value to our shareholders.  
The impact of our multiyear investment plan is reflected in our results. The demand for our strong content offerings, digital solutions and open platform is accelerating growth. Given our strong performance this quarter and our confidence that we will execute successfully on a healthy pipeline as we close out the fiscal year, we are increasing our full year organic ASV plus professional services guidance range to $85 million to $95 million.  We are also reaffirming the other metrics in our annual outlook. Given its timing and nature, an increase in ASV in the fourth quarter will not materially change revenue in fiscal year '21, but would result in a higher bonus accrual. The related expense would impact our margins by an incremental 60 to 75 basis points. We believe that we will remain within our stated annual guidance ranges.  
In closing, from the vantage point of now overseeing FactSet sales and marketing organization, I can attest to the diligent focus and efforts we have made this year, helping clients leverage our offerings, building a stronger and broader pipeline, and converting opportunities to sales. I have confidence in our ability to continue to execute on all these fronts and grow our market share as we finish the year.  
And with that, we are now ready for your questions. I'll turn it back to the operator."

So the APIs are really driving some of the momentum we're seeing in both CTS and showing some strength now in the analytics business.

When we think about the higher cost in technology, I would say, in part, it's really driven also by higher cloud-related costs. And the drivers of the cloud costs include the migration of our existing data and applications, which is always planned; client-related activities, such as hosting and trials; and then new product development as we're doing new products, which is going directly to the cloud. And we monitor these pretty closely, but we're learning along the way. And the cloud allows us monitor our usage better.  
I would say most of the higher costs are really related to client activity and new product development. And I think that reflects the faster adoption, probably a bit faster than we had planned. So it's in line with clients who also need to make their own digital transformation. And so we would expect all of this to give us an indication really linked to future ASV growth as opposed to this year specifically. But I would say, if we think about the higher cost on the cloud side, a portion of it is just related to future top line growth."

We had one significant win that was related to deep sector. And we're on track with that program. So the team did a tremendous job of laying out over a 3- year period, a number of sectors that we would be developing. And we're on track with that program. So 7 quarters into it, we feel really good about the momentum there. We've done a lot of hard work to partner with a lot of firms to bring their data and integrate it into FactSet, which is something we always do really well. And then for other data sets, we're going out and collecting it ourselves. 
So overall, we're really thrilled with that program. The team has done an amazing job, and it's beginning to have a real impact for us on the sell side, but it's not just the sell side. We will be able to monetize this data within the corporate space within the buy side as well."

So the core PA product is actually doing well. We're adding new logos and seats for that. I mentioned APIs already. We have a new quant research environment that we are releasing, which has gotten tremendous feedback from the market. And our front office solutions are beginning to show some green shoots as well. 
So analytics is definitely stabilizing. And clients are willing to now revisit a lot of these decisions for some of these longer sales cycle deals. So -- and obviously, clients are beginning to open up. We are as well as a firm. I think the sales team's itching to get back out there."

So therefore, if the users go up or down within the band, the pricing is the same. Then if they go to the next tier, it goes up. 
So I would say for our largest clients, that's where many -- that's how many of them are set up. Again, it's a blend of, in some cases, usage, but in other cases, users. And we've seen good growth. We can tell from the pricing increases that we've had, our annual price increase, again, for international is up.

There are offsets as we manage both from a people perspective, some of the productivity, lower professional services fees that we think. And we'll see how Q4 ends up, but we had expected a certain level of G&A for Q4, and we'll see where that goes. 
We do think from a margin perspective, though, overall, we'll be on the lower end of our range. So I think that, that is a fair way of thinking about it. I would also add what we're seeing come through that likely on the tax rate side, we'll be on the lower end as well. So we should take both of those into a bit of consideration."

I'm pleased to share that we delivered strong fourth quarter and full year results. We ended the year with record organic ASV plus professional services growth of $68 million for the quarter, crossing the $100 million annual ASV threshold for the first time and soundly beating the top end of our guidance. Our year-on-year organic ASV growth rate accelerated 200 basis points to over 7%, and we delivered annual revenue of $1.6 billion and adjusted EPS of $11.20. 
Our outperformance was driven by 2 years of planned accelerated investments in content and technology, which is paying dividends. FactSet's goal to be the leading open content and analytics platform is resonating in the marketplace and increasing our wallet share with clients. Our targeted investment in new content sets was a significant ASP driver in fiscal '21 and fueled our workstation growth. The continued development of our deep sector coverage improved sell-side retention and expansion with our largest banking clients and helped secure our new business. 
Content and Technology were both key to our expansion with wealth management firms where we landed important wins, including with the Royal Bank of Canada and Raymond James Canada. These wins were due to our market-leading data and the launch of FactSet's Adviser dashboard. We are also expanding our addressable market by increasing our content and delivery capabilities across the front, middle and back office. 
We added meaningful ASV from our cloud and API solutions this year, including: delivering more data through the cloud and cloud-based platforms; entity mapping and linking client data through our data management services or DMS; and unlocking opportunity in new workflows by unbundling our components to plug and play into other third-party systems such as CRMs. Cloud delivery, coupled with the strength of our DMS and concordance as a service solutions, enable our clients to centralize, integrate and analyze disparate data sources for faster and more cost-effective decision-making. This has been a major driver for our CTS business. 
As we look ahead to 2022 and beyond, we remain focused on 3 things: scaling up our content refinery to provide the most comprehensive and connected set of industry, proprietary and third-party data for the financial market; two, enhancing the client experience by delivering hyper-personalized solutions so clients can discover meaningful insights faster and third, driving next-generation workflow-specific solutions for asset managers, asset owners, sell side, wealth management and corporate clients. 
We added new data and capabilities to further these goals by acquiring differentiated assets over the past year. The addition of Truvalue Labs has grown our ESG offering; BTU Analytics advanced our deep sector content for the energy markets; and Cabot technologies will better support the portfolio analytics workflows of asset managers and asset owners. The progress we have made on our investment plan, along with these acquisitions and our award-winning products, give us a distinct competitive advantage. 
Turning now to our financial results. We accelerated our organic ASV plus professional services growth to 7.2%. Our strong performance was driven by stellar execution from our sales and client-facing teams throughout the entire year and especially in the fourth quarter. Our buy-side and sell-side growth rates increased 100 and 400 basis points, respectively, since the third quarter, reflecting higher sales across our key clients. 
On a year-over-year basis, we saw an increase in ASV growth rates from high single digit to double digits across banks, asset owners, hedge funds, data providers, wealth managers and corporates, including private equity and venture capital funds. We capitalized on the strength of our end markets, particularly in banking, and landed several large deals in our wealth and CTS businesses. 
Turning now to our geographic segments. We saw acceleration in every region. ASV growth in the Americas rose to 7% in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by increased sales to our banking, corporate and wealth clients. We also had a large data partner win this quarter in CTS. Asia Pac had a record ASV quarter and delivered a growth rate of 12%. We saw wins across many countries with global and regional banks as well as our research management products. CTS and analytics also contributed to growth with wins across asset managers and data providers. EMEA accelerated to a 6% growth rate, driven by strong performance with data providers, asset managers and banking clients. And CTS had the highest contribution to this region, followed by research. 
Now turning to our businesses. Research was the largest contributor to our ASV growth this year with a growth rate of 6%, driven by very strong growth on the sell-side at 12%. We increased research workstation users by 86% this quarter versus a year ago, with growth across both sell-side and buy-side clients. Increasing our workstation presence and footprint with our largest clients positions us very well for cross-selling opportunities in the future. 
Analytics & Trading accelerated in the second half in fiscal 2021 versus the first half ending the year at a 6% growth rate. We saw wins across performance and reporting, front office and core analytics solutions. Within front office solutions, we are really pleased to see larger wins with our trading platform and believe this will be a contributor to analytics going into next year. 
CTS grew 16%, driven by core company data and data management solutions sold through an increasing number of channels. CTS had robust sales to data providers this year and expanded their footprint across multiple workflows within middle and back office functions at asset management and banking clients. Additionally, while all Truvalue Labs ESG sales are excluded from our organic numbers, I'm pleased to report that ESG data sales were a contributor to CTS' overall growth this quarter. 
Wealth ended the year with a 6% growth rate. Wealth workstations grew 24% year-over-year, and they, alongside FactSet's Adviser dashboard, have been the biggest contributors to winning new clients. We've seen a combination of large and medium-sized wins as existing clients continue to expand their advisory businesses, and we are equally pleased with our new business wins. We are also seeing cross-selling opportunities with analytics products as wealth managers increasingly look to advance the sophistication of their offerings. 
Moving forward with fiscal '22, we will report 3 workflow solutions. We are combining the desktop portion of the wealth business with research into one business to be known as Research and Advisory. We believe this is the right strategy to further our goals to holistically manage our desktop solutions, accelerate the build-out of differentiated front office solutions and facilitate the global expansion and adoption of StreetAccount news and FactSet web. We have also taken the Wealth digital business and combined it with CTS to better align our digital solutions. 
In summary, we are entering fiscal '22 with strong momentum and a solid pipeline as reflected in our annual ASP guidance. The need for more differentiated content and analytics is at an unprecedented high, and we are perfectly positioned to capture this demand and poised to deliver best-in-class workflows and a hyper-personalized experience for our clients. I'm proud of our company's strong performance in fiscal '21. We have advanced our digital platform, executed at a high level and strengthened our relationship with clients. 
I'll now turn it over to Helen, who for the last time as CFO, will discuss our fourth quarter and full year performance in more detail and take you through our fiscal 2022 guidance. I want to thank Helen for leading our global finance organization in the past 3 years, and I'm confident that as our Chief Revenue Officer, she will bring a disciplined, growth-oriented mindset in the same rigor to the sales organization as she did leading finance, enabling us to continue our success going forward."

Full year revenue also exceeded our target as we realize more revenue from ASV booked early in the fourth quarter. We generated solid earnings through disciplined expense management and operating leverage. Driving sustainable long-term growth requires continued investment back into the business as reflected by our increased spend on differentiated content and cloud-enabled technology. We executed our plan well, and our operating results are in line with expectations due to higher revenue and productivity gains with higher adjusted operating income and growth in adjusted EPS. Let me now walk you through the specifics of our fourth quarter. 
Before I explain the quarterly results, I want to remind everyone that our prior year fourth quarter GAAP results were impacted by a onetime noncash charge of approximately $17 million related to an impairment of an investment in a third party. Thus, any year-over-year comparison of GAAP operating results for the fourth quarter of 2021 should take that into consideration. 
As you saw on the previous slide, our organic ASV plus professional services growth rate was 7.2%. This increase reflects the higher demand for our solutions as clients execute on their own digital transformation. Our success in solving their workflow challenges has resulted in higher levels of both client retention and cross-selling activity. 
For the quarter, GAAP revenue increased by 7% to $412 million. Organic revenue, which excludes any impact from foreign exchange, acquisitions and deferred revenue amortization, also increased 7% to $410 million. Growth was driven by our analytics, CTS and research solutions. For our geographic segment, organic revenue for the Americas grew to 6%, EMEA grew to 7% and Asia Pacific to 12%. All regions primarily benefited from increases in our analytics and CTS solutions. 
GAAP operating expenses grew 3% in the fourth quarter to $293 million, impacted by a higher cost of services. Compared to the previous year, our GAAP operating margin increased by 320 basis points to 28.9%, and our adjusted operating margin decreased by 150 basis points to 31.6%. As a percentage of revenue, our cost of services was 10 basis points higher than last year on a GAAP basis and flat to last year on an adjusted basis. The increase is primarily driven by growth in compensation comprised of: higher salary expenses for existing employees, new hires to support a multiyear investment plan and higher bonus accrual in line with stronger-than-anticipated ASV performance. 
SG&A expenses, when expressed as a percentage of revenue, improved year-over-year by 330 basis points on a GAAP basis but increased 170 basis points on an adjusted basis. The primary drivers include higher compensation costs, reflecting the same factors as noted in the cost of services. 
Moving on, our tax rate for the quarter was 15% higher than the prior year's tax rate of 7%, primarily due to lower tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation in the current quarter as well as a tax benefit related to finalizing the prior year's tax returns. 
GAAP EPS increased 15% to $2.63 this quarter versus $2.29 in the prior year. Again, this improvement is primarily a result of the impairment charge we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020. Adjusted diluted EPS remained flat year-over-year at $2.88. Adjusted EPS was driven by higher revenues, offset by higher operating expenses and an increase in the tax rate. A reconciliation of our adjustments to GAAP EPS is included at the end of our press release. 
Free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations less capital spending, was $171 million for the quarter, an increase of 18% over the same period last year. This increase is primarily due to higher net income, improved collections and the timing of certain tax payments. 
For the fourth quarter, our ASV retention remained above 95% and our client retention improved to 91%, which again speaks to the demand for our solutions and excellent execution by our sales teams. Compared to the prior year, we grew our total number of clients by 10% to over 6,400, largely due to the addition of more wealth and corporate clients. And our user count grew 14% year-over-year and crossed the total of 160,000 primarily driven by sales in our Wealth and Research Solutions, and in particular, in the number of banking users. 
For the quarter, we repurchased over 265,000 shares of our common stock at a total cost of $93 million with an average share price of $348. For the year, we repurchased 265 million of our shares and increased our dividend for the 22nd consecutive year. With share repurchases and dividends, on an annual basis, we have returned to shareholders almost 70% as a percentage of free cash flow and proceeds from employee stock options. We remain disciplined in our buyback program and committed to returning long-term value to our shareholders. 
Turning now to our outlook for fiscal year 2022. We delivered outstanding results in the back half of 2021 and believe this pace will carry into our next fiscal year. For organic ASV plus professional services, we are guiding to an incremental $105 million to $135 million. The midpoint of this range represents a 7% increase, which is equal to this year's organic growth rate, reflecting continued momentum in our business. We are confident in our ability to perform at the high standard we demonstrated in fiscal '21 with underlying drivers to include disciplined execution and continued benefits from our investments. We expect growth to be driven largely with existing clients through high retention and cross-selling. In addition, we expect our ability to successfully sell new business in this virtual environment to continue. 
Our recent investment in digital and content are providing us with more opportunities to sell direct solutions tailored for specific workflows. Drivers of future growth would include: first, the retention and expansion of our sell-side client base through our deep sector strategy as we launch new targeted industries in addition to new private markets offerings; second, new wins with wealth managers, who have been responding well to our web-based workstation and personalized adviser dashboard; and third, growth with institutional asset management clients who benefit from our data management solutions and enhanced capabilities in front office and ESG workflows. We are mindful about the global environment and potential future market disruptions, but we believe we have the right offerings and strategy to maintain our high performance and growth rate into fiscal 2022. 
From an operational perspective, we plan for continued labor productivity and operating leverage. In addition to our multiyear investment plan, new investments will be made in content and front office solutions, funded in part by ongoing cost discipline, including permanent savings related to the pandemic and additional efficiency actions. As a result of higher growth in revenues and continued cost discipline, we are guiding to an expansion in our operating margins. Combined with our consistent use of capital for share repurchases, we expect to accelerate growth in our diluted EPS, both on a GAAP and adjusted basis. We are seeing the results of our investments take hold in both technology and content. As we look to fiscal 2022, we are focused on delivering more value to clients, prioritizing our resources and ensuring execution excellence. 
As I transition to my new role, I am seeing firsthand the experience and skills of our sales team in adapting to meet the needs of the market. Our client-centric mentality, combined with our expanding data universe and digital advances, provide me with the confidence that we have the people, strategy and products to build a leading open content and analytics platform in our industry, all while generating long-term value for our shareholders. 
With that, we are now ready for your questions, and I'll turn it over to the operator."

Yes, we're very pleased with how our research business performed this year. Clearly, we had very good performance on the sell-side and the investment that we made in new content really helped drive new logos, expansion at existing clients and help with retention. So that was a big driver on the sell-side. However, the research business grew at a healthy clip in lots of different firm types. So we did very well on a relative basis to last year within Institutional Asset Management. We did well with corporates, hedge funds, a number of different firm types. So it was pretty broad-based. You can see that we grew our workstations by, I think, 14% over the last year. So just getting that footprint is really important for us moving forward to cross-sell. And we closed lots of new logos. So my hats off to the research team. They've done an amazing job and just really a month to quarter from the sales team in terms of going out and executing on of all the opportunities we had in front of us."

So we've been very pleased with the way we've been able to execute. Honestly, as we think about from a year ago to now, I think what has been extremely beneficial to us is our ability to grow with existing clients. So in the past, we've talked about 2/3 of the growth comes from existing, 1/3 from new. If we take a look at how the year actually progressed, we actually saw with existing clients the ability between retention and expansion to be nearly 3/4 of it. That doesn't mean that new business didn't grow. In fact, it grew at the same pace as in the past, Kevin. But what we saw was our ability from many of our investments to really resonate with our existing and even our largest clients. So we do look at new business going forward continuing to do well. As I think about the course of the year, we actually had more in terms of volume. The average transaction price might be a bit lower, but we made that up from volume, and I think that just reflects the virtual environment and the situation that we're in. But it continues to be a key part of our overall growth."

And in terms of major changes, I would say no, other than really, again, enhancing on the areas that we think we can leverage across the firm types or, quite frankly, operationally where we can provide them more bandwidth to spend more time with clients."

Thanks for joining us today. I'm pleased to share that we delivered strong fourth quarter and full year results. We ended the year with record organic ASV plus professional services growth of $68 million for",1293,"Thank you, Rima, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'm pleased to share that we delivered strong fourth quarter and full year results. 
We ended the year with record organic ASV plus professional services growth of $68 million for the quarter, crossing the $100 million annual ASV threshold for the first time and soundly beating the top end of our guidance. Our year-on-year organic ASV growth rate accelerated 200 basis points to over 7%, and we delivered annual revenue of $1.6 billion and adjusted EPS of $11.20.  
Our outperformance was driven by 2 years of planned accelerated investments in content and technology, which is paying dividends. FactSet's goal to be the leading open content and analytics platform is resonating in the marketplace and increasing our wallet share with clients. Our targeted investment in new content sets was a significant ASV driver in fiscal '21 and fueled our workstation growth. The continued development of our deep sector coverage improved sell-side retention and expansion with our largest banking clients and helped secure our new business.  
Content and technology were both key to our expansion with wealth management firms, where we landed important wins, including with the Royal Bank of Canada and Raymond James Canada. These wins were due to our market-leading data and the launch of FactSet's Advisor Dashboard. We are also expanding our addressable market by increasing our content and delivery capabilities across the front, middle and back office. 
We added meaningful ASV from our cloud and API solutions this year, including delivering more data through the cloud and cloud-based platforms; entity mapping and linking client data through our data management services or DMS; and unlocking opportunity in new workflows by unbundling our components to plug and play into other third-party systems such as CRMs. 
Cloud delivery, coupled with the strength of our DMS and Concordance as a service solutions, enable our clients to centralize, integrate and analyze disparate data sources for faster and more cost-effective decision-making. This has been a major driver for our CTS business.  
As we look ahead to 2022 and beyond, we remain focused on three things: scaling up our content refinery to provide the most comprehensive and connected set of industry, proprietary and third-party data for the financial market; two, enhancing the client experience by delivering hyper-personalized solutions, so clients can discover meaningful insights faster; and third, driving next-generation workflow-specific solutions for asset managers, asset owners, sell-side, wealth management and corporate clients.  
We added new data and capabilities to further these goals by acquiring differentiated assets over the past year. The addition of Truvalue Labs has grown our ESG offering; BTU Analytics advanced our deep sector content for the energy markets; and Cabot technologies will better support the portfolio analytics workflows of asset managers and asset owners. The progress we have made on our investment plan, along with these acquisitions and our award-winning products, give us a distinct competitive advantage.  
Turning now to our financial results. We accelerated our organic ASV plus professional services growth to 7.2%. Our strong performance was driven by stellar execution from our sales and client-facing teams throughout the entire year and especially in the fourth quarter. Our buy-side and sell-side growth rates increased 100 and 400 basis points, respectively, since the third quarter, reflecting higher sales across our key clients.  
On a year-over-year basis, we saw an increase in ASV growth rates from high single digit to double digits across banks, asset owners, hedge funds, data providers, wealth managers and corporates, including private equity and venture capital funds. We capitalized on the strength of our end markets, particularly in banking, and landed several large deals in our wealth and CTS businesses.  
Turning now to our geographic segments. We saw acceleration in every region. ASV growth in the Americas rose to 7% in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by increased sales to our banking, corporate and wealth clients. We also had a large data partner win this quarter in CTS. Asia Pac had a record ASV quarter and delivered a growth rate of 12%. We saw wins across many countries with global and regional banks as well as our research management products. CTS and analytics also contributed to growth with wins across asset managers and data providers. EMEA accelerated to a 6% growth rate, driven by strong performance with data providers, asset managers and banking clients. And CTS had the highest contribution to this region, followed by research. 
Now turning to our businesses. Research was the largest contributor to our ASV growth this year with a growth rate of 6%, driven by very strong growth on the sell side at 12%. We increased research workstation users by 86% this quarter versus a year ago with growth across both sell-side and buy-side clients. Increasing our workstation presence and footprint with our largest clients positions us very well for cross-selling opportunities in the future.  
Analytics and trading accelerated in the second half in fiscal 2021 versus the first half, ending the year at a 6% growth rate. We saw wins across performance and reporting, front office and core analytics solutions. Within front office solutions, we are really pleased to see larger wins with our trading platform and believe this will be a contributor to analytics going into next year.  
CTS grew 16%, driven by core company data and data management solutions sold through an increasing number of channels. CTS had robust sales to data providers this year and expanded their footprint across multiple workflows within middle and back office functions at asset management and banking clients. Additionally, while all Truvalue Labs' ESG sales are excluded from our organic numbers, I'm pleased to report that ESG data sales were a contributor to CTS's overall growth this quarter.  
Wealth ended the year with a 6% growth rate. Wealth workstations grew 24% year-over-year, and they, alongside FactSet's Advisor Dashboard, have been the biggest contributors to winning new clients. We've seen a combination of large- and medium-sized wins as existing clients continue to expand their advisory businesses, and we are equally pleased with our new business wins. We are also seeing cross-selling opportunities with analytics products as wealth managers increasingly look to advance the sophistication of their offerings.  
Moving forward with fiscal '22, we will report three workflow solutions. We are combining the desktop portion of the wealth business with research into one business to be known as research and advisory. We believe this is the right strategy to further our goals to holistically manage our desktop solutions, accelerate the build-out of differentiated front office solutions and facilitate the global expansion and adoption of StreetAccount news and FactSet web. We have also taken the wealth digital business and combined it with CTS to better align our digital solutions.  
In summary, we are entering fiscal '22 with strong momentum and a solid pipeline as reflected in our annual ASV guidance. The need for more differentiated content and analytics is at an unprecedented high. And we are perfectly positioned to capture this demand and poised to deliver best-in-class workflows and a hyper-personalized experience for our clients. I'm proud of our company's strong performance in fiscal '21. We have advanced our digital platform, executed at a high level and strengthened our relationship with clients.  
I'll now turn it over to Helen, who for the last time as CFO, will discuss our fourth quarter and full year performance in more detail and take you through our fiscal 2022 guidance. I want to thank Helen for leading our global finance organization in the past 3 years. And I'm confident that as our Chief Revenue Officer, she will bring a disciplined, growth-oriented mindset in the same rigor to the sales organization as she did leading finance, enabling us to continue our success going forward."

I'm happy to be here with you today, and I hope that we will continue to engage even after I fully transition to my sales role.

I'm happy to be here with you today, and I hope that we will continue to engage even after I fully transition to my sales role. 
Like Phil, I want to congratulate FactSetters around the world for achieving outstanding results in fiscal 2021. While we have continued primarily to operate remotely, I am so impressed with the resilience with which our FactSet teams are able to serve our global clients. Our 7% top line growth this year is a testament to the hard work of our teams and validates our strategy to invest in content and technology, capitalize on market trends and address client needs.  
Throughout this fiscal year, we accelerated our growth rate in ASV plus professional services through consistent conversion of our pipeline, delivering over $100 million in ASV growth and surpassing our most recent guidance for the year. Full year revenue also exceeded our target as we realized more revenue from ASV booked early in the fourth quarter. 
We generated solid earnings through disciplined expense management and operating leverage. Driving sustainable long-term growth requires continued investment back into the business as reflected by our increased spend on differentiated content and cloud-enabled technology. We executed our plan well. And our operating results are in line with expectations due to higher revenue and productivity gains with higher adjusted operating income and growth in adjusted EPS. 
Let me now walk you through the specifics of our fourth quarter. Before I explain the quarterly results, I want to remind everyone that our prior year fourth quarter GAAP results were impacted by a one-time noncash charge of approximately $17 million related to an impairment of an investment in a third party. Thus, any year-over-year comparison of GAAP operating results for the fourth quarter of 2021 should take that into consideration. 
As you saw on the previous slide, our organic ASV plus professional services growth rate was 7.2%. This increase reflects the higher demand for our solutions as clients execute on their own digital transformation. Our success in solving their workflow challenges has resulted in higher levels of both client retention and cross-selling activity. 
For the quarter, GAAP revenue increased by 7% to $412 million. Organic revenue, which excludes any impact from foreign exchange, acquisitions and deferred revenue amortization, also increased 7% to $410 million. Growth was driven by our analytics, CTS and research solutions. For our geographic segments, organic revenue for the Americas grew to 6%; EMEA grew to 7%; and Asia Pacific to 12%. All regions primarily benefited from increases in our analytics and CTS solutions.  
GAAP operating expenses grew 3% in the fourth quarter to $293 million, impacted by a higher cost of services. Compared to the previous year, our GAAP operating margin increased by 320 basis points to 28.9% and our adjusted operating margin decreased by 150 basis points to 31.6%. 
As a percentage of revenue, our cost of services was 10 basis points higher than last year on a GAAP basis and flat to last year on an adjusted basis. The increase is primarily driven by growth in compensation comprised of: higher salary expenses for existing employees; new hires to support a multiyear investment plan; and higher bonus accrual in line with stronger-than-anticipated ASV performance. 
SG&A expenses, when expressed as a percentage of revenue, improved year-over-year by 330 basis points on a GAAP basis but increased 170 basis points on an adjusted basis. The primary drivers include higher compensation costs, reflecting the same factors as noted in the cost of services.  
Moving on, our tax rate for the quarter was 15% higher than the prior year's tax rate of 7%, primarily due to lower tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation in the current quarter as well as a tax benefit related to finalizing the prior year's tax returns. 
GAAP EPS increased 15% to $2.63 this quarter versus $2.29 in the prior year. Again, this improvement is primarily a result of the impairment charge we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020. Adjusted diluted EPS remained flat year-over-year at $2.88. Adjusted EPS was driven by higher revenues, offset by higher operating expenses and an increase in the tax rate. A reconciliation of our adjustments to GAAP EPS is included at the end of our press release.  
Free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations less capital spending, was $171 million for the quarter, an increase of 18% over the same period last year. This increase is primarily due to higher net income, improved collections and the timing of certain tax payments. For the fourth quarter, our ASV retention remained above 95% and our client retention improved to 91%, which again speaks to the demand for our solutions and excellent execution by our sales teams. 
Compared to the prior year, we grew our total number of clients by 10% to over 6,400, largely due to the addition of more wealth and corporate clients. And our user count grew 14% year-over-year and crossed the total of 160,000 primarily driven by sales in our wealth and research solutions, and in particular, in the number of banking users.  
For the quarter, we repurchased over 265,000 shares of our common stock at a total cost of $93 million with an average share price of $348. For the year, we repurchased 265 million of our shares and increased our dividend for the 22nd consecutive year. With share repurchases and dividends, on an annual basis, we have returned to shareholders almost 70% as a percentage of free cash flow and proceeds from employee stock options. We remain disciplined in our buyback program and committed to returning long-term value to our shareholders.  
Turning now to our outlook for fiscal year 2022. We delivered outstanding results in the back half of 2021 and believe this pace will carry into our next fiscal year. For organic ASV plus professional services, we are guiding to an incremental $105 million to $135 million. The midpoint of this range represents a 7% increase, which is equal to this year's organic growth rate, reflecting continued momentum in our business. 
We are confident in our ability to perform at the high standard we demonstrated in fiscal '21 with underlying drivers to include disciplined execution and continued benefits from our investments. We expect growth to be driven largely with existing clients through high retention and cross-selling. In addition, we expect our ability to successfully sell new business in this virtual environment to continue.  
Our recent investments in digital and content are providing us with more opportunities to sell direct solutions tailored for specific workflows. Drivers of future growth would include: first, the retention and expansion of our sell-side client base through our deep sector strategy as we launch new targeted industries in addition to new private markets offerings; second, new wins with wealth managers, who have been responding well to our web-based workstation and personalized Advisor Dashboard; and third, growth with institutional asset management clients, who benefit from our data management solutions and enhanced capabilities in front office and ESG workflows.  
We are mindful about the global environment and potential future market disruptions. But we believe we have the right offerings and strategy to maintain our high performance and growth rate into fiscal 2022. From an operational perspective, we plan for continued labor productivity and operating leverage. In addition to our multiyear investment plan, new investments will be made in content and front office solutions, funded in part by ongoing cost discipline, including permanent savings related to the pandemic and additional efficiency actions. 
As a result of higher growth in revenues and continued cost discipline, we are guiding to an expansion in our operating margins. Combined with our consistent use of capital for share repurchases, we expect to accelerate growth in our diluted EPS, both on a GAAP and adjusted basis. We are seeing the results of our investments take hold in both technology and content. As we look to fiscal 2022, we are focused on delivering more value to clients, prioritizing our resources and ensuring execution excellence.  
As I transition to my new role, I am seeing firsthand the experience and skills of our sales team in adapting to meet the needs of the market.

My question, more on the research side, and this is the first year where we've seen such a massive acceleration to 6%, as you mentioned, your deep content as well as technology transformation bearing fruit. I was wondering if you could provide more color. It looks like it's been driven by new wins, client retention. But if you can just talk about how do we think about this research and advisory growth going forward, is that kind of growth sustainable given your deep sector strategy?"

Yes, we're very pleased with how our research business performed this year. Clearly, we had very good performance on the sell side and the investment that we made in new content really helped drive new logos, expansion at existing clients and helped with retention. So that was a big driver on the sell side. However, the research business grew at a healthy clip in lots of different firm types. So we did very well on a relative basis to last year within institutional asset management. We did well with corporates, hedge funds, a number of different firm types. 
So it was pretty broad-based. You can see that we grew our workstations by, I think, 14% over the last year. So just getting that footprint is really important for us moving forward to cross-sell. And we closed lots of new logos. So my hats off to the research team. They've done an amazing job and just really a monster quarter from the sales team in terms of going out and executing on all the opportunities we had in front of us."

So we've been very pleased with the way we've been able to execute. Honestly, as we think about from a year ago to now, I think what has been extremely beneficial to us is our ability to grow with existing clients. So in the past, we've talked about 2/3 of the growth comes from existing, 1/3 from new. If we take a look at how the year actually progressed, we actually saw with existing clients the ability between retention and expansion to be nearly 3/4 of it. 
That doesn't mean that new business didn't grow. In fact, it grew at the same pace as in the past, Kevin. But what we saw was our ability from many of our investments to really resonate with our existing and even our largest clients. So we do look at new business going forward continuing to do well. As I think about the course of the year, we actually had more in terms of volume. The average transaction price might be a bit lower, but we made that up from volume. And I think that just reflects the virtual environment and the situation that we're in. But it continues to be a key part of our overall growth."

You might have -- I think I may have mentioned it in that quarter. We also had one other loss on the digital side, which was not related to wealth but another anticipated cancel.

Managing data is expensive and FactSet is really expert at that. So that is one area that we're seeing really good growth from, particularly as we make those services available through new channels such as cloud providers that we already spoke about. 
We've done traditionally well with performance workflows as well. This was a very good year for us with our Benchmark DataFeed. So FactSet does a lot of work to integrate all of the different benchmarks and indexes that are out there that feed into a client's own performance system.

I believe back then, we articulated that we would exit the year with a 33% margin, which is, I think, I believe, the middle of our guidance here for this year. 
And our aspiration was to get to double-digit EPS growth. I think if you look at the midpoint of our guidance, it's high single digits. But that doesn't mean if we execute well, we can't get to that thing. So I couldn't be prouder of our company. We've all worked exceptionally hard over the last 2 years. And it's really great to see this level of performance. And we're really optimistic as we go into FY '22."

Before I begin, let me start by welcoming Kendra, who recently became FactSet's Head of Investor Relations. Kendra has worked at FactSet for more than 2 decades, most recently serving as my Chief of Staff. She brings a deep knowledge of the company and industry expertise to her new role. I look forward to working with Kendra to continue growing our Investor Relations program.
I'd also like to welcome Linda to her first earnings call as a member of the FactSet team. We are excited to have her here and have already begun leveraging her deep financial and operational expertise as we continue to execute our growth strategy.
Turning to our performance. FactSet is off to a strong start to fiscal 2022, and I'm pleased to share that this quarter had the highest Q1 incremental ASV on record. Building on the momentum from Q4, we grew organic ASV plus professional services by 9% year-over-year in Q1. The strong performance of our sales and client-facing teams carry forward from Q4, increasing the pace of our go-to-market strategy. These teams continue to drive increased retention and expansion rates among our existing clients while achieving a high number of new business wins.
The biggest contributor to this quarter's growth were institutional asset management clients as we continue to see strength in our workstation and accelerating growth in our analytics workflow solutions. The last 2 years of accelerated investments in content and technology continue to drive top line growth. We are seeing increased demand for differentiated content and workflow solutions. FactSet's leading open content and analytics platform is allowing us to meet this demand and capture more share of wallet with our clients.
By client type, wins were broad-based. We saw double-digit ASV growth rates from our banking, wealth, hedge fund and corporate clients as well as private equity and venture capital funds and partners. Our investments in content and technology, including deep sector, wealth and analytics solutions continue to support client retention rates and renewals across the board. Overall, we are pleased that our performance resulted in a 13% increase in adjusted EPS from the prior year period. Our adjusted operating margin of 33.6% exceeds our guidance. Linda will walk you through the details in a few minutes.
We are now in the final year of our multiyear investment plan, and we remain on track to achieve our goals. Our focus is on our digital platform, scaling our content refinery and creating hyperpersonalized workflow solutions. Within our content refinery, ESG, data for wealth, private markets and deep sector are all fueling workstation growth. We continue to grow our deep sector data, launching real estate and technology, media and telecom in November. Deep sector and our investments in private markets have translated into growth and higher retention within sell-side firms. And our recent acquisition of Cobalt further advances our private market strategy by connecting differentiated data with tracking and portfolio monitoring, providing value to our private equity and venture capital clients.
Our workflow solutions, which deliver efficiencies across the front, middle and back office continue to add meaningful ASV. Our analytics APIs are resonating with our clients, and we are increasingly integrating with cloud-based platforms. Earlier this month, we launched over 90 data sets and a number of APIs on Amazon Data Exchange, the first major data and analytics provider to do so. Our trading business continues to grow, bolstered by the recent addition of fixed income support for trade execution. This enables our clients to surface new insights and trade across asset classes with greater speed and efficiency, and was a significant contributor to the growth of our Analytics & Trading business during the quarter. 
Our product teams are focused on identifying, developing and implementing made-for client workflow solutions for each of our client types. This has been incredibly successful within wealth as our adviser dashboard maintains a healthy pipeline and solid client engagement for FY '22. We see this hyperpersonalization as a key differentiator and are committed to working with our clients to evolve our offering.
Looking across our regions, we saw continued strength in ASV growth across all our markets. The Americas was the biggest contributor as organic ASV growth accelerated to 9%, supported by broad-based strength across our businesses. This was driven by strong retention and expansion among asset managers and asset owners. The region also benefited from capturing higher price increases.
In EMEA, growth accelerated to 7%, consistently improving over the past 3 quarters. Research and Advisory had a particularly positive impact driven by improved retention among asset managers and wealth clients and strong workstation sales to new customers.
Asia Pacific had another robust quarter with growth accelerating to 14% driven primarily by CTS. We again saw wins across many countries with hedge funds, asset managers and asset owners driving ASV growth.
In summary, I am proud of the FactSet team for delivering such strong results to the start of the year. The first quarter, as you know, is historically a slower start to the fiscal year and not necessarily an indication of our performance for the rest of the year. However, our momentum from Q4 has continued, and we are well positioned to deliver on our targets for the year. As such, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2022 guidance and we remain confident in our pipeline and in the value we are delivering to our clients.
Looking ahead, we continue to focus on 3 strategic priorities: scaling up our content refinery, enhancing the client experience through hyperpersonalized solutions and delivering next-generation workflow solutions for clients. And we believe that our people, culture and performance-driven mindset will enable us to execute on these priorities as we accelerate the pace of change. We are committed to investing in and developing the talent experience and the skills of our team as we build the industry's leading open content and analytics platform.
Finally, an important milestone in our company's history occurred earlier this week when FactSet became part of the S&P 500 Index. Our addition was, in fact, predicted by our S&P 500 constituent's prediction signal on October 1. Our inclusion is a proud moment for FactSet and a testament to our tremendous growth and our efforts to help our clients do their best work. Our team's creativity, dedication and collaborative spirit make us a trusted partner and I'm tremendously proud of their drive to create smarter, more innovative solutions for our clients.
I'll now turn it over to Linda, who will take you through the specifics of our first quarter performance."

I'm really pleased to be here today as part of the FactSet team. I've been at FactSet for just a few months, but in that short time, it's become clear that the company has been performing really well from accelerating top line growth and strong free cash flow generation to its long history of consistent and growing shareholder returns. And there's still a lot of runway ahead of us as the investments made over the past 2 years are paying off and driving growth. There is undeniably a great deal of talent across the organization. I look forward to working with the team to build on FactSet's history of outstanding performance while generating meaningful value for shareholders.
Looking now at the first quarter, as you have seen from our press release this morning, we are pleased to report acceleration in our top line with high single-digit growth, both in terms of revenue and organic ASV plus professional services. I'll now share more details on our first quarter performance.
First, on ASV, we grew organic ASV plus professional services by 9%. As Phil noted previously, we typically see a seasonal deceleration in Q1. Our performance reflects increased demand for our content and product, higher retention and our ability to realize higher pricing. The marketplace has been supportive with solid workstation growth in banking and greater demands for our portfolio analytics solutions. As market conditions continue to evolve, our subscription-based ASV will continue to support value-based pricing.
GAAP revenue increased by 9% to $425 million, while organic revenue, which excludes any impact from foreign exchange and acquisitions, increased 9% to $423 million. Growth was driven primarily by Analytics & Trading and Research & Advisory. All regions experienced notable year-over-year growth. For our geographic segments on an organic basis, Americas revenue grew 9%, EMEA also came in at 9% and Asia Pac revenues grew at 14%. Main drivers in the region were analytics, CTS and workstation growth.
Turning now to expenses. GAAP operating expenses grew 13% in the first quarter to $302 million impacted by anticipated changes incurred during the period. We recorded a restructuring charge of $9 million to drive a more efficient and empowered organizational structure. Ongoing savings from this realignment will primarily be used for product reinvestment and key talent retention. In addition, we recognized $4 million of expense related to vacating certain office space in New York City. We recently pulled our employees on optimal work arrangements and consistent with what we see in the market, a vast majority prefer a hybrid or remote working model. Given this preference, we are reassessing our real estate footprint to better reflect our new work arrangements.
Also in Q1, we incorporated the FactSet Charitable Foundation to facilitate our corporate social responsibility goals. Compared to the previous year, our GAAP operating margin decreased by 230 basis points to 29%, and our adjusted operating margin decreased by 70 basis points to 34%. As stated before, this exceeds our guidance on this measure. Our increased expenses were partially offset by lower compensation expense. As a percentage of revenue, our cost of sales was 32 basis points higher than last year on a GAAP basis and 72 basis points lower on an adjusted basis. This reflects increased data and infrastructure costs and higher compensation expense for our existing employee base. These expenses also include our ongoing shift to the public cloud as part of our digital transformation and multiyear investment plan. Lower personnel expenses partially offset these increases.
When expressed on a percentage basis of revenue, SG&A was 198 basis points higher year-over-year on a GAAP basis and 145 basis points higher on an adjusted basis. The primary drivers include increased employee compensation, higher bonus accrual and real estate exit costs. This was partially offset by lower stock compensation year-over-year.
Turning now to taxes. Our tax rate for the quarter was 10% compared to last year's rate of 16%. This lower rate was due to a tax benefit from the exercise of stock options as a result of our record stock price. This caused the annual estimated benefit to be higher than expected. The lower annual rate was partially offset by higher-than-expected U.S. income.
GAAP EPS increased 7% to $2.79 this quarter versus $2.62 in the prior year. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 13% to $3.25, driven by higher revenues and a lower tax rate. A reconciliation of our adjustments to GAAP EPS is provided at the end of our press release.
Free cash flow, which we defined as cash generated from operations less capital spending, was $64 million for the quarter, a decrease of 9% over the same period last year. This was primarily due to the timing of tax payments, higher year-over-year employee bonus payments and a reduction in capital expenditures related to facilities build-outs.
Our ASV retention remained at greater than 95%. We grew the total number of clients by 14% compared to the prior year, which continues to be driven by the addition of more wealth and corporate clients. Our client retention improved to 92% year-over-year, which speaks to the success of our products and investments and the efforts of our sales teams.
For the first quarter, we repurchased 46,200 shares of our common stock for a total of $19 million at an average per share price of $403. We remain disciplined in our buyback program and committed to returning long-term value to our shareholders.
We are reaffirming our guidance for 2022. And as we often say, our business is a tale of 2 halves. While it is clear that our momentum from Q4 has continued and we believe that we are well positioned to deliver on our targets, it's still early in the fiscal year. We remain focused on developing our content, technology and people and delivering value for our shareholders.
And with that, we're now ready for questions. Operator?"

They had a very strong quarter relative to the other phone types. I think it was the biggest contributor on an absolute basis relative to last year.

So far, everything is going great. It's been about 10 weeks. And for this quarter, we've been able to pair some pretty terrific top line growth with our start on what we're going to do on working on the margin. So you probably saw, we did a $9 million restructuring charge as well as a $3.7 million real estate charge. And on the margin front, we've talked about the need to focus on 4 big buckets of cost, which would be compensation, technology, real estate and third-party data. So what you're seeing here is the out-of-the-box first efforts here to make sure we've got the margin plan moving along. And this is a best practice, obviously, that has worked in other places.
So the $9 million restructuring charge, we were able to take about 5% off the compensation line. We increased spans of control for the managers, and we reduced the number of layers in the corporation by 1. So that efficiency was very, very helpful to us. We've also been very careful about headcount additions. Headcount is about flat for this quarter. And we did invest some of that 5% savings from the comp line back into key talent and high potential employee performance compensation for those folks.
On the real estate line, as we said, we've got to take a look at our real estate footprint given that a number of our employees are very excited about continued flexibility. The analysis here is to look at the real estate line, think about what we can best do to get the footprint rightsized. And we haven't come to a conclusion yet on that because we have to make sure that the offices work well for the employees. But we're starting on our margin journey here. You see that the margin exceeded the guidance for the GAAP operating margin.
And on capital allocation, we've begun our discussions. No official decisions quite yet. We will be releasing our 10-Q early in January, and we'll see where we get to after that. But so far, so good. Good focus on margin, good focus on capital allocation. And we're also looking to be more specific about the returns on our investments that we've made. Not quite there yet on that one but Phil will be speaking some more about the fact that we've continued to invest through the pandemic, and that is really paying off for us now.

There is still quite a bit of work to do to finish off the work that we set out 3 years ago. So we're on track for deep sector. So we -- as I talked about in the script, we released a couple more industries there. So we've got a few more to go. We continue to build out our ESG coverage. So we're very excited about the Truvalue Labs acquisition that's growing at a good clip. And one of our -- one of the things we do well when we acquire data like that is just continue to build it out in terms of coverage. So there's a lot of effort behind that.
And then on the private market side, that's a relatively new area for us. We're super excited about the Cobalt acquisition. But we're just going to continue to build out what we can offer there from both the data and workflow standpoint. So I'd say on the content side, those are still very exciting and still a ton of runway, and we think we can take a lot of market share once we complete all of those. And then I would say on the software side, it's really this concept of next best action. So we've seen a lot of interest in our adviser dashboard, which has been sold to a number of wealth firms. And that really, as we've spoken about, allows an adviser to sift through the noise and sort of understand what he or she may want to do as the first 10 things on any given day. We're going to extend that concept to other firm types and other workflows. So it's still early days for that, but we do think that, that's going to be an important differentiator for us as a firm."

So we're seeing very good adoption of the front office solutions. And I think the release of our fixed income trading capabilities should provide some good upside in the future.
So on the front office side, we feel good there. We've put a lot of effort into integrating those assets that we bought a few years ago. We've released our portfolio management platform, and we're seeing a ton of interest.
In the middle office, we had a very good quarter as well. In fact, a lot of what drove analytics was good old portfolio analysis, and we saw very good uptick there, and that had been sort of flat for a while. So that's sort of a testament, I think, to us continuing to invest in that product and some of the work we've done there to just continue to execute well on the sales front.
So we just see a ton of opportunity. I mean it's, I think, around a $600 million business today. I think that's what we reported at the end of last fiscal year, but it's really nice to see the growth rate of that segment of our business, which has been differentiating for FactSet and should be moving forward. There's a lot of excitement amongst the team and that's what's been driving, I think, the improved relative performance on the buy side."

So what we're going to do is we're going to look at all 4 of these buckets very carefully, benchmark them and see what action we should take. And what you've seen this quarter, as I said, is a start on that path. So our guidance for this year is 32.5% to 33.5% adjusted operating margin. We're ahead of that for this quarter, which is really good. Very hard to predict the margin sequentially. So we're just going to stick with the annual guidance. And we have a very sharp eye on the margin focus at this point.
On capital allocation, I think you're right, as we move toward Investor Day, which is currently scheduled for April 5, we'll see what happens as every day is a new day with COVID. We would like to talk a little bit more about this. I think directionally many of the companies in this space are sort of investment-grade companies in the BAA, BBB space.

This first quarter has run exceptionally strong in terms of sales, as Phil has detailed. One of the things that we noted as a result of that, which makes it difficult to talk about the margin quarter-over-quarter is the performance plans and the bonus plans associated partially with the sales team and with the rest of the corporation. So for example, last year, we put up $15 million for the performance plan. And this year, in fact, that number is $21 million, just to show you the difference in the strength between Q1 this year versus last year. So we will continue to work hard on making progress on the margin. We took some of these charges earlier in the year so that we are hopeful that the run rate will improve as we move through the year. But in terms of headwinds, we've got some choppiness coming from what the Fed has discussed. And potentially as the semicon situation continues. So we think we're doing and taking the right actions on our part, Alex, but it's kind of hard to tell with this market environment being as choppy as it is.

Phil's also been really modest and hasn't mentioned that, that growth is very broad-based. This is not being done on the back of 1 or 2 mega deals or anything like that. It is singles and doubles again and again and again with clients who are telling us that the investments that we've made over the past 2 years when many other providers stood still or pulled back, that time has really given us -- and the money has given us the opportunity to really have the best-in-class products for our clients, which is really very, very exciting.
Secondly, in terms of how we did this quarter and if you bring it down to the EPS line, looking at our comparison of this year over last year, it's a pretty impressive performance. Last year, on the adjusted diluted EPS, we were at $2.88. This year, we're at $3.25 and we looked at some of the flash reports and a lot of that was attributed to tax and a lower tax rate because of options exercise. That's true. But if you take the beat of $0.37, about half is from the operating side and about half is from the tax side. So even if we had no change in tax rate, we would have beaten by about $0.20. So we feel pretty good about that, and we think it's a testament to the strength of the business. So the next steps are increased focus on the margin, which I talked about, increased focus on the capital allocation and just really make sure that we're running the company as efficiently as we can.
It hasn't been spoken to, George, but last year, in addition, we had $18.5 million in CapEx we spent in the first quarter. This year, it's down to $8.6 million. Part of that last year was the build-out of our Manila office. But with that gone, CapEx has come down a bit. So as Phil said, we kind of see the hump here in terms of this investment program that we've had. But while there were a lot of doubters 2 years ago, it seems to be paying off. So we're pretty excited about all of that. I hope that helps."

Before I begin, let me start by welcoming Kendra, who recently became FactSet's Head of Investor Relations. Kendra has worked at FactSet for more than 2 decades, most recently serving as my Chief of Staff. She brings a deep knowledge of the company and industry expertise to her new role. I look forward to working with Kendra to continue growing our Investor Relations program.
I'd also like to welcome Linda to her first earnings call as a member of the FactSet team. We are excited to have her here and have already begun leveraging her deep financial and operational expertise as we continue to execute our growth strategy.
Turning to our performance. FactSet is off to a strong start to fiscal 2022, and I'm pleased to share that this quarter had the highest Q1 incremental ASV on record. Building on the momentum from Q4, we grew organic ASV plus professional services by 9% year-over-year in Q1. The strong performance of our sales and client-facing teams carry forward from Q4, increasing the pace of our go-to-market strategy. These teams continue to drive increased retention and expansion rates among our existing clients while achieving a high number of new business wins. The biggest contributor to this quarter's growth were institutional asset management clients as we continue to see strength in our workstation and accelerating growth in our analytics workflow solutions. 
The last 2 years of accelerated investments in content and technology continue to drive top line growth. We are seeing increased demand for differentiated content and workflow solutions. FactSet's leading open content and analytics platform is allowing us to meet this demand and capture more share of wallet with our clients.
By client type, wins were broad-based. We saw double-digit ASV growth rates from our banking, wealth, hedge fund and corporate clients as well as private equity and venture capital funds and partners. Our investments in content and technology, including deep sector, wealth and analytics solutions continue to support client retention rates and renewals across the board. Overall, we are pleased that our performance resulted in a 13% increase in adjusted EPS from the prior year period. Our adjusted operating margin of 33.6% exceeds our guidance. Linda will walk you through the details in a few minutes.
We are now in the final year of our multiyear investment plan, and we remain on track to achieve our goals. Our focus is on our digital platform, scaling our content refinery and creating hyperpersonalized workflow solutions. Within our content refinery, ESG, data for wealth, private markets and deep sector are all fueling workstation growth. We continue to grow our deep sector data, launching real estate and technology, media and telecom in November. Deep sector and our investments in private markets have translated into growth and higher retention within sell-side firms. And our recent acquisition of Cobalt further advances our private market strategy by connecting differentiated data with tracking and portfolio monitoring, providing value to our private equity and venture capital clients.
Our workflow solutions, which deliver efficiencies across the front, middle and back office, continue to add meaningful ASV. Our analytics APIs are resonating with our clients, and we are increasingly integrating with cloud-based platforms. Earlier this month, we launched over 90 data sets and a number of APIs on Amazon Data Exchange, the first major data and analytics provider to do so. Our trading business continues to grow, bolstered by the recent addition of fixed income support for trade execution. This enables our clients to surface new insights and trade across asset classes with greater speed and efficiency, and was a significant contributor to the growth of our analytics and trading business during the quarter. 
Our product teams are focused on identifying, developing and implementing made-for client workflow solutions for each of our client types. This has been incredibly successful within wealth as our adviser dashboard maintains a healthy pipeline and solid client engagement for FY '22. We see this hyperpersonalization as a key differentiator and are committed to working with our clients to evolve our offering.
Looking across our regions, we saw continued strength in ASV growth across all our markets. The Americas was the biggest contributor as organic ASV growth accelerated to 9%, supported by broad-based strength across our businesses. This was driven by strong retention and expansion among asset managers and asset owners. The region also benefited from capturing higher price increases.
In EMEA, growth accelerated to 7%, consistently improving over the past 3 quarters. Research and advisory had a particularly positive impact driven by improved retention among asset managers and wealth clients and strong workstation sales to new customers.
Asia Pacific had another robust quarter with growth accelerating to 14%, driven primarily by CTS. We again saw wins across many countries with hedge funds, asset managers and asset owners driving ASV growth.
In summary, I am proud of the FactSet team for delivering such strong results to the start of the year. The first quarter, as you know, is historically a slower start to the fiscal year and not necessarily an indication of our performance for the rest of the year. However, our momentum from Q4 has continued, and we are well positioned to deliver on our targets for the year. As such, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2022 guidance and we remain confident in our pipeline and in the value we are delivering to our clients.
Looking ahead, we continue to focus on 3 strategic priorities: scaling up our content refinery, enhancing the client experience through hyperpersonalized solutions and delivering next-generation workflow solutions for clients. And we believe that our people, culture and performance-driven mindset will enable us to execute on these priorities as we accelerate the pace of change. We are committed to investing in and developing the talent experience and the skills of our team as we build the industry's leading open content and analytics platform.
Finally, an important milestone in our company's history occurred earlier this week when FactSet became part of the S&P 500 Index. Our addition was, in fact, predicted by our S&P 500 constituent's prediction signal on October 1. Our inclusion is a proud moment for FactSet and a testament to our tremendous growth and our efforts to help our clients do their best work. Our team's creativity, dedication and collaborative spirit make us a trusted partner, and I'm tremendously proud of their drive to create smarter, more innovative solutions for our clients.
I'll now turn it over to Linda, who will take you through the specifics of our first quarter performance."

I'm really pleased to be here today as part of the FactSet team. I've been at FactSet for just a few months, but in that short time, it's become clear that the company has been performing really well, from accelerating top line growth and strong free cash flow generation to its long history of consistent and growing shareholder returns. And there's still a lot of runway ahead of us as the investments made over the past 2 years are paying off and driving growth. There is undeniably a great deal of talent across the organization. I look forward to working with the team to build on FactSet's history of outstanding performance while generating meaningful value for shareholders.
Looking now at the first quarter, as you have seen from our press release this morning, we are pleased to report acceleration in our top line with high single-digit growth, both in terms of revenue and organic ASV plus professional services. I'll now share more details on our first quarter performance.
First, on ASV, we grew organic ASV plus professional services by 9%. As Phil noted previously, we typically see a seasonal deceleration in Q1. Our performance reflects increased demand for our content and product, higher retention and our ability to realize higher pricing. The marketplace has been supportive with solid workstation growth in banking and greater demands for our portfolio analytics solutions. As market conditions continue to evolve, our subscription-based ASV will continue to support value-based pricing.
GAAP revenue increased by 9% to $425 million, while organic revenue, which excludes any impact from foreign exchange and acquisitions, increased 9% to $423 million. Growth was driven primarily by analytics and trading and research and advisory.  All regions experienced notable year-over-year growth. For our geographic segments on an organic basis, Americas revenue grew 9%, EMEA also came in at 9% and Asia Pac revenues grew at 14%. Main drivers in the region were analytics, CTS and workstation growth.
Turning now to expenses. GAAP operating expenses grew 13% in the first quarter to $302 million impacted by anticipated changes incurred during the period. We recorded a restructuring charge of $9 million to drive a more efficient and empowered organizational structure. Ongoing savings from this realignment will primarily be used for product reinvestment and key talent retention. In addition, we recognized $4 million of expense related to vacating certain office space in New York City. We recently pulled our employees on optimal work arrangements, and consistent with what we see in the market, a vast majority prefer a hybrid or remote working model. Given this preference, we are reassessing our real estate footprint to better reflect our new work arrangements. Also in Q1, we incorporated the FactSet Charitable Foundation to facilitate our corporate social responsibility goals. 
Compared to the previous year, our GAAP operating margin decreased by 230 basis points to 29%, and our adjusted operating margin decreased by 70 basis points to 34%. As stated before, this exceeds our guidance on this measure. Our increased expenses were partially offset by lower compensation expense. As a percentage of revenue, our cost of sales was 32 basis points higher than last year on a GAAP basis and 72 basis points lower on an adjusted basis. This reflects increased data and infrastructure costs and higher compensation expense for our existing employee base. These expenses also include our ongoing shift to the public cloud as part of our digital transformation and multiyear investment plan. Lower personnel expenses partially offset these increases.
When expressed on a percentage basis of revenue, SG&A was 198 basis points higher year-over-year on a GAAP basis and 145 basis points higher on an adjusted basis. The primary drivers include increased employee compensation, higher bonus accrual and real estate exit costs. This was partially offset by lower stock compensation year-over-year.
Turning now to taxes. Our tax rate for the quarter was 10% compared to last year's rate of 16%. This lower rate was due to a tax benefit from the exercise of stock options as a result of our record stock price. This caused the annual estimated benefit to be higher than expected. The lower annual rate was partially offset by higher-than-expected U.S. income.
GAAP EPS increased 7% to $2.79 this quarter versus $2.62 in the prior year. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 13% to $3.25, driven by higher revenues and a lower tax rate. A reconciliation of our adjustments to GAAP EPS is provided at the end of our press release.
Free cash flow, which we defined as cash generated from operations less capital spending, was $64 million for the quarter, a decrease of 9% over the same period last year. This was primarily due to the timing of tax payments, higher year-over-year employee bonus payments and a reduction in capital expenditures related to facilities build-outs.
Our ASV retention remained at greater than 95%. We grew the total number of clients by 14% compared to the prior year, which continues to be driven by the addition of more wealth and corporate clients. Our client retention improved to 92% year-over-year, which speaks to the success of our products and investments and the efforts of our sales teams.
For the first quarter, we repurchased 46,200 shares of our common stock for a total of $19 million at an average per share price of $403. We remain disciplined in our buyback program and committed to returning long-term value to our shareholders.
We are reaffirming our guidance for 2022. And as we often say, our business is a tale of 2 halves. While it is clear that our momentum from Q4 has continued and we believe that we are well positioned to deliver on our targets, it's still early in the fiscal year. We remain focused on developing our content, technology and people and delivering value for our shareholders.
And with that, we're now ready for questions. Operator?"

The largest segment within that for us, the largest fund type, is just the institutional asset managers where we've seen, obviously, a lot of pressure over the last few years. 
But our solutions are resonating with them. They had a very strong quarter. Relative to the other firm types, I think it was the biggest contributor on an absolute basis relative to last year. So we're really bullish about the buy side and particularly our analytics solutions are beginning to take hold again. So I think there was some pent-up, I think, demand there on the buy side.

So far, everything is going great. It's been about 10 weeks. And for this quarter, we've been able to pair some pretty terrific top line growth with our start on what we're going to do on working on the margin. So you probably saw, we did a $9 million restructuring charge as well as a $3.7 million real estate charge. And on the margin front, we've talked about the need to focus on 4 big buckets of cost, which would be compensation, technology, real estate and third-party data. So what you're seeing here is the out-of-the-box first efforts here to make sure we've got the margin plan moving along. And this is a best practice, obviously, that has worked in other places.
So the $9 million restructuring charge, we were able to take about 5% off the compensation line. We increased spans of control for the managers, and we reduced the number of layers in the corporation by 1. So that efficiency was very, very helpful to us. We've also been very careful about headcount additions. Headcount is about flat for this quarter. And we did invest some of that 5% savings from the comp line back into key talent and high potential employee performance compensation for those folks.
On the real estate line, as we said, we've got to take a look at our real estate footprint given that a number of our employees are very excited about continued flexibility. The analysis here is to look at the real estate line, think about what we can best do to get the footprint rightsized. And we haven't come to a conclusion yet on that because we have to make sure that the offices work well for the employees. But we're starting on our margin journey here. You see that the margin exceeded the guidance for the GAAP operating margin.
And on capital allocation, we've begun our discussions. No official decisions quite yet. We will be releasing our 10-Q early in January, and we'll see where we get to after that. But so far, so good. Good focus on margin, good focus on capital allocation. And we're also looking to be more specific about the returns on our investments that we've made. Not quite there yet on that one, but Phil will be speaking some more about the fact that we've continued to invest through the pandemic, and that is really paying off for us now. We continue to invest where some others pulled back. So, so far, so good, and thanks for the question."

So we -- as I talked about in the script, we released a couple more industries there. So we've got a few more to go. We continue to build out our ESG coverage. So we're very excited about the Truvalue Labs acquisition that's growing at a good clip. And one of our -- one of the things we do well when we acquire data like that is just continue to build it out in terms of coverage. So there's a lot of effort behind that. And then on the private market side, that's a relatively new area for us. We're super excited about the Cobalt acquisition. But we're just going to continue to build out what we can offer there from both the data and workflow standpoint. 
So I'd say on the content side, those are still very exciting and still a ton of runway, and we think we can take a lot of market share once we complete all of those. And then I would say on the software side, it's really this concept of next best action. So we've seen a lot of interest in our adviser dashboard, which has been sold to a number of wealth firms. And that really, as we've spoken about, allows an adviser to sift through the noise and sort of understand what he or she may want to do as the first 10 things on any given day. But we're going to extend that concept to other firm types and other workflows. So it's still early days for that, but we do think that, that's going to be an important differentiator for us as a firm."

And as you know, it's a broad portfolio of solutions and products we have there. So maybe I'll break it down. In terms of our front office solutions, what we have in there are our trading capabilities and we put our new Quants research environment in there. And both of those are doing very well. So we're seeing very good adoption of the front office solutions. And I think the release of our fixed income trading capabilities should provide some good upside in the future.
So on the front office side, we feel good there. We've put a lot of effort into integrating those assets that we bought a few years ago. We've released our portfolio management platform, and we're seeing a ton of interest.
In the middle office, we had a very good quarter as well. In fact, a lot of what drove analytics was good old portfolio analysis, and we saw very good uptick there, and that had been sort of flat for a while. So that's sort of a testament, I think, to us continuing to invest in that product and some of the work we've done there to just continue to execute well on the sales front.
So we just see a ton of opportunity. I mean it's, I think, around a $600 million business today. I think that's what we reported at the end of last fiscal year, but it's really nice to see the growth rate of that segment of our business, which has been differentiating for FactSet and should be moving forward. There's a lot of excitement amongst the team and that's what's been driving, I think, the improved relative performance on the buy side."

So what we're going to do is we're going to look at all 4 of these buckets very carefully, benchmark them and see what action we should take. And what you've seen this quarter, as I said, is a start on that path. So our guidance for this year is 32.5% to 33.5% adjusted operating margin. We're ahead of that for this quarter, which is really good. Very hard to predict the margin sequentially. So we're just going to stick with the annual guidance. And we have a very sharp eye on the margin focus at this point.
On capital allocation, I think you're right. As we move toward Investor Day, which is currently scheduled for April 5, we'll see what happens as every day is a new day with COVID. We would like to talk a little bit more about this. I think directionally many of the companies in this space are sort of investment-grade companies in the BAA, BBB space. I think we'll think about that a little bit further, and we'll give you a little bit more guidance as we move through the next earnings call and Investor Day."

This first quarter has run exceptionally strong in terms of sales, as Phil has detailed. One of the things that we noted as a result of that, which makes it difficult to talk about the margin quarter-over-quarter, is the performance plans and the bonus plans associated partially with the sales team and with the rest of the corporation. 
So for example, last year, we put up $15 million for the performance plan. And this year, in fact, that number is $21 million, just to show you the difference in the strength between Q1 this year versus last year. So we will continue to work hard on making progress on the margin. We took some of these charges earlier in the year so that we are hopeful that the run rate will improve as we move through the year. But in terms of headwinds, we've got some choppiness coming from what the Fed has discussed and, potentially, as the semicon situation continues. So we think we're doing and taking the right actions on our part, Alex, but it's kind of hard to tell with this market environment being as choppy as it is.

So Helen certainly hit the ground running as Chief Revenue Officer. She's doing a great job there.

So we've invested a lot in our information systems over the last few years, as I mentioned. We've done a lot to sort of rationalize the packages on FactSet. Helen is putting some great incentives in there in place for the sales team, which I think were effective in Q1. So there's a lot of levers that we're pulling. And obviously, it's great. The sales team is having a lot of success. 
So we've got a great team at FactSet on the sales front and client service. It's a big team. It might be an order of a couple of thousand people that we have facing off against our clients, but they're all working very well together, having fun and it's great to kind of see this momentum. So we will certainly keep hiring, but we have essentially created a lot of really good salespeople at FactSet from people that come up through the consulting and specialty ranks, and what makes FactSet salespeople so effective is just how well they know our product."

Phil's also been really modest and hasn't mentioned that, that growth is very broad-based. This is not being done on the back of 1 or 2 mega deals or anything like that. It is singles and doubles again and again and again with clients who are telling us that the investments that we've made over the past 2 years when many other providers stood still or pulled back, that time has really given us -- and the money has given us the opportunity to really have the best-in-class products for our clients, which is really very, very exciting.
Secondly, in terms of how we did this quarter and if you bring it down to the EPS line, looking at our comparison of this year over last year, it's a pretty impressive performance. Last year, on the adjusted diluted EPS, we were at $2.88. This year, we're at $3.25 and we looked at some of the flash reports and a lot of that was attributed to tax and a lower tax rate because of options exercise. That's true. But if you take the beat of $0.37, about half is from the operating side and about half is from the tax side. So even if we had no change in tax rate, we would have beaten by about $0.20. So we feel pretty good about that, and we think it's a testament to the strength of the business. So the next steps are increased focus on the margin, which I talked about, increased focus on the capital allocation and just really make sure that we're running the company as efficiently as we can.
It hasn't been spoken to, George, but last year, in addition, we had $18.5 million in CapEx we spent in the first quarter. This year, it's down to $8.6 million. Part of that last year was the build-out of our Manila office. But with that gone, CapEx has come down a bit. So as Phil said, we kind of see the hump here in terms of this investment program that we've had. But while there were a lot of doubters 2 years ago, it seems to be paying off. So we're pretty excited about all of that. I hope that helps."
