I hope everyone in their families remain healthy and that your 2021 is off to a good start. 
In my 35 years in real estate, I can't remember another year, but there's many positive and negative twists in terms in such a short period of time as we saw in 2020. The range of emotions I felt from March when I was worried about the daily safety of our employees and customers, to April when I wondered when rental demand in our sector would return, to September, when we saw some of the strongest occupancy and rental rate fundamentals in our company's history are hard to describe. 
I am proud of our team's resilience and how well they responded to 2020's unprecedented challenges. Our team's efforts, together with our balanced portfolio, sophisticated platform and innovative external growth efforts, yielded a great result in the fourth quarter. We ended the year with same-store occupancy of 94.8%, an all-time year-end high for Extra Space. 
Our elevated occupancy has given us significant pricing power, which we have experienced since August and a return to positive same-store revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2.3%, a 380 basis point acceleration from the third quarter. We also had excellent expense control with a 0.6% decrease in same-store expenses, resulting in 3.4% NOI growth in the quarter. 
Our return to positive NOI gains, coupled with strong external investment activity, yielded core FFO growth of 16.5% in the quarter. Despite the challenges of the year, the fourth quarter was full of accomplishments, including completion of 2 preferred equity investments totaling $350 million, $147 million in acquisitions, $168 million in bridge loan closings, the addition of 44 stores to our management platform and receipt of NAREIT's Leader in the Light Award, recognizing Extra Space for its sustainability efforts. This is the first time a storage company has received this award. 
While we are excited about the accomplishments of 2020, we are even more optimistic about how our efforts have positioned us for 2021. Rentals continue to be steady, and vacates continue to be muted. We are heading into 2021 with the highest occupancy we have ever experienced at this time of year and expect rental rates to remain strong. 
We have already added 51 third-party management stores in 2021. And our acquisition, management and bridge loan pipelines are robust. But we are also mindful of the risks we face. We recognize that current or potential government regulations could impede same-store revenue and expense performance. We believe that vacates may eventually return to more normal levels. And we recognize that the challenges related to new supply have not subsided completely and will continue to suppress rate growth in many markets. As in the past, our team is prepared to use all our available tools to optimize performance in the face of any risks, which materialize. 
In short, despite significant turbulence, we had a very successful 2020 and look forward to an even better 2021. We continue to execute on our strategy to maximize shareholders' long-term value and to deliver the results our shareholders have come to expect from Extra Space Storage. 
I would now like to turn the time over to Scott."

As Joe mentioned, we had a great fourth quarter with reaccelerating same-store revenue growth, driven by all-time high occupancy and strong rental rate growth to new customers. 
Late fees and other income continue to be lower year-over-year and partially offset rental income, but we saw improvement in both line items from levels experienced in the third quarter. We lowered expenses in all controllable expense categories in the quarter. And despite property tax increases of 6.4%, we still delivered a reduction in same-store expenses overall. This resulted in same-store NOI growth of 3.4%. 
Core FFO for the quarter was $1.48, a year-over-year increase of 16.5% and well above consensus estimates. Our same-store performance was the primary driver of the outperformance with additional contribution from growth in tenant reinsurance income, management fees and interest and investment income. We continue to evolve our balance sheet to reduce secured debt and increase the size of our unencumbered pool. Our efforts resulted in Moody's issuing Extra Space of BAA2 credit rating on January 28, our second investment-grade credit rating, now providing us access to the public bond market. 
We are excited to add another capital option to finance future growth, reduce total cost of debt and further ladder our maturities. At year-end, we had higher-than-normal revolver balances and variable rate debt due to the elevated capital activity that took place in the fourth quarter, including settling our convertible notes, completing preferred equity investments and closing substantial bridge loan and acquisition volume. A significant portion of these transactions were temporarily funded by draws on our revolving lines. We were comfortable doing so, knowing we were actively issuing on our ATM, and had pending bridge loan sales and are recapitalizing stores into a JV, which bring our revolver balances down to historical levels. 
Last night, we provided guidance and annual assumptions for 2021, with ranges that are wider than in previous years to address some of the uncertainty related to COVID-19 and its impact on customer behavior and government regulation. 
Our new same-store pool includes a total of 860 stores, which is essentially flat with last year. The number of new stores added to the pool was generally offset by sites removed due to disposition or redevelopment. We anticipate the changes in the same-store pool will benefit our 2021 same-store revenue growth by approximately 20 basis points. 
Same-store revenue is expected to increase 4.25% to 5.5%, driven by higher occupancy in the first half of the year and elevated rates in new and existing -- to new and existing customers. Same-store expense growth is expected to be 3.5% to 4.5%, primarily driven by higher property tax expense. Our revenue and expense guidance results in same-store NOI growth range of 4.25% to 6.25%. 
The acquisition market continues to be expensive, and we will remain disciplined but opportunistic. We expect to do significant acquisition volume and plan to close a number of transactions with joint venture partners. Our guidance assumes $350 million in Extra Space investment, approximately $180 million of which is closed or under contract. We also expect to close approximately $400 million of bridge loans and plan to retain 20% to 25% of those balances or approximately $100 million in 2021. 
We have plenty of capital to invest if we find additional opportunities that create long-term value for shareholders, and we will be creative as we deploy capital in the sector. Our full year core FFO is estimated to be between $5.85 and $6.05 per share. We anticipate $0.16 of dilution from value-add acquisitions or C of O stores, down $0.04 from 2020. 
We also added additional guidance related to our expected interest income for 2021 as well as notes clarifying the recognition of our preferred investments in SmartStop and NexPoint, which can be found in the outlook tables of our earnings release. 
As Joe mentioned, 2020 has been a memorable year for extra space. We are excited to turn the page and are already on our way to a very strong 2021. And with that, let's turn it over to Cindy to start our Q&A."

I can give you a little bit more detail in terms of what our guidance assumes. We're assuming that our occupancy stays strong. So in January and into February, our gap has actually expanded to be just over 300 basis points. So what's happened is January and February typically have lower occupancy, declining occupancy. We haven't seen that. So we moved from 240 basis point delta in occupancy to over 300 basis points where we are today. So we're assuming that occupancy holds at this high level through the end of the summer. At which point, we expect occupancy to fall more to historical levels. So last year, in the fourth quarter -- third and fourth quarter, we saw occupancy 200 to 300 basis points higher than normal. This year, we expect that to be a 100 to 200 basis point headwind for us. So we expect it to be lower in the fall back more to historical levels. 
We expect the first quarter to be strong in terms of revenue growth continuing to accelerate from the fourth quarter. The second quarter should be the peak, and that is mainly due to some easy comps from last year and then continued good into the third quarter with that, the end of the third quarter and fourth quarter being challenging."

We -- I'm going to speak to our same-store pool, not national statistics. I'll speak to what matters to us. We had projected in 2020 that about 30% of our same-store pool would be impacted by new supply. And when you look at the actual numbers, it was only around 21%. So almost 1/3 got pushed or canceled because of COVID. And in 2022, we project 22% of our same-store pool will be impacted by new stores. And I think there will be like there is every year, some number of those stores get delayed or maybe even canceled. So we are seeing an incremental decrease in new supply. And that's good news. But I would caution you on 2 fronts. One is, we still have significant supply delivered in many markets over the last several years, and we're working through that, and that affects our ability to push rate. And secondly, with the performance of storage, particularly in comparison to other asset classes, I would not be surprised if that attracts more capital, more developers to the market. So new supply isn't going away. It's not in every market, but in the markets where it is, it's something we need to deal with."

I don't think that's going to be a giant source of new self-storage. Some of the dark retail -- dark retail for a reason. You don't -- we wouldn't want to put a storage site there. Some is dark retail but not zoned properly for storage. And there's a lot of other physical issues with doing that. So there certainly will be some of that, but I don't see a wave a giant wave of new supply from retail conversions."

One thing, I think Extra Space has done well over the years is be innovative with the external growth. And that means not executing the same strategy regardless of where you are in the market cycle. Just trying to understand that market cycle and see where you can make outsized returns at acceptable levels of risk. Right now, that's bridge loans.

The second is we have to manage the store. And that's -- some people are self-managed and want to continue that, and they don't want us to age the store, and then we won't do it. 
After that, we get to property quality, location, underwriting. We can't get to the proceeds that the borrower wants. But there's, we have a substantial pipeline, and we feel confident we can hit our guidance for this year."

Thanks, Jeff. And thank you, everyone, for joining today's call. I hope everyone and their families remain healthy and that your 2021 is off to a good start.
In my 35 years in real estate, I can't remember another year with as many positive and negative twists and turns in such a short period of time as we saw in 2020. The range of emotions I felt from March when I was worried about the daily safety of our employees and customers, to April when I wondered when rental demand in our sector would return, to September, when we saw some of the strongest occupancy and rental rate fundamentals in our company's history are hard to describe.
I am proud of our team's resilience and how well they responded to 2020's unprecedented challenges. Our team's efforts, together with our balanced portfolio, sophisticated platform and innovative external growth efforts, yielded a great result in the fourth quarter. We ended the year with same-store occupancy of 94.8%, an all-time year-end high for Extra Space.
Our elevated occupancy has given us significant pricing power, which we have experienced since August and a return to positive same-store revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2.3%, a 380 basis point acceleration from the third quarter. We also had excellent expense control with a 0.6% decrease in same-store expenses, resulting in 3.4% NOI growth in the quarter.
Our return to positive NOI gains, coupled with strong external investment activity, yielded core FFO growth of 16.5% in the quarter. Despite the challenges of the year, the fourth quarter was full of accomplishments, including completion of 2 preferred equity investments totaling $350 million, $147 million in acquisitions, $168 million in bridge loan closings, the addition of 44 stores to our management platform and receipt of NAREIT's Leader in the Light Award, recognizing Extra Space for its sustainability efforts. This is the first time a storage company has received this award.
While we are excited about the accomplishments of 2020, we are even more optimistic about how our efforts have positioned us for 2021. Rentals continue to be steady and vacates continue to be muted. We are heading into 2021 with the highest occupancy we have ever experienced at this time of year and expect rental rates to remain strong.
We have already added 51 third-party management stores in 2021. And our acquisition, management and bridge loan pipelines are robust. But we are also mindful of the risks we face. We recognize that current or potential government regulations could impede same-store revenue and expense performance. We believe that vacates may eventually return to more normal levels, and we recognize that the challenges related to new supply have not subsided completely and will continue to suppress rate growth in many markets. As in the past, our team is prepared to use all our available tools to optimize performance in the face of any risks which materializes.
In short, despite significant turbulence, we had a very successful 2020 and look forward to an even better 2021. We continue to execute on our strategy to maximize shareholders' long-term value and to deliver the results our shareholders have come to expect from Extra Space Storage.
I would now like to turn the time over to Scott."

As Joe mentioned, we had a great fourth quarter with reaccelerating same-store revenue growth, driven by all-time high occupancy and strong rental rate growth to new customers.
Late fees and other income continue to be lower year-over-year and partially offset rental income, but we saw improvement in both line items from levels experienced in the third quarter. We lowered expenses in all controllable expense categories in the quarter. And despite property tax increases of 6.4%, we still delivered a reduction in same-store expenses overall. This resulted in same-store NOI growth of 3.4%.
Core FFO for the quarter was $1.48, a year-over-year increase of 16.5% and well above consensus estimates. Our same-store performance was the primary driver of the outperformance with additional contribution from growth in tenant reinsurance income, management fees and interest and investment income. We continue to evolve our balance sheet to reduce secured debt and increase the size of our unencumbered pool. Our efforts resulted in Moody's issuing Extra Space a BAA2 credit rating on January 28, our second investment-grade credit rating, now providing us access to the public bond market.
We are excited to add another capital option to finance future growth, reduce total cost of debt and further ladder our maturities. At year-end, we had higher-than-normal revolver balances and variable rate debt due to the elevated capital activity that took place in the fourth quarter, including settling our convertible notes, completing preferred equity investments and closing substantial bridge loan and acquisition volume. A significant portion of these transactions were temporarily funded by draws on our revolving lines. We were comfortable doing so knowing we were actively issuing on our ATM, had pending bridge loan sales and are recapitalizing stores into a JV, which bring our revolver balances down to historical levels.
Last night, we provided guidance and annual assumptions for 2021, with ranges that are wider than in previous years to address some of the uncertainty related to COVID-19 and its impact on customer behavior and government regulation.
Our new same-store pool includes a total of 860 stores, which is essentially flat with last year. The number of new stores added to the pool was generally offset by sites removed due to disposition or redevelopment. We anticipate the changes in the same-store pool will benefit our 2021 same-store revenue growth by approximately 20 basis points.
Same-store revenue is expected to increase 4.25% to 5.5%, driven by higher occupancy in the first half of the year and elevated rates in new and existing -- to new and existing customers. Same-store expense growth is expected to be 3.5% to 4.5%, primarily driven by higher property tax expense. Our revenue and expense guidance results in same-store NOI growth range of 4.25% to 6.25%.
The acquisition market continues to be expensive, and we will remain disciplined but opportunistic. We expect to do significant acquisition volume and plan to close a number of transactions with joint venture partners. Our guidance assumes $350 million in Extra Space investment, approximately $180 million of which is closed or under contract. We also expect to close approximately $400 million of bridge loans and plan to retain 20% to 25% of those balances or approximately $100 million in 2021.
We have plenty of capital to invest if we find additional opportunities that create long-term value for shareholders, and we will be creative as we deploy capital in the sector. Our full year core FFO is estimated to be between $5.85 and $6.05 per share. We anticipate $0.16 of dilution from value-add acquisitions or C of O stores, down $0.04 from 2020.
We also added additional guidance related to our expected interest income for 2021 as well as notes clarifying the recognition of our preferred investments in SmartStop and NexPoint, which can be found in the outlook tables of our earnings release.
As Joe mentioned, 2020 has been a memorable year for extra space. We are excited to turn the page and are already on our way to a very strong 2021. And with that, let's turn it over to Cindy to start our Q&A."

I can give you a little bit more detail in terms of what our guidance assumes. We're assuming that our occupancy stays strong. So in January and into February, our gap has actually expanded to be just over 300 basis points. So what's happened is January and February typically have lower occupancy, declining occupancy. We haven't seen that. So we moved from 240 basis point delta in occupancy to over 300 basis points where we are today. So we're assuming that occupancy holds at this high level through the end of the summer, at which point, we expect occupancy to fall more to historical levels. So last year, in the fourth quarter -- third and fourth quarter, we saw occupancy 200 to 300 basis points higher than normal. This year, we expect that to be a 100 to 200 basis point headwind for us. So we expect it to be lower in the fall back more to historical levels.
We expect the first quarter to be strong in terms of revenue growth continuing to accelerate from the fourth quarter. The second quarter should be the peak, and that is mainly due to some easy comps from last year and then continued good into the third quarter with that, the end of the third quarter and fourth quarter being challenging."

We -- I'm going to speak to our same-store pool, not national statistics. I'll speak to what matters to us. We had projected in 2020 that about 30% of our same-store pool would be impacted by new supply. And when you look at the actual numbers, it was only around 21%. So almost 1/3 got pushed or canceled because of COVID. 
And in 2022, we project 22% of our same-store pool will be impacted by new stores. And I think that will be like there is every year some number of those stores get delayed or maybe even canceled. So we are seeing an incremental decrease in new supply, and that's good news. But I would caution you on 2 fronts: one is, we still have significant supply delivered in many markets over the last several years, and we're working through that, and that affects our ability to push rate. And secondly, with the performance of storage, particularly in comparison to other asset classes, I would not be surprised if that attracts more capital, more developers to the market.

I just read an article that most of the people leaving San Francisco are settling in the counties around Francisco. They're not going to Utah or Florida or Texas. 
And then lastly, and this is just one man's opinion. I don't believe COVID is the death of New York City. I believe young people like to live in cities. Cities have a lot of advantages.

The second is, we have to manage the store. And that's -- some people are self-managed and want to continue that, and they don't want us to manage the store, and then we won't do it.

We are off to a great start in 2021. The strong fundamentals we discussed on our fourth quarter call not only continued, but actually accelerated as we moved through the first 3 months of the year. Same-store occupancy remained at all-time highs for Extra Space, with sequential growth in January and February at a time of the year where occupancy normally declines. Occupancy increased further in March, ending the quarter with a year-over-year positive delta of 480 basis points. 
Our elevated occupancy has given us significant pricing power which has also accelerated during the quarter with achieved rates increasing from 10% in January to well into the teens by the end of March. These trends fueled same-store revenue growth of 4.6% despite a 110 basis point drag on revenue growth from lower year-over-year late fees. We had excellent expense control with a 0.2% decrease in same store expenses. The result was same-store NOI growth of 6.5%, a sequential acceleration of 310 basis points from Q4. And year-over-year core FFO growth of 21%. With fundamentals holding and performance comps becoming much easier in the upcoming months, we expect continued acceleration in revenue growth through the second quarter. Our concern of a dramatic increase in vacates has not materialized, and now we are into our busy leasing season. When demand is typically strongest. 
We believe that vacate risk to our elevated occupancy has likely been postponed until the end of the summer or even into the fall. 
Turning to external growth. The acquisition market continues to be expensive, and we remain disciplined but opportunistic. Year-to-date, we've been able to close or put under contract a little over $300 million in acquisitions. These are primarily lease-up properties, and several of the properties came from our bridge lending program. Looking forward, we anticipate the majority of additional acquisitions to be completed in joint ventures, and we have plenty of capital to invest if we find additional opportunities that create long-term value for our shareholders. We were very active in Q1 on the third-party management front. Adding 61 stores in the quarter, which include the previously announced JCAP stores. Our growth was partially offset by dispositions, where owners sold to other operators at prices we viewed as unattractive to the REIT. While this trend presents a headwind we still expect solid growth in our third-party management platform for the year. 
As I said on our last call, we are mindful of the risks we face. These include difficult fourth quarter operational comps, a tight labor market and new supply and state of emergency orders in certain markets. That said, current fundamentals are the strongest we have seen in some time, and our team is prepared to use all our available tools to optimize performance. Our first quarter outperformance coupled with steady external growth, the improving 2021 outlook, allow us to increase our industry-leading annual guidance, $0.075 at the midpoint. 
I would now like to turn the time over to Scott."

As Joe mentioned, we had a good first quarter with accelerating same-store revenue growth, driven by all-time high occupancy and strong rental rate growth to new customers.

As Joe mentioned, we had a good first quarter with accelerating same-store revenue growth, driven by all-time high occupancy and strong rental rate growth to new customers. Late fees and other income continue to be down and partially offset rental income, but we will lap this comp in the second quarter, which will enhance same-store revenue growth. Existing customer rate increases will also provide a tailwind in the second quarter since they were passed during much of Q2 2020. We delivered a reduction in same-store expenses despite property tax increases of 6.9% and repairs and maintenance increases of 20% due to higher year-over-year snow removal costs. These increases were offset primarily by savings in payroll and marketing. We believe payroll savings will continue throughout the year, albeit perhaps at lower levels due to wage pressure in certain markets. Marketing spend will depend on our use of this lever to drive top line revenue growth, but it should also remain down for the year. 
Core FFO for the quarter was $1.50 per share, a year-over-year increase of 21%. Same-store property performance was the primary driver of the outperformance, with additional contribution from growth in tenant insurance income and management fees. As we announced during the quarter, Moody's issued extra space, BAA2 credit rating, our second investment-grade credit rating, now providing us access to the public bond market. We continued to strengthen our balance sheet during the quarter through ATM activity and an overnight offering which combined for net proceeds of $274 million. 
We sold 16 stores into a joint venture and obtained debt for that venture, resulting in cash proceeds to extra space of $132 million and an ownership interest of 55%. We plan to add a third partner to this venture in the second quarter, which will reduce our ownership interest to 16%. Our equity and disposition proceeds reduced revolving balances, and we ended the quarter with net debt-to-EBITDA of 5.1x and lower than our long-term debt target of 5.5 to 6x. 
Last night, we revised our 2021 guidance and annual assumptions. We raised our same-store revenue range to 5% to 6%. Same-store expense growth was reduced to 2% to 3% and resulting in same-store NOI growth range of 6% to 8%, a 175 basis point increase at the midpoint. These improvements in our same-store expectations are due to better-than-expected first quarter performance, relaxed legislative restrictions in certain markets and better-than-expected resilience and storage fundamentals as the vaccine rolls out. We raised our full year core FFO range to be $5.95 to $6.10 per share, a $0.075 increase at the midpoint. We anticipate $0.14 of dilution from value-add acquisitions and CFO stores, $0.02 less than previously reported due to improved property performance. We are excited by the strong performance year-to-date as well as the acceleration we see heading into the second quarter. 
With that, let's turn it over to Latif to start our Q&A."

Now maybe that, that's stuff that was delayed or postponed from last year because there was a bunch of that now being into the pipeline.

So in an environment where we think our view is that the market is expensive, it allows us to continue to grow and make good returns to our investors. So let me give you an example. We've approved so far this year, 12 wholly owned acquisitions.

We've also approved 5 joint venture deals also will lease-up 12 months to stabilization, but the first year yield is 6.9% and stabilized yield is 9.9%.

So there's constantly the discussion about do we invest more money at a lower return or less money at a higher return. But the impact to the returns to our investors is meaningful. We also, on top of that, get the opportunity turn to promote. None of those numbers include the promoter. And right now, we're in the cash flow, promote on a number of our ventures. And we've also realized back end promotes a number of times. The other thing it helps us do is derisk transactions, right?

We continue smart, careful external growth, and all of this leads to exceptional, both same-store and double-digit core FFO growth. And all of this is due to extraordinarily hard work, dedication and focus of over 4,000 employees at Extra Space.

We are off to a great start in 2021. The strong fundamentals we discussed on our fourth quarter call not only continued, but actually accelerated as we moved through the first 3 months of th",504,"Thanks, Jeff, and thank you, everyone, for joining today's call. We are off to a great start in 2021. The strong fundamentals we discussed on our fourth quarter call not only continued, but actually accelerated as we moved through the first 3 months of the year. Same-store occupancy remained at all-time highs for Extra Space, with sequential growth in January and February at a time of the year where occupancy normally declines. Occupancy increased further in March, ending the quarter with a year-over-year positive delta of 480 basis points.
Our elevated occupancy has given us significant pricing power, which has also accelerated during the quarter with achieved rates increasing from 10% in January to well into the teens by the end of March. These trends fueled same-store revenue growth of 4.6% despite a 110 basis point drag on revenue growth from lower year-over-year late fees.
We had excellent expense control with a 0.2% decrease in same-store expenses. The result was same-store NOI growth of 6.5%, a sequential acceleration of 310 basis points from Q4, and year-over-year core FFO growth of 21%. With fundamentals holding and performance comps becoming much easier in the upcoming months, we expect continued acceleration in revenue growth through the second quarter.
Our concern of a dramatic increase in vacates has not materialized, and now we are into our busy leasing season when demand is typically strongest. We believe that vacate risk to our elevated occupancy has likely been postponed until the end of the summer or even into the fall.
Turning to external growth. The acquisition market continues to be expensive, and we remain disciplined but opportunistic. Year-to-date, we've been able to close or put under contract a little over $300 million in acquisitions. These are primarily lease-up properties, and several of the properties came from our bridge lending program.
Looking forward, we anticipate the majority of additional acquisitions to be completed in joint ventures, and we have plenty of capital to invest if we find additional opportunities that create long-term value for our shareholders.
We were very active in Q1 on the third-party management front adding 61 stores in the quarter, which include the previously announced JCAP stores. Our growth was partially offset by dispositions, where owners sold to other operators at prices we viewed as unattractive to the REIT. While this trend presents a headwind, we still expect solid growth in our third-party management platform for the year.
As I said on our last call, we are mindful of the risks we face. These include difficult fourth quarter operational comps, a tight labor market and new supply and state of emergency orders in certain markets. That said, current fundamentals are the strongest we have seen in some time, and our team is prepared to use all our available tools to optimize performance.
Our first quarter outperformance coupled with steady external growth, the improving 2021 outlook allow us to increase our industry-leading annual guidance $0.075 at the midpoint.
I would now like to turn the time over to Scott."
8057672,710500022,2263147,"Extra Space Storage Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2021",2021-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Extra Space Storage Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Joe, and hello, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we had a good first quarter with accelerating same-store revenue growth, driven by all-time high occupancy and strong rental rate growth to new customers.

As Joe mentioned, we had a good first quarter with accelerating same-store revenue growth, driven by all-time high occupancy and strong rental rate growth to new customers. Late fees and other income continue to be down and partially offset rental income, but we will lap this comp in the second quarter, which will enhance same-store revenue growth.
Existing customer rate increases will also provide a tailwind in the second quarter since they were paused during much of Q2 2020. We delivered a reduction in same-store expenses despite property tax increases of 6.9% and repairs and maintenance increases of 20% due to higher year-over-year snow removal costs. These increases were offset primarily by savings in payroll and marketing. We believe payroll savings will continue throughout the year, albeit perhaps at lower levels due to wage pressure in certain markets. Marketing spend will depend on our use of this lever to drive top line revenue growth, but it should also remain down for the year.
Core FFO for the quarter was $1.50 per share, a year-over-year increase of 21%. Same-store property performance was the primary driver of the outperformance, with additional contribution from growth in tenant insurance income and management fees.
As we announced during the quarter, Moody's issued Extra Space a BAA2 credit rating, our second investment-grade credit rating, now providing us access to the public bond market. We continued to strengthen our balance sheet during the quarter through ATM activity and an overnight offering, which combined for net proceeds of $274 million.
We sold 16 stores into a joint venture and obtained debt for that venture, resulting in cash proceeds to Extra Space of $132 million and an ownership interest of 55%. We plan to add a third partner to this venture in the second quarter, which will reduce our ownership interest to 16%. Our equity and disposition proceeds reduced revolving balances, and we ended the quarter with net debt-to-EBITDA of 5.1x, lower than our long-term debt target of 5.5x to 6x.
Last night, we revised our 2021 guidance and annual assumptions. We raised our same-store revenue range to 5% to 6%. Same-store expense growth was reduced to 2% to 3% resulting in same-store NOI growth range of 6% to 8%, a 175 basis point increase at the midpoint.
These improvements in our same-store expectations are due to better-than-expected first quarter performance, relaxed legislative restrictions in certain markets and better-than-expected resilience and storage fundamentals as the vaccine rolls out.
We raised our full year core FFO range to be $5.95 to $6.10 per share, a $0.075 increase at the midpoint. We anticipate $0.14 of dilution from value-add acquisitions and C of O stores, $0.02 less than previously reported due to improved property performance. We are excited by the strong performance year-to-date as well as the acceleration we see heading into the second quarter.
With that, let's turn it over to Latif to start our Q&A."

And we can't always -- as we look at the pricing that's achieved, we choose not to match it and not to acquire the store. We always get that opportunity.

Also as we update stores that new developments that compete with our stores, we saw a slight tick up of a couple of percentage points this quarter. Now maybe that, that's stuff that was delayed or postponed from last year because there was a bunch of that now being into the pipeline. But overall, I think we're going to see continued development, right?
Self-storage is performing very well. If you're a developer and you're trying to calculate your development yields, you can probably use a 3.6 exit cap and see if someone is going to accept that.

So in an environment where we think our view is that the market is expensive, it allows us to continue to grow and make good returns to our investors. So let me give you an example. We've approved so far this year 12 wholly owned acquisitions, and they're all lease-up stores, the first year yield is in the mid-3s and the stabilized yield is about 6, 16-month average stabilization.
We've also approved 5 joint venture deals, also will lease-up 12 months to stabilization, but the first year yield is 6.9% and stabilized yield is 9.9%. So there's a meaningful difference when -- to our returns when you transact in a joint venture.
Now you get less money out the door. So there's constantly the discussion about do we invest more money at a lower return or less money at a higher return. But the impact to the returns to our investors is meaningful. We also, on top of that, get the opportunity to turn a promote. None of those numbers include the promotes. And right now, we're in the cash flow promote on a number of our ventures. And we've also realized back end promotes a number of times.
The other thing it helps us do is derisk transactions, right, to the extent that we invest less money in a transaction. We are balancing our portfolio in an interesting way. And then lastly, I'll say, we have really good smart partners. And they -- having another set of eyes on a deal or a market or an opportunity is never a bad thing."

So for instance, travels way down, you do have some benefit in the store. If you look at our savings at the property, we did have an easier comp in the first quarter of last year when payroll was maybe a little higher as we started going into the COVID lockdown. Second quarter, same thing, it will be an easier comp, but we're also being proactive on hours.
And so we are looking to make sure that we have the right number of hours at our stores. Our store managers are one of our biggest assets. And so we want to make sure we maximize their time in front of the customers. But with that easy comp, we're expecting it to be a savings. And then we're also adjusting up slightly for the fact that we are having a bit of a -- it's a tight labor market right now. So we wanted to make sure that we recognize the fact that it might cost us a little more for new people coming in the door or we may have to be a little more competitive on our labor there.
The third area is really marketing. And marketing we view as one of the levers we use. As we have opportunities to use it to maximize rate, we'll spend marketing dollars. We have had an opportunity so far this year to spend -- we've actually increased our marketing spend year-over-year. And we hope that trend continues, but it's something that we'll look at on a quarter-by-quarter basis."

One of our goals for this year was to get to 2021 stores in the year 2021. And we've achieved that, which is a great thing. 
When I first started with Extra Space, we had 12 stores, and it's incredible to see the exceptional growth of this company, the value we've created for our shareholders. So I want to thank all the folks at Extra Space who contributed to our achieving that goal. 
I'm also happy to announce that we recently published our 2020 sustainability report with disclosures and information related to the company's environmental, social and governance initiatives. I invite our listeners to review the report on the Sustainability page of our Investor Relations website. 
Heading into this quarter -- I'm sorry, heading into the second quarter, our management team had high expectations due to our record high occupancy levels, significant pricing power and a relatively easy 2020 comparable, and actual performance far exceeded these elevated expectations. Same-store occupancy set another new high watermark at the end of June at 97%, which is incredible, as you consider the diversification of our national portfolio. The elevated occupancy led to exceptional pricing power with achieved rates to new customers in the quarter over 60% higher than 2020 levels. While this is inflated by an artificially low prior year comp, achieve rates were over 30% greater than 2019 levels and accelerated through the quarter. In addition to the benefit from new customer rates, we have continued to bring existing customers closer to current street rates as more of the state of emergency rate restrictions are lifted throughout the country. Other income is no longer a drag on revenue due to late fees improving year-over-year and actually contributed 20 basis points to revenue growth in the quarter. And finally, higher discounts, primarily due to higher rates were offset by lower bad debt. These drivers produced same-store revenue growth of 13.6%, a 900 basis point acceleration from Q1, and same-store NOI growth of 20.2%, an acceleration of over 1,300 basis points. In addition, our external growth initiatives produced steady returns outside of the same-store pool, resulting in FFO growth of 33.3%.  
Turning to external growth. The acquisition market continues to be, in our view, expensive. Given the pricing we are seeing in the market, we have listed an additional 17 stores for outright disposition, which we expect to close during the back half of 2021. We continue to be actively engaged in acquisitions, but we remain disciplined. Year-to-date, we have been able to close or put under contract acquisitions totaling $400 million of Extra Space investment. These are primarily lease-up properties and several of the properties came from our bridge loan program. We have increased our 2021 acquisition guidance to $500 million in Extra Space investments. 
Looking forward, many of our acquisitions will be completed in joint ventures, and we have plenty of capital to invest if we find additional opportunities that create long-term value for our shareholders. 
We were active on the third-party management front, adding 39 stores in the quarter and a total of 100 stores through the first 6 months. Our growth was partially offset by dispositions where owners sold their properties. In the quarter, we purchased 11 of these stores in the REIT or in one of our joint ventures. Our first half outperformance coupled with steady external growth and the improved outlook for the second half of 2021 allowed us to increase our annual FFO guidance by $0.50 or 8.3% at the midpoint. While we still assume a seasonal occupancy moderation of approximately 300 basis points from this summer's peak to the winter trough, the moderation will begin from a higher starting point than we previously expected. As a result, we assume minimal impact on revenue growth from the negative occupancy delta in the back half of the year. Our guidance assumes moderating but still strong rate growth for the duration of 2021, which should result in another great year for Extra Space Storage. 
I would now like to turn the time over to Scott."

As Joe mentioned, we had an excellent quarter with accelerating same-store revenue growth driven by all-time high occupancy and strong rental rate growth to new and existing customers.

As Joe mentioned, we had an excellent quarter with accelerating same-store revenue growth driven by all-time high occupancy and strong rental rate growth to new and existing customers. Core FFO for the quarter was $1.64 per share, a year-over-year increase of 33.3%. Property performance was the primary driver of the beat with additional contribution coming from growth in tenant insurance income and management fees. Despite property tax increases of 6%, we delivered a reduction in same-store expenses in the quarter. These increases were offset primarily by 13% savings in payroll and 31% savings in marketing. Our guidance assumes payroll savings will continue throughout the year, however, at lower levels due to wage pressure across the U.S. Marketing spend will depend on our use of this lever to drive top line revenue, but it should also remain down for the year. 
In May, we completed our inaugural investment-grade public bond offering, issuing $450 million in 10-year bonds at 2.55%. Access to the investment-grade bond market provides another deep capital source at low rates and will allow us to further extend our average maturities. Our year-to-date dispositions, equity issuances and NOI have resulted in a reduction in our leverage. Our quarter end net debt to EBITDA was 4.8x, giving us significant dry powder for investment opportunities since we generally target a range of 5.5 to 6x on this metric. 
Last night, we revised our 2021 guidance and annual assumptions. We raised our same-store revenue range to 11%. Same-store expense growth was reduced to 0 to 1%, resulting in same-store NOI growth of 13.5% to 15.5%, a 750 basis point increase at the midpoint. These improvements in our same-store expectations are due to better-than-expected achieved rates, higher occupancy and lower payroll and marketing expense. We raised our full year core FFO range to be $6.45 to $6.60 per share, a $0.50 or 8.3% increase at the midpoint. Due to stronger lease-up performance, we dropped our anticipated dilution from value-add acquisitions and C of O stores from $0.14 to $0.12. We're excited by our strong performance year-to-date and the success of our customer acquisition, revenue management, operational and growth strategies across our highly diversified portfolio.

Last year was an odd comp. If you look at it compared to 2019, you're 30% ahead. So we continue to push our street rates. And the expectation is that we will continue to push them through the year. We do come up against a more difficult comp at the end of this year as we started pushing rates at the end of last year. So that is one thing that we're looking at as we move into the fall. A couple of other maybe data points, discounts are up slightly in the quarter, mainly due to rates being higher. Our discounting strategy hasn't changed significantly. We'll continue to use them as a tool, but we'll continue to monitor those also. Our existing customer rate increases are running above where they've historically been, and part of that is an odd comp again from last year. Where last year you had many state of emergencies where we paused rate increases. And so from a year-over-year perspective, those existing customer rate increases are contributing more than they were last year."

Traditionally, the #1 reason has been there somewhere in the moving process. And then that declined and what increased during the pandemic was lack of space, and that became the #1 reason for a while. Those lines of since crossed again. But we interpret lack of space as I'm at home and I need a bedroom to -- for in-home school or in-home office or a workout room or I'm going to find a clean the garage or whatever. And those customers tend to stay longer than customers who give the reason of staying is moving. So I would point to that as why we're seeing currently declining vacates. And I don't think all of those customers eventually take their stuff out of storage and convert the home office back to a bedroom or whatever. I think some of -- not all of them, but I think some portion of them will be longer-term customers."

One of our goals for this year was to get to 2021 stores in the year 2021. And we've achieved that, which is a great thing.
When I first started with Extra Space, we had 12 stores and it's incredible to see the exceptional growth of this company, the value we've created for our shareholders. So I want to thank all the folks at Extra Space who contributed to our achieving that goal.
I'm also happy to announce that we recently published our 2020 sustainability report with disclosures and information related to the company's environmental, social and governance initiatives. I invite our listeners to review the report on the Sustainability page of our Investor Relations website.
Heading into this quarter -- I'm sorry, heading into the second quarter, our management team had high expectations due to our record high occupancy levels, significant pricing power and a relatively easy 2020 comparable, and actual performance far exceeded these elevated expectations. Same-store occupancy set another new high watermark at the end of June at 97%, which is incredible, as you consider the diversification of our national portfolio. The elevated occupancy led to exceptional pricing power with achieved rates to new customers in the quarter over 60% higher than 2020 levels. While this is inflated by an artificially low prior year comp, achieve rates were over 30% greater than 2019 levels and accelerated through the quarter.
In addition to the benefit from new customer rates, we have continued to bring existing customers closer to current street rates as more of the state of emergency rate restrictions are lifted throughout the country. Other income is no longer a drag on revenue due to late fees improving year-over-year and actually contributed 20 basis points to revenue growth in the quarter. And finally, higher discounts, primarily due to higher rates were offset by lower bad debt. These drivers produced same-store revenue growth of 13.6%, a 900 basis point acceleration from Q1, and same-store NOI growth of 20.2%, an acceleration of over 1,300 basis points. In addition, our external growth initiatives produced steady returns outside of the same-store pool, resulting in FFO growth of 33.3%.
Turning to external growth. The acquisition market continues to be, in our view, expensive. Given the pricing we are seeing in the market, we have listed an additional 17 stores for outright disposition, which we expect to close during the back half of 2021. We continue to be actively engaged in acquisitions, but we remain disciplined. Year-to-date, we have been able to close or put under contract acquisitions totaling $400 million of Extra Space investment. These are primarily lease-up properties and several of the properties came from our Bridge Loan Program. We have increased our 2021 acquisition guidance to $500 million in Extra Space investments.
Looking forward, many of our acquisitions will be completed in joint ventures, and we have plenty of capital to invest if we find additional opportunities that create long-term value for our shareholders.
We were active on the third-party management front, adding 39 stores in the quarter and a total of 100 stores through the first 6 months. Our growth was partially offset by dispositions where owners sold their properties. In the quarter, we purchased 11 of these stores in the REIT or in one of our joint ventures. Our first half outperformance coupled with steady external growth and the improved outlook for the second half of 2021 allowed us to increase our annual FFO guidance by $0.50 or 8.3% at the midpoint. While we still assume a seasonal occupancy moderation of approximately 300 basis points from this summer's peak to the winter trough, the moderation will begin from a higher starting point than we previously expected. As a result, we assume minimal impact on revenue growth from the negative occupancy delta in the back half of the year. Our guidance assumes moderating but still strong rate growth for the duration of 2021, which should result in another great year for Extra Space Storage.
I would now like to turn the time over to Scott."

As Joe mentioned, we had an excellent quarter with accelerating same-store revenue growth driven by all-time high occupancy and strong rental rate growth to new and existing customers.

As Joe mentioned, we had an excellent quarter with accelerating same-store revenue growth driven by all-time high occupancy and strong rental rate growth to new and existing customers. Core FFO for the quarter was $1.64 per share, a year-over-year increase of 33.3%. Property performance was the primary driver of the beat with additional contribution coming from growth in tenant insurance income and management fees. Despite property tax increases of 6%, we delivered a reduction in same-store expenses in the quarter. These increases were offset primarily by 13% savings in payroll and 31% savings in marketing. Our guidance assumes payroll savings will continue throughout the year, however, at lower levels due to wage pressure across the U.S. Marketing spend will depend on our use of this lever to drive top line revenue, but it should also remain down for the year.
In May, we completed our inaugural investment-grade public bond offering, issuing $450 million in 10-year bonds at 2.55%. Access to the investment-grade bond market provides another deep capital source at low rates and will allow us to further extend our average maturities. Our year-to-date dispositions, equity issuances and NOI have resulted in a reduction in our leverage. Our quarter end net debt-to-EBITDA was 4.8x, giving us significant dry powder for investment opportunities since we generally target a range of 5.5 to 6x on this metric.
Last night, we revised our 2021 guidance and annual assumptions. We raised our same-store revenue range to 10% to 11%. Same-store expense growth was reduced to 0% to 1%, resulting in same-store NOI growth of 13.5% to 15.5%, a 750 basis point increase at the midpoint. These improvements in our same-store expectations are due to better-than-expected achieved rates, higher occupancy and lower payroll and marketing expense. We raised our full year core FFO range to be $6.45 to $6.60 per share, a $0.50 or 8.3% increase at the midpoint. Due to stronger lease-up performance, we dropped our anticipated dilution from value-add acquisitions and C of O stores from $0.14 to $0.12. We're excited by our strong performance year-to-date and the success of our customer acquisition, revenue management, operational and growth strategies across our highly diversified portfolio.
With that, let's turn it over to Latif to start our Q&A."

I think that's the big question here. We've seen very good rate growth. If you look at our rates year-over-year, we mentioned that we're 60% ahead of where we were last year. Last year was an odd comp. If you look at it compared to 2019, you're 30% ahead. So we continue to push our street rates. And the expectation is that we will continue to push them through the year. We do come up against a more difficult comp at the end of this year as we started pushing rates at the end of last year.
So that is one thing that we're looking at as we move into the fall. A couple of other maybe data points, discounts are up slightly in the quarter, mainly due to rates being higher. Our discounting strategy hasn't changed significantly. We'll continue to use them as a tool, but we'll continue to monitor those also. Our existing customer rate increases are running above where they've historically been, and part of that is an odd comp again from last year, where last year you had many state of emergencies where we paused rate increases.

But that being said, I think we're going to see more development in the future. Just this week, I talked to 2 developers who had projects that did not hit underwriting, they were making no money and they're selling them and they're getting bailed out by current pricing. And I asked both of them what they're going to do with the proceeds, and they said, we're going to go stick shovels in the ground.
So between great fundamentals, low interest rates, lots of capital floating into the space, albeit I get that costs are higher. I think we're going to continue to see development, and it's going to be something we're going to have to deal with just like we've been dealing with for the past 4 or 5 years, no difference. And that being said, I'd point out that one of the advantages of having a broadly diversified portfolio like Extra Space is we have exposures to many, many different markets, some of which are heading into a development cycle, some of which are coming out of a development cycle, some of which have never been affected by development.

But we interpret lack of space as I'm at home and I need a bedroom to -- for in-home school or in-home office or a workout room or I'm going to find a cleaner garage or whatever. And those customers tend to stay longer than customers who give the reason of staying is moving. So I would point to that as why we're seeing currently declining vacates.

Among other accomplishments, we celebrated the addition of store #200 to our portfolio. We were recognized by Inside Self-Storage as the best third-party management company in the industry, and we achieved some of the strongest operating results in our company's history. 
Same-store occupancy once again reached a new all-time high during the quarter at over 97%, with vacates continuing at lower-than-historic levels. Our strong occupancy resulted in exceptional pricing power. Achieved rates to new customers in the quarter were 43% higher than 2020 levels and 41% greater than 2019 levels. In addition to the benefit from new customer rates, we have continued to bring existing customers closer to current street rates as state of emergency rate restrictions continue to be lifted throughout the country. 
Other income improved significantly year-over-year, primarily due to increased late fees contributing 30 basis points to revenue growth in the quarter. We had modestly higher discounts due to higher street rates, but their impact was offset by lower bad debt. These drivers produced same-store revenue growth of 18.4%, a 480 basis point acceleration from Q2 and same-store NOI growth of 27.8%, an acceleration of 760 basis points. In addition, our external growth initiatives produced steady returns outside of the same-store pool, resulting in FFO growth of 41.2%. 
Turning to external growth. The acquisition market remains very active but expensive in our view. Our investment team has never been busier, and we have found the most success acquiring lease-up properties and/or acquiring stores with the joint venture partner. 
While most of our transactions have been in relatively small bites, the total is adding up, allowing us to increase our investment guidance to $700 million for the year. Also, our approach has resulted in better-than-market average yields. But we are much more focused on FFO per share accretion than total acquisition volume, and we plan to continue to be selective in the current environment. We continue to look at all material transactions in the market and we have plenty of capital to invest when we find opportunities that create long-term value for our shareholders. 
We had an incredibly strong quarter on the third-party management front, adding 96 stores. Our growth was partially offset by dispositions where owners sold their properties. It is worth mentioning that oftentimes, we are the buyer of these properties, and they are simply moving from one ownership category to another. 
In the quarter, we purchased 11 of our managed stores in the REIT or in a joint venture for a total of 30 stores purchased from our third-party platform through September. Fundamentals have remained even stronger than our already positive outlook, allowing us to raise our annual FFO guidance by $0.28 at the midpoint. 
While we still assume a seasonal occupancy moderation, it has been less than our initial estimate of 300 basis points from this summer's peak. Our revised guidance now assumes a 200 basis point moderation which would result in 2021 year-end occupancy generally similar to that of 2020. We expect continued strong growth in the fourth quarter to cap off what has been an incredible year for Extra Space Storage. 
I would now like to turn the time over to Scott."

As Joe mentioned, we had an excellent quarter with accelerating same-store revenue growth, driven by all-time high occupancy and strong rental rate growth to new and existing customers. Core FFO for the quarter was $1.8",469,"Thanks, Joe, and hello, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we had an excellent quarter with accelerating same-store revenue growth, driven by all-time high occupancy and strong rental rate growth to new and existing customers. 
Core FFO for the quarter was $1.85 per share, a year-over-year increase of 41.2%. Property performance was the primary driver of the beat with additional contribution from growth in tenant insurance income and management fees. 
As a result of our strong FFO growth, our Board of Directors raised our third quarter dividend an additional 25% after already raising it 11% earlier this year, a total increase of 38.9% over the third quarter 2020 dividend. We delivered a reduction in same-store expenses in the quarter, including a 3% savings in payroll, 42% savings in marketing and a 4% decrease in property taxes due to some successful appeals. Despite the payroll savings we've enjoyed this year, like most companies, we have felt material wage pressure across all markets, including our corporate office. 
Some of the payroll reduction has been the result of higher turnover and longer time to fill -- and longer time required to fill vacant positions. We will experience continued payroll pressure in 2022 as we have raised wages to retain and recruit the best team in the storage industry. This will also impact our G&A expense. 
In the second quarter, we completed our inaugural investment-grade public bond offering. And we completed a successful second offering in the third quarter, issuing another $600 million 10-year bond at a rate of 2.35%. We also refiled our ATM in the quarter, and we have $800 million in availability. Our access to capital has never been stronger. And between net operating income and disposition proceeds, our leverage continues to be reduced. Our quarter end net debt to EBITDA was 4.5x giving us significant dry powder for investment opportunities while maintaining our credit ratings. 
Last night, we revised our 2021 guidance and annual assumptions. We raised our same-store revenue range to 12.5% to 13.5%. Same-store expense growth was reduced to negative 1% to 0%, resulting in same-store NOI growth range of 18% to 19.5%. These improvements in our same-store expectations are due to better-than-expected rates, higher occupancy and lower payroll and marketing expense. 
We raised our full year core FFO range to be $6.75 to $6.85 per share. Due to stronger lease-up performance, we dropped our anticipated dilution from value-add acquisitions and C of O stores from $0.12 to $0.11 even after adding a number of additional lease-up properties to our acquisition pipeline. 
We are excited by our strong performance year-to-date and the success of our team driving our growth strategies across our highly diversified portfolio. As we often say, it's a great time to be in storage. 
With that, let's turn it over to Joanna to start our Q&A."

We have a very small number of developments underway that we're committed too. We believe for us, and I know other companies executed a different way, which makes sense for them, the best way for us to do development is with joint venture partners, where we can be the partner with the best local or regional developer who brings their particular local skills and something that we don't have across the country. 
And the other advantage that gives us is through structure, we can allocate the specific risks of development, entitlement risk, cost risk, delay risk, completion risk fairly between the development partner and ours, so we don't take all of those risks when those are, frankly, more in the development partners control. So we believe development is a great way to make money in any real estate business. We believe if it's structured right, you can control the risk. And we believe it's very important to make sure you're in the right time in the market cycle to be heavy in the development business."

Property taxes, we would expect to grow in the 5% to 6% range as we continue to see pressure. And I think that's partly with lower cap r",348,"Yes. Let me maybe start with property taxes. I mean we had a negative quarterly comp and that's not going to continue. Property taxes, we would expect to grow in the 5% to 6% range as we continue to see pressure. And I think that's partly with lower cap rates, higher valuations, we would expect municipalities to continue to assess. We would expect that to continue into next year. We -- obviously, we're not ready to give guidance on property taxes, but that will continue. 
The second one I would point to is marketing. We wouldn't expect it to be down 40% again this year. We would expect next year to maybe be a little bit more normal, and it's a lever we will use as we see opportunities to grow our revenues by using marketing. 
The third one I would point to just because of the size of the expense is payroll. So this year, we've had a negative payroll comp, and it's been by us being proactive partly. So we've done things to decrease hours to optimize our payroll. But we've also had some, what I would call, a negative benefit. And what I mean by that is we've seen our payroll go down because we've had higher turnover, and we've had a longer time to fill. So not necessarily a good thing. We've had lower payroll as a result of that. We continue to see pressure on wages. So that's at the stores, that's in our corporate office, and we would expect that to be -- we would expect that to continue into next year. I think every company in America is experiencing that. 
The other thing I would point to on the expense side is it's a good thing to be in storage. And what I mean by that is we're in a high-margin business. So payroll, for instance, even if we see significant payroll pressure, you're still sub-6% as a percentage of revenues. And so if you're an inflationary market, we do have the ability to push our rates as their month-to-month leases."

We were recognized by Inside",554,"Thanks, Jeff, and thank you, everyone, for joining today's call. Well, we had an exciting quarter. I'm not sure how else to describe it. Among other accomplishments, we celebrated the addition of store #2000 to our portfolio. We were recognized by Inside Self-Storage as the Best Third-Party Management company in the industry, and we achieved some of the strongest operating results in our company's history.
Same-store occupancy once again reached a new all-time high during the quarter at over 97%, with vacates continuing at lower-than-historic levels. Our strong occupancy resulted in exceptional pricing power. Achieved rates to new customers in the quarter were 43% higher than 2020 levels and 41% greater than 2019 levels. In addition to the benefit from new customer rates, we have continued to bring existing customers closer to current street rates as state of emergency rate restrictions continued to be lifted throughout the country.
Other income improved significantly year-over-year, primarily due to increased late fees contributing 30 basis points to revenue growth in the quarter. We had modestly higher discounts due to higher street rates, but their impact was offset by lower bad debt. These drivers produced same-store revenue growth of 18.4%, a 480 basis point acceleration from Q2. And same-store NOI growth of 27.8%, an acceleration of 760 basis points. In addition, our external growth initiatives produced steady returns outside of the same-store pool, resulting in FFO growth of 41.2%.
Turning to external growth. The acquisition market remains very active but expensive in our view. Our investment team has never been busier, and we have found the most success acquiring lease-up properties and/or acquiring stores with the joint venture partner.
While most of our transactions have been in relatively small bites, the total is adding up, allowing us to increase our investment guidance to $700 million for the year. Also, our approach has resulted in better-than-market average yields. But we are much more focused on FFO per share accretion than total acquisition volume, and we plan to continue to be selective in the current environment. We continue to look at all material transactions in the market and we have plenty of capital to invest when we find opportunities that create long-term value for our shareholders.
We had an incredibly strong quarter on the third-party management front, adding 96 stores. Our growth was partially offset by dispositions where owners sold their properties. It is worth mentioning that oftentimes, we are the buyer of these properties, and they are simply moving from one ownership category to another. In the quarter, we purchased 11 of our managed stores in the REIT or in a joint venture for a total of 30 stores purchased from our third-party platform through September.
Fundamentals have remained even stronger than our already positive outlook, allowing us to raise our annual FFO guidance by $0.28 at the midpoint. While we still assume a seasonal occupancy moderation, it has been less than our initial estimate of 300 basis points from this summer's peak. Our revised guidance now assumes a 200 basis point moderation which would result in 2021 year-end occupancy generally similar to that of 2020. We expect continued strong growth in the fourth quarter to cap off what has been an incredible year for Extra Space Storage.
I would now like to turn the time over to Scott."

As Joe mentioned, we had an excellent quarter with accelerating same-store revenue growth, driven by all-time high occupancy and strong rental rate growth to new and existing customers.Core FFO for the quarter was $1.85",468,"Thanks, Joe, and hello, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we had an excellent quarter with accelerating same-store revenue growth, driven by all-time high occupancy and strong rental rate growth to new and existing customers.
Core FFO for the quarter was $1.85 per share, a year-over-year increase of 41.2%. Property performance was the primary driver of the beat with additional contribution from growth in tenant insurance income and management fees. As a result of our strong FFO growth, our Board of Directors raised our third quarter dividend an additional 25% after already raising it 11% earlier this year, a total increase of 38.9% over the third quarter 2020 dividend.
We delivered a reduction in same-store expenses in the quarter, including a 3% savings in payroll, 42% savings in marketing and a 4% decrease in property taxes due to some successful appeals. Despite the payroll savings we've enjoyed this year, like most companies, we've felt material wage pressure across all markets, including our corporate office.
Some of the payroll reduction has been the result of higher turnover and longer time to fill -- and longer time required to fill vacant positions. We will experience continued payroll pressure in 2022 as we have raised wages to retain and recruit the best team in the storage industry. This will also impact our G&A expense.
In the second quarter, we completed our inaugural investment-grade public bond offering. And we completed a successful second offering in the third quarter, issuing another $600 million 10-year bond at a rate of 2.35%. We also refiled our ATM in the quarter, and we have $800 million in availability. Our access to capital has never been stronger. And between net operating income and disposition proceeds, our leverage continues to be reduced. Our quarter end net debt to EBITDA was 4.5x, giving us significant dry powder for investment opportunities while maintaining our credit ratings.
Last night, we revised our 2021 guidance and annual assumptions. We raised our same-store revenue range to 12.5% to 13.5%. Same-store expense growth was reduced to negative 1% to 0%, resulting in same-store NOI growth range of 18% to 19.5%. These improvements in our same-store expectations are due to better-than-expected rates, higher occupancy and lower payroll and marketing expense.
We raised our full year core FFO range to be $6.75 to $6.85 per share. Due to stronger lease-up performance, we dropped our anticipated dilution from value-add acquisitions and C of O stores from $0.12 to $0.11, even after adding a number of additional lease-up properties to our acquisition pipeline.
We are excited by our strong performance year-to-date and the success of our team driving our growth strategies across our highly diversified portfolio. As we often say, it's a great time to be in storage.
With that, let's turn it over to Joanna to start our Q&A."

And the other advantage that gives us is through structure, we can allocate the specific risks of development, entitlement risk, cost risk, delay risk, completion risk, fairly between the development partner and ours, so we don't take all of those risks when those are, frankly, more in the development partner's control.
So we believe development is a great way to make money in any real estate business. We believe if it's structured right, you can control the risk. And we believe it's very important to make sure you're in the right time in the market cycle to be heavy in the development business."

And I think that's partly with lower cap rates, higher valuations, we would expect municipalities to continue to assess. We would expect that to continue into next year. We -- obviously, we're not ready to give guidance on property taxes, but that will continue.
The second one I would point to is marketing. We wouldn't expect it to be down 40% again this year. We would expect next year to maybe be a little bit more normal, and it's a lever we will use as we see opportunities to grow our revenues by using marketing.
The third one I would point to just because of the size of the expense is payroll. So this year, we've had a negative payroll comp, and it's been by us being proactive partly. So we've done things to decrease hours to optimize our payroll. But we've also had some, what I would call, a negative benefit. And what I mean by that is we've seen our payroll go down because we've had higher turnover, and we've had a longer time to fill.
So not necessarily a good thing. We've had lower payroll as a result of that. We continue to see pressure on wages. So that's at the stores, that's in our corporate office, and we would expect that to be -- we would expect that to continue into next year. I think every company in America is experiencing that.
The other thing I would point to on the expense side is it's a good thing to be in storage. And what I mean by that is we're in a high-margin business. So payroll, for instance, even if we see significant payroll pressure, you're still sub-6% as a percentage of revenues. And so if you're an inflationary market, we do have the ability to push our rates as their month-to-month leases."

And we'll continue to gather that data and get better. But we do see moderation in 2022.
My concern is, given the great, great performance of the sector, the amount of capital that wants exposure to storage, low interest rate that we are going to get ourselves back into a development cycle and the line will start to go in the other direction maybe in 2023 and beyond.
Now that's not all bad, right? Development creates bridge loan and management and acquisition and development, participation opportunities for us. But it's also a challenge for the stores that have new supply coming in their trade area, and we'll manage through that just like we managed through the last cycle."

And the reason why I asked that, if I look at your property management fees as a percentage of your G&A, it's starting to trend back up over a longer time frame towards like the 70% range, meaning you're getting closer to effectively paying for your corporate layer with fees.
And I guess from like a structural premium standpoint, you know you guys have already had one. I'm curious like how you guys think about like getting to that number or eclipsing it? I think it's like $63 million on $100 million now. And kind of how could that gap narrow over time?"

And we also want to have the right stores, right? A store with an owner that plans to hold for 10 years is of much more value to us than a store where it's a developer and they're going to build it and flip it.

So we're really focused on the economics and the relationships that this business brings to us as opposed to the outright number of stores.
