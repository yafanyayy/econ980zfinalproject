As we embark on 2021, I think it's important to recognize the sense of uncertainty and the ongoing challenges that we all face as individual or as a society. Despite the social, economic and health issues we are facing, I'm hopeful that collectively, we will emerge stronger and more united. At NortonLifeLock, the safety and wellbeing of our employees is our utmost priority. And I want to thank each and every one of them for facing all those challenges while continuing to show a deep commitment to drive our vision of protecting and empowering people to live their digital life safely. 
A lot has happened since our last earnings. On top of delivering another solid quarter, accelerating our growth and adding some exceptional talents to our team and our Board, we also are proud to have been recognized by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation for earning a top score on the 2021 Equality Index. We are proud of the diverse backgrounds represented by our entire team and NortonLifeLock, and we remain committed to building an inclusive company. We know that delivering on our vision cannot happen without a committed, talented and diverse team. 
In December, we announced LifeLock's first acquisition. Now that the deal has closed, we are excited to welcome Avira's employees, customers and partners to the Norton family. We are really excited by the opportunity to provide Avira's 30 million users and over 1.5 million paid customers, the benefit of the Norton plus Avira offering. Together, we are now privileged to help protect over 80 million consumers globally as we embrace the important responsibility we have in securing their digital lives. We are also quickly working to leverage Avira's strong presence in Europe, which now also includes BullGuard, a U.K.-based cybersecurity company that Avira added to their business last year. On top of extending our reach deeper into EMEA, we look forward to adding Avira's and BullGuard's capabilities to our portfolio. 
Before I dive into Q3 results, I want to revisit 2 key post transition commitments we previously set as a stand-alone NortonLifeLock company. From returning to a growing customer base, a first since 2014, to delivering over $1.5 annualized EPS, I'm proud to say that we have established the company on a trajectory of sustainable and profitable growth. We are a strongest cyber safety company today, 100% focused on protecting and empowering consumers to live their digital lives safely. While we are proud of these achievements, we know we have a tremendous responsibility to deliver a portfolio that stays ahead of cybercriminals. We don't take this slightly. As we innovate and work to keep our customers safe, we know that we will be transforming our company for a richer portfolio and expanded consumer reach, and we're just getting started. 
In Q3, we delivered solid growth and accelerated our momentum. Revenue was up 6% and non-GAAP EPS grew 52%. Reported billings growth was 10%, our first quarter of double-digit growth. We are closing the fiscal year out strong, and more importantly, we're well on our way to creating a meaningful and sustainable growth business. Leading the growth momentum, our partner business posted double-digit revenue growth, up 15%. Retail was strong in the quarter, performing well through eTail and during the holidays. Internationally, Japan was particularly strong as it relates to identity Test protection solutions, such as Dark Web Monitoring and ID Advisor sold through partners and retailers. 
Finding the right opportunities and markets to build and expand these long-term partnerships is one of our key strategic focus areas to broaden our reach and bring cyber safety to more consumers in underpenetrated markets. Stay tuned for more developments in this area as we continue to transform the company. 
Our direct-to-consumer revenue, which represent the majority of our business, was up 5%. We saw broad-based growth across the portfolio as well as strong performance through the holiday season. While our North America business is considerably larger than the rest of the world, the international growth rate continues to show strength and outpace the Americas. In the quarter, our direct business grew double digits across multiple countries, including Germany, France, Australia and New Zealand, where we have recently added Dark Web Monitoring into our Norton 360 offering. This is part of our strategic push to expand Norton Identity products internationally and bring more comprehensive cyber safety offering to international consumers. We definitely have more room to grow here, especially with the synergies and extended global reach, we will be leveraging with Avira and the freemium model. 
In Q3, our direct customer count grew over 300,000 sequentially and close to 900,000 year-over-year, bringing our total count to 21 million. This was our fifth straight quarter of net direct customer adds sequentially. Our customer retention rate remained stable at 85%. Our industry-leading monthly ARPU, average revenue per user, also remained strong at $9. Both metrics are strong indicators that our current customers see the value of our products. Notwithstanding the effect of tenure and geographical mix, we continue to see opportunities to improve ARPU as we enriched the cyber safety value offered to our customers and to improve retention rates, especially in the early years of the customer journey. 
One of the key contributors to our customer count growth and retention success continues to be the Norton 360 integrated platform, the first truly integrated cyber safety offering in the market. At the end of Q3, approximately 60% of our installed base are using Norton 360. This platform is designed to provide a comprehensive protection while driving higher customer engagement. This level of adoption shows that our approach to provide an easy to use platform and comprehensive protection through a membership model, which resonates well with our customers, and we're working hard to continue bringing new functionalities, simplifying the membership plans and constantly improving the user experience. The combination of Norton 360 platform, our international expansion effort and our strategic shift to new forms of digital marketing is working and bringing cyber safety to new customers. 
Looking back at the last 12 months, we've welcomed approximately 4 million new customers to NortonLifeLock, the majority of which was on Norton 360. We are seeing early improvements in renewal trends with these newer customer cohorts for engaging with this customer differently, communicating with new alerts, measuring what works, what doesn't, and we're able to scale product launches more effectively through our in-house e-commerce platform. At the heart of all of this, it's our technologies and accelerated pace of innovation, that enable us to be nimble in bringing new and incremental value to customers. Sometimes, we may run the risk of failing fast, but the reward is that we learn even faster to translate that into success as we move to own the consumer cyber safety category. 
With the ever-expanding scope of cyber crimes and the acceleration of the numbers of attacks that we've all witnessed in the news, we know it's critical to focus on product and service innovation to help keep consumers' digital lives safe and to raise the overall awareness of consumer cyber safety across all audience. We plan to continue to release new products and features at an accelerated pace that we have not achieved in years. Let me tell you about a couple of them launched in Q3. 
As part of our global expansion efforts, we successfully launched Norton ID Advisor in Japan powered by LifeLock. Here, we specifically targeted retail and service providers to reach new audiences and increase awareness on the value of Dark Web Monitoring. One of the differentiators in this product is the access to a dedicated ID restoration specialist, a Japanese speaking service agent, to help resolve fraudulent claims from start to finish. Another example is our enhanced Norton 360 mobile experience, which provides customers access to their device security, online privacy and identity features through one single easy-to-use app, making it easier for customers to access and manage their cyber safety tools from one dashboard. This is another example of our commitment to bring a richer and simpler experience to consumer cyber safety. 
Looking back, we have demonstrated our continued commitment to grow the top line, drive disciplined operating leverage and pursue value creation for all stakeholders. It's important to me and our entire leadership team to build credibility and a sustainable and growing financial track record. It's also worth noting that behind our strong third quarter performance, you will find a very passionate team working hard to fulfill our vision, to protect and empower people to live their digital life safely. We think customer first. We innovate and grow. We're scrappy, We own it. We're open. We are authentic. These are the core values we live by, and making the world cyber safe is what inspires us. 
Finally, before I pass it to Natalie, I'm excited to share a little more detail on our recent additions to the Board. Sherrese Smith is Vice Chair and Partner at Paul Hastings, a prominent global law firm. She brings extensive international experience in data privacy, cybersecurity and breach respond issues. Similarly, Emily Heath, DocuSign's Chief Trust and Security Officer, brings significant experience in information security, data privacy, in addition to being a key contributor in creating consumer trust to digitally transform an industry. They are both passionate and accomplished leaders, who are already valuable member of the Board team. 
And now let me turn the call over to Natalie for more details on the financial results."

For today's discussion, I will focus on non-GAAP financials, starting with our Q3 results and then provide our outlook for Q4. We delivered strong performance in Q3 with growth year-over-year and quarter-over-quart",1157,"Thank you, Vincent, and hello, everyone. For today's discussion, I will focus on non-GAAP financials, starting with our Q3 results and then provide our outlook for Q4. We delivered strong performance in Q3 with growth year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter across our key metrics. Our Q3 revenue was $639 million, up 6% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance. We accelerated reported billings growth to 10%, including a 2-point positive impact from FX in our ending contract liability balance. Our growth momentum was driven by broad-based strength across all geos and products as well as a successful holiday season. 
Our total direct customer count increased to 21 million, adding 334,000 customers quarter-over-quarter and 876,000 customers year-over-year. This was our fifth consecutive quarter of net customer adds sequential. Our customer retention rate, a unit retention metric, remains stable at 85%. Our monthly average revenue per user, or ARPU, was over $9 this quarter, up 1% year-over-year and stable quarter-over-quarter. As we continue to grow our customer base, it is important to note that our first year ARPU and retention rate for newly acquired customers is generally lower than our total average. As we explore new business models and add more customers globally, ARPU can vary as our mix changes. We will look for opportunities to improve ARPU and first year retention as we continue to grow and diversify our business. 
We are still in the early innings, but our go-to-market efforts are beginning to take hold. We are leveraging our distribution channels to reach more customers globally. We accelerated growth in our direct business in Q3, driven by our growing renewable base. As we continue to add new customers, we are seeing positive data points and retention, directly correlated with our Norton 360 membership suite. As we have accelerated the pace of our innovation and launched new in-demand products and features, we are beginning to see improvements in our cross-sell and upsell efforts. And we have the opportunity to accelerate further as we expand our reach to new audiences and continue to foster growth in our loyal customer base. 
In our partner business, Q3 revenue grew 15% year-over-year. We continue to make strides internationally, signing new partnerships that we expect will scale over the long term. As we have noted in previous conversations, these partners sales cycles are longer, taking 1 to 2 years or more to realize. We continue to invest in these partnerships for the long-term as they are strategically important for us to expand our reach. Next, Q3 operating margin was 51%. We remain focused on driving operational discipline and prioritizing investments in product innovation and diversified marketing. With R&D, we continue to accelerate the pace of product introductions, growing and expanding our product portfolio and providing an increasingly differentiated value proposition for consumers. With marketing, we continue to invest to drive new customer acquisition as well as diversify our spend into more digital and international channels to help widen our audience, measuring and ensuring effectiveness along the way. We are disciplined in our approach and we'll continue to invest in sustainable growth. 
Q3 net income was $229 million, up 44% year-over-year. Diluted EPS was $0.38 for the quarter, up 52% year-over-year and at the high end of our guidance range. We are now operating above the $1.5 annualized EPS level and have established a strong foundation to build upon. As we look to the future, we will continue to prioritize EPS expansion while taking advantage of the sustainable growth opportunities. 
Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Q3 operating cash flow was $293 million and free cash flow was $291 million. For a few quarters now, we have been generating more than $900 million in annual free cash flow, excluding stranded costs. We ended Q3 with over $1 billion of total cash and $1 billion of undrawn revolver capacity. We continue to have a strong liquidity position and are levered at approximately 2x net debt. 
Now a quick update on our real estate assets held for sale. We see a lot of activity and interest in each of our properties, and recently agreed to terms for the sale of one of our buildings in Mountain View. The buyers are expected to complete their due diligence in our fourth quarter. While we've seen a lot of interest and continue to be in active discussions on all properties, we remain focused on achieving fair market value for the remaining assets for sale in Mountain View, Dublin and Tucson. 
Let me spend a few minutes specifically on capital allocation. In Q3, we returned approximately $207 million to shareholders in the form of our regular quarterly dividend and share repurchase. In the quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.125 per common share. Despite the limited open trading window, we were active in the last month of the quarter and deployed $133 million and purchased 7 million shares. As of the end of Q3, there was approximately $420 million remaining in our $1.6 billion share buyback authorization, which we expect to continue to deploy opportunistically. As described in the press release, the Board of Directors approved a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.125 per common share to be paid on March 17, 2021 for all shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 22, 2021. 
Before I move on to our Q4 outlook, let me provide an update on Avira. As you heard from Vincent, we closed the acquisition of Avira in January, which falls in our fiscal fourth quarter. While it is early, the integration process is well underway and on track to plan. As a reminder, we expect to add approximately 3 points of growth to our total revenue and be financially accretive in the first year, targeting to achieve 50% operating margin post synergies within 6 months. 
Now turning to our Q4 outlook. We expect Q4 revenue in the range of $655 million to $665 million, which translates to high single-digit growth year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.37 to $0.39 per share, assuming stable currency rates and share count dilution from Q3 buybacks. Our Q4 outlook includes the partial impact of Avira. As we enter the last quarter of our fiscal year 2021, we are proud to have achieved all of the long-term commitments we set when we stood up NortonLifeLock, including revenue growth of mid-single digits, operating margin at 50%, generating annualized free cash flow of more than $900 million and an annualized EPS of $1.50. Achieving all of those is a true testament to our renewed focus on execution and building a consistent and sustainable track record. We look forward to closing out this fiscal year strong with accelerating momentum and a scalable foundation, and we're excited about the tremendous opportunities ahead.

The pandemic has only accelerated that movement. And I think a lot is here to stay. Along with that, as you know, cybercriminals are adapting, and we've seen an increase in activity there. And the awareness from a consumer standpoint to have a cyber safety protection is more relevant than ever. We feel good about where we are as a company, both investing, as we discussed, organically and inorganically. We have a platform, the cyber safety integrated platform we've launched, Norton 360, covering 3 pillars: security, privacy and identity protection and restoration. And then along with that, we said we're going to continue and accelerate the growth by doing 3 things. One is accelerating our penetration of international markets. The second one was to, while we doubled on a direct-to-consumer go-to-market model, explore new go-to-market models, partner with companies like TELUS to penetrate Canada or explore new business models. Obviously, a membership plan was the first in the market for cyber safety. We continue to build on that. And the third one is adding new functionalities. We came with [indiscernible], et cetera. 
When I take those 3 dimensions, I [indiscernible] a plays in all 3.
[Audio Gap]
We were #3 with Avira. We moved to #1, and we accelerate our growth across Western Europe. And Avira to penetrate internationally, many markets will be definitely an asset. The second one, which you mentioned, which is the free model, going to market in different ways is very important. We have the direct-to-consumer on a premium model. We are doing B2B2C consumers. The free model for us is just one more tool in our toolbox. As functionalities could become more commoditized, we can have an offer, first access for all consumers to cyber safety using some of those in a freemium model. And then using the muscle of cross-selling and upselling and converting to the full portfolio over time. So it's a way of acquiring those eyeballs, if you want an experience around cyber safety to then later on
[Audio Gap] 
more in marketing. And the third element is they had a few nuggets in their technology. They have a very nimble and creative engineering teams and there's some functionalities, like we mentioned, the gaming booster functionally from BullGuard, and we can integrate into our gaming additions of Norton 360. So we'll continue to look at their capabilities from a portfolio perspective to enrich our overall experience. So that's how Avira plays into our growth moving forward."

So when you look at the geographical mix of the overall market, it's clear to see that we are underpenetrated internationally. So from a core security first entry point, if you want, Avira will definitely be a strong help. But where we add a real differentiator is when we bring our expertise in privacy and identity management and restoration from LifeLock, and make it in the form of an international proposal, which was always the intent when we bought LifeLock, but was lead to come as we were trying to find the first angle. With Dark Web Monitoring, which is really protecting your multiple digital identities that you have out there, we see a lot of very good positive feedback from consumers. And so now adding to that Dark Web Monitoring activities, the restoration and helping the consumers to restore claims when there is some, it's definitely also a value-add and a differentiator.

Despite the social, economic and health issues we are facing, I'm hopeful that collectively, we will emerge stronger and more united.
At NortonLifeLock, the safety and well-being of our employees is our utmost priority, and I want to thank each and every one of them for facing all those challenges, while continuing to show a deep commitment to drive our vision of protecting and empowering people to live their digital life safely.
A lot has happened since our last earnings. On top of delivering another solid quarter, accelerating our growth and adding some exceptional talents to our team and our Board, we also are proud to have been recognized by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation for earning a top score on the 2021 Equality Index. We are proud of the diverse backgrounds represented by our entire team at NortonLifeLock, and we remain committed to building an inclusive company. We know that delivering on our vision cannot happen without a committed, talented and diverse team.
In December, we announced LifeLock's first acquisition. Now that the deal has closed, we are excited to welcome Avira's employees, customers and partners to the Norton family. We are really excited by the opportunity to provide Avira's 30 million users and over 1.5 million paid customers the benefit of the Norton plus Avira offering. Together, we are now privileged to help protect over 80 million consumers globally as we embrace the important responsibility we have in securing their digital life. We are also quickly working to leverage Avira's strong presence in Europe, which now also includes BullGuard, a U.K.-based cybersecurity company that Avira added to their business last year. On top of extending our reach deeper into EMEA, we look forward to adding Avira's and BullGuard's capabilities to our portfolio.  
Before I dive into Q3 results, I want to revisit 2 key post-transition commitments we previously set as a stand-alone NortonLifeLock company. From returning to a growing customer base, a first since 2014, to delivering over $1.5 annualized EPS, I'm proud to say that we have established the company on the trajectory of sustainable and profitable growth. We are a stronger cyber safety company today, 100% focused on protecting and empowering consumers to live their digital lives safely. While we are proud of these achievements, we know we have a tremendous responsibility to deliver a portfolio that stays ahead of cybercriminals. We don't take this lightly. As we innovate and work to keep our customers safe, we know that we will be transforming our company for a richer portfolio and expanded consumer reach, and we're just getting started.
In Q3, we delivered solid growth and accelerated our momentum. Revenue was up 6% and non-GAAP EPS grew 52%. Reported billings growth was 10%, our first quarter of double-digit growth. We are closing the fiscal year out strong, and more importantly, we're well on our way to creating a meaningful and sustainable growth business. Leading the growth momentum, our partner business posted double-digit revenue growth, up 15%. Retail was strong in the quarter, performing well through eTail and during the holidays. Internationally, Japan was particularly strong as it relates to identity test protection solutions, such as Dark Web Monitoring and ID Advisor sold through partners and retailers. Finding the right opportunities and markets to build and expand these long-term partnerships is one of our key strategic focus areas to broaden our reach and bring cyber safety to more consumers in underpenetrated markets. Stay tuned for more developments in this area as we continue to transform the company.
Our direct-to-consumer revenue, which represent the majority of our business, was up 5%. We saw broad-based growth across the portfolio as well as strong performance through the holiday season. While our North America business is considerably larger than the rest of the world, the international growth rate continues to show strength and outpace the Americas. In the quarter, our direct business grew double digits across multiple countries, including Germany, France, Australia and New Zealand, where we have recently added Dark Web Monitoring into our Norton 360 offering. This is part of our strategic push to expand Norton Identity products internationally and bring more comprehensive cyber safety offering to international consumers. We definitely have more room to grow here, especially with the synergies and extended global reach we will be leveraging with Avira and the freemium model.  
In Q3, our direct customer count grew over 300,000 sequentially and close to 900,000 year-over-year, bringing our total count to 21 million. This was our fifth straight quarter of net direct customer adds sequentially. Our customer retention rate remained stable at 85%. Our industry-leading monthly ARPU, average revenue per user, also remained strong at $9. Both metrics are strong indicators that our current customers see the value of our products. Notwithstanding the effect of tenure and geographical mix, we continue to see opportunities to improve ARPU as we enriched the cyber safety value offered to our customers and to improve retention rates, especially in the early years of the customer journey. 
One of the key contributors to our customer count growth and retention success continues to be the Norton 360 integrated platform, the first truly integrated cyber safety offering in the market. At the end of Q3, approximately 60% of our installed base are using Norton 360. This platform is designed to provide a comprehensive protection while driving higher customer engagement. This level of adoption shows that our approach to provide an easy-to-use platform and comprehensive protection through a membership model resonates well with our customers, and we're working hard to continue bringing new functionalities, simplifying the membership plans and constantly improving the user experience. 
The combination of Norton 360 platform, our international expansion effort, and our strategic shift to new forms of digital marketing is working and bringing cyber safety to new customers. Looking back at the last 12 months, we've welcomed approximately 4 million new customers to NortonLifeLock, the majority of which was on Norton 360. We are seeing early improvements in renewal trends with these newer customer cohorts for engaging with this customer differently, communicating with new alerts, measuring what works, what doesn't, and we're able to scale product launches more effectively through our in-house e-commerce platform. At the heart of all of this, it's our technologies and accelerated pace of innovation that enable us to be nimble in bringing new and incremental value to customers. Sometimes, we may run the risk of failing fast, but the reward is that we learn even faster to translate that into success as we move to own the consumer cyber safety category.
With the ever-expanding scope of cyber crimes and the acceleration of the numbers of attacks that we've all witnessed in the news, we know it's critical to focus on product and service innovation to help keep consumers' digital lives safe and to raise the overall awareness of consumer cyber safety across all audience. We plan to continue to release new products and features at an accelerated pace that we have not achieved in years. Let me tell you about a couple of them launched in Q3.
As part of our global expansion efforts, we successfully launched Norton ID Advisor in Japan powered by LifeLock. Here, we specifically targeted retail and service providers to reach new audiences and increase awareness on the value of Dark Web Monitoring. One of the differentiators in this product is the access to a dedicated ID restoration specialist, a Japanese-speaking service agent, to help resolve fraudulent claims from start to finish. Another example is our enhanced Norton 360 mobile experience, which provides customers access to their device security, online privacy and identity features through one single easy-to-use app, making it easier for customers to access and manage their cyber safety tools from one dashboard. This is another example of our commitment to bring a richer and simpler experience to consumer cyber safety.
Looking back, we have demonstrated our continued commitment to grow the top line, drive disciplined operating leverage and pursue value-creation for all stakeholders. It's important to me and our entire leadership team to build credibility and a sustainable and growing financial track record. It's also worth nothing that behind our strong third quarter performance, you will find a very passionate team working hard to fulfill our vision to protect and empower people to live their digital life safely. We think customer first, we innovate and grow, we're scrappy we own it, we open, we are authentic. These are the core values we live by, and making the world cyber safe is what inspires us. 
Finally, before I pass it to Natalie, I'm excited to share a little more detail on our recent additions to the Board. Sherrese Smith is Vice Chair and Partner at Paul Hastings, a prominent global law firm. She brings extensive international experience in data privacy, cybersecurity and breach response issues. Similarly, Emily Heath, DocuSign's Chief Trust and Security Officer, brings significant experience in information security, data privacy, in addition to being a key contributor in creating consumer trust to digitally transform an industry. They are both passionate and accomplished leaders, who are already valuable member of the Board team.
And now let me turn the call over to Natalie for more details on the financial results."

For today's discussion, I will focus on non-GAAP financials, starting with our Q3 results and then provide our outlook for Q4.

For today's discussion, I will focus on non-GAAP financials, starting with our Q3 results and then provide our outlook for Q4. We delivered strong performance in Q3 with growth year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter across our key metrics. Our Q3 revenue was $639 million, up 6% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance. We accelerated reported billings growth to 10%, including a 2-point positive impact from FX in our ending contract liability balance. Our growth momentum was driven by broad-based strength across all geos and products as well as a successful holiday season.
Our total direct customer count increased to 21 million, adding 334,000 customers quarter-over-quarter and 876,000 customers year-over-year. This was our fifth consecutive quarter of net customer adds sequential. Our customer retention rate, a unit retention metric, remained stable at 85%. Our monthly average revenue per user, or ARPU, was over $9 this quarter, up 1% year-over-year and stable quarter-over-quarter. As we continue to grow our customer base, it is important to note that our first year ARPU and retention rate for newly acquired customers is generally lower than our total average. As we explore new business models and add more customers globally, ARPU can vary as our mix changes. We will look for opportunities to improve ARPU and first year retention as we continue to grow and diversify our business. 
We are still in the early innings, but our go-to-market efforts are beginning to take hold. We are leveraging our distribution channels to reach more customers globally. We accelerated growth in our direct business in Q3, driven by our growing renewable base. As we continue to add new customers, we are seeing positive data points and retention, directly correlated with our Norton 360 membership suite. As we have accelerated the pace of our innovation and launched new in-demand products and features, we are beginning to see improvements in our cross-sell and upsell efforts, and we have the opportunity to accelerate further as we expand our reach to new audiences and continue to foster growth in our loyal customer base.
In our partner business, Q3 revenue grew 15% year-over-year. We continue to make strides internationally, signing new partnerships that we expect will scale over the long term. As we have noted in previous conversations, these partner sales cycles are longer, taking 1 to 2 years or more to realize. We continue to invest in these partnerships for the long term as they are strategically important for us to expand our reach. 
Next, Q3 operating margin was 51%. We remain focused on driving operational discipline and prioritizing investments in product innovation and diversified marketing. With R&D, we continued to accelerate the pace of product introductions, growing and expanding our product portfolio and providing an increasingly differentiated value proposition for consumers. With marketing, we continue to invest to drive new customer acquisition as well as diversify our spend into more digital and international channels to help widen our audience, measuring and ensuring effectiveness along the way. We are disciplined in our approach, and we'll continue to invest in sustainable growth. 
Q3 net income was $229 million, up 44% year-over-year. Diluted EPS was $0.38 for the quarter, up 52% year-over-year and at the high end of our guidance range. We are now operating above the $1.5 annualized EPS level and have established a strong foundation to build upon. As we look to the future, we will continue to prioritize EPS expansion while taking advantage of the sustainable growth opportunities.
Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Q3 operating cash flow was $293 million and free cash flow was $291 million. For a few quarters now, we have been generating more than $900 million in annual free cash flow, excluding stranded costs. We ended Q3 with over $1 billion of total cash and $1 billion of undrawn revolver capacity. We continue to have a strong liquidity position and are levered at approximately 2x net debt.
Now a quick update on our real estate assets held for sale. We see a lot of activity and interest in each of our properties and recently agreed to terms for the sale of one of our buildings in Mountain View. The buyers are expected to complete their due diligence in our fourth quarter. While we've seen a lot of interest and continue to be in active discussions on all properties, we remain focused on achieving fair market value for the remaining assets for sale in Mountain View, Dublin and Tucson.
Let me spend a few minutes specifically on capital allocation. In Q3, we returned approximately $207 million to shareholders in the form of our regular quarterly dividend and share repurchase. In the quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.125 per common share. Despite the limited open trading window, we were active in the last month of the quarter and deployed $133 million and purchased 7 million shares. As of the end of Q3, there was approximately $420 million remaining in our $1.6 billion share buyback authorization, which we expect to continue to deploy opportunistically. As described in the press release, the Board of Directors approved a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.125 per common share to be paid on March 17, 2021, for all shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 22, 2021.
Before I move on to our Q4 outlook, let me provide an update on Avira. As you heard from Vincent, we closed the acquisition of Avira in January, which falls in our fiscal fourth quarter. While it is early, the integration process is well underway and on track to plan. As a reminder, we expect to add approximately 3 points of growth to our total revenue and be financially accretive in the first year, targeting to achieve 50% operating margin post synergies within 6 months.
Now turning to our Q4 outlook. We expect Q4 revenue in the range of $655 million to $665 million, which translates to high single-digit growth year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.37 to $0.39 per share, assuming stable currency rates and share count dilution from Q3 buybacks. Our Q4 outlook includes the partial impact of Avira.
As we enter the last quarter of our fiscal year 2021, we are proud to have achieved all of the long-term commitments we set when we stood up NortonLifeLock, including revenue growth of mid-single digits, operating margin at 50%, generating annualized free cash flow of more than $900 million and an annualized EPS of $1.50. Achieving all of those is a true testament to our renewed focus on execution and building a consistent and sustainable track record. We look forward to closing out this fiscal year strong with accelerating momentum and a scalable foundation, and we're excited about the tremendous opportunities ahead.

The pandemic has only accelerated that movement, and I think a lot is here to stay. Along with that, as you know, cybercriminals are adapting, and we've seen an increase in activity there and the awareness from a consumer standpoint to have a cyber safety protection is more relevant than ever. We feel good about where we are as a company, both investing, as we discussed, organically and inorganically. We have a platform, the cyber safety integrated platform we've launched, Norton 360, covering 3 pillars: security, privacy and identity protection and restoration. And then along with that, we said we're going to continue and accelerate the growth by doing 3 things. One is accelerating our penetration of international markets. The second one was to, while we double down on a direct-to-consumer go-to-market model, explore new go-to-market models, partner with companies like TELUS to penetrate Canada, or explore new business models. Obviously, a membership plan was the first in the market for cyber safety, we'll continue to build on that. And the third one is adding new functionalities, which came with [indiscernible], et cetera. 
When I take those 3 dimensions, Avira plays in all 3.
[Audio Gap]
We were #3 
[Audio Gap] 
with Avira, we moved to #1, and we accelerate our growth across Western Europe. And Avira to penetrate internationally, many markets will be definitely an asset. The second one, which you mentioned, which is the free model, going to market in different ways is very important. We have the direct-to-consumer on a premium model. We are doing B2B2C consumers. The free model for us is just one more tool in our toolbox. As functionalities could become more commoditized, we can have an offer, first access for all consumers to cyber safety using some of those in a freemium model and then using the muscle of cross-selling and upselling and converting to the full portfolio over time. So it's a way of acquiring those eyeballs, if you want an experience around cyber safety to then later on
[Audio Gap] 
more in marketing. And the third element is they had a few nuggets in their technology. They have a very nimble and creative engineering team and there's some functionalities, like we mentioned, the gaming booster functionally from BullGuard, and we can integrate into our gaming additions of Norton 360. So we'll continue to look at their capabilities from a portfolio perspective to enrich our overall experience. So that's how Avira plays into our growth moving forward."

But where we add a real differentiator is when we bring our expertise in privacy and identity management and restoration from LifeLock and make it in the form of an international proposal, which was always the intent when we bought LifeLock, but was late to come as we were trying to find the first angle. With Dark Web Monitoring, which is really protecting your multiple digital identities that you have out there, we see a lot of very good, positive feedback from consumers. And so now adding to that Dark Web Monitoring activities, the restoration and helping the consumers to restore claims, when there is some, is definitely also a value-add and a differentiator.

So mobile, very important user experience, right? And we acquired through multiple channels. I know in the past, as security started on the device, then on a desktop, then moved to a laptop, then moved to a mobile. I get very often the question of, wow, do you need security on new cell phone, for example? And the answer is we've moved to a user-centric view of cyber safety, which includes security, but also identity and privacy. And we see a lot of our customers using their cyber safety dashboard and tools, both on desktop and on tablet or cell phones. And therefore, mobility from a user experience perspective is hugely important to us. Simplifying that experience as we continue to enrich the value is also a core element of our investments. So you'll see more around simplifying, making cyber safety easy to use, to consume and giving consumers full peace of mind. 
In terms of the channels, we have a direct-to-customer, and I'll pass it to Natalie. And we have a second angle, which is partnership. It's very important for us to continue taking that user perspective, to work on B2B2C offering, combining our value-add with other offerings to provide full total protection to consumers depending on their situations. And I think that's the one we approach. It's not only device hardware-centric world, but it's really a user service-centric world that we're taking as an approach.

We've been diversifying into online digital channels so that we can get really relevant and interesting content out there. We can diversify the users that are coming to our platform. We've got really, really strong brand awareness.

And what I mean by that is, we have said we are -- we've been -- for the last couple of quarters, been on track to generate $900 million of annualized cash flow. And from a capital allocation perspective, we've talked about 3 main tenants. The first one being the dividend, which we paid the regular dividend in the quarter. And then as we progress, we said we would strike the right balanced approach as it pertains to opportunistic share buyback and acquisition. And so the actions in Q3, I think, speak for themselves in terms of if you look back and you think back to approximately November, and all things considered, now you guys know why we didn't necessarily -- we had the acquisition activity going on. 
As soon as our trading window was open, we opportunistically bought shares by the share buyback to the extent of $133 million. And so as you take that into account, high safety ratio in terms of leveraging and maximizing the value of our capital allocation tenants and you look forward, I would -- it's going -- our strategy remains unchanged. We will continue with the quarterly dividend and then strike that right balance on opportunistic share buyback, but we've not been shy to say that we are interested in M&A activity, especially as we look forward and look for those sustainable growth opportunities."

Increasing into the gaming verticals with new functionalities, now integrating some of the BullGuard functionalities that are really interesting.

Despite the social, economic and health issues we are facing, I'm hopeful that collectively, we will emerge stronger and more united.
At NortonLifeLock, the safety and well-being of our employees is our utmost priority, and I want to thank each and every one of them for facing all those challenges, while continuing to show a deep commitment to drive our vision of protecting and empowering people to live their digital life safely.
A lot has happened since our last earnings. On top of delivering another solid quarter, accelerating our growth and adding some exceptional talents to our team and our Board, we also are proud to have been recognized by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation for earning a top score on the 2021 Equality Index. We are proud of the diverse backgrounds represented by our entire team at NortonLifeLock, and we remain committed to building an inclusive company. We know that delivering on our vision cannot happen without a committed, talented and diverse team.
In December, we announced LifeLock's first acquisition. Now that the deal has closed, we are excited to welcome Avira's employees, customers and partners to the Norton family. We are really excited by the opportunity to provide Avira's 30 million users and over 1.5 million paid customers the benefit of the Norton plus Avira offering. Together, we are now privileged to help protect over 80 million consumers globally as we embrace the important responsibility we have in securing their digital life. We are also quickly working to leverage Avira's strong presence in Europe, which now also includes BullGuard, a U.K.-based cybersecurity company that Avira added to their business last year. On top of extending our reach deeper into EMEA, we look forward to adding Avira's and BullGuard's capabilities to our portfolio.  
Before I dive into Q3 results, I want to revisit 2 key post-transition commitments we previously set as a stand-alone NortonLifeLock company. From returning to a growing customer base, a first since 2014, to delivering over $1.5 annualized EPS, I'm proud to say that we have established the company on the trajectory of sustainable and profitable growth. We are a stronger cyber safety company today, 100% focused on protecting and empowering consumers to live their digital lives safely. While we are proud of these achievements, we know we have a tremendous responsibility to deliver a portfolio that stays ahead of cybercriminals. We don't take this lightly. As we innovate and work to keep our customers safe, we know that we will be transforming our company for a richer portfolio and expanded consumer reach, and we're just getting started.
In Q3, we delivered solid growth and accelerated our momentum. Revenue was up 6% and non-GAAP EPS grew 52%. Reported billings growth was 10%, our first quarter of double-digit growth. We are closing the fiscal year out strong, and more importantly, we're well on our way to creating a meaningful and sustainable growth business. Leading the growth momentum, our partner business posted double-digit revenue growth, up 15%. Retail was strong in the quarter, performing well through eTail and during the holidays. Internationally, Japan was particularly strong as it relates to identity test protection solutions, such as Dark Web Monitoring and ID Advisor sold through partners and retailers. Finding the right opportunities and markets to build and expand these long-term partnerships is one of our key strategic focus areas to broaden our reach and bring cyber safety to more consumers in underpenetrated markets. Stay tuned for more developments in this area as we continue to transform the company.
Our direct-to-consumer revenue, which represent the majority of our business, was up 5%. We saw broad-based growth across the portfolio as well as strong performance through the holiday season. While our North America business is considerably larger than the rest of the world, the international growth rate continues to show strength and outpace the Americas. In the quarter, our direct business grew double digits across multiple countries, including Germany, France, Australia and New Zealand, where we have recently added Dark Web Monitoring into our Norton 360 offering. This is part of our strategic push to expand Norton Identity products internationally and bring more comprehensive cyber safety offering to international consumers. We definitely have more room to grow here, especially with the synergies and extended global reach we will be leveraging with Avira and the freemium model.  
In Q3, our direct customer count grew over 300,000 sequentially and close to 900,000 year-over-year, bringing our total count to 21 million. This was our fifth straight quarter of net direct customer adds sequentially. Our customer retention rate remained stable at 85%. Our industry-leading monthly ARPU, average revenue per user, also remained strong at $9. Both metrics are strong indicators that our current customers see the value of our products. Notwithstanding the effect of tenure and geographical mix, we continue to see opportunities to improve ARPU as we enriched the cyber safety value offered to our customers and to improve retention rates, especially in the early years of the customer journey. 
One of the key contributors to our customer count growth and retention success continues to be the Norton 360 integrated platform, the first truly integrated cyber safety offering in the market. At the end of Q3, approximately 60% of our installed base are using Norton 360. This platform is designed to provide a comprehensive protection while driving higher customer engagement. This level of adoption shows that our approach to provide an easy-to-use platform and comprehensive protection through a membership model resonates well with our customers, and we're working hard to continue bringing new functionalities, simplifying the membership plans and constantly improving the user experience. 
The combination of Norton 360 platform, our international expansion effort, and our strategic shift to new forms of digital marketing is working and bringing cyber safety to new customers. Looking back at the last 12 months, we've welcomed approximately 4 million new customers to NortonLifeLock, the majority of which was on Norton 360. We are seeing early improvements in renewal trends with these newer customer cohorts for engaging with this customer differently, communicating with new alerts, measuring what works, what doesn't, and we're able to scale product launches more effectively through our in-house e-commerce platform. At the heart of all of this, it's our technologies and accelerated pace of innovation that enable us to be nimble in bringing new and incremental value to customers. Sometimes, we may run the risk of failing fast, but the reward is that we learn even faster to translate that into success as we move to own the consumer cyber safety category.
With the ever-expanding scope of cyber crimes and the acceleration of the numbers of attacks that we've all witnessed in the news, we know it's critical to focus on product and service innovation to help keep consumers' digital lives safe and to raise the overall awareness of consumer cyber safety across all audience. We plan to continue to release new products and features at an accelerated pace that we have not achieved in years. Let me tell you about a couple of them launched in Q3.
As part of our global expansion efforts, we successfully launched Norton ID Advisor in Japan powered by LifeLock. Here, we specifically targeted retail and service providers to reach new audiences and increase awareness on the value of Dark Web Monitoring. One of the differentiators in this product is the access to a dedicated ID restoration specialist, a Japanese-speaking service agent, to help resolve fraudulent claims from start to finish. Another example is our enhanced Norton 360 mobile experience, which provides customers access to their device security, online privacy and identity features through one single easy-to-use app, making it easier for customers to access and manage their cyber safety tools from one dashboard. This is another example of our commitment to bring a richer and simpler experience to consumer cyber safety.
Looking back, we have demonstrated our continued commitment to grow the top line, drive disciplined operating leverage and pursue value-creation for all stakeholders. It's important to me and our entire leadership team to build credibility and a sustainable and growing financial track record. It's also worth nothing that behind our strong third quarter performance, you will find a very passionate team working hard to fulfill our vision to protect and empower people to live their digital life safely. We think customer first, we innovate and grow, we're scrappy we own it, we open, we are authentic. These are the core values we live by, and making the world cyber safe is what inspires us. 
Finally, before I pass it to Natalie, I'm excited to share a little more detail on our recent additions to the Board. Sherrese Smith is Vice Chair and Partner at Paul Hastings, a prominent global law firm. She brings extensive international experience in data privacy, cybersecurity and breach response issues. Similarly, Emily Heath, DocuSign's Chief Trust and Security Officer, brings significant experience in information security, data privacy, in addition to being a key contributor in creating consumer trust to digitally transform an industry. They are both passionate and accomplished leaders, who are already valuable member of the Board team.
And now let me turn the call over to Natalie for more details on the financial results."

Our monthly average revenue per user, or ARPU, was over $9 this quarter, up 1% year-over-year and stable quarter-over-quarter. As we continue to grow our customer base, it is important to note that our first year ARPU and retention rate for newly acquired customers is generally lower than our total average. As we explore new business models and add more customers globally, ARPU can vary as our mix changes. We will look for opportunities to improve ARPU and first year retention as we continue to grow and diversify our business. 
We are still in the early innings, but our go-to-market efforts are beginning to take hold. We are leveraging our distribution channels to reach more customers globally. We accelerated growth in our direct business in Q3, driven by our growing renewable base. As we continue to add new customers, we are seeing positive data points and retention, directly correlated with our Norton 360 membership suite. As we have accelerated the pace of our innovation and launched new in-demand products and features, we are beginning to see improvements in our cross-sell and upsell efforts, and we have the opportunity to accelerate further as we expand our reach to new audiences and continue to foster growth in our loyal customer base.
In our partner business, Q3 revenue grew 15% year-over-year. We continue to make strides internationally, signing new partnerships that we expect will scale over the long term. As we have noted in previous conversations, these partner sales cycles are longer, taking 1 to 2 years or more to realize. We continue to invest in these partnerships for the long term as they are strategically important for us to expand our reach. 
Next, Q3 operating margin was 51%. We remain focused on driving operational discipline and prioritizing investments in product innovation and diversified marketing. With R&D, we continued to accelerate the pace of product introductions, growing and expanding our product portfolio and providing an increasingly differentiated value proposition for consumers. With marketing, we continue to invest to drive new customer acquisition as well as diversify our spend into more digital and international channels to help widen our audience, measuring and ensuring effectiveness along the way. We are disciplined in our approach, and we'll continue to invest in sustainable growth. 
Q3 net income was $229 million, up 44% year-over-year. Diluted EPS was $0.38 for the quarter, up 52% year-over-year and at the high end of our guidance range. We are now operating above the $1.5 annualized EPS level and have established a strong foundation to build upon. As we look to the future, we will continue to prioritize EPS expansion while taking advantage of the sustainable growth opportunities.
Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Q3 operating cash flow was $293 million and free cash flow was $291 million. For a few quarters now, we have been generating more than $900 million in annual free cash flow, excluding stranded costs. We ended Q3 with over $1 billion of total cash and $1 billion of undrawn revolver capacity. We continue to have a strong liquidity position and are levered at approximately 2x net debt.
Now a quick update on our real estate assets held for sale. We see a lot of activity and interest in each of our properties and recently agreed to terms for the sale of one of our buildings in Mountain View. The buyers are expected to complete their due diligence in our fourth quarter. While we've seen a lot of interest and continue to be in active discussions on all properties, we remain focused on achieving fair market value for the remaining assets for sale in Mountain View, Dublin and Tucson.
Let me spend a few minutes specifically on capital allocation. In Q3, we returned approximately $207 million to shareholders in the form of our regular quarterly dividend and share repurchase. In the quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.125 per common share. Despite the limited open trading window, we were active in the last month of the quarter and deployed $133 million and purchased 7 million shares. As of the end of Q3, there was approximately $420 million remaining in our $1.6 billion share buyback authorization, which we expect to continue to deploy opportunistically. As described in the press release, the Board of Directors approved a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.125 per common share to be paid on March 17, 2021, for all shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 22, 2021.
Before I move on to our Q4 outlook, let me provide an update on Avira. As you heard from Vincent, we closed the acquisition of Avira in January, which falls in our fiscal fourth quarter. While it is early, the integration process is well underway and on track to plan. As a reminder, we expect to add approximately 3 points of growth to our total revenue and be financially accretive in the first year, targeting to achieve 50% operating margin post synergies within 6 months.
Now turning to our Q4 outlook. We expect Q4 revenue in the range of $655 million to $665 million, which translates to high single-digit growth year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.37 to $0.39 per share, assuming stable currency rates and share count dilution from Q3 buybacks. Our Q4 outlook includes the partial impact of Avira.
As we enter the last quarter of our fiscal year 2021, we are proud to have achieved all of the long-term commitments we set when we stood up NortonLifeLock, including revenue growth of mid-single digits, operating margin at 50%, generating annualized free cash flow of more than $900 million and an annualized EPS of $1.50. Achieving all of those is a true testament to our renewed focus on execution and building a consistent and sustainable track record. We look forward to closing out this fiscal year strong with accelerating momentum and a scalable foundation, and we're excited about the tremendous opportunities ahead.

The pandemic has only accelerated that movement, and I think a lot is here to stay. Along with that, as you know, cybercriminals are adapting, and we've seen an increase in activity there and the awareness from a consumer standpoint to have a cyber safety protection is more relevant than ever. We feel good about where we are as a company, both investing, as we discussed, organically and inorganically. We have a platform, the cyber safety integrated platform we've launched, Norton 360, covering 3 pillars: security, privacy and identity protection and restoration. And then along with that, we said we're going to continue and accelerate the growth by doing 3 things. One is accelerating our penetration of international markets. The second one was to, while we double down on a direct-to-consumer go-to-market model, explore new go-to-market models, partner with companies like TELUS to penetrate Canada, or explore new business models. Obviously, a membership plan was the first in the market for cyber safety, we'll continue to build on that. And the third one is adding new functionalities, which came with [indiscernible], et cetera. 
When I take those 3 dimensions, Avira plays in all 3. Expanding internationally, we're very strong in Europe. We were #3 market share in Germany. With Avira, we moved to #1, and we accelerate our growth across Western Europe. And Avira to penetrate internationally, many markets will be definitely an asset. The second one, which you mentioned, which is the free model, going to market in different ways is very important. We have the direct-to-consumer on a premium model. We are doing B2B2C consumers. The free model for us is just one more tool in our toolbox. As functionalities could become more commoditized, we can have an offer, first access for all consumers to cyber safety using some of those in a freemium model and then using the muscle of cross-selling and upselling and converting to the full portfolio over time. So it's a way of acquiring those eyeballs, if you want an experience around cyber safety to then later on demonstrated that value without spending more in marketing. And the third element is they had a few nuggets in their technology. They have a very nimble and creative engineering team and there's some functionalities, like we mentioned, the gaming booster functionally from BullGuard, and we can integrate into our gaming additions of Norton 360. So we'll continue to look at their capabilities from a portfolio perspective to enrich our overall experience. So that's how Avira plays into our growth moving forward."

So when you look at the geographical mix of the overall market, it's clear to see that we are underpenetrated internationally. So from a core security-first entry point, if you want, Avira will definitely be a strong help. But where we add a real differentiator is when we bring our expertise in privacy and identity management and restoration from LifeLock and make it in the form of an international proposal, which was always the intent when we bought LifeLock, but was late to come as we were trying to find the first angle. With Dark Web Monitoring, which is really protecting your multiple digital identities that you have out there, we see a lot of very good, positive feedback from consumers. And so now adding to that Dark Web Monitoring activities, the restoration and helping the consumers to restore claims, when there is some, is definitely also a value-add and a differentiator. I think that opportunity to push Norton Identity international is broad across many countries, and we'll start with the big one.

I would say -- I hear you on the timing in terms of, of course, we've got to figure out from an employee benefit calendar, most people really get started understanding what partners they're going to do business with, et cetera, as those annual enrollments come later in the year. So we are definitely working hard. The employee benefits channel for us has been pretty consistent. We have been really working across the employee benefits channel to gain more partners and to really get our Norton 360 value proposition out there and really get the education and the audience has widened through the employee benefits channel. And then as we look forward, again, just to reiterate, we love this channel, and we want to make sure that we are working with the partners in the right way. There's a lot of different size and types of partners that we can go after from a growth perspective, and we're just really excited to take advantage of the opportunity. But you're right. The time is now. I mean -- and you really have to pay attention to when those employee benefits annual moment are. So we're trying to get after it, for sure."

And therefore, from that perspective, that sort of being mainly in the U.S., we are getting a higher ARPU in the U.S. And then as you move into Western Europe, we start to add some of those identities protection and restoration so we're able to grow ARPU, which is less than our aggregate, and then if you move into more international closer to emerging markets will have lower ARPU. The way we think about it is really about a set of all combined levers by cohorts and by markets. So we're going to get it. We may have pressure on an ARPU or retention rate, but as long as we continue to grow more customers by cohort or by markets, continue to improve the value we deliver to customers, we're moving into the right direction."

I know in the past, as security started on the device, then on a desktop, then moved to a laptop, then moved to a mobile. I get very often the question of, wow, do you need security on new cell phone, for example? And the answer is we've moved to a user-centric view of cyber safety, which includes security, but also identity and privacy. And we see a lot of our customers using their cyber safety dashboard and tools, both on desktop and on tablet or cell phones. And therefore, mobility from a user experience perspective is hugely important to us. Simplifying that experience as we continue to enrich the value is also a core element of our investments. So you'll see more around simplifying, making cyber safety easy to use, to consume and giving consumers full peace of mind. 
In terms of the channels, we have a direct-to-customer, and I'll pass it to Natalie. And we have a second angle, which is partnership. It's very important for us to continue taking that user perspective, to work on B2B2C offering, combining our value-add with other offerings to provide full total protection to consumers depending on their situations.

And then as we progress, we said we would strike the right balanced approach as it pertains to opportunistic share buyback and acquisition. And so the actions in Q3, I think, speak for themselves in terms of if you look back and you think back to approximately November, and all things considered, now you guys know why we didn't necessarily -- we had the acquisition activity going on. 
As soon as our trading window was open, we opportunistically bought shares by the share buyback to the extent of $133 million. And so as you take that into account, high safety ratio in terms of leveraging and maximizing the value of our capital allocation tenants and you look forward, I would -- it's going -- our strategy remains unchanged.

As we embark on 2021, I think it's important to recognize the sense of uncertainty and the ongoing challenges that we all face as individual or as a society. Despite the social, economic and health issues we are facing, I'm hopeful that collectively, we will emerge stronger and more united.
At NortonLifeLock, the safety and well-being of our employees is our utmost priority, and I want to thank each and every one of them for facing all those challenges, while continuing to show a deep commitment to drive our vision of protecting and empowering people to live their digital life safely.
A lot has happened since our last earnings. On top of delivering another solid quarter, accelerating our growth and adding some exceptional talents to our team and our Board, we also are proud to have been recognized by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation for earning a top score on the 2021 Equality Index. We are proud of the diverse backgrounds represented by our entire team at NortonLifeLock, and we remain committed to building an inclusive company. We know that delivering on our vision cannot happen without a committed, talented and diverse team.
In December, we announced LifeLock's first acquisition. Now that the deal has closed, we are excited to welcome Avira's employees, customers and partners to the Norton family. We are really excited by the opportunity to provide Avira's 30 million users and over 1.5 million paid customers the benefit of the Norton plus Avira offering. Together, we are now privileged to help protect over 80 million consumers globally as we embrace the important responsibility we have in securing their digital life. We are also quickly working to leverage Avira's strong presence in Europe, which now also includes BullGuard, a U.K.-based cybersecurity company that Avira added to their business last year. On top of extending our reach deeper into EMEA, we look forward to adding Avira's and BullGuard's capabilities to our portfolio.  
Before I dive into Q3 results, I want to revisit 2 key post-transition commitments we previously set as a stand-alone NortonLifeLock company. From returning to a growing customer base, a first since 2014, to delivering over $1.5 annualized EPS, I'm proud to say that we have established the company on the trajectory of sustainable and profitable growth. We are a stronger cyber safety company today, 100% focused on protecting and empowering consumers to live their digital lives safely. While we are proud of these achievements, we know we have a tremendous responsibility to deliver a portfolio that stays ahead of cybercriminals. We don't take this lightly. As we innovate and work to keep our customers safe, we know that we will be transforming our company for a richer portfolio and expanded consumer reach, and we're just getting started.
In Q3, we delivered solid growth and accelerated our momentum. Revenue was up 6% and non-GAAP EPS grew 52%. Reported billings growth was 10%, our first quarter of double-digit growth. We are closing the fiscal year out strong, and more importantly, we're well on our way to creating a meaningful and sustainable growth business. Leading the growth momentum, our partner business posted double-digit revenue growth, up 15%. Retail was strong in the quarter, performing well through eTail and during the holidays. Internationally, Japan was particularly strong as it relates to identity theft protection solutions, such as Dark Web Monitoring and ID Advisor sold through partners and retailers. Finding the right opportunities and markets to build and expand these long-term partnerships is one of our key strategic focus areas to broaden our reach and bring cyber safety to more consumers in underpenetrated markets. Stay tuned for more developments in this area as we continue to transform the company.
Our direct-to-consumer revenue, which represent the majority of our business, was up 5%. We saw broad-based growth across the portfolio as well as strong performance through the holiday season. While our North America business is considerably larger than the rest of the world, the international growth rate continues to show strength and outpace the Americas. In the quarter, our direct business grew double digits across multiple countries, including Germany, France, Australia and New Zealand, where we have recently added Dark Web Monitoring into our Norton 360 offering. This is part of our strategic push to expand Norton Identity products internationally and bring more comprehensive cyber safety offering to international consumers. We definitely have more room to grow here, especially with the synergies and extended global reach we will be leveraging with Avira and the freemium model.  
In Q3, our direct customer count grew over 300,000 sequentially and close to 900,000 year-over-year, bringing our total count to 21 million. This was our fifth straight quarter of net direct customer adds sequentially. Our customer retention rate remained stable at 85%. Our industry-leading monthly ARPU, average revenue per user, also remained strong at $9. Both metrics are strong indicators that our current customers see the value of our products. Notwithstanding the effect of tenure and geographical mix, we continue to see opportunities to improve ARPU as we enriched the cyber safety value offered to our customers and to improve retention rates, especially in the early years of the customer journey. 
One of the key contributors to our customer count growth and retention success continues to be the Norton 360 integrated platform, the first truly integrated cyber safety offering in the market. At the end of Q3, approximately 60% of our installed base are using Norton 360. This platform is designed to provide a comprehensive protection while driving higher customer engagement. This level of adoption shows that our approach to provide an easy-to-use platform and comprehensive protection through a membership model resonates well with our customers, and we're working hard to continue bringing new functionalities, simplifying the membership plans and constantly improving the user experience. 
The combination of Norton 360 platform, our international expansion effort, and our strategic shift to new forms of digital marketing is working and bringing cyber safety to new customers. Looking back at the last 12 months, we've welcomed approximately 4 million new customers to NortonLifeLock, the majority of which was on Norton 360. We are seeing early improvements in renewal trends with these newer customer cohorts for engaging with this customer differently, communicating with new alerts, measuring what works, what doesn't, and we're able to scale product launches more effectively through our in-house e-commerce platform. At the heart of all of this, it's our technologies and accelerated pace of innovation that enable us to be nimble in bringing new and incremental value to customers. Sometimes, we may run the risk of failing fast, but the reward is that we learn even faster to translate that into success as we move to own the consumer cyber safety category.
With the ever-expanding scope of cyber crimes and the acceleration of the numbers of attacks that we've all witnessed in the news, we know it's critical to focus on product and service innovation to help keep consumers' digital lives safe and to raise the overall awareness of consumer cyber safety across all audience. We plan to continue to release new products and features at an accelerated pace that we have not achieved in years. Let me tell you about a couple of them launched in Q3.
As part of our global expansion efforts, we successfully launched Norton ID Advisor in Japan powered by LifeLock. Here, we specifically targeted retail and service providers to reach new audiences and increase awareness on the value of Dark Web Monitoring. One of the differentiators in this product is the access to a dedicated ID restoration specialist, a Japanese-speaking service agent, to help resolve fraudulent claims from start to finish. Another example is our enhanced Norton 360 mobile experience, which provides customers access to their device security, online privacy and identity features through one single easy-to-use app, making it easier for customers to access and manage their cyber safety tools from one dashboard. This is another example of our commitment to bring a richer and simpler experience to consumer cyber safety.
Looking back, we have demonstrated our continued commitment to grow the top line, drive disciplined operating leverage and pursue value-creation for all stakeholders. It's important to me and our entire leadership team to build credibility and a sustainable and growing financial track record. It's also worth nothing that behind our strong third quarter performance, you will find a very passionate team working hard to fulfill our vision to protect and empower people to live their digital life safely. We think customer first, we innovate and grow, we're scrappy. We own it, we're open, we are authentic. These are the core values we live by, and making the world cyber safe is what inspires us. 
Finally, before I pass it to Natalie, I'm excited to share a little more detail on our recent additions to the Board. Sherrese Smith is Vice Chair and Partner at Paul Hastings, a prominent global law firm. She brings extensive international experience in data privacy, cybersecurity and breach response issues. Similarly, Emily Heath, DocuSign's Chief Trust and Security Officer, brings significant experience in information security, data privacy, in addition to being a key contributor in creating consumer trust to digitally transform an industry. They are both passionate and accomplished leaders, who are already valuable member of the Board team.
And now let me turn the call over to Natalie for more details on the financial results."
35000,701221361,2240549,"NortonLifeLock Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2021",2021-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Gen Digital Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Vincent, and hello, everyone. For today's discussion, I will focus on non-GAAP financials, starting with our Q3 results and then provide our outlook for Q4. We delivered strong performance in Q3 with growth year-over-year and quarter-over-quart",1158,"Thank you, Vincent, and hello, everyone. For today's discussion, I will focus on non-GAAP financials, starting with our Q3 results and then provide our outlook for Q4. We delivered strong performance in Q3 with growth year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter across our key metrics. Our Q3 revenue was $639 million, up 6% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance. We accelerated reported billings growth to 10%, including a 2-point positive impact from FX in our ending contract liability balance. Our growth momentum was driven by broad-based strength across all geos and products as well as a successful holiday season.
Our total direct customer count increased to 21 million, adding 334,000 customers quarter-over-quarter and 876,000 customers year-over-year. This was our fifth consecutive quarter of net customer adds sequential. Our customer retention rate, a unit retention metric, remained stable at 85%. Our monthly average revenue per user, or ARPU, was over $9 this quarter, up 1% year-over-year and stable quarter-over-quarter. As we continue to grow our customer base, it is important to note that our first year ARPU and retention rate for newly acquired customers is generally lower than our total average. As we explore new business models and add more customers globally, ARPU can vary as our mix changes. We will look for opportunities to improve ARPU and first year retention as we continue to grow and diversify our business. 
We are still in the early innings, but our go-to-market efforts are beginning to take hold. We are leveraging our distribution channels to reach more customers globally. We accelerated growth in our direct business in Q3, driven by our growing renewable base. As we continue to add new customers, we are seeing positive data points and retention, directly correlated with our Norton 360 membership suite. As we have accelerated the pace of our innovation and launched new in-demand products and features, we are beginning to see improvements in our cross-sell and upsell efforts, and we have the opportunity to accelerate further as we expand our reach to new audiences and continue to foster growth in our loyal customer base.
In our partner business, Q3 revenue grew 15% year-over-year. We continue to make strides internationally, signing new partnerships that we expect will scale over the long term. As we have noted in previous conversations, these partner sales cycles are longer, taking 1 to 2 years or more to realize. We continue to invest in these partnerships for the long term as they are strategically important for us to expand our reach. 
Next, Q3 operating margin was 51%. We remain focused on driving operational discipline and prioritizing investments in product innovation and diversified marketing. With R&D, we continued to accelerate the pace of product introductions, growing and expanding our product portfolio and providing an increasingly differentiated value proposition for consumers. With marketing, we continue to invest to drive new customer acquisition as well as diversify our spend into more digital and international channels to help widen our audience, measuring and ensuring effectiveness along the way. We are disciplined in our approach, and we'll continue to invest in sustainable growth. 
Q3 net income was $229 million, up 44% year-over-year. Diluted EPS was $0.38 for the quarter, up 52% year-over-year and at the high end of our guidance range. We are now operating above the $1.50 annualized EPS level and have established a strong foundation to build upon. As we look to the future, we will continue to prioritize EPS expansion while taking advantage of the sustainable growth opportunities.
Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Q3 operating cash flow was $293 million and free cash flow was $291 million. For a few quarters now, we have been generating more than $900 million in annual free cash flow, excluding stranded costs. We ended Q3 with over $1 billion of total cash and $1 billion of undrawn revolver capacity. We continue to have a strong liquidity position and are levered at approximately 2x net debt.
Now a quick update on our real estate assets held for sale. We see a lot of activity and interest in each of our properties and recently agreed to terms for the sale of one of our buildings in Mountain View. The buyers are expected to complete their due diligence in our fourth quarter. While we've seen a lot of interest and continue to be in active discussions on all properties, we remain focused on achieving fair market value for the remaining assets for sale in Mountain View, Dublin and Tucson.
Let me spend a few minutes specifically on capital allocation. In Q3, we returned approximately $207 million to shareholders in the form of our regular quarterly dividend and share repurchase. In the quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.125 per common share. Despite the limited open trading window, we were active in the last month of the quarter and deployed $133 million and purchased 7 million shares. As of the end of Q3, there was approximately $420 million remaining in our $1.6 billion share buyback authorization, which we expect to continue to deploy opportunistically. As described in the press release, the Board of Directors approved a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.125 per common share to be paid on March 17, 2021, for all shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 22, 2021.
Before I move on to our Q4 outlook, let me provide an update on Avira. As you heard from Vincent, we closed the acquisition of Avira in January, which falls in our fiscal fourth quarter. While it is early, the integration process is well underway and on track to plan. As a reminder, we expect to add approximately 3 points of growth to our total revenue and be financially accretive in the first year, targeting to achieve 50% operating margin post synergies within 6 months.
Now turning to our Q4 outlook. We expect Q4 revenue in the range of $655 million to $665 million, which translates to high single-digit growth year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.37 to $0.39 per share, assuming stable currency rates and share count dilution from Q3 buybacks. Our Q4 outlook includes the partial impact of Avira.
As we enter the last quarter of our fiscal year 2021, we are proud to have achieved all of the long-term commitments we set when we stood up NortonLifeLock, including revenue growth of mid-single digits, operating margin at 50%, generating annualized free cash flow of more than $900 million and an annualized EPS of $1.50. Achieving all of those is a true testament to our renewed focus on execution and building a consistent and sustainable track record. We look forward to closing out this fiscal year strong with accelerating momentum and a scalable foundation, and we're excited about the tremendous opportunities ahead.

The pandemic has only accelerated that movement, and I think a lot is here to stay. Along with that, as you know, cybercriminals are adapting, and we've seen an increase in activity there and the awareness from a consumer standpoint to have a cyber safety protection is more relevant than ever. 
We feel good about where we are as a company, both investing, as we discussed, organically and inorganically. We have a platform, the cyber safety integrated platform we've launched, Norton 360, covering 3 pillars: security, privacy and identity protection and restoration. And then along with that, we said we're going to continue and accelerate the growth by doing 3 things. 
One is accelerating our penetration of international markets. The second one was to, while we double down on a direct-to-consumer go-to-market model, explore new go-to-market models, partner with companies like TELUS to penetrate Canada, or explore new business models. Obviously, our membership plan was the first in the market for cyber safety, we'll continue to build on that. And the third one is adding new functionalities, which came with [ some time in ], et cetera. 
When I take those 3 dimensions, Avira plays in all 3. Expanding internationally, we're very strong in Europe. We were #3 market share in Germany. With Avira, we moved to #1, and we accelerate our growth across Western Europe. And Avira to penetrate internationally, many markets will be definitely an asset. The second one, which you mentioned, which is the free model, going to market in different ways is very important. We have the direct-to-consumer on a premium model. We are doing B2B2C consumers. The free model for us is just one more tool in our toolbox. 
As functionalities could become more commoditized, we can have an offer, first access for all consumers to cyber safety using some of those in a freemium model and then using the muscle of cross-selling and upselling and converting to the full portfolio over time. So it's a way of acquiring those eyeballs, if you want an experience around cyber safety to then later on demonstrated that value without spending more in marketing. 
And the third element is they had a few nuggets in their technology. They have a very nimble and creative engineering team and there's some functionalities, like we mentioned, the gaming booster functionally from BullGuard, and we can integrate into our gaming additions of Norton 360. So we'll continue to look at their capabilities from a portfolio perspective to enrich our overall experience. So that's how Avira plays into our growth moving forward."

Now to answer your question around renewal and conversion, yes, we are seeing early improvements in our renewal rates related to our new customer cohorts. And now, look, it's early, but I would say the Norton 360 platform is definitely helping us. It's gaining good traction with now nearly 60% of our base.

And how should we think about the cost of reaching these markets?"

So when you look at the geographical mix of the overall market, it's clear to see that we are underpenetrated internationally. 
So from a core security-first entry point, if you want, Avira will definitely be a strong help. But where we add a real differentiator is when we bring our expertise in privacy and identity management and restoration from LifeLock and make it in the form of an international proposal, which was always the intent when we bought LifeLock, but was late to come as we were trying to find the first angle. 
With Dark Web Monitoring, which is really protecting your multiple digital identities that you have out there, we see a lot of very good, positive feedback from consumers. And so now adding to that Dark Web Monitoring activities, the restoration and helping the consumers to restore claims, when there is some, is definitely also a value-add and a differentiator. I think that opportunity to push Norton Identity international is broad across many countries, and we'll start with the big one. Japan was the first one where we got real roots. We expanded into Australia, New Zealand, Germany, U.K., touching France, and we'll continue to penetrate actively all of the interesting markets."

Increasing into the gaming verticals with new functionalities, now integrating some of the BullGuard functionalities that are really interesting. And so we have a long list, if you want, of opportunities that we are working with our engineers and our product people. 
And then the third element, of course, is to continue to expand outside of the U.S. to be a truly global and reach out everyone, the 5 billion connected to the Internet that have a digital life online."

Everything from the expanding Norton 360 integrated platform and the suite of products that Vincent has talked about and whether you talk about where you're at in the funnel in terms of whether you're brand new, and we need to explain the value that we can bring to consumers globally or if you are an existing customer perhaps on the security side, and we can find ways to share the value we can bring to your life from an identity perspective.

For today's discussion, I will focus on non-GAAP financials, starting with our Q1 results and then provide our outlook for Q2 and full year. Fiscal year 2022 is off to a strong start. Our Q1 revenue was $691 millio",954,"Thank you, Vincent, and hello, everyone. For today's discussion, I will focus on non-GAAP financials, starting with our Q1 results and then provide our outlook for Q2 and full year. Fiscal year 2022 is off to a strong start. Our Q1 revenue was $691 million, up 13% year-over-year on an as-reported basis, delivering above the high end of our guidance range. 
We grew bookings by 12% in the quarter. Our growth was driven by broad-based strength across all geos and products and included a 2-point positive impact from that -- FX. Our total direct customer count increased to over 23.1 million, adding 2.6 million customers year-over-year and adding 150,000 net new customers quarter-over-quarter. This was our seventh consecutive quarter of sequential net customer adds, a testament to our growing value proposition. 
Our customer retention rate, a unit retention metric remains stable at 85%. Our monthly average revenue per user, or ARPU, is up on a sequential basis to $8.84. Our growing customer base, combined with our strong retention rate and expanding ARPU, accelerated the revenue growth of our direct business to 11% year-over-year. We continue to add more in-demand products and features into the portfolio to assist our cross-sell and upsell efforts, keeping loyal customers engaged through their life cycle. 
As we continue to grow our customer base, it is important to note that our first year ARPU and retention rate for newly acquired customers is generally lower than our total average. But our growing product portfolio and customer-centric mindset make us well positioned to foster growth with these customers while expanding our reach to new audiences. 
Our partner business is a key tenet of our go-to-market strategy and once again posted strong results in Q1, up 29% year-over-year, including Avira and with broad-based growth across our distribution channels. Our employee benefits channel continues to post double-digit growth with an expanded pipeline. More small and mid-market employers are discovering that our identity theft protection solutions help mitigate the rapidly evolving cyber safety threats, including recent concerns related to unemployment and tax fraud. 
We're proud of the progress we've made so far and are excited about the upcoming expansion efforts in this channel. We also drove double-digit retail growth in key European countries as we continue to adapt to the market conditions in each country and focus on building the strategic partnerships needed to achieve our long-term goals. 
Turning to profitability. We remain focused on executing to achieve our long-term strategy and consistently drive sustainable growth with operational discipline. As I shared at our Investor Day, we continue to drive the core business at or above a 50% margin rate with Q1 operating at 51%, up 410 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we invested in performance marketing and product innovation. With our marketing investments, we operate with a disciplined approach in new customer acquisition, measuring and ensuring effectiveness along the way while adapting to consumer behavior shifts in the market and newer media offerings. 
We keep our eyes on the marketplace and continue to evolve our marketing spend mix to expand our reach in a relevant and efficient manner. With R&D, we continue to accelerate the pace of product introductions, investing to expand our product portfolio and provide an increasingly differentiated value proposition for consumers, all the while focused on operational excellence and funding additional investment capacity through G&A efficiencies. Q1 net income was $248 million, up 32% year-over-year. 
Diluted EPS was $0.42 for the quarter, up 35% year-over-year and at the high end of our guidance range. We continue to prioritize sustainable growth and maintain strong operational discipline to deliver EPS expansion in line with our long-term strategy. Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Q1 operating cash flow was $258 million, and free cash flow was $257 million. We ended Q1 with over $1.2 billion of total cash and $1 billion of undrawn revolver capacity. 
Please note this does not reflect the cash proceeds from the sale of our Mountain View ELS buildings, which closed in mid-July, for total cash proceeds of approximately $358 million. We continue to have a strong liquidity position, healthy balance sheet and are levered at approximately 2x net debt. 
Now let me spend a few minutes specifically on capital allocation. In Q1, we returned approximately $74 million to shareholders in the form of our regular quarterly dividend of $0.125 per common share. At the end of Q1, there was approximately $1.8 billion remaining in the current share buyback program, which we intend to deploy opportunistically. 
As described in the press release, for Q2, the Board of Directors approved a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.125 per common share to be paid on September 15, 2021, for all shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 23, 2021. 
Now turning to our Q2 and full year outlook. We expect Q2 non-GAAP revenue in the range of $690 million to $700 million, which translates to 10% to 12% growth year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.41 to $0.43 per share, assuming stable currency rates. We also reiterate our full year non-GAAP guidance presented in May at Investor Day, which is revenue growth of 8% to 10% plus year-over-year and EPS in the range of $1.65 to $1.75. 
Q1 was a great start to the year, and we look forward to building on this growth momentum with our scalable foundation. We're excited about the tremendous opportunities ahead. Thank you for your time today, and I will now turn the call back to the operator to take your questions. But please do keep in mind, we are not able to answer any questions related to any specific M&As at this time. Operator?"

It's not rocket science. There are really 3 areas we use capital for. One is for inorganic investments, and we talk about M&A and all capitalized investment. The other one is buyback and the other one is dividend. And we use all 3 in a balanced way. Now when we talk about balanced way, it doesn't mean that every quarter it will be balanced.

When we became NortonLifeLock, 100% focused on consumers, really maximizing the protection for digital lab tops of every consumers connected to the internet. 
We said, and I'll confirm that today, we look at always to reach the customers, all go-to-market channels.

So it's the first time we have 3 months, a full quarter of 12 months looking back and a lot of investors and a lot of people were wondering where we're going to be able to maintain a customer account growth. 
And we definitely have seen the impact of a lower quarter Q1, as you know, when in summer, people get out and they're less into their digital lives. But I think the progress we've made in expanding the need for cyber safety platform, which is different than just a PC antivirus, if you want, has shown, and we were able to maintain not only a year-over-year growth sequential growth, which is pretty extraordinary continued in Q1, but Q4 is a big quarter with the tax quarter and then normally Q1 sequentially is down and we're able to grow it.

Now they are first year renewal rates so that are lower than average 85% but the first year renewal rates a year ago, 2 years ago, are in line to what we saw this quarter. We believe it's an opportunity to improve retention rate by specific -- or driving specific operational initiatives around the first year cohort and customer satisfaction and experience. 
But we have not seen a change in behavior with what -- Some of you may have called the COVID cohort, if you want. The third question I get is around Avira. Avira was slightly below in their retention rate, below our average northern customers, but not that far behind. And despite the addition of a little bit less than 2 million Avira customers, we've seen an overall retention rate for our business that maintained around 85%. 
And I have more details and we've not made them public for obvious reasons, but I have more details, and I can tell you that improved on every line and Avira 2 continues to have a solid although small incrementally a solid performance on both acquisition and retention. 
In addition, they have a third dimension we are learning or we're building is really the free [indiscernible] conversion and we've redeployed some of our marketing capacity and capabilities to drive and increase that conversion rate as well. So we're very pleased by the performance of all of our lines of businesses."

And from here, we continue to see good traction on ARPU. Now  as you know, as we continue to acquire new customers and be a net grower overall, the first year ARPU is lower than the multiyear. And so the headwind from that first year cohort growing is then offset by the slide but consistent and incremental improvement from the Norton 360 and the upselling to the portfolio."

Last year, Yes. Last year, we grew sequentially between 100,000 net new customers to have 400,000 net new customer depending on the quarter. We also know that Q1 and Q2 had a seasonally low quarter on a sequential basis, and then Q3 is more security driven and Q4 is a tax identity-driven quarter. 
And so growing 150,000 quarter, while it's less than Q4, of course, of last quarter, it is a very strong performance in a first seasonally low quarter sequential net customer adds. So it's right on our plan. It's right on our short-term and long-term commitment. Do we would we want to have a higher awareness and penetrate faster, of course, but we feel pretty good about that plan. What is the impact of the COVID or post-COVID market opening versus the normal effect of more people being in summertime on vacation, the month on the beach and less on their digital life that we cannot say. And I think it will always be a business that in the winter is a bit more dominant than it is in the summer."

It is a business that had not been invested enough in the past as they shifted from partnership, the OEM mainly into direct-to-customer and build a very strong direct-to-consumer engine. We said it will be much more diversified and go in every areas. There is no one salesperson within our go-to-market way that doesn't come during our weekly or monthly reviews and say I have a new idea should we invest in that. And Natalie and I are going through the review, look at the investment and decide to invest. 
We have increased our sales capacity in a few of the channels. I mentioned a quarter or 2 quarters ago, our employee benefit channel that has been growing double digit and we continue to build that up. mentioned, of course, the OEMs still small, but we can do more. We have our SP business that continue to grow. And then Natalie mentioned that between online and physical retail balancing it and really strategically moving through the different opportunities by local market has always been an effort. Recently, a few months ago, we also started a country-by-country strategy that look at all of our different channels, if you want and trying to balance our investment in a coordinated way at the local level, and that also is bearing its fruit.

So before we dive into our first quarter results, let me start by addressing the possible combination with Avast. We confirm that we are in advanced discussions with the Board of Avast regarding a possible merger. As we've said many times, M&A is a key part of our strategy and we're constantly looking at potential acquisitions and investment opportunities, some small, some larger in size. 
We believe in being disciplined in our approach and playing for the long term. So if or when we have material developments, we will share those with you. I'm sure you understand that today, we will not be able to answer any question related to specific cases. 
So now with that out of the way, just barely over 2 months ago at our Investor Day, we shared with you our long-term strategic path to meaningful and sustainable growth. And the ambitious big goals we set then should tell you everything you need to know about our opportunity that we see in front of us. Big, audacious goals are not achieved in the short term, of course, but quarter-by-quarter, strong execution creates the momentum that would allow us to meet our long-term goals. And Q1 is just that, a strong execution and solid results that put us right on track to achieve our ambition. 
We are off to a strong start to fiscal year 2022, with solid financial results for Q1. The direct-to-consumer demand for cyber safety remains a global opportunity, and our Q1 results are evidence of that evolving and underpenetrated opportunity. Overall, Q1 performance was in line with short-term and long-term commitments. Bookings and revenue growth were 12% and 13%, respectively, and EPS grew 35%. The we sustain our growth momentum in Q1, managing our business through the unpredictable macro environment and the transition to post-pandemic environment in many parts of the world. 
At the heart of it, it is critical for us to focus on product and service innovation. This is the only way we can stay at the forefront of the ever-changing scope and sophistication of cyber crimes and offer consumers the best in cyber safety. In the first quarter, we unveiled 4 new products, doubling the number of new product introductions compared to a year ago. As we have said at our Investor Day, it is about being nimble, showcasing our ability to move faster and being better by learning along the way. 
Let me tell you about a couple of these product releases in Q1. As planned and previewed, we launched a very first integrated product with Avira called Game Optimizer. This new feature on Norton 360 platform is designed to maximize gaming performance while strengthening security, freeing PCs from programs that are typically running in the background and hogging CPU system resources. This is another tool in our expanding toolbox, and we're excited and eager to give gamers tools that they not only need but want. 
Another new product is Norton Crypto. While the seed investment is in its infancy, it is another example of how we are committed to innovation and how we are looking to enable and empower the digital lives of consumers. Digital currency is becoming an increasingly important part of consumers' digital lives, and this feature allows you to use your idle PC time to earn digital currency. And our Norton Crypto Wallet allows you to track, transfer and store earnings in the cloud. 
We accelerated our pace of innovation to be the first cyber safety company to provide such a feature to help ensure our customers have a safe and easy way to mine crypto without having to make trade-offs that could compromise their cybersecurity. 
As we transform our company to offer a richer portfolio, we've also made great strides in extending our overall consumer reach. In Q1, our direct-to-consumer revenue which represents the majority of our business, was up 11%. Our global expansion efforts are working as Q1 growth was partly driven by record growth in international. While our North America business remains larger than the rest of the world, the international growth rate once again outpaced the Americas. 
Similar to last quarter, our direct business grew double digits across multiple countries, including the U.K., Germany, France, Australia and New Zealand. We continue to make great progress in leveraging Avira's freemium model to broaden our reach while accelerating their free to paid conversion using our marketing capabilities. 
Another area of strength is our partner business, which posted double-digit revenue growth for the third straight quarter, up to 29% in Q1, including Avira. Key channels continue to drive the growth from employee benefits to online retail and service providers. As part of our all-in effort to build the most comprehensive go-to-market model, we recently expanded our partnerships with Lenovo for our OEM business. Selected 5G Lenovo laptop PCs will be pre-installed with Norton Security and VPN app available now in selected markets. While our OEM business is small, it demonstrates that we will continue to explore all avenues to reach customers. We've been highly engaged in various opportunities and markets globally in our panel business. Our goal is to continue to build and expand these long-term partnerships and increase cyber safety awareness everywhere. 
In Q1, our direct customer count grew over 150,000 sequentially and including Avira, over 2.5 million customers year-over-year, bringing our total direct customer count to 23.1 million. This was our seventh straight quarter of net direct customer adds sequentially in a quarter that has been historically down sequentially driven by normal seasonality.
Our customer retention rate remained strong at 85% as we drive new initiatives to further improve retention overall and within specific products and customer cohorts. As we shared at our Investor Day, we have started multiple operational initiatives targeting areas of improvement such as our first year cohort or geographies with different customer profiles. Customer satisfaction and retention will continue to be a long-term focus for this leadership team. 
Finally, before I pass it to Natalie, I want to reiterate our core values and our inspiration to fulfill our vision to protect and empower people to live their digital lives safely. We think customer first, we innovate and grow we're scrappy, we own it, and we are open and authentic. These are the core values that push us to be better every single day to make the world cyber safe.
Quarter in, quarter out, we have been and continue to exercise financial discipline and reinforce our cadence of innovation. We have demonstrated our ability to grow this business relentlessly building a strong financial track record with consistent and accelerated growth. We are far from being down, of course, and we're just getting started as we look to transform our company to redefine consumer cyber safety. And with that, let me turn it over to Natalie."

For today's discussion, I will focus on non-GAAP financials, starting with our Q1 results and then provide our outlook for Q2 and full year. Fiscal year 2022 is off to a strong start. Our Q1 revenue was $691 million, up 13% year-over-year on an as-reported basis, delivering above the high end of our guidance range.
We grew bookings by 12% in the quarter. Our growth was driven by broad-based strength across all geos and products and included a 2-point positive impact from that -- FX. Our total direct customer count increased to over 23.1 million, adding 2.6 million customers year-over-year and adding 150,000 net new customers quarter-over-quarter. This was our seventh consecutive quarter of sequential net customer adds, a testament to our growing value proposition.
Our customer retention rate, a unit retention metric remains stable at 85%. Our monthly average revenue per user, or ARPU, is up on a sequential basis to $8.84. Our growing customer base, combined with our strong retention rate and expanding ARPU, accelerated the revenue growth of our direct business to 11% year-over-year. We continue to add more in-demand products and features into the portfolio to assist our cross-sell and upsell efforts, keeping loyal customers engaged through their life cycle.
As we continue to grow our customer base, it is important to note that our first year ARPU and retention rate for newly acquired customers is generally lower than our total average. But our growing product portfolio and customer-centric mindset make us well positioned to foster growth with these customers while expanding our reach to new audiences.
Our partner business is a key tenet of our go-to-market strategy and once again posted strong results in Q1, up 29% year-over-year, including Avira and with broad-based growth across our distribution channels. Our employee benefits channel continues to post double-digit growth with an expanded pipeline. More small and mid-market employers are discovering that our identity theft protection solutions help mitigate the rapidly evolving cyber safety threats, including recent concerns related to unemployment and tax fraud.
We're proud of the progress we've made so far and are excited about the upcoming expansion efforts in this channel. We also drove double-digit retail growth in key European countries as we continue to adapt to the market conditions in each country and focus on building the strategic partnerships needed to achieve our long-term goals.
Turning to profitability. We remain focused on executing to achieve our long-term strategy and consistently drive sustainable growth with operational discipline. As I shared at our Investor Day, we continue to drive the core business at or above a 50% margin rate with Q1 operating at 51%, up 410 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we invested in performance marketing and product innovation. With our marketing investments, we operate with a disciplined approach in new customer acquisition, measuring and ensuring effectiveness along the way while adapting to consumer behavior shifts in the market and newer media offerings.
We keep our eyes on the marketplace and continue to evolve our marketing spend mix to expand our reach in a relevant and efficient manner. With R&D, we continue to accelerate the pace of product introductions, investing to expand our product portfolio and provide an increasingly differentiated value proposition for consumers, all the while focused on operational excellence and funding additional investment capacity through G&A efficiencies. 
Q1 net income was $248 million, up 32% year-over-year. Diluted EPS was $0.42 for the quarter, up 35% year-over-year and at the high end of our guidance range. We continue to prioritize sustainable growth and maintain strong operational discipline to deliver EPS expansion in line with our long-term strategy. 
Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Q1 operating cash flow was $258 million, and free cash flow was $257 million. We ended Q1 with over $1.2 billion of total cash and $1 billion of undrawn revolver capacity. Please note this does not reflect the cash proceeds from the sale of our Mountain View Ellis buildings, which closed in mid-July, for total cash proceeds of approximately $358 million. We continue to have a strong liquidity position, healthy balance sheet and are levered at approximately 2x net debt.
Now let me spend a few minutes specifically on capital allocation. In Q1, we returned approximately $74 million to shareholders in the form of our regular quarterly dividend of $0.125 per common share. At the end of Q1, there was approximately $1.8 billion remaining in the current share buyback program, which we intend to deploy opportunistically.
As described in the press release, for Q2, the Board of Directors approved a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.125 per common share to be paid on September 15, 2021, for all shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 23, 2021.
Now turning to our Q2 and full year outlook. We expect Q2 non-GAAP revenue in the range of $690 million to $700 million, which translates to 10% to 12% growth year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.41 to $0.43 per share, assuming stable currency rates. We also reiterate our full year non-GAAP guidance presented in May at Investor Day, which is revenue growth of 8% to 10% plus year-over-year and EPS in the range of $1.65 to $1.75.
Q1 was a great start to the year, and we look forward to building on this growth momentum with our scalable foundation. We're excited about the tremendous opportunities ahead. Thank you for your time today, and I will now turn the call back to the operator to take your questions. But please do keep in mind, we are not able to answer any questions related to any specific M&As at this time. Operator?"

But first, let me talk about the overall strategy moving forward is really about investing into innovation, bring more product to redefine cyber safety, investing, Natalie talked about marketing, but broadly defined investing in the more solid go-to-market model.
We know that this market is still vastly underpenetrated when you take a broad definition of cyber safety and reaching out to our customers is very important. We said it at the Analyst Day, we are operating management team that create levers within the P&L. So improving capacity to drive more innovations, more productivity there, more marketing spend. But we are also using all levers of our business, including the balance sheet and there you talk about the capital and capital allocation.
It's not rocket science. There are really 3 areas we use capital for. One is for inorganic investments, and we talk about M&A and all capitalized investments. The other one is buyback and the other one is dividend. And we use all 3 in a balanced way. Now when we talk about balanced way, it doesn't mean that every quarter it will be balanced. Also last year, over 12 months, it was exactly 1/3, 1/3, 1/3, but we really take a very long-term view of our business when it comes to investment and use of cash."

As you know, the economic on a long-term basis, take a 7-year or 10-year view requires more investment upfront and then profitability over time as you -- total customer value has a long tail 6, 7 years. So that's how it works.
When Symantec decided to really focus on maximizing the profit of the consumer division to fund the enterprise turnaround, they made certain decisions. When we became NortonLifeLock, 100% focused on consumers, really maximizing the protection for digital lives of every consumers connected to the internet.
We said, and I'll confirm that today, we look at always to reach the customers, all go-to-market channels. It's just they have to make sense financially in the short, mid- or long-term view and we'll go and develop the best, most diversified distribution channel for reaching all those consumers, creating the awareness and fulfilling the demand. 
As part of that, I also said we don't have anything that we want to exclude from and obviously, relationship with PC manufacturers, although we are focused on the user experience and the Internet and the cloud digital lives is one of the ways that could be favorable.

Totally good. So your point on the 2. And I'm sure Saket mend them behind his questions, which is this is the first full quarter where you're leaping the first big growth we had as we entered the COVID locked-in periods last year, as you remember, starting in March, but really impacting this quarter. So it's the first time we have 3 months, a full quarter of 12 months looking back and a lot of investors and a lot of people were wondering where we're going to be able to maintain a customer account growth.
And we definitely have seen the impact of a lower quarter Q1, as you know, when in summer, people get out and they're less into their digital lives. But I think the progress we've made in expanding the need for cyber safety platform, which is different than just a PC antivirus, if you want, has shown, and we were able to maintain not only a year-over-year growth but a sequential growth, which is pretty extraordinary considering in Q1, while Q4 is a big quarter with the tax quarter and then normally Q1 sequentially is down and we're able to grow it. So very happy by the results. As Natalie mentioned, it's in line to what we had embedded into our guidance. So we are on plan and put a big deposit into our full year plan. 
The second question I get from investors is those people or those customers that signed in for the first time during the COVID period, are they going to renew at the same level?
And what we have seen in now 4 months looking back March to end of June, we've seen very renewal rates. Now they are first year renewal rates so that are lower than average 85% but the first year renewal rates a year ago, 2 years ago, are in line to what we saw this quarter. 
We believe it's an opportunity to improve retention rate by specific -- or driving specific operational initiatives around the first year cohort and customer satisfaction and experience. But we have not seen a change in behavior with what some of you may have called the COVID cohort, if you want. 
The third question I get is around Avira. Avira was slightly below in their retention rate, below our average Norton customers, but not that far behind. And despite the addition of a little bit less than 2 million Avira customers, we've seen an overall retention rate for our business that maintained around 85%.
And I have more details and we've not made them public for obvious reasons, but I have more details, and I can tell you that with improved on every line and Avira too continues to have a solid although small incrementally a solid performance on both acquisition and retention.
In addition, they have a third dimension we are learning or we're building is really the free to paid conversion and we've redeployed some of our marketing capacity and capabilities to drive and increase that conversion rate as well. So we're very pleased by the performance of all of our lines of businesses."

And so it lowered our aggregated ARPU that was at $9.10 before the acquisition to $8.80 when you take the aggregate by the pure fact of adding new customers that only had exposure to security plus a few other products, but didn't have exposure to a full cyber safety platform.
And from here, we continue to see good traction on ARPU. Now as you know, as we continue to acquire new customers and be a net grower overall, the first year ARPU is lower than the multiyear. And so the headwind from that first year cohort growing is then offset by the slide but consistent and incremental improvement from the Norton 360 and the upselling to the portfolio."

Last year, Yes. Last year, we grew sequentially between 100,000 net new customers to have 400,000 net new customer depending on the quarter.

And so growing 150,000 quarter, while it's less than Q4, of course, a last quarter, it is a very strong performance in a first seasonally low quarter sequential net customer adds. So it's right on our plan. It's right on our short-term and long-term commitment. Do we -- would we want to have a higher awareness and penetrate faster?

Mentioned, of course, the OEM's still small, but we can do more. We have our xSP business that continue to grow.

Welcome, and good afternoon, everyone. We've come a long way since we became a consumer-focused stand-alone company exactly 2 years ago today.

We've come a long way since we became a consumer-focused stand-alone company exactly 2 years ago today. As I reflect on NortonLifeLock transformation, I'm extremely proud of our team. We committed to operating within financial discipline and bringing meaningful and sustainable growth to this business, and we have delivered. We have relentlessly been building a strong track record and remain focused on meeting our long-term objectives. 
As you've heard me share before, we are focused on driving growth by improving customer experience, scaling our integrated cybersafety platform and accelerating the pace of our product innovation from core security to trust-based digital solutions. By putting our customers first and relentlessly executing to our plan, we believe our long-term goals are within reach. 
Our strategy is working. And as we delivered another quarter of solid and consistent growth, Q2 revenue was up 11%, with high single-digit growth in bookings. We are delivering strong profitability and continued EPS expansion up almost 20% year-over-year. Our high single-digit bookings growth was in line to our long-term objectives and is reflective of our normal seasonality, with the first half of our fiscal year historically being seasonally lower. 
The start of Q2 was impacted by expected weaker summer demand and COVID reopening as more people mobilized or prioritized to travel and other activities. As we balanced all of our operational metrics and investment, we finished the quarter with strong momentum, delivering our eighth straight quarter of net direct customer adds sequentially. Our direct customer count grew over 178,000 sequentially, and we added over 2.6 million customers year-over-year, bringing our total customer count to 23.3 million. 
In Q2, our direct-to-consumer revenue, which represented the majority of our business, was up 9%, with ARPU growing slightly quarter-over-quarter and unit retention stable. We have continued to build a richer and more robust product portfolio as we reach more consumers on a global basis while driving higher engagement with our existing customers. Our Net Promoter Score continues to improve from low 40s last year to 49 this quarter, reflecting our focus on customer experience and providing peace of mind to our customers as they live their digital lives. 
Our international expansion efforts continued in Q2 and grew double digits similar to last quarter. We continue to invest in our freemium model as it increases our consumer reach and awareness, and we are encouraged that our nascent expansion into identity internationally is now available in more than 20 countries across Europe and Asia. It is a critical component of our ability to provide more value to our customers outside of the U.S., replicating the success we have had with ID Advisor in Japan, where we combined dark web monitoring with elements of restoration. 
Our partner business posted double-digit revenue growth for the quarter for the actually fourth straight quarter, up 25% in Q2. All channels contributed meaningfully to these results. Amongst those, the employee benefits channel delivered another very strong quarter. We've expanded beyond the United States, offering our employee benefit solutions to Canadian employers and unlocking a broader customer base. Our investment in this area are paying off as we have strengthened our sales team and market coverage in the last few quarters. We intend to expand our overall partner business, and we will continue to invest in our multichannel approach evaluating all potential opportunities and markets globally. 
Overall, we are on track to our plan and committed to investing in what we see as a long-term secular growth opportunity to develop the best cybersafety portfolio for consumers. As a result, we continued to accelerate the pace of our product innovation pipeline as we work to bring cybersafety to every digital user and release products that help protect consumers' devices, privacy and identity. 
We opened the quarter with the release of Norton Utilities Ultimate, a new performance maintenance offering that helps create a faster and smoother and more secure experience for consumers, whether they're gaming or browsing or streaming content or more on their Windows PC. We expanded Norton family with new features, including Favorite Locations, to help parents establish approved geographic locations and receive notifications when their child's device arrives or departs those set locations. We also introduced Alert Me, which helps parents inform about their children's location by setting specific dates and times to receive automatic check-in alerts from the location of their child's device. Both of these new features were quite timely as many kids headed back to school in person. 
On the Identity front, we added payday loan lock to selected U.S. LifeLock plans to help block the opening of fraudulent payday loans and other short-term loans. And we've added new features like social media monitoring in more markets to provide consumers with broader protection as their digital footprint expands. 
As awareness grows globally for identity protection, we continue to evolve our road map to protect our customers and provide the most relevant products and features to new audiences. As we continue to strengthen our privacy pillar and help provide additional ways for consumers to control their online privacy, we released Norton AntiTrack in the U.S., a new app and browser extension that helps prevent websites from tracking and profiling users in ways normal private browsers or VPNs cannot do. That way, people can protect and control their digital footprint from companies and websites that track online activities and collect or sell their personal data. We've seen positive momentum from this new product release as consumers are seeing ways to protect their privacy. And I'm pleased to share that Norton AntiTrack has expanded now to APG and EMEA earlier this week. Privacy overall is 1 of the 3 pillars of our cybersafety portfolio, and we should continue to see investment in this area to help consumers manage their privacy and reputation online. 
In Q2, we also released our first environmental, social and governance report. This report highlights NortonLifeLock's ongoing pledge to bring together our team, expertise and technology to help build a safe, inclusive and sustainable future. We are making good progress on this front, and I'm proud of all of our employees, the commitment we have made together to develop a responsible company. I encourage you to check all of our achievement in that area on our IR website. 
Additionally, we were recognized by the Business Intelligence Group 2021 Sales and Marketing Technology Award or what they call the semis, which ranked NortonLifeLock as one of the top medium-sized companies of 2021 for innovation in sales and marketing technology. We were recognized for our efforts upgrading customer service operations with the development of a new internal sales platform that was built by our own in-house engineers and launched in the spring of 2021. 
This technology enable us to better deliver key customer services within a single easy-to-use interface. The platform also replaced a legacy vendor-supplied solution, driving cost efficiencies for the company. This is a great example of the team's living our value. They advocated for the customer. They were empowered to take initiative to identify the opportunity, and they delighted customers while improving our business operations. And more importantly, they delivered. 
Before I turn the call over to Natalie to discuss the financial results, I would like to provide an update on our proposed merger with Avast. We have made great progress, and we continue to be enthusiastic about the combination of the 2 companies and the opportunity to accelerate innovation in cybersafety. We crossed an important milestone today with NortonLifeLock shareholders voting to overwhelmingly support our ongoing transformation through the proposed merger with Avast with the next key step being the Avast shareholder vote scheduled for November 18. We're also actively and collaboratively working through the antitrust and other regulatory processes in all relevant jurisdictions, and we believe we are on track to close mid of next calendar year 2022, as previously stated. 
Our strategy has been to protect and empower consumers as more and more of their lives move online, and this transaction will allow the combined companies to invest in and accelerate innovation for new cybersafety products. 
And now let me turn the call over to Natalie for more details on the financials."

To all our customers, shareholders and listeners around the world who are celebrating Diwali today, may the festival of lights bring joy and happiness to you and your families. For today's discussion, I will focus on non-GAAP financials, starting with our Q2 results and then provide our outlook for Q3 and full year. 
We delivered another solid quarter, rounding out a strong first half of our fiscal year. Our Q2 revenue was $695 million, up 11%. Our growth remains broad-based across geos and products. Bookings growth of 7% was supported by our renewal efforts, expanded product offerings and continued international expansion. 
Our total direct customer count increased to 23.3 million, adding 2.6 million customers year-over-year and adding 178,000 net new customers quarter-over-quarter. This was our eighth consecutive quarter of sequential net direct customer adds. In a quarter where there is seasonally lower demand, our strong net adds in Q2 is evidence that there is growing demand for our products, and we feel proud to have added over 300,000 net new customers in the first half of our fiscal year. 
Our operational metrics remain strong, with 85% unit retention and our monthly average revenue per user, or ARPU, increased on a sequential basis to $8.85. As a result, our direct business maintained consistent growth momentum, up 9% in revenue. 
We continue to drive higher engagement with our existing loyal customers through the accelerated pace of new product releases while scaling up our cross-sell efforts. We are also reaching more audiences with the expansion of our identity protection offerings into more international markets, providing broader cybersafety protection to newer cohorts of customers. 
As Vincent mentioned earlier, our partner business again posted strong results in Q2, up 25% year-over-year with continued strength in employee benefits as well as growth from other distribution channels. Although it accounts for approximately 10% of our total, our partner business remains a key tenet of our long-term growth strategy and will continue to be an important investment area for us, and we are encouraged by the year-to-date growth unlocks thus far. 
Turning to profitability. Q2 operating margin was 52%, up 200 basis points year-over-year. We operate with a growth-focused approach in our investment decisions. With sales and marketing, we are constantly evaluating the effectiveness of our spend to optimize how we reach consumers and market our products to maximize the return on these investments for both the short term and long term in an increasingly competitive advertising environment. With R&D, we have focused our efforts on increasing the pace of new product launches while maintaining a robust evolving product pipeline for our customers. And we self-fund these investments through productivity gains and lower infrastructure costs, operating at 87% gross margin and with G&A less than 5% of revenue as we drive long-term sustainable growth. 
Q2 net income was $255 million, up 19% year-over-year. Diluted EPS was $0.43 for the quarter, also up 19% year-over-year and at the high end of our guidance range. We remain focused on EPS expansion and achieving our long-term EPS objective of $3 that we shared back in May this year. 
Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Q2 operating cash flow was $60 million, and free cash flow was $59 million, which included seasonal tax payments. Year-to-date operating cash flow was $318 million, in line with our net income improvement and growth. We ended Q2 with over $1.5 billion of total cash, which includes the cash proceeds from the July sale of our Mountain View [ Ellis ] building. We remain levered at approximately 2x net debt and maintain both a strong liquidity position and a healthy balance sheet. 
In Q2, we also returned approximately $73 million to shareholders in the form of our regular quarterly dividend of $0.125 per common share. For Q3, the Board of Directors has approved a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.125 per common share to be paid on December 15, 2021, for all shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 22, 2021, as described in the press release. And a reminder that while we still have approximately $1.8 billion remaining in the current share buyback program, we cannot deploy it in the short term due to the pending Avast transaction. 
Now turning to our Q3 and full year outlook. We expect Q3 non-GAAP revenue in the range of $695 million to $705 million, assuming stable currency rates quarter-over-quarter, which translates to 9% to 11% growth year-over-year. We expect Q3 non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.42 to $0.44 per share. For the full year, we expect non-GAAP revenue growth of 9% to 10% year-over-year in constant currency and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.70 to $1.75, narrowing the range to the high end on both revenue and EPS versus what we shared with you back in May at our Analyst Day. 
We look forward to building on our growth momentum and consistent profitability in the second half of this year, and we are well positioned to deliver on our objectives. Even with the macro impacts around inflation, foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the evolving pandemic conditions, we have successfully navigated through and continued to hit expectations. As we look forward, we will continue to challenge ourselves to anticipate, prioritize and meet customer needs in a growth-focused manner.

I'm going to focus on bookings in the response to your question. But I'm also not surprised at our Q2 results as it's in line with our models, our internal models. As you know, we don't guide bookings, but we did share that Q2 is historically a seasonally lighter quarter. We also recognized early on that even if you look at the external search traffic metrics, either on Google metrics, analytics, et cetera, and you hone in on our branded and nonbranded terms, we knew that search volume was lower than prior quarters than what we saw last year. And then we also saw very early on that the advertising spend being put into the market across our competitive landscape was up. 
The other thing I'd encourage you guys to look at is, as you know, with our recurring business model, and as you know, with customer acquisition, when they get to the first year retention and renewal, there's a healthy step-up in terms of the bookings amount that we get as those customers choose to renew with us. So you really have to date back to last year. In Q1, we added 379,000 net new customers. Again, factor in the seasonality component from Q1 to Q2, last year, at this time, we added about 117,000 net customers. When you factor into the model the step-up in the renewal bookings that we get from that renewable customer base, it would point you to a 7% result for us."

We've come a long way since we became a consumer-focused stand-alone company exactly 2 years ago today. As I reflect on NortonLifeLock transformation, I'm extremely proud of our team. We committed to operating within financial discipline and bringing meaningful and sustainable growth to this business, and we have delivered. We have relentlessly been building a strong track record and remain focused on meeting our long-term objectives. 
As you've heard me share before, we are focused on driving growth by improving customer experience, scaling our integrated cybersafety platform and accelerating the pace of our product innovation from core security to trust-based digital solutions. By putting our customers first and relentlessly executing to our plan, we believe our long-term goals are within reach.
Our strategy is working. And as we delivered another quarter of solid and consistent growth, Q2 revenue was up 11%, with high single-digit growth in bookings. We are delivering strong profitability and continued EPS expansion up almost 20% year-over-year. Our high single-digit bookings growth was in line to our long-term objectives and is reflective of our normal seasonality, with the first half of our fiscal year historically being seasonally lower.
The start of Q2 was impacted by expected weaker summer demand and COVID reopening as more people mobilized or prioritized to travel and other activities. As we balanced all of our operational metrics and investment, we finished the quarter with strong momentum, delivering our eighth straight quarter of net direct customer adds sequentially. Our direct customer count grew over 178,000 sequentially, and we added over 2.6 million customers year-over-year, bringing our total customer count to 23.3 million.
In Q2, our direct-to-consumer revenue, which represented the majority of our business, was up 9%, with ARPU growing slightly quarter-over-quarter and unit retention stable. We have continued to build a richer and more robust product portfolio, as we reach more consumers on a global basis while driving higher engagement with our existing customers. Our Net Promoter Score continues to improve from low 40s last year to 49 this quarter, reflecting our focus on customer experience and providing peace of mind to our customers, as they live their digital lives.
Our international expansion efforts continued in Q2 and grew double digits, similar to last quarter. We continue to invest in our freemium model, as it increases our consumer reach and awareness, and we are encouraged that our nascent expansion into identity internationally is now available in more than 20 countries across Europe and Asia. It is a critical component of our ability to provide more value to our customers outside of the U.S., replicating the success we have had with ID Advisor in Japan, where we combined Dark Web Monitoring with elements of restoration. 
Our partner business posted double-digit revenue growth for the quarter for the actually fourth straight quarter, up 25% in Q2. All channels contributed meaningfully to these results. Amongst those, the employee benefits channel delivered another very strong quarter. We've expanded beyond the United States, offering our employee benefit solutions to Canadian employers and unlocking a broader customer base. Our investment in this area are paying off, as we have strengthened our sales team and market coverage in the last few quarters. We intend to expand our overall partner business, and we will continue to invest in our multichannel approach evaluating all potential opportunities and markets globally.
Overall, we are on track to our plan and committed to investing in what we see as a long-term secular growth opportunity to develop the best cybersafety portfolio for consumers. As a result, we continued to accelerate the pace of our product innovation pipeline, as we work to bring cybersafety to every digital user and release products that help protect consumers' devices, privacy and identity.
We opened the quarter with the release of Norton Utilities Ultimate, a new performance maintenance offering that helps create a faster and smoother and more secure experience for consumers, whether they're gaming or browsing or streaming content or more on their Windows PC. We expanded Norton family with new features, including Favorite Locations, to help parents establish approved geographic locations and receive notifications when their child's device arrives or departs those set locations. We also introduced Alert Me, which helps parents stay informed about their children's location by setting specific dates and times to receive automatic check-in alerts from the location of their child's device. Both of these new features were quite timely as many kids headed back to school in person.
On the Identity front, we added PayDay Loan Lock to selected U.S. LifeLock plans to help block the opening of fraudulent payday loans and other short-term loans. And we've added new features like social media monitoring in more markets to provide consumers with broader protection, as their digital footprint expands.
As awareness grows globally for identity protection, we continue to evolve our road map to protect our customers and provide the most relevant products and features to new audiences. As we continue to strengthen our privacy pillar and help provide additional ways for consumers to control their online privacy, we released Norton AntiTrack in the U.S., a new app and browser extension that helps prevent websites from tracking and profiling users in ways normal private browsers or VPNs cannot do. That way, people can protect and control their digital footprints from companies and websites that track online activities and collect or sell their personal data. 
We've seen positive momentum from this new product release as consumers are seeing ways to protect their privacy. And I'm pleased to share that Norton AntiTrack has expanded now to APG and EMEA earlier this week. Privacy overall is 1 of the 3 pillars of our cybersafety portfolio, and we should continue to see investment in this area to help consumers manage their privacy and reputation online.
In Q2, we also released our first environmental, social and governance report. This report highlights NortonLifeLock's ongoing pledge to bring together our team, expertise and technology to help build a safe, inclusive and sustainable future. We are making good progress on this front, and I'm proud of all of our employees, the commitment we have made together to develop a responsible company. I encourage you to check all of our achievement in that area on our IR website.
Additionally, we were recognized by the Business Intelligence Group 2021 Sales and Marketing Technology Awards or what they call The Sammys, which ranked NortonLifeLock as one of the top medium-sized companies of 2021 for innovation in sales and marketing technology. We were recognized for our efforts upgrading customer service operations with the development of a new internal sales platform that was built by our own in-house engineers and launched in the spring of 2021.
This technology enable us to better deliver key customer services within a single easy-to-use interface. The platform also replaced a legacy vendor-supplied solution, driving cost efficiencies for the company. This is a great example of the team's living our value. They advocated for the customer. They were empowered to take initiative to identify the opportunity, and they delighted customers while improving our business operations. And more importantly, they delivered.
Before I turn the call over to Natalie to discuss the financial results, I would like to provide an update on our proposed merger with Avast. We have made great progress, and we continue to be enthusiastic about the combination of the 2 companies and the opportunity to accelerate innovation in cybersafety. We crossed an important milestone today with NortonLifeLock shareholders voting to overwhelmingly support our ongoing transformation through the proposed merger with Avast with the next key step being the Avast shareholder votes scheduled for November 18. 
We're also actively and collaboratively working through the antitrust and other regulatory processes in all relevant jurisdictions, and we believe we are on track to close mid of next calendar year 2022, as previously stated. Our strategy has been to protect and empower consumers as more and more of their lives move online, and this transaction will allow the combined companies to invest in and accelerate innovation for new cybersafety products.
And now let me turn the call over to Natalie for more details on the financials."
35000,1684978621,2426709,"NortonLifeLock Inc., Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Gen Digital Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Vincent, and hello, everyone.

To all our customers, shareholders and listeners around the world, who are celebrating Diwali today, may the festival of lights bring joy and happiness to you and your families. For today's discussion, I will focus on non-GAAP financials, starting with our Q2 results and then provide our outlook for Q3 and full year.
We delivered another solid quarter, rounding out a strong first half of our fiscal year. Our Q2 revenue was $695 million, up 11%. Our growth remains broad-based across geos and products. Bookings growth of 7% was supported by our renewal efforts, expanded product offerings and continued international expansion.
Our total direct customer count increased to 23.3 million, adding 2.6 million customers year-over-year and adding 178,000 net new customers quarter-over-quarter. This was our eighth consecutive quarter of sequential net direct customer adds. In a quarter where there is seasonally lower demand, our strong net adds in Q2 is evidence that there is growing demand for our products, and we feel proud to have added over 300,000 net new customers in the first half of our fiscal year.
Our operational metrics remain strong, with 85% unit retention and our monthly average revenue per user, or ARPU, increased on a sequential basis to $8.85. As a result, our direct business maintained consistent growth momentum, up 9% in revenue. We continue to drive higher engagement with our existing loyal customers through the accelerated pace of new product releases while scaling up our cross-sell efforts. We are also reaching more audiences with the expansion of our identity protection offerings into more international markets, providing broader cybersafety protection to newer cohorts of customers.
As Vincent mentioned earlier, our partner business again posted strong results in Q2, up 25% year-over-year with continued strength in employee benefits as well as growth from other distribution channels. Although it accounts for approximately 10% of our total, our partner business remains a key tenet of our long-term growth strategy and will continue to be an important investment area for us, and we are encouraged by the year-to-date growth unlocks thus far.
Turning to profitability. Q2 operating margin was 52%, up 200 basis points year-over-year. We operate with a growth-focused approach in our investment decisions. With sales and marketing, we are constantly evaluating the effectiveness of our spend to optimize how we reach consumers and market our products to maximize the return on these investments for both the short term and long term in an increasingly competitive advertising environment. 
With R&D, we have focused our efforts on increasing the pace of new product launches while maintaining a robust evolving product pipeline for our customers. And we self-fund these investments through productivity gains and lower infrastructure costs, operating at 87% gross margin and with G&A less than 5% of revenue, as we drive long-term sustainable growth. 
Q2 net income was $255 million, up 19% year-over-year. Diluted EPS was $0.43 for the quarter, also up 19% year-over-year and at the high end of our guidance range. We remain focused on EPS expansion and achieving our long-term EPS objective of $3 that we shared back in May this year. 
Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Q2 operating cash flow was $60 million, and free cash flow was $59 million, which included seasonal tax payments. Year-to-date operating cash flow was $318 million, in line with our net income improvement and growth. We ended Q2 with over $1.5 billion of total cash, which includes the cash proceeds from the July sale of our Mountain View Ellis buildings. We remain levered at approximately 2x net debt and maintain both a strong liquidity position and a healthy balance sheet.
In Q2, we also returned approximately $73 million to shareholders in the form of our regular quarterly dividend of $0.125 per common share. For Q3, the Board of Directors has approved a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.125 per common share to be paid on December 15, 2021, for all shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 22, 2021, as described in the press release. And a reminder that while we still have approximately $1.8 billion remaining in the current share buyback program, we cannot deploy it in the short term due to the pending Avast transaction.
Now turning to our Q3 and full-year outlook. We expect Q3 non-GAAP revenue in the range of $695 million to $705 million, assuming stable currency rates quarter-over-quarter, which translates to 9% to 11% growth year-over-year. We expect Q3 non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.42 to $0.44 per share. For the full-year, we expect non-GAAP revenue growth of 9% to 10% year-over-year in constant currency and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.70 to $1.75, narrowing the range to the high end on both revenue and EPS versus what we shared with you back in May at our Analyst Day.
We look forward to building on our growth momentum and consistent profitability in the second half of this year, and we are well positioned to deliver on our objectives. Even with the macro impacts around inflation, foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the evolving pandemic conditions, we have successfully navigated through and continued to hit expectations. As we look forward, we will continue to challenge ourselves to anticipate, prioritize and meet customer needs in a growth-focused manner.
Thank you for your time today, and I will now turn the call back to the operator to take your questions. Please do keep in mind we are not able to answer any questions related to any specific M&A at this time. Operator?"

I'm going to focus on bookings in the response to your question. But I'm also not surprised at our Q2 results, as it's in line with our models, our internal models. As you know, we don't guide bookings, but we did share that Q2 is historically a seasonally lighter quarter. We also recognized early on that even if you look at the external search traffic metrics, either on Google metrics, analytics, et cetera, and you hone in on our branded and nonbranded terms, we knew that search volume was lower than prior quarters than what we saw last year. And then we also saw very early on that the advertising spend being put into the market across our competitive landscape was up.
The other thing I'd encourage you guys to look at is, as you know, with our recurring business model, and as you know, with customer acquisition, when they get to the first year retention and renewal, there's a healthy step-up in terms of the bookings amount that we get as those customers choose to renew with us. So you really have to date back to last year. In Q1, we added 379,000 net new customers. Again, factor in the seasonality component from Q1 to Q2, last year, at this time, we added about 117,000 net customers. When you factor into the model the step-up in the renewal bookings that we get from that renewable customer base, it would point you to a 7% result for us."

We now start to build up the portfolio to move above and beyond that security, moving into protecting the digital lives, exploring element of restoration and so what I call solutions, which includes services. 
I think on a long-term perspective, outside of the U.S., we have a huge structural growth opportunities. Obviously, the proposed merger with Avast will boost all of that. It will be more balanced. When I look at different industry technology or even the demographic, as you know, we should be more 40 in the U.S., 60 international versus the reverse on a unit basis, and we're going to continue to expand."

When it comes to then our ongoing prices, obviously, pricing structure and how do you upsell and move to a premium model have different structure. First, your price, as you know, as a promotion to get in the first time you get in. And then you have the renewal price at the normal MSRP that we have set. And then we're tracking the dynamic of cost, inflation, competition in every country. It is a dynamic environment. It is a competitive environment. And so our pricing philosophy follows the value we provide to the members, as we continue to add new product and new value to that membership.
