I'd like to start our call today by expressing our sincerest gratitude to all of our associates for their hard work and dedication in 2020. Together, our organization has successfully accomplished many monumental tasks in the most uncertain environment we have ever faced as a company. 
I am so proud of the efforts of all of our global teams who have worked as 1 TJX to operate the business through this environment, while prioritizing the health and safety of our associates and of our customers. I want to give special recognition to our store, distribution center and fulfillment center associates. We are truly grateful for their commitment to our business and to our associate and customer safety protocols. 
In recognition of their efforts, including physically coming into work in the fourth quarter, we awarded a majority of them an appreciation bonus, which is the third appreciation bonus that we have paid during the pandemic. We will continue to look for opportunities, future opportunities to recognize associates for their important contributions to the business. As we continue to manage through the global pandemic, we are thinking of everyone who has been impacted by COVID. Including our associates and their families, our customers and our communities. Also, our hearts are with the people in Texas and other parts of the U.S. who have endured so much due to the severe weather this month. 
Looking ahead, as the power and water situation improves in Texas and other areas and the rollout of vaccines is more widespread in the coming months. We are hopeful and optimistic about the future. 
Turning to our business operations. During the fourth quarter, we were very pleased that our U.S. stores were generally able to stay open. However, at certain times during the quarter, we have to temporarily close all our stores in Europe in a majority of our Canadian stores. In total, Europe was closed for almost 2/3 of the quarter in Canada for about 1/3 of the quarter. As we reopen some of these European and Canadian stores over the past couple of weeks, we were encouraged by consumers' enthusiastic response, similar to what we saw last summer when we began our reopenings. 
We are following government mandates in our regions. And at this time, approximately 690 stores remain temporarily closed. Currently, the vast majority of these closures are still in Europe, where we expect shutdowns to remain in place for a significant portion of the first quarter. 
Okay. Moving to a recap of our fourth quarter results. First, I am very pleased that our overall open only comp store sales of down 3% exceeded our plans. During the fourth quarter, we saw a continuation of strong sales trends in our home and beauty departments as well as great customer response to our holiday gift assortments and values. 
I am particularly pleased with the terrific assortment of brands we offer shoppers across all categories, which we believe was an important driver of our above plan sales. These comp sales also exceeded our plans across each of our divisions, including at HomeGoods, which once again saw a double-digit increase. While overall sales were down significantly due to the temporary closing of our stores for approximately 13% of the quarter, I want to emphasize that we are very encouraged by our fourth quarter overall open only comp sales, which improved each month of the quarter and were positive in January. 
Despite operating during COVID surges, with the headwinds of uncertain consumer behavior, occupancy constraints and social distancing protocols, we only had a small decline in sales at our stores that were committed to be open. It was great to see many of our best customers enthusiastically return to our stores. We believe this speaks to the resilience of the business and enduring appeal of our value proposition across all of our retail banners regardless of the environment. 
All of this gives us great confidence in our business over the long term. We also believe our ongoing commitment to health and safety protocols help customers feel comfortable visiting our stores throughout the quarter. We continue to receive positive feedback from our shoppers on our safe shopping experience. 
We believe this will remain an important factor for consumers when deciding where to shop while COVID persists. 
Next, our merchandise margin was up. The buying environment remains excellent as we continue to see a terrific selection of inventory from both existing and new vendors. We are very pleased with the improved seasonality and mix of merchandise at our stores as our buying teams have done a great job aggressively sourcing branded product across good, better and best categories. We achieved fourth quarter earnings per share of $0.27 and maintained our strong balance sheet and liquidity position despite the overall sales decline. 
Further, we declared a quarterly dividend and refinance some of our outstanding debt to lower our borrowing costs over the long term. 
Scott will speak to all of these items in more detail in his financial update. As we enter 2021, significant uncertainty remains around COVID and its impact on consumer behavior. While many factors remain outside of our control, such as temporary store closings and customer shopping habits, we are very confident about the areas that we can control, including buying, merchandising and store operations. 
Despite the near term uncertainty, we have grown more optimistic about the medium and long-term with the news of multiple effective COVID vaccines. I'm convinced that our business will rebound and we'll capture market share once we are past this health crisis. 
Let me highlight some of the actions we took in 2020 that we believe set us up for success going forward. First, we have strengthened our relationships with many of our existing vendors. With all the uncertainty in the retail landscape, some vendors have looked to us to buy even more of their inventory. We have also had opportunities to buy goods across an even wider range of product categories. 
In 2020, our buyers open thousands of new vendors across good, better and best brands and sourced from a universe of approximately 21,000 vendors around the world. We believe all of this puts us in an excellent position to keep offering consumers an eclectic mix of branded merchandise at amazing values. 
Second, we're prepared to take advantage of the terrific real estate availability that we are seeing across each of our geographies and continue our global store growth. With the increase in-store closures by some other retailers, we are in an excellent position to open new stores in some of our target markets. Further, we see additional opportunities to relocate existing stores to more desirable locations and to seek out more favorable terms when leases expire. 
Next, upon initially reopening our stores last summer, we focused our marketing on addressing safety concerns to build the confidence of our shoppers while highlighting value and the hotter trending categories. In the fourth quarter, we also emphasized gifting. In 2021, we plan to launch bold new campaigns for each banner that reinforce our value leadership, while also highlighting the elements of discovery, variety and quality, which are all major strengths for us. 
Lastly, we prioritized investments in our associates, stores, supply chain and systems to strengthen our infrastructure and support our future growth plans. Scott will outline our 2021 capital plans shortly. 
Looking beyond the health crisis, we are confident that more consumers will be drawn to our stores once they are back to more normalized routines and shopping habits. I'd like to walk through the reasons why we believe we are strongly positioned to capture market share in the future. 
First, we are confident that our relentless focus on value and quality will be as important as ever for shoppers beyond the health crisis. Second, we are convinced that consumers will seek out our stores for our wide assortment of branded and fashionable merchandise. We see our excellent selection of brands in our global buying organization as key differentiators for our business. 
Further, we believe the brands we offer consumers will continue to be a major driver of incremental customer traffic and sales. We believe our flexible close-to-knee buying will continue to be a tremendous advantage. Eventually, consumers will be physically returning to work, socializing again and resuming travel. This is what we saw happen in Australia, where despite recent COVID shutdowns, life had largely returned to normal during the fourth quarter, and we saw strong sales trends return in our apparel business. 
Our buying organization is well positioned to shift our spending in our other geographies to meet shoppers' changing category needs once we move past this health crisis. Third, we are confident that the appeal of our treasure hunt shopping experience will resonate for people looking to be inspired and discover new products when they shop. We shipped to our stores several times a week with new and different merchandise, so there is always something exciting for shoppers to see. With our rapidly changing store assortment, shoppers learned to buy something when they see it, because it may not be there the next time they visit. We believe that the entertainment element of our shopping experience will continue to be important. 
Customers tell us that part of the reason they shop us is for some stress relief, particularly during these times and some ""meet time"" , which we expect to continue into the future. 
Next, we believe our convenient off-mall locations in urban, suburban and rural locations is an advantage as this allows us to reach a very wide customer demographic. In the U.S. roughly 80% of consumers are within 10 miles of one of our stores. This makes it very easy for shoppers to visit our stores. We expect to see incremental traffic once consumers return to their workplaces and go out more as they will be passing by our stores much more frequently. 
We also see a great opportunity to capture share from other retailers that have shut down completely or closed stores. We also believe this will lead to greater availability of inventory from both new and existing vendors. 
Lastly, we continue to aggressively pursue the significant opportunities we are seeing in the home category just as we have for decades. This includes increasing the HomeGoods division's long-term target to 1,500 stores and our plans to launch e-commerce on homegoods.com later this year. 
Further, we have been increasing the mix of all of our banners to capture some of the incremental demand. In 2020, home accounted for almost 40% of our overall sales, up from 33% in the prior year. Going forward, we are confident that the strength of our home buying teams and our global buying offices will allow us to keep bringing an eclectic mix of home merchandise at great value to our shoppers and capture additional market share. 
Before I close, I want to reiterate how great we feel about the long-term and our opportunity to drive sales post pandemic. At the same time, we are still facing several significant expense headwinds. Scott will discuss this in more detail. But the cost pressures that we have pre-COVID, including supply chain, wage and freight, continue to persist, and COVID has made each of them worse. Of course, we also continue to have significant COVID related costs. 
I want to emphasize that we are extremely focused on our top line opportunities that could help to ease some of these pressures. In closing, I am so proud of the resilience and dedication of our associates, who successfully navigated our company through an unprecedented environment in 2020.  I also want to add that as an organization and management team, this has been such an important year in terms of our global corporate responsibility efforts. 
As COVID has been evolving differently in different parts of the world, we have continued to prioritize the health, safety and well-being of our associates and customers, along with the financial stability of the business. 2020 was also a critical year for our inclusion and diversity work, which includes our commitment to standing up for racial justice and equity. 
We are committed to listening to and learning from our associates and taking actions to do better. I am confident as ever about the future of TJX. Longer term, we believe we have a tremendous opportunity to capture additional market share, even beyond the prospect of a resurgence in consumer spending and ""revenge shopping"" once vaccines are widely available, longer term, we are convinced that our flexible off-price model has structural advantages with our entertaining and engaging treasure hunt shopping experience, differentiated assortment of branded merchandise and our excellent values. 
Our teams are energized and laser-focused on capitalizing on the opportunities we see for our company, and I look forward to sharing our success going forward. Now I'll turn the call over to Scott for a financial update, and then we'll open it up for questions. Scott?"

I'd like to first echo Ernie's comments and thank all of our global associates for their hard work and commitment in 2020 and continued efforts in 2021. I'll start today with some additional details of our four",1483,"Thanks, Ernie, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to first echo Ernie's comments and thank all of our global associates for their hard work and commitment in 2020 and continued efforts in 2021. 
I'll start today with some additional details of our fourth quarter results. As Ernie mentioned, open only comp store sales were down just 3% despite the COVID related headwinds we faced. Average basket increased and was strong again, as customers responded favorably to our fresh seasonable mix and put more items in their carts. As to the cadence of comp sales, we saw improvement in each month of the quarter with our Marmaxx, HomeGoods and TJX Canada divisions all achieving positive open only comp sales in January. 
At Marmaxx, our largest division, customer traffic in the fourth quarter was better than the third quarter and also improved each month of the quarter. As to overall sales, the decline was primarily due to the temporary closures of some of our stores. These closures were primarily in Europe, which was closed for 63% of the quarter, including essentially all of January. And in Canada, which was closed for 32% of the quarter. Overall, stores were closed for approximately 13% of the fourth quarter. 
Fourth quarter merchandise margin was up versus the prior year. This was driven by strong mark on and a benefit from the timing of a shrink accrual. These benefits were partially offset by higher freight costs as well as higher markdowns as a result of the store closures in Europe and Canada. 
Moving to the bottom line. Fourth quarter earnings per share were $0.27, which included a debt extinguishment charge of $312 million or $0.18 per share. Earnings per share also included a negative impact of $0.05 from our tax rate, which was significantly higher than last year.  This was due to the company moving to a year-to-date net income position in the fourth quarter and the related impact of the jurisdictional mix of profits and losses. 
Further, as detailed in our press release this morning, we believe the temporary store closures in Europe and Canada during the fourth quarter negatively impacted sales by approximately $950 million to $1.05 billion, resulting in a significant loss of profit dollars and about $0.18 to $0.21 of earnings per share. 
I want to also remind you that our EPS reflects significant cost headwinds in the fourth quarter, which more than offset some of our temporary expense savings. Let me take a moment to go through a couple of the larger ones. First, our net costs related to COVID accounted for approximately $300 million of incremental expense. These costs include extra payroll to clean the store and monitor occupancy levels, payroll for some store associates that we kept active to support the business while stores were temporarily closed, the cost of PP&E and the fourth quarter appreciation bonus for certain associates. 
The increase in our costs versus the third quarter included extra payroll as our stores were open longer hours, partially offset by increased government relief due to the European and Canadian store closures. Second, we had increased supply chain costs. This was due to a lower average ticket and processing more units as our merchandise mix continued to shift to our non apparel categories. Expenses related to additional distribution capacity and wage increases at our distribution facilities. 
As for inventory, our teams are doing a great job procuring merchandise and adjusting logistics to get it to our distribution facilities and stores. As a result, our store inventory position is close to where we want it to be. To reiterate, availability of merchandise in the marketplace is excellent. 
Now I'd like to walk through our cash flow and liquidity. First, we generated $4.6 billion of operating cash flow in fiscal '21. As a result, we ended the fourth quarter in a very strong liquidity position with $10.5 billion in cash. 
Next, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.26 per share in the fourth quarter. In the first quarter of fiscal '22, we plan -- we're planning to declare a dividend at the same rate, subject to Board approval. 
Lastly, in the fourth quarter, we significantly lowered our borrowing costs by reducing our high interest rate, longer-dated bonds through a cash tender offer and issuing lower interest rate bonds. The net result of these actions will lower our interest expense by approximately $32 million per year. 
Now I'll spend a moment on fiscal 2022. As we said in our press release this morning, we are not providing a financial outlook for fiscal '22 because of the continued uncertainty of the environment due to COVID. As a point of reference, overall open only comps store sales trends for the first 3 weeks of the first quarter were better than in the fourth quarter despite the unfavorable weather in the United States. In the periods before and after the unfavorable weather, overall comp sales were positive. 
In terms of fiscal '22 profitability, we expect pretax margins to be higher than fiscal 2021, but to deleverage significantly versus our pre-COVID levels. This is due to a number of known headwinds that we've discussed many times before. As a reminder, these include the following: first, we continue to have the net costs related to COVID. In the first quarter, we are currently planning $225 million of net expense. At this time, we do not know or by how much these costs may moderate beyond the first quarter. As a reminder, most of these costs are in SG&A. 
Second, based on what we know today, we expect temporary store closures will negatively impact overall first quarter sales by approximately $750 million to $850 million, and will result in some level of margin deleverage. This includes our stores that are currently closed in Europe and the majority of our Canadian stores that are currently closed or have been closed during the first quarter. Based on what we know today, overall, we expect stores to be closed for approximately 11% of the first quarter, which includes Europe being closed for an estimated 67% of the quarter. These expectations could be negatively impacted further if current mandates are extended or new ones are put in place. 
Next, as Ernie mentioned, the headwinds of freight, wage and supply chain that existed pre pandemic have not gone away. In fact, each of them has gotten worse in the current environment. On freight specifically, we continue to see capacity constraints and driver shortages, which has led to higher rates. We're also experiencing incremental freight costs due to our lower average ticket and moving more units through our supply chain. All that said, we remain laser-focused on looking for expense savings throughout the business. 
We may also have an opportunity to offset some of these headwinds over the long-term if we successfully drive outside sales increases and market share gains or see demand improve for the higher ticket categories. Additionally, if the buying environment stays beneficial, we could capture additional merchandise margin. 
Moving on, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion in fiscal '22. This includes opening new stores, remodels and relocations and investments in our distribution network and infrastructure. For new stores, we plan to add 122 net new stores, which would bring our year-end total close to 4,700 stores. This would represent a store growth of about 3%. 
In the U.S., our plans call for us to add about 30 net stores at Marmaxx, 34 net stores at HomeGoods and 12 Sierra stores. In Canada, we plan to add about 22 net stores. And at TJX International, we plan to open up approximately 15 stores in Europe and 9 stores in Australia. 
As to our long-term store growth opportunity, we now see the potential to grow to [ 6,275 ] stores globally. In addition to the increasing home goods by 100 stores, we've also increased the store potential for Canada and Australia. 
In closing, to reiterate what Ernie said, we feel great about the strength of our business. In general, the stores are -- that are open are performing well despite the numerous COVID related headwinds. Additionally, we are in a very strong financial position, which allows us to continue investing in our business to support our growth plans. All of this gives us great confidence that we will continue to successfully navigate this environment and be a stronger company when we are past the pandemic. 
Now we're happy to take your questions. As we do every quarter, we're going to ask you to please limit your questions to 1 per person and 1 part to each question. We respectfully ask that everyone sticks with this request to keep the call on schedule so that we can answer questions from as many analysts as we can. Thanks, and now we will open it up for questions."

Certainly a question near and dear to my heart as we talk about how we buy the goods and how we stock the stores, as you said, in terms of the demands by category really, since the beginning when COVID, if you remember back, and I know we spoke back when COVID first hit, and we could see our home business and some of our other trending categories we're going to clearly trend differently than apparel, for example. So we were able to adjust, as you could hear what we said in the script, how big our home business has actually gotten to over the last 6 months, we were able to adjust the mix in our stores very appropriately to that because our model is very flexible, right? So we're able to -- and supply has been plentiful even though there were little snippets of time when it wasn't so easy to get exactly what we want. For the most part, we got the categories that we wanted. 
When you ask about apparel, I don't think -- we weren't trying to communicate that we weren't able to get it. So apparel is pretty plentiful in the market. It's just not the -- consumer demand isn't there, as great as it has been, I would say, would be the way to put it. Having said that, I mentioned Australia, where the environment is more normal and almost -- is the least COVID impacted market that we're in. Their apparel business has been very healthy. 
So we are predicting, and there won't be an availability issue that as we start to go through this year, we're feeling that apparel, specifically, second quarter into summer as the vaccine rollout becomes more widespread, and people start to circulate out there more I and the teams are anticipating a surge in apparel, certainly part not every department, but a pretty big search from where we've been hovering and probably gaining back a little bit more of the share within our store. No availability problem, though, on us sourcing across all the categories. And in fact, as I always say to all of you, we have to really control our merchants from buying too much. Specifically, I would say apparel has been where we've really had a slowdown of recent only because the trend isn't what it is in some of the other areas. Everything has been improving quarter-by-quarter. 
So if you look at Marmaxx, our business. And when you talk apparel, I think, domestically here, because, obviously, our Europe business was kind of shut in the fourth quarter. I can't give you as much detail there. But if you look at Marmaxx, we improved from a minus 10 in the third quarter to a minus 7 in the fourth quarter. And then each month got progressively better in the fourth quarter from Marmaxx. And barring the weather, we're starting the year off, improved from where we were in the preceding months in the fourth quarter. So hopefully, that helps you."

So on the -- what's been helping us with our comp improvement is a little what I was talking to Lorraine about. So our merchants have really done a great job in shifting their -- we shift -- first of all, we shifted buyers around, some merchants around in certain areas to go after the healthier in trending categories. What's interesting is at the beginning of the pandemic, when the market was an opeval, we took a very, I would call it, a very forthright approach with all of our vendor community, and they knew how important we were then. But I think what's happened, and I think this is where we're getting to the second part of your question on the expansion of the vendor relationships to help us, we talked about the 21,000 vendors that we're dealing with. We've been opening up a few thousand additional vendors, but there's always vendors falling off because we stopped buying certain categories or unfortunately into pandemic you've had some other vendors kind of falling off to the side, as you can imagine. 
But we are meaning more to, I would say, the more branded vendor community across the board. And so if you listen to the script, we made a conscious effort, I made a conscious effort to really highlight that one of the key differentiators of TJX, and I think this applies from us against other retailers, maybe against other off-price formats is our focus on brands is really second to none. So we -- and if you look back at my script, I mentioned across good, better and best. So we have had all of our teams on a mission to continue to open more brands, always continuing to do that because you get more newness that way and you get more excitement in the mix and then that, combined with the market share that's out there, you mentioned the $10 billion up for grabs. I think the way to do it as some of the other -- think of the retailers who have struggled during this, it's not your essential retailers, right? It's not the people you know customers really need to go to right now, a very task based missions that they have to go on. 
It's really the more impulse or more fashion driven. In our case, we're an impulse driven retailer. And you can't ask for a better situation for us to have more brands in the future because we mean more to those brands and the fact that when consumers start to get more comfortable, they want to shop our entertainment, it's a perfect storm. And I just think the expression I would like to use right now, what we're feeling is a tiger by the tail in the business here, meaning once things start to open up and the consumer goes back to normalcy, I just think we're really going to be in a strong position to continue to improve, which we -- as you can see from the sales we've been doing every quarter.

We -- at this point, we're not giving guidance in terms of -- a lot will depend on -- just as you can see, right, what we've had in the fourth quarter and the first quarter with this significant number of store closures, how much we're going to have for COVID costs. I think we need a little more time and earning probably will address this as we move forward in terms of how much of the mix switches back to apparel, which will then help us both on the average retail, freight, some of the other productivity measures. I think there's a lot of uncertainty, although we think we'll be getting -- it will have a first half, second half impact in terms of freight costs certainly spiked as we move from the third quarter to fourth quarter, will likely remain high at least on a both a [ TYLY ] basis as we move through the first half of the year, and we would hope due to things that we're going to be doing and market conditions be moderating, but we don't know where that's going to level off, and that does relate a little to the mix of the merchandise as well. 
We've been buying very good and other thing, Ernie, I think we'll touch on what level we'll be able to maintain and extend on that is to be determined. Also in certain things. We've had very good markdown performance, but as we've been chasing inventory at a very high level, particularly at HomeGoods. So again, I think the big cost pressures are going to be the ones that we've had in the past, where we've now had 2 years of deleverage on due to wages, supply chain costs, DC wages, opening up a bit -- we're opening a couple of facilities this year. But a lot will depend on when we get back to our sales because we still have to recapture a lot of the sales that we lost last year and get to the level and get back and hopefully surpass where we were going to be. So a lot of uncertainty of when we're going to get -- we know -- we feel comfortable we're going to get back to sales, but is it going to be in the back half of this year? Is it going to be over a little longer period of time. So putting all that, it's just too early to be giving a number. 
In terms of the fourth quarter, what we're seeing is that the shrink number was really just a time. Our shrink came in slightly lower than our last year number, but we had -- we thought early on with COVID with all the closing and opening of the stores, the movement of merchandise. That we had accrued for higher levels in the second and third quarter, and it came in better than what we thought, but that was offset by our freight. When you net-net look at all the ins and outs, we also had to accrue for additional markdowns this quarter due to the Europe and Canadian closures, that overall, our merchandise margin when you strip it all away, was still up in the, let's call it, in that 30 basis points range for the quarter after all of the ins and outs. And again, we -- that largely be determined on how we do on our mark on and markdowns for next year, whether we can continue that."

Kimberly, what I'll do is  let me just comment on the real estate quickly, and then I'm going to turn over some of the -- when you were asking about the rate on the leases. I'll turn it over to Scott. But when we look at for the opportunities in the business, we do want to get back to even things such as remodels because our -- one of the things we've seen over the years is our shopping experience is -- comprises many things. Certainly, the merchandise is #1. But our consumers have come to appreciate the environment they're in as well as the shopping centers. So when you ask about a relocation, sometimes, we aren't in the most happening shopping center. And many -- we have found that some of our best uses of capital have been relocations, so Scott will talk to all of that. At a high level, I would just say it keeps us healthy and keeps our existing stores proceeding and staying up to date. So for the long-term health of TJX, it's very important in every geography we're in to keep spending appropriate. Obviously, we had curtailed that at the beginning of COVID. 
But Scott will talk to why that's important. And by the way, why we're excited about opportunities. Inventory, where that falls across in the store. First of all, we don't -- I don't give out information as far as where we are versus where we'd want to be. But I would just say that at the high level, the reason we've been very happy with where our sales have been proceeding. And you can tell what we did give is our home area, our beauty area, which have grown in percentage, which is where, obviously, that's not a secret, those areas are healthy in the world around us. We have been getting plenty of availability and where we would run into pockets of categories within those worlds. Our buyers have done a great job of shifting around and we buy in different ways. So sometimes they're buying goods that are landing within a week or 2. And sometimes, they're buying some goods that are landing a couple of months out. 
But we have, overall, as you can see, we've been happier with our overall inventory level. Scott and I have talked about that recently in terms of where we are with each division and in total TJX. From where we were -- if you remember back in the third quarter, second quarter, the third quarter, we were in the major scramble mode, which probably somewhat impacted our sales then versus the healthier open only comps where we are now. We will run into some little pockets there, obviously, where we were probably missing some departments a little bit more. And we couldn't get -- by the way, some of that was really transportation of the goods. It wasn't necessarily availability. So right now, I would tell you, across the board, availability pretty much in any way we want it. There's more -- definitely more apparel out there than we would want to use across most every category. 
So hopefully, that gives you color in terms of where we're headed. We're just feeling really balanced on the way our inventory levels are right now heading into February and into March across every division. I mean the only place that we are not happy is in Europe where we're closed because, clearly, we have inventory there, and it's -- we can't do anything in terms of selling it. Scott, do you want to..."

Going to capital and some of the things that you talked about on the new stores, rents, et cetera. I think overall, the big picture is that we're starting to spend some of the, obviously, now that we're in a position of strength on both the cash and on our balance sheet. We're spending -- we're going to spend the $500 million to $700 million more in capital than we did last year and more than what we did even 2 years ago, I think we have an open to buy to spend more capital as we move through the year as we would see -- if we see opportunities for, and we see how our business recovers for either more real estate than the 122 I talked about and/or more remodels that Ernie talked about as something to be using our cash for and from a timing. We're going to be doing north of 350 remodels. I think last year, we did several hundred remodels less than what we had planned. So we would be viewing that over the next several years as we could be getting up even to 400 remodels a year or more to try to catch up and take advantage of that. 
Two, in terms of new stores, the we would see -- we're not giving out a number, but it's going to be -- it will be more than the 122, probably at 150-plus for the next several years. I think there's great opportunity with all the unfortunate disruption in retail. We are already starting to see in all of our geographies when we are signing leases in store closures that have already happened in the past year. And we would view it doesn't happen overnight, but we would see that as a big opportunity for calendar '22 and '23 to get sites. I think part of the bigger part of that is the quality of the sites without having to necessarily get them at rents that we would have paid just a year or 2 ago. So it's not that it's necessarily cheaper than our current cost base, but it will be cheaper than what we would have paid and probably locations that we otherwise would not been able to get. 
In Marmaxx division, particularly, but across all of our stores, the relocations is an opportunity as we have hundreds of leases coming to renewal. And so we see a great opportunity to open again to better real estate and potentially, I think, the #1 thing is to drive higher sales, but potentially even to keep our costs the same or lower. I think where we've seen a fantastic opportunity in Europe in terms of cost reductions, a lot of it is the environment there, as you can imagine, worse than it is here from a real estate with all the closures. And on a lot of our rent renewals, we are seeing increases -- decreases in terms of the overall cost that we have to pay north of 25% on a per-store basis. So that's a combination of either the capital that you're going to get when we want to move into a store or the benefit  we're going to get or just the actual reduction in the rent. So we're seeing significant decreases there. We were doing -- we were seeing decreases before, but not to the level that we're currently seeing. 
We're also seeing some phenomenal deals. So I'm not going to name the specific sites, but in the last couple of weeks, we've seen stores where we were paying $900,000 in rent go down to $600,000 or $500,000 to less than $200,000 just phenomenal decreases in renewals and also even landlords who want us giving us extended rent-free periods because we're an anchor tenant in a strip, and they very much want us to be there. So yes, I think that's a tremendous opportunity for us."

And by the way, I'll just throw these together, you asked about HomeSense. HomeSense similarly was heading to a good place. But obviously, when COVID is impacted us. Everything the tide rose overall with both these businesses. And we're just seeing, as the world changes in lifestyle and focus even when the vaccines all hit, you're still going to have a dynamic change around us all in terms of how many people are spending more time still in home environments and focused on that regardless of whether there's an X percent that goes back to work. Of course, there will be. There'll be a majority going back to offices. But all you need is a small percent going the other way and with a focus on the environment of home. 
So yes. We just feel like there's way more market opportunity as we move forward. If you look at the amount of home business being done online, and let's go back to the market share mission we're on. We feel, and of course, homegoods.com, which will be later in the year. We feel that's an opportunity to take online business, but we feel our HomeSense business specifically, really pulls from categories that are significantly done online. We feel HomeSense can really eat into that online business. And recently, anecdotally, I've had friends that have bought goods at a HomeSense, and they've used our delivery service, which, again, in many cases, is a third party, but you are trying the for example, the sofa or the chair, you're trying that actual sofa or chair there. And that is what shows up at your house within the next day or 2, again, we have same-day delivery at many of those sites. 
And I think that is an interesting dynamic, which, obviously, the business is extremely healthy right now, but we feel like there's just so much more upside. And as you could tell by the number we gave you as the percent of TJX that home has been most recently, the momentum is so strong to think otherwise, that we wouldn't continue to just grab our market share.

If we had guided to approximately [ 10.2 to 10.3 ] last year on a 3% comp, if you would had the similar level -- the headwinds of of supply chain wage, et cetera, you would have gone down 30 to 40 basis points for another year. So as we said, nothing's really changed in terms of store wage in terms of that, the DC -- the 2 components that are a bit larger right now are the DC supply chain and the DC wage as we've had both in our HomeGoods and Marmaxx DCs, wage increases this year, which are going to be annualizing for most of this year, those impacts and significant freight costs, what would have been over fiscal '20 last results. 
So those will largely depend on what level of sales because you have a natural delever on the sales until you get back and recapture those sales. So if the delever was 30 to 40, it's clearly going to -- it would clearly be significantly higher than that without the COVID costs. And then those we would expect to start recapturing some of that as we get our sales levels up. So it's -- but that [ 10.6 ] would have been going down. And then on top of that is the deleverage of the sales and the higher freight and other supply chain costs."

And it's one thing I thought I didn't get to mention on one of the earlier questions. We are buying significantly more from our satellite buying offices this year, which actually speaks to a little about what you just asked. Because -- probably because of availability, it's not always with the same vendors and maybe what's going on with Europe. So we have satellite offices, we have offices in Italy and in Europe and in the Far East and California. And so we've had a disproportionate growth in purchases from those offices recently relative to our total during COVID. 
And then -- I mean, the good news in the vendor, this is not unusual. When we -- specifically in the home business, Adrienne, the -- if you have a go-to wire store 1 week and you go the next week, for example, and some of our categories where there's a lot of newness. So if you look at our food business, and you'll see lots of new brands that will go in there, and they maybe weren't there a few months ago, and you don't tend to think of that area, but there's a lot of special labels in there that really become hot and lend quality and country of origin from Italy to domestic brands. And that happens throughout the store, but there are definitely more areas where I think brands have become -- it's really going to be a big differentiator of us from, I think, everybody else because so many of the retailers around us in apparel, by the way, the apparel world is going very specialty private label driven. And what will be neat about our business is the customer, she or he can walk in and see an assortment of different brands that, yes, you'd find them in-depth in other stores, but they're all going to be under 1 roof, in the treasury hunch format.  If that makes sense."

In terms of the big picture on freight, it's very difficult to start, and you'll see that when we're going to be starting to compare against our numbers in the first and second quarter because we weren't open for business for such large chunks of the business of the time. But if you're going to compare fiscal '20 -- fiscal '22 to fiscal '20, it's a -- you're 50 to -- north of 60 basis points over a 2-year impact of incremental basis points on freight. But it's really going to be a tale of 2 stories. It's going to be significantly weighted toward the first half of the year versus the second half of the year because most of -- we had the big spike ups. A lot of for us is we'll be renegotiating domestically our rail, our truck and our ocean in the middle of the second quarter. So we would hope to contract more capacity because a lot of what impacted us and others is having to go to more spot rates and just pay through the nose. That happened in the fourth quarter and a little of what will be happening still. And also the mix of the goods was not ideal because the #1 priority, I think, Ernie, would agree, was to make sure we were getting the goods and our teams did a great job. We get the goods, but we were paying -- we had to pay a premium in many cases. But we're working on a lot of issues in our logistics area to reduce costs, and we think there will be opportunities we'll be able to take advantage of as we move forward through the next year and beyond."

I'd like to start our call today by expressing our sincerest gratitude to all of our associates for their hard work and dedication in 2020. Together, our organization has successfully accomplished many monumental tasks in the most uncertain environment we have ever faced as a company.  
I am so proud of the efforts of all of our global teams who have worked as 1 TJX to operate the business through this environment, while prioritizing the health and safety of our associates and of our customers. I want to give special recognition to our store, distribution center and fulfillment center associates. We are truly grateful for their commitment to our business and to our associate and customer safety protocols.  
In recognition of their efforts, including physically coming into work in the fourth quarter, we awarded a majority of them an appreciation bonus, which is the third appreciation bonus that we have paid during the pandemic. We will continue to look for opportunities -- future opportunities to recognize associates for their important contributions to the business. 
As we continue to manage through the global pandemic, we are thinking of everyone who has been impacted by COVID. Including our associates and their families, our customers and our communities. Also, our hearts are with the people in Texas and other parts of the U.S. who have endured so much due to the severe weather this month.  
Looking ahead, as the power and water situation improves in Texas and other areas and the rollout of vaccines is more widespread in the coming months. We are hopeful and optimistic about the future.  
Turning to our business operations. During the fourth quarter, we were very pleased that our U.S. stores were generally able to stay open. However, at certain times during the quarter, we had to temporarily close all our stores in Europe in a majority of our Canadian stores. In total, Europe was closed for almost 2/3 of the quarter and Canada for about 1/3 of the quarter. As we reopen some of these European and Canadian stores over the past couple of weeks, we were encouraged by consumers' enthusiastic response, similar to what we saw last summer when we began our reopenings.
We are following government mandates in our regions. And at this time, approximately 690 stores remain temporarily closed. Currently, the vast majority of these closures are still in Europe, where we expect shutdowns to remain in place for a significant portion of the first quarter.
Okay. Moving to a recap of our fourth quarter results. First, I am very pleased that our overall open-only comp store sales of down 3% exceeded our plans. During the fourth quarter, we saw a continuation of strong sales trends in our home and beauty departments as well as great customer response to our holiday gift assortments and values. I am particularly pleased with the terrific assortment of brands we offered shoppers across all categories which we believe was an important driver of our above planned sales. These comp sales also exceeded our plans across each of our divisions, including at HomeGoods, which once again saw a double-digit increase. While overall sales were down significantly due to the temporary closing of our stores for approximately 13% of the quarter, I want to emphasize that we are very encouraged by our fourth quarter overall open-only comp sales, which improved each month of the quarter and were positive in January.  
Despite operating during COVID surges, with the headwinds of uncertain consumer behavior, occupancy constraints and social distancing protocols, we only had a small decline in sales at our stores that were committed to be open. It was great to see many of our best customers enthusiastically return to our stores. We believe this speaks to the resilience of the business and enduring appeal of our value proposition across all of our retail banners regardless of the environment.  All of this gives us great confidence in our business over the long term. 
We also believe our ongoing commitment to health and safety protocols help customers feel comfortable visiting our stores throughout the quarter. We continue to receive positive feedback from our shoppers on our safe shopping experience.  We believe this will remain an important factor for consumers when deciding where to shop while COVID persists. 
Next, our merchandise margin was up. The buying environment remains excellent as we continue to see a terrific selection of inventory from both existing and new vendors. We are very pleased with the improved seasonality and mix of merchandise at our stores as our buying teams have done a great job aggressively sourcing branded product across good, better and best categories. 
We achieved fourth quarter earnings per share of $0.27 and maintained our strong balance sheet and liquidity position despite the overall sales decline.  Further, we declared a quarterly dividend and refinance some of our outstanding debt to lower our borrowing costs over the long term.  Scott will speak to all of these items in more detail in his financial update. 
As we enter 2021, significant uncertainty remains around COVID and its impact on consumer behavior. While many factors remain outside of our control, such as temporary store closings and customer shopping habits, we are very confident about the areas that we can control, including buying, merchandising and store operations.  Despite the near term uncertainty, we have grown more optimistic about the medium and long-term with the news of multiple effective COVID vaccines. I'm convinced that our business will rebound and will capture market share once we are past this health crisis. 
Let me highlight some of the actions we took in 2020 that we believe set us up for success going forward. First, we have strengthened our relationships with many of our existing vendors. With all the uncertainty in the retail landscape, some vendors have looked to us to buy even more of their inventory. We have also had opportunities to buy goods across an even wider range of product categories.  
In 2020, our buyers open thousands of new vendors across good, better and best brands and sourced from a universe of approximately 21,000 vendors around the world. We believe all of this puts us in an excellent position to keep offering consumers an eclectic mix of branded merchandise at amazing values.  
Second, we're prepared to take advantage of the terrific real estate availability that we are seeing across each of our geographies and continue our global store growth. With the increase in-store closures by some other retailers, we are in an excellent position to open new stores in some of our target markets. Further, we see additional opportunities to relocate existing stores to more desirable locations and to seek out more favorable terms when leases expire.  
Next, upon initially reopening our stores last summer, we focused our marketing on addressing safety concerns to build the confidence of our shoppers while highlighting value and the hotter trending categories. In the fourth quarter, we also emphasized gifting. In 2021, we plan to launch bold new campaigns for each banner that reinforce our value leadership, while also highlighting the elements of discovery variety and quality, which are all major strengths for us.  
Lastly, we prioritized investments in our associates, stores, supply chain and systems to strengthen our infrastructure and support our future growth plans. Scott will outline our 2021 capital plans shortly.  
Looking beyond the health crisis, we are confident that more consumers will be drawn to our stores once they are back to more normalized routines and shopping habits. I'd like to walk through the reasons why we believe we are strongly positioned to capture market share in the future.  
First, we are confident that our relentless focus on value and quality will be as important as ever for shoppers beyond the health crisis. Second, we are convinced that consumers will seek out to our stores for our wide assortment of branded and fashionable merchandise. We see our excellent selection of brands in our global buying organization as key differentiators for our business.  
Further, we believe the brands we offer consumers will continue to be a major driver of incremental customer traffic and sales. 
We believe our flexible close-to-knee buying will continue to be a tremendous advantage. Eventually, consumers will be physically returning to work, socializing again and resuming travel. This is what we saw happen in Australia, where despite recent COVID shutdowns, life had largely returned to normal during the fourth quarter, and we saw strong sales trends return in our apparel business.  Our buying organization is well positioned to shift our spending in our other geographies to meet shoppers' changing category needs once we move past this health crisis. 
Third, we are confident that the appeal of our treasure hunt shopping experience will resonate for people looking to be inspired and discover new products when they shop. We ship to our stores several times a week with new and different merchandise, so there is always something exciting for shoppers to see. With our rapidly changing store assortment, shoppers learned to buy something when they see it, because it may not be there the next time they visit. We believe that the entertainment element of our shopping experience will continue to be important.  Customers tell us that part of the reason they shop us is for some stress relief, particularly during these times and some ""met time"" , which we expect to continue into the future.  
Next, we believe our convenient off-mall locations in urban, suburban and rural locations is an advantage as this allows us to reach a very wide customer demographic. In the U.S. roughly 80% of consumers are within 10 miles of one of our stores. This makes it very easy for shoppers to visit our stores. We expect to see incremental traffic once consumers return to their workplaces and go out more as they will be passing by our stores much more frequently.  
We also see a great opportunity to capture share from other retailers that have shut down completely or closed stores. We also believe this will lead to greater availability of inventory from both new and existing vendors.  
Lastly, we continue to aggressively pursue the significant opportunities we are seeing in the home category, just as we have for decades. This includes increasing the HomeGoods division's long-term target to 1,500 stores and our plans to launch e-commerce on homegoods.com later this year.  
Further, we have been increasing the mix of all of our banners to capture some of the incremental demand. In 2020, home accounted for almost 40% of our overall sales, up from 33% in the prior year. Going forward, we are confident that the strength of our home buying teams and our global buying offices will allow us to keep bringing an eclectic mix of home merchandise at great value to our shoppers and capture additional market share.  
Before I close, I want to reiterate how great we feel about the long-term and our opportunity to drive sales post pandemic. At the same time, we are still facing several significant expense headwinds. Scott will discuss this in more detail. But the cost pressures that we had pre-COVID, including supply chain, wage and freight, continue to persist, and COVID has made each of them worse. Of course, we also continue to have significant COVID-related costs.  I want to emphasize that we are extremely focused on our top line opportunities that could help to ease some of these pressures. 
In closing, I am so proud of the resilience and dedication of our associates who successfully navigated our company through an unprecedented environment in 2020.  I also want to add that as an organization and management team, this has been such an important year in terms of our global corporate responsibility efforts.  
As COVID has been evolving differently in different parts of the world, we have continued to prioritize the health, safety and well-being of our associates and customers, along with the financial stability of the business. 2020 was also a critical year for our inclusion and diversity work, which includes our commitment to standing up for racial justice and equity.  We are committed to listening to and learning from our associates and taking actions to do better. I am confident as ever about the future of TJX. Longer term, we believe we have a tremendous opportunity to capture additional market share. Even beyond the prospect of a resurgence in consumer spending and ""revenge shopping "" once vaccines are widely available, longer term, we are convinced that our flexible off-price model has structural advantages with our entertaining and engaging treasure hunt shopping experience, differentiated assortment of branded merchandise and our excellent values.  Our teams are energized and laser-focused on capitalizing on the opportunities we see for our company, and I look forward to sharing our success going forward. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Scott for a financial update, and then we'll open it up for questions. Scott?"

I'd like to first echo Ernie's comments and thank all of our global associates for their hard work and commitment in 2020 and continued efforts in 2021.  
I'll start today with some additional details of our fourth quarter results. As Ernie mentioned, open-only comp store sales were down just 3% despite the COVID-related headwinds we faced. Average basket increased and was strong again, as customers responded favorably to our fresh seasonable mix and put more items in their carts. As to the cadence of comp sales, we saw improvement in each month of the quarter with our Marmaxx, HomeGoods and TJX Canada divisions all achieving positive open-only comp sales in January.  At Marmaxx, our largest division, customer traffic in the fourth quarter was better than the third quarter and also improved each month of the quarter. As to overall sales, the decline was primarily due to the temporary closures of some of our stores. These closures were primarily in Europe, which was closed for 63% of the quarter, including essentially all of January; and in Canada, which was closed for 32% of the quarter. Overall, stores were closed for approximately 13% of the fourth quarter.  
Fourth quarter merchandise margin was up versus the prior year. This was driven by strong mark on and a benefit from the timing of a shrink accrual. These benefits were partially offset by higher freight costs as well as higher markdowns as a result of the store closures in Europe and Canada.  
Moving to the bottom line. Fourth quarter earnings per share were $0.27, which included a debt extinguishment charge of $312 million or $0.18 per share. Earnings per share also included a negative impact of $0.05 from our tax rate, which was significantly higher than last year.  This was due to the company moving to a year-to-date net income position in the fourth quarter and the related impact of the jurisdictional mix of profits and losses.  
Further, as detailed in our press release this morning, we believe the temporary store closures in Europe and Canada during the fourth quarter negatively impacted sales by approximately $950 million to $1.05 billion, resulting in a significant loss of profit dollars and about $0.18 to $0.21 of earnings per share.  I want to also remind you that our EPS reflects significant cost headwinds in the fourth quarter, which more than offset some of our temporary expense savings. Let me take a moment to go through a couple of the larger ones. 
First, our net costs related to COVID accounted for approximately $300 million of incremental expense. These costs include extra payroll to clean the store and monitor occupancy levels, payroll for some store associates that we kept active to support the business while stores were temporarily closed, the cost of PPE and the fourth quarter appreciation bonus for certain associates.  The increase in our costs versus the third quarter included extra payroll as our stores were open longer hours, partially offset by increased government relief due to the European and Canadian store closures. 
Second, we had increased supply chain costs. This was due to a lower average ticket and processing more units as our merchandise mix continued to shift to our non-apparel categories. Expenses related to additional distribution capacity and wage increases at our distribution facilities.  As for inventory, our teams are doing a great job procuring merchandise and adjusting logistics to get it to our distribution facilities and stores. As a result, our store inventory position is close to where we want it to be. To reiterate, availability of merchandise in the marketplace is excellent.  
Now I'd like to walk through our cash flow and liquidity. First, we generated $4.6 billion of operating cash flow in fiscal '21. As a result, we ended the fourth quarter in a very strong liquidity position with $10.5 billion in cash.  Next, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.26 per share in the fourth quarter. In the first quarter of fiscal '22, we plan -- we're planning to declare a dividend at the same rate, subject to Board approval.  
Lastly, in the fourth quarter, we significantly lowered our borrowing costs by reducing our high interest rate, longer-dated bonds through a cash tender offer and issuing lower interest rate bonds. The net result of these actions will lower our interest expense by approximately $32 million per year.  
Now I'll spend a moment on fiscal 2022. As we said in our press release this morning, we are not providing a financial outlook for fiscal '22 because of the continued uncertainty of the environment due to COVID. As a point of reference, overall open-only comps store sales trends for the first 3 weeks of the first quarter were better than in the fourth quarter despite the unfavorable weather in the United States. In the periods before and after the unfavorable weather, overall comp sales were positive.  
In terms of fiscal '22 profitability, we expect pretax margins to be higher than fiscal 2021, but to deleverage significantly versus our pre-COVID levels. This is due to a number of known headwinds that we've discussed many times before. As a reminder, these include the following: 
First, we continue to have the net costs related to COVID. In the first quarter, we are currently planning $225 million of net expense. At this time, we do not know -- or by how much these costs may moderate beyond the first quarter. As a reminder, most of these costs are in SG&A.  
Second, based on what we know today, we expect temporary store closures will negatively impact overall first quarter sales by approximately $750 million to $850 million, and will result in some level of margin deleverage. This includes our stores that are currently closed in Europe and the majority of our Canadian stores that are currently closed or have been closed during the first quarter. Based on what we know today, overall, we expect stores to be closed for approximately 11% of the first quarter, which includes Europe being closed for an estimated 67% of the quarter. These expectations could be negatively impacted further if current mandates are extended or new ones are put in place.  
Next, as Ernie mentioned, the headwinds of freight, wage and supply chain that existed pre-pandemic have not gone away. In fact, each of them has gotten worse in the current environment. On freight specifically, we continue to see capacity constraints and driver shortages, which has led to higher rates. We're also experiencing incremental freight costs due to our lower average ticket and moving more units through our supply chain. All that said, we remain laser-focused on looking for expense savings throughout the business.  
We may also have an opportunity to offset some of these headwinds over the long-term if we successfully drive outside sales increases and market share gains or see demand improve for the higher-ticket categories. Additionally, if buying environment stays beneficial, we could capture additional merchandise margin.  
Moving on, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $1.2 to $1.4 billion in fiscal '22. This includes opening new stores, remodels and relocations and investments in our distribution network and infrastructure. For new stores, we plan to add 122 net new stores, which would bring our year-end total close to 4,700 stores. This would represent a store growth of about 3%.  In the U.S., our plans call for us to add about 30 net stores at Marmaxx, 34 net stores at HomeGoods and 12 Sierra stores. In Canada, we plan to add about 22 net stores. And at TJX International, we plan to open up approximately 15 stores in Europe and 9 stores in Australia.  
As to our long-term store growth opportunity, we now see the potential to grow to 60 to 75 stores globally. In addition to the increasing HomeGoods by 100 stores, we've also increased the store potential for Canada and Australia.  
In closing, to reiterate what Ernie said, we feel great about the strength of our business. In general, the stores are that are open are performing well despite the numerous COVID related headwinds. Additionally, we are in a very strong financial position, which allows us to continue investing in our business to support our growth plans. All of this gives us great confidence that we will continue to successfully navigate this environment and be a stronger company when we are past the pandemic.  
Now we're happy to take your questions. As we do every quarter, we're going to ask you to please limit your questions to 1 per person and 1 part to each question.

Certainly a question near and dear to my heart as we talk about how we buy the goods and how we stock the stores, as you said, in terms of the demands by category really. Since the beginning when COVID, if you remember back, and I know we spoke back when COVID first hit, and we could see our home business and some of our other trending categories were going to clearly trend differently than apparel, for example. So we were able to adjust, as you could hear what we said in the script, how big our home business has actually gotten to over the last 6 months, we were able to adjust the mix in our stores very appropriately to that because our model is very flexible, right? So we're able to -- and supply has been plentiful even though there were little snippets of time when it wasn't so easy to get exactly what we want. For the most part, we got the categories that we wanted. 
When you ask about apparel, I don't think -- we weren't trying to communicate that we weren't able to get it. So apparel is pretty plentiful in the market. It's just not the -- consumer demand isn't there, as great as it has been, I would say, would be the way to put it. Having said that, I mentioned Australia, where the environment is more normal and almost -- is the least COVID impacted market that we're in. Their apparel business has been very healthy. 
So we are predicting, and there won't be an availability issue, that as we start to go through this year, we're feeling that apparel, specifically, second quarter into summer, as the vaccine rollout becomes more widespread and people start to circulate out there more, I and the teams are anticipating a surge in apparel. Certainly part -- not every department, but a pretty big search from where we've been hovering and probably gaining back a little bit more of the share within our store. No availability problem, though, on us sourcing across all the categories. And in fact, as I always say to all of you, we have to really control our merchants from buying too much. Specifically, I would say apparel has been where we've really had a slowdown of recent only because the trend isn't what it is in some of the other areas. Everything has been improving quarter-by-quarter. 
So if you look at Marmaxx, our business. And when you talk apparel, I think, domestically here, because, obviously, our Europe business was kind of shut in the fourth quarter. I can't give you as much detail there. But if you look at Marmaxx, we improved from a minus 10 in the third quarter to a minus 7 in the fourth quarter. And then each month got progressively better in the fourth quarter from Marmaxx. And barring the weather, we're starting the year off improved from where we were in the preceding months in the fourth quarter. So hopefully, that helps you."

So on the -- what's been helping us with our comp improvement is a little what I was talking to Lorraine about. So our merchants have really done a great job in shifting their -- we shift -- first of all, we shifted buyers around, some merchants around in certain areas to go after the healthier and trending categories. What's interesting is at the beginning of the pandemic, when the market was an upheaval, we took a very, I would call it, a very forthright approach with all of our vendor community, and they knew how important we were then. But I think what's happened, and I think this is where we're getting to the second part of your question, on the expansion of the vendor relationships to help us -- we talked about the 21,000 vendors that we're dealing with. We've been opening up a few thousand additional vendors, but there's always vendors falling off because we stopped buying certain categories, or unfortunately in the pandemic, you've had some other vendors kind of falling off to the side, as you can imagine.  But we are meaning more to, I would say, the more branded vendor community across the board. 
And so if you listen to the script, we made a conscious effort, I made a conscious effort, to really highlight that one of the key differentiators of TJX, and I think this applies from us against other retailers, maybe against other off-price formats, is our focus on brands is really second to none. So we -- and if you look back at my script, I mentioned across good, better and best. So we have had all of our teams on a mission to continue to open more brands, always continuing to do that because you get more newness that way and you get more excitement in the mix. And then that, combined with the market share that's out there, you mentioned the $10 billion up for grabs. I think the way to do it as some of the other -- think of the retailers who have struggled during this. It's not your essential retailers, right? It's not the people you know customers really need to go to right now, very task-based missions that they have to go on.  It's really the more impulse or more fashion-driven. 
In our case, we're an impulse driven retailer. And you can't ask for a better situation for us to have more brands in the future because we mean more to those brands, and the fact that when consumers start to get more comfortable, they want to shop our entertainment. It's a perfect storm. And I just think -- the expression I would like to use right now, what we're feeling, is a tiger by the tail in the business here. Meaning once things start to open up and the consumer goes back to normalcy, I just think we're really going to be in a strong position to continue to improve, which we -- as you can see from the sales we've been doing every quarter. 
So great question. It's really at a high level, one of the most important aspects of our store strategy, medium-term and long term."

We -- at this point, we're not giving guidance in terms of -- a lot will depend on -- just as you can see, right, what we've had in the fourth quarter and the first quarter with this significant number of store closures, how much we're going to have for COVID costs. I think we need a little more time, and Ernie probably will address this as we move forward, in terms of how much of the mix switches back to apparel, which will then help us both, on the average, retail, freight, some of the other productivity measures. 
I think there's a lot of uncertainty, although we think we'll be getting -- will have a first half, second half impact in terms of freight costs, certainly spiked as we move from the third quarter to fourth quarter, will likely remain high at least on a both a TYLY basis as we move through the first half of the year. And we would hope due to things that we're going to be doing and market conditions be moderating, but we don't know where that's going to level off. And that does relate a little to the mix of the merchandise as well. 
We've been buying very good. Another thing, Ernie, I think will touch on, what level we'll be able to maintain and extend on that is to be determined. Also in certain things, we've had very good markdown performance, but as we've been chasing inventory at a very high level, particularly at HomeGoods. So again, I think the big cost pressures are going to be the ones that we've had in the past, where we've now had 2 years of deleverage on due to wages, supply chain costs, DC wages, opening up a bit -- we're opening a couple of facilities this year. But a lot will depend on when we get back to our sales because we still have to recapture a lot of the sales that we lost last year and get to the level and get back and hopefully surpass where we were going to be. So a lot of uncertainty of when we're going to get -- we know -- we feel comfortable we're going to get back to sales, but is it going to be in the back half of this year? Is it going to be over a little longer period of time. So putting all that, it's just too early to be giving a number. 
In terms of the fourth quarter, what we're seeing is that the shrink number was really just a time. Our shrink came in slightly lower than our last year number, but we had -- we thought early on with COVID with all the closing and opening of the stores, the movement of merchandise. That we had accrued for higher levels in the second and third quarter, and it came in better than what we thought, but it was offset by our freight. When you net-net look at all the ins and outs, we also had to accrue for additional markdowns this quarter due to the Europe and Canadian closures. That overall, our merchandise margin when you strip it all away, was still up in the, let's call it in that 30-basis-points range for the quarter after all of the ins and outs. And again, we -- that largely will be determined on how we do on our mark on and markdowns for next year, whether we can continue that."

Kimberly, what I'll do is -- let me just comment on the real estate quickly, and then I'm going to turn over some of the -- when you were asking about the rate on the leases, I'll turn it over to Scott. 
But when we look at for the opportunities in the business, we do want to get back to even things such as remodels because our -- one of the things we've seen over the years is our shopping experience is -- comprises many things. Certainly, the merchandise is #1. But our consumers have come to appreciate the environment they're in as well as the shopping centers. So when you ask about a relocation, sometimes, we aren't in the most happening shopping center. And many -- we have found that some of our best uses of capital have been relocations. So Scott will talk to all of that. 
At a high level, I would just say it keeps us healthy and keeps our existing stores proceeding and staying up to date. So for the long-term health of TJX, it's very important in every geography we're in to keep spending appropriate. Obviously, we had curtailed that at the beginning of COVID.  But Scott will talk to why that's important, and by the way, why we're excited about opportunities. 
Inventory, where that falls across in the store, first of all, we don't -- I don't give out information as far as where we are versus where we'd want to be. But I would just say that at the high level, the reason we've been very happy with where our sales have been proceeding. And you can tell what we did give is our home area, our beauty area, which have grown in percentage, which is where, obviously, that's not a secret, those areas are healthy in the world around us. We have been getting plenty of availability. And where we would run into pockets of categories within those worlds, our buyers have done a great job of shifting around. And we buy in different ways. So sometimes, they're buying goods that are landing within 1 week or 2. And sometimes, they're buying some goods that are landing a couple of months out.  But we have, overall, as you can see, we've been happier with our overall inventory level. Scott and I have talked about that recently in terms of where we are with each division and in total TJX. 
From where we were -- if you remember back in the third quarter, second quarter, the third quarter, we were in the major scramble mode, which probably somewhat impacted our sales then versus the healthier open-only comps where we are now. We will run into some little pockets there, obviously, where we were probably missing some departments a little bit more. And we couldn't get -- by the way, some of that was really transportation of the goods. It wasn't necessarily availability. So right now, I would tell you, across the board, availability pretty much in any way we want it. There's more -- definitely more apparel out there than we would want to use across most every category. 
So hopefully, that gives you color in terms of where we're headed. We're just feeling really balanced on the way our inventory levels are right now heading into February and into March across every division. I mean, the only place that we are not happy is in Europe where we're closed because, clearly, we have inventory there, and it's -- we can't do anything in terms of selling it. Scott, do you want to..."

Going to capital and some of the things that you talked about on the new stores, rents, et cetera. I think overall, the big picture is that we're starting to spend some of the, obviously, now that we're in a position of strength on both the cash and on our balance sheet. We're spending -- we're going to spend the $500 million to $700 million more in capital than we did last year and more than what we did even 2 years ago, I think we have an open to buy to spend more capital as we move through the year as we would see -- if we see opportunities for, and we see how our business recovers for either new more real estate than the 122 I talked about and/or more remodels that Ernie talked about as something to be using our cash for and from a timing. 
We're going to be doing north of 350 remodels. I think last year, we did several hundred remodels, less than what we had planned. So we would be viewing that over the next several years as we could be getting up even to 400 remodels a year or more to try to catch up and take advantage of that. 
Two, in terms of new stores, the -- we would see -- we're not giving out a number, but it's going to be -- it will be more than the 122, probably at 150-plus for the next several years. I think there's great opportunity with all the unfortunate disruption in retail. We are already starting to see in all of our geographies when we are signing leases in store closures that have already happened in the past year. And we would view -- it doesn't happen overnight, but we would see that as a big opportunity for calendar '22 and '23 to get sites. 
I think part of -- the bigger part of that is the quality of the sites without having to necessarily get them at rents that we would have paid just 1 year or 2 ago. So it's not that it's necessarily cheaper than our current cost base, but it will be cheaper than what we would have paid and probably locations that we otherwise would not been able to get. 
In Marmaxx division particularly, but across all of our stores, the relocations is an opportunity as we have hundreds of leases coming to renewal. And so we see a great opportunity to open again to better real estate and potentially, I think, the #1 thing is to drive higher sales, but potentially even to keep our costs the same or lower. I think where we've seen a fantastic opportunity in Europe in terms of cost reductions, a lot of it is the environment there, as you can imagine, worse than it is here from a real estate with all the closures. And on a lot of our rent renewals, we are seeing increases -- decreases in terms of the overall cost that we have to pay north of 25% on a per-store basis. So that's a combination of either the capital that you're going to get when we want to move into a store, or benefit  we're going to get, or just the actual reduction in the rent. So we're seeing significant decreases there.  We were doing -- we were seeing decreases before, but not to the level that we're currently seeing. 
We're also seeing some phenomenal deals. So I'm not going to name the specific sites, but in the last couple of weeks, we've seen stores where we were paying $900,000 in rent go down to $600,000 or $500,000 to less than $200,000. Just phenomenal decreases in renewals. And also even landlords who want us, giving us extended rent-free periods because we're an anchor tenant in a strip, and they very much want us to be there. So yes, I think that's a tremendous opportunity for us."

And by the way, I'll just throw these together. You asked about HomeSense. HomeSense similarly was heading to a good place. But obviously, when COVID impacted us, everything, the tide rose overall with both these businesses. And we're just seeing, as the world changes in lifestyle and focus, even when the vaccines all hit, you're still going to have a dynamic change around us all in terms of how many people are spending more time still in home environments and focused on that. Regardless of whether there's an x percent that goes back to work; of course, there will be. There'll be a majority going back to offices. But all you need is a small percent going the other way and with a focus on the environment of home.  So yes. We just feel like there's way more market opportunity as we move forward. 
If you look at the amount of home business being done online, and let's go back to the market share mission we're on. We feel, and of course, homegoods.com, which will be later in the year, we feel that's an opportunity to take online business. But we feel our HomeSense business, specifically, really pulls from categories that are significantly done online. We feel HomeSense can really eat into that online business. And recently, anecdotally, I've had friends that have bought goods at HomeSense, and they've used our delivery service, which, again, in many cases, is a third party. But you are trying the -- for example, the sofa or the chair, you're trying that actual sofa or chair there. And that is what shows up at your house within the next day or 2. Again, we have same-day delivery in many of those sites.  And I think that is an interesting dynamic, which, obviously, the business is extremely healthy right now, but we feel like there's just so much more upside. And as you could tell by the number we gave you as the percent of TJX, that home has been most recently -- the momentum is so strong to think otherwise, that we wouldn't continue to just grab more market share.

If you've been in our store, you'll see that in most of those, we have 2 greeters. They're really cleaning the carts as well as welcoming, asking, ""Do you need help?"" Where they treated okay and safely. And so that's had huge impact. And I'm looking at that as a form of marketing to help us with our top line for the future. And so that is -- we want to be very careful as we pull that back because all the indicators are that has been a big help on our reputation during COVID. So very good question."

All things being equal, and if, again, saying a lot right now, if we had guided to approximately 10.2% to 10.3% last year on a 3% comp, if you would had the similar level headwinds of supply chain wage, et cetera, you would have gone down 30 to 40 basis points for another year. So as we said, nothing's really changed in terms of store wage in terms of that. 
The DC -- the 2 components that are a bit larger right now are the DC supply chain and the DC wage as we've had both in our HomeGoods and Marmaxx DCs, wage increases this year, which are going to be annualizing for most of this year, those impacts, and significant freight costs, what would have been over fiscal '20 last results. 
So those will largely depend on what level of sales because you have a natural delever on the sales until you get back and recapture those sales. So if the delever was 30 to 40, it's clearly going to -- it would clearly be significantly higher than that without the COVID costs. And then those, we would expect to start recapturing some of that as we get our sales levels up. So it's -- but that 10.6% would have been going down. And then on top of that is the deleverage of the sales and the higher freight and other supply chain costs."

This year, we obviously are not meeting our plans. And so we had the incentive accruals go the other way. So it was a benefit of almost 90 basis points in the quarter that's, obviously, next year, we would hope to have a normal level of bonus accruals. And so that's the biggest difference. There was some -- the rest of it's just noise between fuel hedges, and there was expense savings as a lot of companies -- maybe I haven't talked about it that much, on medical costs and others due to less people being sick that we had a benefit as well."

And I will tell you to go along with that, Adrienne, as we -- it's funny you mentioned that, and it's one thing I thought I didn't get to mention on one of the earlier questions. We are buying significantly more from our satellite buying offices this year, which actually speaks to a little about what you just asked because -- probably because of availability around -- it's not always with the same vendors and maybe what's going on with Europe. So we have satellite offices. We have offices in Italy and in Europe and in the Far East and California. And so we've had a disproportionate growth in purchases from those offices recently relative to our total during COVID. 
And then -- I mean, the good news in the vendor, this is not unusual. When we -- specifically in the home business, Adrienne. The -- if you ever go to our store 1 week and you go the next week, for example, in some of our categories where, there's a lot of newness. So if you look at our food business, you'll see lots of new brands that will go in there, and they maybe weren't there a few months ago. And you don't tend to think of that area, but there's a lot of special labels in there that really become hot and lend quality and country of origin from Italy to domestic brands. And that happens throughout the store, but there are definitely more areas where I think brands have become -- it's really going to be a big differentiator of us from, I think, everybody else because so many of the retailers around us in apparel -- by the way, the apparel world is going very specialty private label-driven. And what will be neat about our business is the customer. She or he can walk in and see an assortment of different brands that, yes, you'd find them in-depth in other stores, but they're all going to be under 1 roof, in a treasury hunt format, if that makes sense."

In terms of the big picture on freight, it's very difficult to start, and you'll see that when we're going to be starting to compare against our numbers in the first and second quarter because we weren't open for business for such large chunks of the business of the time. But if you're going to compare fiscal '20 -- fiscal '22 to fiscal '20, it's a -- you're 50 to north of 60 basis points over a 2-year impact of incremental basis points on freight. But it's really going to be a tale of 2 stories. It's going to be significantly weighted toward the first half of the year versus the second half of the year because most of -- we had the big spike ups. 
A lot of for us is we'll be renegotiating domestically our rail, our truck and our ocean in the middle of the second quarter. So we would hope to contract more capacity because a lot of what impacted us and others is having to go to more spot rates and just pay through the nose that happened in the fourth quarter and a little of what will be happening still. And also the mix of the goods was not ideal because the #1 priority, I think, Ernie, would agree, was to make sure we were getting the goods. And our teams did a great job to get the goods, but we were paying -- we had to pay a premium in many cases. But we're working on a lot of issues in our logistics area to reduce costs, and we think there will be opportunities we'll be able to take advantage of as we move forward through the next year and beyond."

Joining me and Deb on the call is Scott Goldenberg. As we've done throughout the pandemic, I'd like to start our call today by saying how truly grateful I am for the hard work and dedication of our global associates and their continued commitment to our health and safety protocols. I want to give special recognition to our store, distribution center and fulfillment center associates who continue to physically come into work. In recognition of their continued efforts, we awarded a vast majority of them an appreciation bonus, which was the fourth appreciation bonus that we have paid during the pandemic. 
While the health crisis is beginning to improve in some parts of the world, there are many areas that are still facing challenges or have become worse. Our hearts go out to everyone whose lives have been impacted by this virus. We are hopeful that more people around the world will have access to the vaccine in the coming months and that we can move past this health crisis soon. 
Moving to our business operations. During the first quarter, we were very pleased that our U.S. stores were able to stay open. However, we continued to have a significant number of our stores in Europe and Canada that were temporarily closed at certain times throughout the quarter due to government mandates. Currently, approximately 300 stores remain temporarily closed, all of which are in either Canada or Europe. Around the world, we continue to prioritize the health and well-being of our associates and customers in our stores, our distribution centers and our offices. 
Now I'll recap our first quarter results. First, I am extremely pleased that our overall open-only comp store sales when compared to fiscal '20 increased 16%, which well exceeded our plans. We believe we saw a benefit from consumers feeling more comfortable leaving their homes, visiting our stores and being happy with the brands and values they found. Our home businesses across all of our divisions continued their phenomenal sales trends. 
Further, we saw strong open-only comp increases in many other categories and positive open-only comp store sales in overall apparel. Open-only comp sales were also outstanding across each of our divisions, which indicates to us that our value proposition continues to resonate in all of our geographies. I'll talk more about our divisional performance in a moment. 
Next, overall sales of $10.1 billion were a first quarter sales record despite the temporary closing of our stores for approximately 14% of the quarter. We are extremely pleased that we are seeing our most loyal customers return to our stores in the U.S. and that new shoppers are discovering our great values and exciting treasure hunt shopping experience. All of this gives us great confidence that we are set up extremely well to continue driving sales and gain additional market share over the medium to long term.
Third, merchandise margin remains healthy. The buying environment is excellent with the marketplace loaded with a great selection of merchandise across good, better and best brands and trending categories. Our buyers are doing a tremendous job sourcing quality-branded merchandise to keep up with the strong consumer demand that we have been seeing. 
Lastly, first quarter earnings per share of $0.44 were also well above our plans despite a larger-than-expected sales loss as our non-U.S. stores were temporarily closed more than we had anticipated. 
Now to our divisional performance, which is again compared to fiscal '20, beginning with Marmaxx. Marmaxx open-only comp store sales increased an outstanding 12%, and overall sales increased 14% versus the first quarter of fiscal '20. Marmaxx' home business continued its excellent performance with a comp increase similar to the HomeGoods as shoppers continue to spend on their homes. We were also very pleased to see a comp sales increase in our overall apparel business, which was driven by strong demand in select categories. We believe our apparel sales benefited from wardrobe refreshing as more consumers begin resuming more normal activities. We feel very good about Marmaxx' sales momentum and our ability to flex their merchandise mix to the category shoppers want. 
At HomeGoods, open-only comp store sales increased a phenomenal 40%. During the quarter, HomeGoods and HomeSense sales were remarkable across all major categories and geographic regions as their eclectic mix of home fashions from around the world continue to resonate with consumers. 
Similar to home sales at Marmaxx, we believe HomeGoods sales continue to benefit from consumers spending more time in their homes during the health crisis. We have been aggressively investing in the growth of our home division for many years and are convinced we are set up very well to build upon our market leadership position in the United States. 
While Canada continues to face challenges with store closures, we are very encouraged with the sales trends we have seen when our stores are open. TJX Canada's open-only comp store sales increased 9%. Open-only comp sales at our HomeSense banner and home sales at Winners and Marshalls were also in line with the increase we saw at our HomeGoods division. Shoppers love our great values in Canada, and we are very confident that this division is well positioned to return to and exceed their pre-pandemic sales levels once we are beyond this health crisis. 
Now to TJX International. Like Canada, Europe faced continued store closures, and we expect them to continue into the second quarter as well. However, during the limited time our stores were permitted to be open, customer excitement was very high in response to our values was fantastic. We were very pleased with TGX International's 11% open-only comp store sales increase. Given the length of time our stores were closed in Europe, we saw significant pent-up demand when we reopened later in the quarter. As the only major brick-and-mortar off-price retailer of significant size in Europe, we see an opportunity to scale our business and capture a bigger piece of the European retail market over the long term. 
In Australia, where our stores were generally open for the entire quarter, comp store sales were extremely strong for both our apparel and home categories. 
As to e-commerce overall, we saw terrific growth over first quarter fiscal '20 sales levels in both the U.S. and U.K. We are still on track to launch homegoods.com later this year and are looking forward to offering consumers even more exciting home fashion items at great value online. 
Moving on. While the health crisis persists, we are confident that the core strengths of our off-price business model will continue to help us navigate through the current environment while setting us up very well to succeed in a more normalized environment. Let me take a moment to highlight these strengths.
First is our relentless focus on value. We believe our value proposition, which is a combination of brand, fashion, price and quality, is as important as ever to consumers. 
Second is our world-class global buying organization of more than 1,100 buyers. These buyers are located in 12 countries across 4 continents and sourced from a vast network of approximately 21,000 vendors. We see our global buying offices and reach as a tremendous advantage, particularly in an environment where travel remains limited. Consumer demand across our home businesses has been especially strong. So our ability to successfully leverage our global buying has been a great benefit. 
We believe our 500-plus homebuyers around the world allow us to offer consumers a truly global differentiated merchandise mix versus other large retailers. We strengthened our relationships with many of our vendors and have added thousands of new vendors for apparel and home product over the past year. All of this allows us to offer a fresh and exciting mix of quality-branded merchandise to our shoppers every time they visit.
Next, the flexibility of our buying, store format and distribution network allows us to take advantage of consumer trends and hot categories as consumer demand changes. We also reach a very wide customer demographic in urban, ex-urban, suburban and rural markets. With our fast-growing inventories, our customers can discover something new in-store and online every time they visit. 
Lastly is our global presence. With nearly 45 years of operating expertise in the U.S., 30-plus years in Canada and more than 25 years in Europe, we are an off-price leader in every country we operate in. Even in Australia, a country we have entered more recently, we are an off-price leader. We have spent decades establishing relationships with vendors and landlords and building out our global buying offices, distribution networks, systems and infrastructure. Further, we have expansive country-specific knowledge of consumer shopping habits and have earned customer loyalty. We believe our well-established global off-price retail model and level of international expertise is a tremendous advantage, and our size and scale would be very difficult to replicate.
Now I'd like to walk through the reasons why we are confident that we can drive sales and traffic growth in a normalized environment and why we continue to see a significant opportunity to increase our market share across each of our divisions.
First, we believe the appeal of our entertaining treasure hunt shopping experience gives consumers a compelling reason to shop us. Based on what we've seen for decades, including the past year, in-store shopping is not going away. We see our stores as a desirable destination for consumers seeking some stress relief or ""me time"" and also a great place to shop when they are seeking inspiration and looking to discover new things, which is difficult to replicate online. 
Second, we see a significant opportunity to grow our global store base at each of our divisions. In total, we believe we can open more than 1,600 additional stores to grow to about 6,275 stores in the long term just with our current banners and our current countries. Availability of real estate is terrific, and we see plenty of opportunities to open new stores or relocate existing stores. Further, we believe our strategy of locating stores in convenient, highly accessible locations makes it very easy for shoppers to find and visit us. We are anticipating incremental traffic once consumers return to their workplaces and go out more as they will be passing by our stores much more frequently. 
Next is our focus on marketing to attract new shoppers while staying top of mind with our existing customers. This year, we have already launched new campaigns across television, digital and social media platforms for a number of our banners. These campaigns continue to reinforce our value leadership while also highlighting discovery, fashion and quality. I hope you have seen them. The creative is excellent. Let me take a moment to highlight a couple of them. 
First, we took a unique approach for Mother's Day and created a multi-brand music video in the U.S. that was highly successful and was viewed by more than 17 million times on YouTube over a 2-week period. We also did an integration with the NBC prime show, The Voice, where each of the top 20 contestants were styled head-to-toe with products from Marshalls and performed a powerful segment lasting over 2 minutes. This work continues to reflect our leadership in fashion and value and helps us show that our stores can be for everyone. Further, we continue to see strong overall customer satisfaction scores where we are open, including on our ongoing health and safety protocol measurements. 
Lastly, our research tells us that overall, we continue to attract new shoppers of all ages into our stores, including a significant amount of Gen Z and millennial shoppers, which we believe bodes well for today and in the future.
Fourth, we see a great opportunity to capture a bigger share of the consumers' wallet due to other retailers closing stores. We also believe that these store closures may lead to even better product and real estate availability and more favorable lease terms.
Lastly, we are investing in new stores and remodels and our distribution network and systems to ensure we have the infrastructure in place to support our global growth plans.
In closing, I want to again recognize the exceptional talent that we have across this entire company. With outsized open-only comps in the first quarter, our organization really stepped up from buyers who successfully chased the goods in the marketplace to our associates in planning and allocation, distribution centers, logistics and store operations. Each of these groups has a vital role to play to ensure our merchandise flow can keep up with the consumer demand we have been seeing. It's the collective efforts of all of our associates and their dedication to TJX that brings our business to life for our customers every day in all kinds of retail environments. 
Our outstanding first quarter results tell us that consumers are seeking out our branded quality merchandise and great values. Clearly, they are enjoying our entertaining treasure hunt shopping experience. Overall, open-only comp store sales trends for the start of the second quarter remained similar to the first quarter. Looking ahead, I am convinced that TJX is very well positioned to emerge from this health crisis in a position of great strength. We see numerous opportunities to continue our global growth and are excited about the runway for growth that we see ahead for TJX. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Scott for a financial update, and then we'll open it up for questions."

I'd like to first echo Ernie's comments and thank all of our global associates for their hard work and continued commitment to our business.I'll start today with some additional details on our first quarter res",946,"Thanks, Ernie, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to first echo Ernie's comments and thank all of our global associates for their hard work and continued commitment to our business.
I'll start today with some additional details on our first quarter results. As Ernie mentioned, overall open-only comp stores increased an outstanding 16%. As you described in the press release, our first quarter open-only comp store sales compare fiscal '22 sales to fiscal '20 sales. In the first quarter, we continued to see a very strong increase in our average basket as consumers put more items into their carts.
In the U.S., where we open -- where we were opened the entire quarter, customer traffic compared to fiscal '20 increased for the first time since the start of the pandemic. At Marmaxx, we saw a significant improvement in customer traffic the fourth quarter. And at HomeGoods, customer traffic remained outstanding.
Overall sales for the first quarter increased 129% over fiscal '21 as stores were closed for approximately 50% of the first quarter last year. More importantly, when comparing to fiscal '20, first quarter sales increased a very strong 9% despite the negative impact of approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion of lost sales due to the temporary closings of our stores across TJX for about 14% of the quarter. These closures were primarily in Europe, which was closed for about 76% of the quarter, including essentially all of February and March; and in Canada, which was closed for approximately 25% of the quarter. 
Pretax margin for the first quarter was 7.2%, and merchandise margin was up slightly compared to fiscal '20. During the quarter, we were very pleased with our strong mark-on and lower markdowns. However, these were mostly offset by significantly higher freight costs, which we expect to persist for the remainder of the year.
Moving to the bottom line. First quarter earnings per share were $0.44. As detailed in our press release this morning, we believe the temporary store closures in Europe and Canada during the first quarter resulted in a significant loss of profit dollars, with an estimated negative impact to earnings per share of approximately $0.21 to $0.24. Additionally, I want to remind you that our first quarter pretax margin and earnings per share reflect some significant expense headwinds compared to the first quarter of fiscal '20. These include approximately $200 million of net costs related to COVID, approximately 40 basis points of additional interest expense and incremental costs from freight, supply chain and wage pressures.
As for inventory, it was up 3% last year, and store levels are where we want them to be. Our buyers are doing a great job sourcing merchandise and have been able to chase the goods we need to satisfy consumer demand. To reiterate, availability of merchandise is excellent.
Moving on to our cash flow and liquidity. We ended the quarter in a very strong liquidity position with $8.8 billion in cash. With our strong liquidity, we took several proactive actions to deleverage our balance sheet and reduce our annual interest expense.
First, in April, we paid down the $750 million note that was due to mature this coming June at par. Secondly, this morning, we announced make-whole calls for our $1.25 billion principal outstanding 3.5% notes maturing in 2025 and our $750 million outstanding 3.75% notes maturing in 2027, both of which were issued last April.
As a result of this action, we are expecting a pretax debt extinguishment charge of approximately $250 million in the second quarter. We expect the net results of both of these actions to be a $2.7 billion reduction in our outstanding debt and over 900 -- and over $90 million of annualized interest expense savings. Further, after these actions and including the tender refinancing this past November, we expect the average interest rate on our outstanding debt will be about 2.5%, which is in line with our pre-COVID level.
Lastly, we declared a dividend of $0.26 per share in the first quarter. In the second quarter of fiscal '22, we're planning to declare a dividend at the same rate, subject to Board approval.
Now to the second quarter. As a point of reference for the start of the second quarter, overall open-only comp store sales trends remain similar to the first quarter. For overall sales, we currently have approximately 300 stores that are temporarily closed. Based on what we know today, overall, we expect stores to be closed for approximately 3% of the second quarter, which includes Canada being closed for an estimated 17% of the quarter and Europe being closed for about 7% of the quarter. We are planning a $275 million to $325 million negative impact to our overall second quarter sales due to the store closures.
These expectations could be negatively impacted further if current mandates are extended or new ones are put in place as they were last quarter. At this time, we are not planning any significant store closures in the back half of the year.
In closing, we feel great about our first quarter results and the momentum of our business. We believe that a growing top line and a strong merchandise margin are excellent indicators of a healthy retailer. Additionally, we have a very strong balance sheet and are in excellent financial position to invest in our business to support our growth plans.
Now we're happy to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] We respectively ask that everyone stick with this request to both keep the call on schedule and so that we can answer questions from as many analysts as we can. Thanks, and now we will open it up for questions."

The traffic patterns once we got past some of the weather issues that we called out on our last call have been consistently strong through, we'll call it the [ Marple ], that February, March and continuing right up to, as Ernie talked about, similar sales today. And that's at both -- speaking really more Marmaxx and HomeGoods because of the -- all of the closures that we've had. So the basket has been remarkably strong."

So the improvement this quarter relative to pre-pandemic despite the freight, I thought, was really impressive. I guess -- so first, just sustainability or your ability to continue that trend in your opinion.
But then second, at the EBIT margin level. So I think 3 months ago, Scott, you laid it out well. There's a lot of moving parts. But I think you basically said at a [ 3 ], you see 30 to 40 basis points of underlying margin pressure. But then we needed to consider freight, supply chain and COVID costs this year. So am I thinking about these pieces right? And any factors or changes to these factors to think about now that we're 3 months later?"

I will just jump in on the merchandise margin -- the healthy merchandise margin. Certainly, what we're seeing, and it -- fortunately, it lines up with our model. And again, I give the teams a lot of credit. We went in with the right amount of liquidity. And so the teams did not -- I would say they were right in the sweet spot of how much -- and this applies to all the divisions, most especially, obviously, right now, Marmaxx and HomeGoods buying to about the right level of trend.
And then when you're staying on trend like that with what's going on, the buyers have done a great job of being able to buy so opportunistically in the market. So that helped. The sales being so strong has been a big benefit on our markdown rate, also helping our merchandise margin. As I said in my script, it's coming across -- we're making very advantageous buys across whether it's the level of good vendors, moderate or best vendors, it's been everywhere, but in trending categories, which has been key. So we've had certain categories that are outpacing the store. And the merchants have done a great job of buying into those at the right cost and at the right retail because, as you know, we're ultrasensitive about where we retail are good at. And so again, I give them a lot of credit.
I will tell you, we have a challenge down the road here as we look into probably more like the third quarter, where last year, we were up against almost an artificial margin bump up based on what had happened in the country during the COVID shutdown. And so there might be a little bit of a mark-on or markdown jeopardy in a window there of a few months where it's going to be a little more challenging, and I think to show the merchandise margin at these rates. And by the way, I'm talking aside from freight, which has obviously gone up everywhere. I'm talking kind of take that out of the equation. But we might have a little challenge there. However, we're so opportunistic. I have faith that we can do better than what we're probably thinking our challenges there.
I will now let Scott talk to the margins."

This third quarter last year where Ernie was comparing to '21 is really on the mark-on and the markdowns. We also had some technical issues where we had some pools in which -- and both on markdowns and shrink, which we reversed in the back half of the year, which are not a fiscal '20 issue, but when comparing to last year or benefits that we saw last year in the back half that we won't repeat."

So the other aspect is in terms of some of the 2-year flow-through, it's hard to isolate, especially when you look at the quarter we've just had, when you have -- we have COVID costs, which we're still roughly in full force.

So the other aspect is in terms of some of the 2-year flow-through, it's hard to isolate, especially when you look at the quarter we've just had, when you have -- we have COVID costs, which we're still roughly in full force. And we can talk about that more, but I would expect those to moderate and already can talk about them more as we move through the second quarter and back half of the year.
I think what -- at least at the moment is stubborn, and we're still in the middle of assessing like everyone else, are freight costs. But probably compared to both last -- what we -- when we talked 3 months ago and earlier in that, the freight costs are probably going to be stubbornly high, at least for the rest of this year, as we're dealing with the same issues of driver shortages and rate increases likely to be higher than what we had originally thought. So I think that piece of it is still -- is going to be persisting.
Having said that, we have been -- I think, as Ernie mentioned, we're doing a great job of getting the goods. Paying more for it, but we're getting goods. Our inventories are in good shape, and the buyer -- and our planning and allocation teams have been allocating those goods and doing a great job, as you can see by our sales.
On the other hand, the wage costs have been -- there's been pressure but more -- it's still stubborn in the DCs as we've had a number of our DCs where we've had wage -- increase our wage rates. But on the positive side, both in the stores and the DCs, although we have pockets of challenges, we've been able to hire back to our staffing -- close to our staffing levels we need to staff the store, albeit at a deleverage compared to prior year.
So again, the positive is we adjust as necessary, but we've been able to staff the stores and the distribution centers to meet the demand. So it's hard to compare with the lost sales in Europe and with the COVID costs exactly what those breakpoints would be on sales at this point."

And that's even with all the COVID costs in there and all the freight inflation and the wages and everything else.
So I'm just -- it looks like the weight in the P&L here in Q1, if I look at it from a different angle, it's really coming from that international piece.

The difference is, and Scott mentioned this, we had such an overachievement on the sales that -- I mean you'd have to be counting on a 16 open-only comp sales. And when the rest of Europe -- if we have those type of comp sales, yes, we'd have a different discussion where maybe the margin is back to more like those levels. But that -- you'd have to have these way outpaced comp sales like we just did.
Now to your other point, though, and Scott mentioned it, we are -- looking at the COVID costs is something we can take a hard look at here in the near future. As we move ahead each quarter and as the environment normalizes, we're going to make some improvements on those lines. So that will help.
So I hope that answered -- I -- we're -- we do believe there's sales upside all along. And another plus we have on the cost line is our average retail has been moderating. And Scott, I think, started to allude to this. As we go forward even into the back half, we're looking like it's going to moderate even more because we're seeing some more best brands goods coming in on order as we get to the third quarter, which is going to help our average ticket. And that should help our expense on processing come down a little bit. So a very good question, a lot of moving parts."

So standout categories, I'll start with the most obvious one, which is our home business is remarkably consistent, as I said in the script. I mean you're looking at 40 comps kind of what we did in the first quarter. And again, that basically was where we were in every division, even in the full family stores in a T.J. Maxx, a Marshalls up in Canada, HomeSense. So remarkable consistency. And the neat thing there is we have a lot of broad-based consistency throughout our entire home business. So whether it's big-ticket areas like -- whether it's furnitures or rugs or decorative accessories, everything was good. There wasn't really one category.
And this is where I give our teams, planning and allocation and our -- and this is not just in the home area. Our buying teams, our planning and allocation teams have been getting the goods, fueling it so that -- the second part of your question was the deceleration in home. We have really not seen it -- I don't think we're going to expect it to stay at that almost artificially high level that it did in the first quarter, but I think we have opportunity over the next quarter to stay up in the realm pretty close to that.
And we're not having a problem in the home area of stock -- staying at stock, which was the third part of your question. And we're not actually having a problem where apparel has now started to improve for us. Paul, I think you're asking what else is standing out. So we have a handful of apparel categories, which I won't give the specifics on which ones, but they are really kicking in as the quarter went on and going into the second quarter.
And the nice thing that often happens is when the weather shifts and apparel kicks in, if there was a trend line prior, usually, our home business takes more of a hit where the consumer moves off of home for a little bit. And yes, again, our homes is going to continue at 40 comps, but it did not move off hardly at all. And our apparel just kicked in, and that's one reason you're seeing these outpaced comps from us really at this first quarter.
Chasing product flow of product has been a nonissue. I say it's a nonissue because the teams have really executed so well, and they're working so -- and I give logistics credit. I give really everybody involved credit to keep fuel -- it's not easy to keep fueling a 16 comp. And that's why I liked your question when you asked it because it is an unusual time for us to be running an open-only 16 comp. And I just, again, give credit to all the TJX associates that are involved in that because they're making it happen, and they have this position going into the second quarter every bit as well as we were in the first quarter. Hopefully, that answers your question."

Can you help us think what the SG&A dollars are for the year and what you think COVID costs are for the year in the budget? And then with all the noise, and you laid out the closures, I think as we take the inputs you gave us, you probably, excluding the closures, would have been about $2 billion higher on sales versus first quarter fiscal '20. And then when we add back your $0.21 to $0.24 that you pointed to, which was, I think, only for the closures, you'd be at about a 9.9% to 10.4% margin in the quarter compared to the 10.1% in first quarter 2 years ago. So with that as a starting point -- I know you've been asked to go through margins in a bunch of different ways. But with that as a starting point from here, it sounds like the incremental puts and takes all get sequentially better going forward, except for freight, which you said you now got visibility that it'll be tough. But as you look at 2Q, 3Q, 4Q, you see the COVID costs coming down, international reopening, some of the AUR tailwinds, some of the mix moving back towards apparel. Am I thinking about that right, that if we kind of reorient to the first quarter last year that way that we should see sequential improvement in the underlying margin going forward through the model?"

So not -- again, not giving up the cost save other than we expect them to moderate, both in dollars and as a percent sales impact.
I think Ernie reiterated on, one, a lot of it is still will depend on the merchandise margin in terms of what the -- what our mark-on and markdown will be and the level of sales. So again, if we have outsized sales and we're able to buy better, the real wildcard is freight costs and how high they're going to be in the back half of the year.
But we didn't say that a lot of the other cost wins are going to be -- at least for now, the wage and the distribution costs we're cycling, opening up of both a lot of our facilities. And we did a lot -- we opened 6 3PLs or just additional, what we'll call processing space last year that we're going to go against in the back half and including Lordstown, a HomeGoods distribution center.
So I don't think our supply chain/wage are going to be levering at this point based on what we know and the wildcards really being merchandise margin and freight, with COVID going down.
So I think the biggest benefit to us getting better in our overall margins will be how far does COVID get down and what's our level of sales. And if those stay high, then we would expect to go to a higher level of pretax margin."

So we believe that I would say a chunk of our -- has not been just the stimulus and the -- to the best of our knowledge, we wouldn't be entering the second quarter with a similar trend, which is why we specifically, when we did the release, we put that last bullet point there, which is -- I guess is a little bit more specific than we normally would on how we start a quarter and why we wanted to say that we are entering it similarly so you would understand that the overall stimulus check thing isn't the only thing playing in and it has to be some of those other issues in our business model, store closures -- by the way, I do believe our business model now resonates more than it even did pre-COVID. I think consumers -- if ever they have, even more so now with all the stress of what's happened in the last year, they appreciate the treasure hunt entertainment ""me time,"" as I mentioned in the script, ""me time"". They -- I think our model and the fact that what we talked about earlier on the call, we've delivered a lot of exciting merchandise, which plays right into this time period.

So it's that -- so the stimulus, as Ernie said, was -- as best we confirm, was more of a March-April factor, probably waning, as best we can determine. But now it has to do with the wardrobe people -- they didn't buy a lot of apparel last year in the first and second quarter. And that's, I think, contributing to our strength right now."

And our home division has -- as I mentioned, we have over 500-plus buyers in our home division that have collaborated just beyond even what we did before. As well as we have satellite offices for not just home that are overseas that are now buying more merchandise for us than they did before.
So when you -- I feel we can continue to actually now drive an even more eclectic mix of home, which has the advantage that the consumer can buy at that day. If it's a piece of furniture, they can try it and buy it. I mean think about all the delivery issues that have taken place or -- so that's all [ another plus ]. In addition to the apparel thing Scott was talking about as well as some other better hot categories in the industry, such as the beauty business, we have -- I give that team a lot of credit. We've really been doing a nice job. They collaborate strongly across division.

Joining me and Deb on the call is Scott Goldenberg. As we've done throughout the pandemic, I'd like to start our call today by saying how truly grateful I am for the hard work and dedication of our global associates and their continued commitment to our health and safety protocols. I want to give special recognition to our store, distribution center and fulfillment center associates who continue to physically come into work. In recognition of their continued efforts, we awarded a vast majority of them an appreciation bonus, which was the fourth appreciation bonus that we have paid during the pandemic. 
While the health crisis is beginning to improve in some parts of the world, there are many areas that are still facing challenges or have become worse. Our hearts go out to everyone whose lives have been impacted by this virus. We are hopeful that more people around the world will have access to the vaccine in the coming months and that we can move past this health crisis soon. 
Moving to our business operations. During the first quarter, we were very pleased that our U.S. stores were able to stay open. However, we continued to have a significant number of our stores in Europe and Canada that were temporarily closed at certain times throughout the quarter due to government mandates. Currently, approximately 300 stores remain temporarily closed, all of which are in either Canada or Europe. Around the world, we continue to prioritize the health and well-being of our associates and customers in our stores, our distribution centers and our offices. 
Now I'll recap our first quarter results. First, I am extremely pleased that our overall open-only comp store sales when compared to fiscal '20 increased 16%, which well exceeded our plans. We believe we saw a benefit from consumers feeling more comfortable leaving their homes, visiting our stores and being happy with the brands and values they found. Our home businesses across all of our divisions continued their phenomenal sales trends. 
Further, we saw strong open-only comp increases in many other categories and positive open-only comp store sales in overall apparel. Open-only comp sales were also outstanding across each of our divisions, which indicates to us that our value proposition continues to resonate in all of our geographies. I'll talk more about our divisional performance in a moment. 
Next, overall sales of $10.1 billion were a first quarter sales record despite the temporary closing of our stores for approximately 14% of the quarter. We are extremely pleased that we are seeing our most loyal customers return to our stores in the U.S. and that new shoppers are discovering our great values and exciting treasure hunt shopping experience. All of this gives us great confidence that we are set up extremely well to continue driving sales and gain additional market share over the medium to long term. 
Third, merchandise margin remains healthy. The buying environment is excellent with the marketplace loaded with a great selection of merchandise across good, better and best brands and trending categories. Our buyers are doing a tremendous job sourcing quality-branded merchandise to keep up with the strong consumer demand that we have been seeing. 
Lastly, first quarter earnings per share of $0.44 were also well above our plans despite a larger-than-expected sales loss as our non-U.S. stores were temporarily closed more than we had anticipated. 
Now to our divisional performance, which is again compared to fiscal '20, beginning with Marmaxx. Marmaxx open-only comp store sales increased an outstanding 12%, and overall sales increased 14% versus the first quarter of fiscal '20. Marmaxx's home business continued its excellent performance with a comp increase similar to the HomeGoods as shoppers continue to spend on their homes. We were also very pleased to see a comp sales increase in our overall apparel business, which was driven by strong demand in select categories. We believe our apparel sales benefited from wardrobe refreshing as more consumers begin resuming more normal activities. We feel very good about Marmaxx's sales momentum and our ability to flex their merchandise mix to the category shoppers want. 
At HomeGoods, open-only comp store sales increased a phenomenal 40%. During the quarter, HomeGoods and HomeSense sales were remarkable across all major categories and geographic regions as their eclectic mix of home fashions from around the world continue to resonate with consumers. 
Similar to home sales at Marmaxx, we believe HomeGoods sales continue to benefit from consumers spending more time in their homes during the health crisis. We have been aggressively investing in the growth of our home division for many years and are convinced we are set up very well to build upon our market leadership position in the United States. 
While Canada continues to face challenges with store closures, we are very encouraged with the sales trends we have seen when our stores are open. TJX Canada's open-only comp store sales increased 9%. Open-only comp sales at our HomeSense banner and home sales at Winners and Marshalls were also in line with the increase we saw at our HomeGoods division. 
Shoppers love our great values in Canada, and we are very confident that this division is well positioned to return to and exceed their pre-pandemic sales levels once we are beyond this health crisis. 
Now to TJX International. Like Canada, Europe faced continued store closures, and we expect them to continue into the second quarter as well. However, during the limited time our stores were permitted to be open, customer excitement was very high in response to our values was fantastic. We were very pleased with TJX International's 11% open-only comp store sales increase. Given the length of time our stores were closed in Europe, we saw significant pent-up demand when we reopened later in the quarter. 
As the only major brick-and-mortar off-price retailer of significant size in Europe, we see an opportunity to scale our business and capture a bigger piece of the European retail market over the long term. 
In Australia, where our stores were generally open for the entire quarter, comp store sales were extremely strong for both our apparel and home categories. 
As to e-commerce overall, we saw terrific growth over first quarter fiscal '20 sales levels in both the U.S. and U.K. We are still on track to launch homegoods.com later this year and are looking forward to offering consumers even more exciting home fashion items at great value online. 
Moving on. While the health crisis persists, we are confident that the core strengths of our off-price business model will continue to help us navigate through the current environment while setting us up very well to succeed in a more normalized environment. Let me take a moment to highlight these strengths. 
First is our relentless focus on value. We believe our value proposition, which is a combination of brand, fashion, price and quality, is as important as ever to consumers. 
Second is our world-class global buying organization of more than 1,100 buyers. These buyers are located in 12 countries across 4 continents and sourced from a vast network of approximately 21,000 vendors. We see our global buying offices and reach as a tremendous advantage, particularly in an environment where travel remains limited. Consumer demand across our home businesses has been especially strong. So our ability to successfully leverage our global buying has been a great benefit. 
We believe our 500-plus homebuyers around the world allow us to offer consumers a truly global differentiated merchandise mix versus other large retailers. We strengthened our relationships with many of our vendors and have added thousands of new vendors for apparel and home product over the past year. All of this allows us to offer a fresh and exciting mix of quality-branded merchandise to our shoppers every time they visit. 
Next, the flexibility of our buying, store format and distribution network allows us to take advantage of consumer trends and hot categories as consumer demand changes. We also reach a very wide customer demographic in urban, ex-urban, suburban and rural markets. With our fast-growing inventories, our customers can discover something new in-store and online every time they visit. 
Lastly is our global presence. With nearly 45 years of operating expertise in the U.S., 30-plus years in Canada and more than 25 years in Europe, we are an off-price leader in every country we operate in. Even in Australia, a country we have entered more recently, we are an off-price leader. We have spent decades establishing relationships with vendors and landlords and building out our global buying offices, distribution networks, systems and infrastructure. Further, we have expansive country-specific knowledge of consumer shopping habits and have earned customer loyalty. We believe our well-established global off-price retail model and level of international expertise is a tremendous advantage, and our size and scale would be very difficult to replicate. 
Now I'd like to walk through the reasons why we are confident that we can drive sales and traffic growth in a normalized environment and why we continue to see a significant opportunity to increase our market share across each of our divisions. 
First, we believe the appeal of our entertaining treasure hunt shopping experience gives consumers a compelling reason to shop us. Based on what we've seen for decades, including the past year, in-store shopping is not going away. We see our stores as a desirable destination for consumers seeking some stress relief or ""me time"" and also a great place to shop when they are seeking inspiration and looking to discover new things, which is difficult to replicate online. 
Second, we see a significant opportunity to grow our global store base at each of our divisions. In total, we believe we can open more than 1,600 additional stores to grow to about 6,275 stores in the long term just with our current banners and our current countries. Availability of real estate is terrific, and we see plenty of opportunities to open new stores or relocate existing stores. Further, we believe our strategy of locating stores in convenient, highly accessible locations makes it very easy for shoppers to find and visit us. We are anticipating incremental traffic once consumers return to their workplaces and go out more as they will be passing by our stores much more frequently. 
Next is our focus on marketing to attract new shoppers while staying top of mind with our existing customers. This year, we have already launched new campaigns across television, digital and social media platforms for a number of our banners. These campaigns continue to reinforce our value leadership while also highlighting discovery, fashion and quality. I hope you have seen them. The creative is excellent. Let me take a moment to highlight a couple of them. 
First, we took a unique approach for Mother's Day and created a multi-brand music video in the U.S. that was highly successful and was viewed by more than 17 million times on YouTube over a 2-week period. We also did an integration with the NBC prime show, The Voice, where each of the top 20 contestants were styled head-to-toe with products from Marshalls and performed a powerful segment lasting over 2 minutes. This work continues to reflect our leadership in fashion and value and helps us show that our stores can be for everyone. Further, we continue to see strong overall customer satisfaction scores where we are open, including on our ongoing health and safety protocol measurements. 
Lastly, our research tells us that overall, we continue to attract new shoppers of all ages into our stores, including a significant amount of Gen Z and millennial shoppers, which we believe bodes well for today and in the future. 
Fourth, we see a great opportunity to capture a bigger share of the consumers' wallet due to other retailers closing stores. We also believe that these store closures may lead to even better product and real estate availability and more favorable lease terms. 
Lastly, we are investing in new stores and remodels and our distribution network and systems to ensure we have the infrastructure in place to support our global growth plans. 
In closing, I want to again recognize the exceptional talent that we have across this entire company. With outsized open-only comps in the first quarter, our organization really stepped up from buyers who successfully chased the goods in the marketplace to our associates in planning and allocation, distribution centers, logistics and store operations. Each of these groups has a vital role to play to ensure our merchandise flow can keep up with the consumer demand we have been seeing. It's the collective efforts of all of our associates and their dedication to TJX that brings our business to life for our customers every day in all kinds of retail environments. 
Our outstanding first quarter results tell us that consumers are seeking out our branded quality merchandise and great values. Clearly, they are enjoying our entertaining treasure hunt shopping experience. Overall, open-only comp store sales trends for the start of the second quarter remained similar to the first quarter. Looking ahead, I am convinced that TJX is very well positioned to emerge from this health crisis in a position of great strength. We see numerous opportunities to continue our global growth and are excited about the runway for growth that we see ahead for TJX. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Scott for a financial update, and then we'll open it up for questions."

I'd like to first echo Ernie's comments and thank all of our global associates for their hard work and continued commitment to our business. I'll start today with some additional details on our first quarter re",947,"Thanks, Ernie, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to first echo Ernie's comments and thank all of our global associates for their hard work and continued commitment to our business. 
I'll start today with some additional details on our first quarter results. As Ernie mentioned, overall open-only comp stores increased an outstanding 16%. As you described in the press release, our first quarter open-only comp store sales compare fiscal '22 sales to fiscal '20 sales. In the first quarter, we continued to see a very strong increase in our average basket as consumers put more items into their carts. 
In the U.S., where we open -- where we were opened the entire quarter, customer traffic compared to fiscal '20 increased for the first time since the start of the pandemic. At Marmaxx, we saw a significant improvement in customer traffic versus the fourth quarter. And at HomeGoods, customer traffic remained outstanding. 
Overall sales for the first quarter increased 129% over fiscal '21 as stores were closed for approximately 50% of the first quarter last year. More importantly, when comparing to fiscal '20, first quarter sales increased a very strong 9% despite the negative impact of approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion of lost sales due to the temporary closings of our stores across TJX for about 14% of the quarter. These closures were primarily in Europe, which was closed for about 76% of the quarter, including essentially all of February and March; and in Canada, which was closed for approximately 25% of the quarter. 
Pretax margin for the first quarter was 7.2%, and merchandise margin was up slightly compared to fiscal '20. During the quarter, we were very pleased with our strong mark-on and lower markdowns. However, these were mostly offset by significantly higher freight costs, which we expect to persist for the remainder of the year. 
Moving to the bottom line. First quarter earnings per share were $0.44. As detailed in our press release this morning, we believe the temporary store closures in Europe and Canada during the first quarter resulted in a significant loss of profit dollars, with an estimated negative impact to earnings per share of approximately $0.21 to $0.24. Additionally, I want to remind you that our first quarter pretax margin and earnings per share reflect some significant expense headwinds compared to the first quarter of fiscal '20. These include approximately $200 million of net costs related to COVID, approximately 40 basis points of additional interest expense and incremental costs from freight, supply chain and wage pressures. 
As for inventory, it was up 3% last year, and store levels are where we want them to be. Our buyers are doing a great job sourcing merchandise and have been able to chase the goods we need to satisfy consumer demand. To reiterate, availability of merchandise is excellent. 
Moving on to our cash flow and liquidity. We ended the quarter in a very strong liquidity position with $8.8 billion in cash. With our strong liquidity, we took several proactive actions to deleverage our balance sheet and reduce our annual interest expense. 
First, in April, we paid down the $750 million note that was due to mature this coming June at par. Secondly, this morning, we announced make-whole calls for our $1.25 billion principal outstanding 3.5% notes maturing in 2025 and our $750 million outstanding 3.75% notes maturing in 2027, both of which were issued last April. 
As a result of this action, we are expecting a pretax debt extinguishment charge of approximately $250 million in the second quarter. We expect the net results of both of these actions to be a $2.7 billion reduction in our outstanding debt and over 900 -- and over $90 million of annualized interest expense savings. Further, after these actions and including the tender refinancing this past November, we expect the average interest rate on our outstanding debt will be about 2.5%, which is in line with our pre-COVID level. 
Lastly, we declared a dividend of $0.26 per share in the first quarter. In the second quarter of fiscal '22, we're planning to declare a dividend at the same rate, subject to Board approval. 
Now to the second quarter. As a point of reference for the start of the second quarter, overall open-only comp store sales trends remain similar to the first quarter. For overall sales, we currently have approximately 300 stores that are temporarily closed. Based on what we know today, overall, we expect stores to be closed for approximately 3% of the second quarter, which includes Canada being closed for an estimated 17% of the quarter and Europe being closed for about 7% of the quarter. We are planning a $275 million to $325 million negative impact to our overall second quarter sales due to the store closures. 
These expectations could be negatively impacted further if current mandates are extended or new ones are put in place as they were last quarter. At this time, we are not planning any significant store closures in the back half of the year. 
In closing, we feel great about our first quarter results and the momentum of our business. We believe that a growing top line and a strong merchandise margin are excellent indicators of a healthy retailer. Additionally, we have a very strong balance sheet and are in excellent financial position to invest in our business to support our growth plans.

That's even continuing. So overall, the average age of the customers in both boxes is likely, when we finish up and get current results, probably younger than it has been. So that's really good. 
The traffic patterns once we got past some of the weather issues that we called out on our last call have been consistently strong through, we'll call it the [ Marple ], that February, March and continuing right up to, as Ernie talked about, similar sales today. And that's at both -- speaking really more Marmaxx and HomeGoods because of the -- all of the closures that we've had. So the basket has been remarkably strong."

So the improvement this quarter relative to pre-pandemic despite the freight, I thought, was really impressive. I guess -- so first, just sustainability or your ability to continue that trend in your opinion. 
But then second, at the EBIT margin level. So I think 3 months ago, Scott, you laid it out well. There's a lot of moving parts. But I think you basically said at the 3 comp, you see 30 to 40 basis points of underlying margin pressure. But then we needed to consider freight, supply chain and COVID costs this year. So am I thinking about these pieces right? And any factors or changes to these factors to think about now that we're 3 months later?"
306688,713743839,2292659,"The TJX Companies, Inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, May 19, 2021",2021-05-19,"Earnings Calls","The TJX Companies, Inc.","Executives","Yes. Matt, I think you're right, a lot of that is for Scott. I will just jump in on the merchandise margin -- the healthy merchandise margin. Certainly, what we're seeing, and it -- fortunately, it lines up with our model. And again, I give the teams a lo",399,"Yes. Matt, I think you're right, a lot of that is for Scott. I will just jump in on the merchandise margin -- the healthy merchandise margin. Certainly, what we're seeing, and it -- fortunately, it lines up with our model. And again, I give the teams a lot of credit. We went in with the right amount of liquidity. And so the teams did not -- I would say they were right in the sweet spot of how much -- and this applies to all the divisions, most especially, obviously, right now, Marmaxx and HomeGoods buying to about the right level of trend. 
And then when you're staying on trend like that with what's going on, the buyers have done a great job of being able to buy so opportunistically in the market. So that helped. The sales being so strong has been a big benefit on our markdown rate, also helping our merchandise margin. As I said in my script, it's coming across -- we're making very advantageous buys across whether it's the level of good vendors, moderate or best vendors, it's been everywhere, but in trending categories, which has been key. So we've had certain categories that are outpacing the store. And the merchants have done a great job of buying into those at the right cost and at the right retail because, as you know, we're ultrasensitive about where we retail our goods at. And so again, I give them a lot of credit. 
I will tell you, we have a challenge down the road here as we look into probably more like the third quarter, where last year, we were up against almost an artificial margin bump up based on what had happened in the country during the COVID shutdown. And so there might be a little bit of a mark-on or markdown jeopardy in a window there of a few months where it's going to be a little more challenging, and I think to show the merchandise margin at these rates. And by the way, I'm talking aside from freight, which has obviously gone up everywhere. I'm talking kind of take that out of the equation. But we might have a little challenge there. However, we're so opportunistic. I have faith that we can do better than what we're probably thinking our challenges there. 
I will now let Scott talk to the margins."

I mean I think if we compare it to -- again, as we move -- I think the second quarter trying to make comparisons, and we feel good about as Ernie -- the overall merchandise margin, especially if you take freight out of the equation compared to 2 years ago. 
This third quarter last year where Ernie was comparing to '21 is really on the mark-on and the markdowns. We also had some technical issues where we had some accruals in which -- and both on markdowns and shrink, which we reversed in the back half of the year, which are not a fiscal '20 issue, but when comparing to last year or benefits that we saw last year in the back half that we won't repeat."

And we can talk about that more, but I would expect those to moderate and already can talk about them more as we move through the second quarter and back half of the year. 
I think what -- at least at the moment is stubborn, and we're still in the middle of assessing like everyone else, are freight costs. But probably compared to both last -- what we -- when we talked 3 months ago and earlier in that, the freight costs are probably going to be stubbornly high, at least for the rest of this year, as we're dealing with the same issues of driver shortages and rate increases likely to be higher than what we had originally thought. So I think that piece of it is still -- is going to be persisting. 
Having said that, we have been -- I think, as Ernie mentioned, we're doing a great job of getting the goods. Paying more for it, but we're getting goods. Our inventories are in good shape, and the buyer -- and our planning and allocation teams have been allocating those goods and doing a great job, as you can see by our sales. 
On the other hand, the wage costs have been -- there's been pressure but more -- it's still stubborn in the DCs as we've had a number of our DCs where we've had wage -- increase our wage rates. But on the positive side, both in the stores and the DCs, although we have pockets of challenges, we've been able to hire back to our staffing -- close to our staffing levels we need to staff the store, albeit at a deleverage compared to prior year. 
So again, the positive is we adjust as necessary, but we've been able to staff the stores and the distribution centers to meet the demand. So it's hard to compare with the lost sales in Europe and with the COVID costs exactly what those breakpoints would be on sales at this point."

And if I -- if there's a reason to believe that international, once it reopens and sort of gets back to normal in the future, if it goes back to -- calendar year 2019 profitability, it would suggest that actually operating income in aggregate here in the first quarter would have been up about 10% from 2 years ago. And that's even with all the COVID costs in there and all the freight inflation and the wages and everything else.
So I'm just -- it looks like the weight in the P&L here in Q1, if I look at it from a different angle, it's really coming from that international piece. And sort of everything else kind of came out in the wash and delivered pretty nice profit growth if we sort of take that out. So to me, it looks like you're probably offsetting a lot of those cost pressures. Am I correct in that assumption? And as we move through the year and those COVID costs start to come off, does that mean that actually margins could get back to and maybe above where you were sitting in calendar year 2019?"

Now to your other point, though, and Scott mentioned it, we are -- looking at the COVID costs is something we can take a hard look at here in the near future. As we move ahead each quarter and as the environment normalizes, we're going to make some improvements on those lines. So that will help.
So I hope that answered -- I -- we're -- we do believe there's sales upside all along. And another plus we have on the cost line is our average retail has been moderating. And Scott, I think, started to allude to this. As we go forward even into the back half, we're looking like it's going to moderate even more because we're seeing some more best brands goods coming in on order as we get to the third quarter, which is going to help our average ticket. And that should help our expense on processing come down a little bit. So a very good question, a lot of moving parts."

So standout categories, I'll start with the most obvious one, which is our home business is remarkably consistent, as I said in the script. I mean you're looking at 40 comps kind of what we did in the first quarter. And again, that basically was where we were in every division, even in the full family stores in a T.J. Maxx, a Marshalls up in Canada, HomeSense. So remarkable consistency. And the neat thing there is we have a lot of broad-based consistency throughout our entire home business. So whether it's big-ticket areas like -- whether it's furnitures or rugs or decorative accessories, everything was good. There wasn't really one category.
And this is where I give our teams, planning and allocation and our -- and this is not just in the home area. Our buying teams, our planning and allocation teams have been getting the goods, fueling it so that -- the second part of your question was the deceleration in home. We have really not seen it -- I don't think we're going to expect it to stay at that almost artificially high level that it did in the first quarter, but I think we have opportunity over the next quarter to stay up in the realm pretty close to that.
And we're not having a problem in the home area of stock -- staying at stock, which was the third part of your question. And we're not actually having a problem where apparel has now started to improve for us. Paul, I think you're asking what else is standing out. So we have a handful of apparel categories, which I won't give the specifics on which ones, but they are really kicking in as the quarter went on and going into the second quarter.
And the nice thing that often happens is when the weather shifts and apparel kicks in, if there was a trend line prior, usually, our home business takes more of a hit where the consumer moves off of home for a little bit. And yes, again, our home is going to continue at 40 comps, but it did not move off hardly at all. And our apparel just kicked in, and that's one reason you're seeing these outpaced comps from us really at this first quarter.
Chasing product flow of product has been a nonissue. I say it's a nonissue because the teams have really executed so well, and they're working so -- and I give logistics credit. I give really everybody involved credit to keep fuel -- it's not easy to keep fueling a 16 comp. And that's why I liked your question when you asked it because it is an unusual time for us to be running an open-only 16 comp. And I just, again, give credit to all the TJX associates that are involved in that because they're making it happen, and they have this position going into the second quarter every bit as well as we were in the first quarter.

Can you help us think what the SG&A dollars are for the year and what you think COVID costs are for the year in the budget?

And then when we add back your $0.21 to $0.24 that you pointed to, which was, I think, only for the closures, you'd be at about a 9.9% to 10.4% margin in the quarter compared to the 10.1% in first quarter 2 years ago. 
So with that as a starting point -- I know you've been asked to go through margins in a bunch of different ways. But with that as a starting point from here, it sounds like the incremental puts and takes all get sequentially better going forward, except for freight, which you said you now got visibility that it'll be tough. But as you look at 2Q, 3Q, 4Q, you see the COVID costs coming down, international reopening, some of the AUR tailwinds, some of the mix moving back towards apparel.

I think Ernie reiterated on, one, a lot of it is still will depend on the merchandise margin in terms of what the -- what our mark-on and markdown will be and the level of sales. So again, if we have outsized sales and we're able to buy better, the real wildcard is freight costs and how high they're going to be in the back half of the year.
But we didn't say that a lot of the other cost wins are going to be -- at least for now, the wage and the distribution costs, we're cycling, opening up of both a lot of our facilities. And we did a lot -- we opened 6 3PLs or just additional, what we'll call processing space last year that we're going to go against in the back half and including Lordstown, a HomeGoods distribution center.
So I don't think our supply chain/wage are going to be levering at this point based on what we know and the wildcards really being merchandise margin and freight, with COVID going down.
So I think the biggest benefit to us getting better in our overall margins will be how far does COVID get down and what's our level of sales. And if those stay high, then we would expect to go to a higher level of pretax margin."

And I think in the press release, you mentioned that you're seeing consumers begin to resume more normal activities. Can you just talk about whether the strength in the quarter that you've seen to date, how much do you think is still a tailwind from stimulus and how much is maybe just reopening consumers really just getting excited about going out and spend other things? And what the implication is for sales upside in Q2 and Q3 as you look out and the potential for sales growth rates remaining, to your point, unusually high?"

So obviously, when we looked at the first quarter -- and it's tough to measure. We can't get it all that data specifically. We do believe the stimulus checks, et cetera, were part of it and the -- clearly, a pent-up demand issue,",385,"Yes. Great question. Yes. So obviously, when we looked at the first quarter -- and it's tough to measure. We can't get it all that data specifically. We do believe the stimulus checks, et cetera, were part of it and the -- clearly, a pent-up demand issue, right, from people not having shopped. And then we have the -- something we talked about, I think it was on the last call, you do have that revenge shopping aspect that I think comes out where people are passionate and want to get out there. And we are entertaining. So pieces of that. But you have the store closure thing we talked about, which is going on all around us.
So we believe that I would say a chunk of our -- has not been just the stimulus and the -- to the best of our knowledge, we wouldn't be entering the second quarter with a similar trend, which is why we specifically, when we did the release, we put that last bullet point there, which is -- I guess is a little bit more specific than we normally would on how we start a quarter and why we wanted to say that we are entering it similarly so you would understand that the overall stimulus check thing isn't the only thing playing in and it has to be some of those other issues in our business model, store closures -- by the way, I do believe our business model now resonates more than it even did pre-COVID. 
I think consumers -- if ever they have, even more so now with all the stress of what's happened in the last year, they appreciate the treasure hunt entertainment ""me time,"" as I mentioned in the script, ""me time"". They -- I think our model and the fact that what we talked about earlier on the call, we've delivered a lot of exciting merchandise, which plays right into this time period. I think that's the vast majority of why we're getting the sales. And to your point, that's why I think there's sales upside as we look out. You know what I mean? It's not just from the different stimulus government packages that have taken place or we wouldn't be seeing what seems to be a pretty consistent trend."

But the home sales now have continued to be strong, and what's driving it is the apparel sales have gone up from the fourth quarter and as we've moved and continue to be strong -- to be a big benefit as we've moved through up until -- as we speak today.
So it's that -- so the stimulus, as Ernie said, was -- as best we confirm, was more of a March-April factor, probably waning, as best we can determine. But now it has to do with the wardrobe people -- they didn't buy a lot of apparel last year in the first and second quarter. And that's, I think, contributing to our strength right now."

And our home division has -- as I mentioned, we have over 500-plus buyers in our home division that have collaborated just beyond even what we did before. As well as we have satellite offices for not just home that are overseas that are now buying more merchandise for us than they did before.
So when you -- I feel we can continue to actually now drive an even more eclectic mix of home, which has the advantage that the consumer can buy at that day. If it's a piece of furniture, they can try it and buy it. I mean think about all the delivery issues that have taken place or -- so that's all an added plus. So in addition to the apparel thing Scott was talking about as well as some other better hot categories in the industry, such as the beauty business, we have -- I give that team a lot of credit. We've really been doing a nice job. They collaborate strongly across division. 
And again, some of the learnings that have taken place, I think we're going to have a slight bit of advantage over what we did pre-COVID and the way we're able to flex and leverage all the different divisions, merchant knowledge. So I know long winded, but that's a whole other piece that is making us feel even better about the future."

And then the good news is that at HomeGoods, almost all our stores into Marmaxx, the 90-plus percent, where our stores are in the suburban, ex-urban and rural areas, that's where our stores are located.

I'd like to start our call today by once again thanking all of our global associates for their continued hard work and dedication to TJX. We are especially grateful for their efforts over the past 18 months and for their commitment to the health and safety of our associates and customers. 
Now to an overview of our second quarter results. First, I am extremely pleased that our overall open-only comp store sales, when compared to our fiscal year 2020 or calendar year 2019, increased an outstanding 20%, which well exceeded our plans. Comp growth in home continued to be excellent, and we also saw a very strong low teens comp increase in apparel as that category continued its upward trend this quarter. 
We were particularly pleased with the strong execution we saw across each of our divisions, which all drove double-digit open-only comp sales growth versus fiscal 2020. Clearly, our branded mix and great values continue to resonate with consumers in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Australia. 
Next, overall sales were $12.1 billion, over $2 billion more than the second quarter of fiscal 2020. And overall segment profit increased more than $300 million over the same period. We are convinced that our sales growth and profit in the second quarter demonstrate that we are capturing profitable market share. We are confident that many of our loyal customers have returned to our stores and are shopping us more frequently and that we are attracting new shoppers with our marketing and exciting treasure hunt shopping experience. 
Third, I am very pleased with the sequential improvement of our pretax margin versus the first quarter. Our strong sales growth and merchandise margin increased more than offset the persistent expense headwinds we have been facing. The buying environment has been excellent, and our teams have done a terrific job sourcing the right mix of goods and getting them to our stores to satisfy the strong customer demand. 
Lastly, second quarter earnings per share of $0.64 were also well above our plans. As a reminder, this includes a negative $0.15 impact from a debt extinguishment charge and the impact from our temporary store closures. Our strong earnings per share in the second quarter were over EPS of $0.62 in fiscal 2020. 
Now I'll turn it over to Scott to cover more of our second quarter financial results in more detail."
306688,1676152163,2381534,"The TJX Companies, Inc., Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Aug 18, 2021",2021-08-18,"Earnings Calls","The TJX Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ernie, and good morning, everyone.

I'd like to echo Ernie's comments and thank all of our global associates for their hard work and continued commitment to our business. 
I'll start with some additional details of our second quarter results. As Ernie mentioned, overall open-only comp store sales increased 20% over fiscal '20, well above our plans and segment profit was very strong. In the second quarter, we continued to see an increase in our average basket across all divisions, driven by customers putting more items into their cards. Overall, average ticket was down slightly versus fiscal '20, but improved significantly compared to the first quarter, primarily due to the improved strength in apparel. 
Further, average ticket improved each month of the quarter and was up in July. Overall, customer traffic in the United States where we were open the entire quarter with minimal occupancy restrictions was up mid-single digits versus fiscal '20. 
Across each of our divisions, second quarter open-only comp store sales growth was also excellent and exceeded our plans. At Marmaxx, open-only comp store sales increased an outstanding 18% and profit dollars were up 19% versus fiscal '20. Marmaxx's home business continued its excellent performance and once again posted a comp increase in line with HomeGoods. Apparel comps were up mid-teens and improved significantly versus the first quarter. Further, sales were strong across all geographies and by age of store. 
At HomeGoods, open-only comps increased a phenomenal 36% with consistent strength across all major categories and geographic regions for HomeGoods and HomeSense. We were also very pleased with HomeGoods profit dollars, which were up 42% versus fiscal '20. As a reminder, HomeGoods margin is disproportionately impacted by freight increases due to its product mix and further pressured by supply chain costs related to its new distribution center and wages. 
When looking at our HomeGoods -- Marmaxx and HomeGoods divisions combined versus fiscal '20, total open-only comp store sales for the U.S. increased 21% and profit dollars were up 22%. 
During the second quarter, Canada, Europe and Australia each face challenges with temporary store closures and occupancy restrictions. Despite these limitations, we saw very healthy sales when we were open with TJX's Canada's second quarter open-only comp store sales, increasing 18% and TJX's international comp sales increasing 12%. 
Moving on, overall sales increased 22% over the second quarter of fiscal '20. As we detailed in our press release this morning, we estimate that sales were negatively impacted by about $300 million to $350 million due to the temporary closing of our stores for about 3% of the quarter. Pretax margin for the second quarter was 8.7%. This includes a 200 basis point negative impact due to a debt extinguishment charge and an estimated 60 basis points negative impact from the temporary store closures. Net COVID costs moderated significantly versus the first quarter and negatively impacted pretax margin by only 30 basis points in the second quarter. 
Again, we are extremely pleased with our improved pretax margin in the second quarter. Our very strong sales and excellent merchandise margin increase more than offset the 150 basis points of incremental freight expense, the substantial supply chain and wage costs and higher incentive compensation accruals. 
Moving to the bottom line. Second quarter earnings per share were $0.64 and well above our plans. Second quarter EPS includes a $0.15 negative impact due to the debt extinguishment charge and an estimated $0.05 to $0.07 negative impact from the temporary store closures. Again, EPS in the second quarter of fiscal '20 was $0.62 per share. 
As for balance sheet inventory, it was down 3% on a constant currency basis versus the second quarter of fiscal '20. Store inventories were down, but essentially where we want them to be. In our distribution and centers, inventory was lower as we have less packaway and more goods on order and in-transit. Our bars are doing a great job sourcing merchandise and have been able to chase the goods we need to satisfy the current strong consumer demand. To reiterate, the availability of merchandise is excellent. 
Moving on to our cash flow and liquidity. During the second quarter, we generated $1.4 billion in operating cash flow and ended the quarter with $7.1 billion in cash. In June, we completed the make-whole calls for $2 billion of principal outstanding notes which resulted in a pretax debt extinguishment charge of $242 million. As a result of these actions, we have reduced our outstanding debt by $2.75 billion this year and lowered our annual interest expense by over $90 million. 
As for the shareholder distributions, in the second quarter, we returned $614 million to shareholders through our buyback and dividend programs. For the full year, we have increased our stock buyback by $250 million and now expect to repurchase $1.25 billion to $1.5 billion of TJX stock. 
Now I will turn it back to Ernie."

Looking ahead, I'd like to highlight the opportunities that we believe will allow us to drive sales and traffic in the second half of the year.

Looking ahead, I'd like to highlight the opportunities that we believe will allow us to drive sales and traffic in the second half of the year. First, we are convinced that our relentless focus on value is a tremendous advantage. In an inflationary environment, we believe even more consumers will be seeking out value. We are confident that our value position will be a very attractive option for consumers looking to stretch their dollars without sacrificing on quality and brands. 
Second, we are excited about our store and online merchandising plans for the back half of the year, especially the back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons. The marketplace is loaded with a great selection of apparel and home merchandise across good, better and best brands. We have enormous confidence that our teams will execute on these initiatives to bring consumers the right brands and fashions at the right values every day. 
Next, we are planning exciting marketing campaigns for television and digital media for the fall and holiday season. We believe these campaigns will help us continue to attract new shoppers and stay top-of-mind with our existing customers. Each of our divisions will showcase our differentiated shopping experience by reinforcing our value leadership while also highlighting discovery, fashion and quality. 
Further, in an ever-evolving media landscape, we continue to learn and adapt to new digital outlets so that we can broaden our consumer reach and ensure we are connecting with shoppers on the platforms where they are spending their time. Additionally, our research tells us that, overall, our marketing campaigns and great assortment of values continue to attract new shoppers of all ages into our stores, including an outsized number of Gen Z and millennial shoppers. We are also encouraged by our strong overall customer satisfaction scores. 
Lastly, while most of our European and Canadian stores were open in the second quarter, many of them were still operating with stringent COVID-related occupancy restrictions. Many of these restrictions have eased, and assuming this trend continues, we expect overall sales and customer traffic to improve in the second half of the year in these regions. Further, with a significant number of permanent retail closures in these geographies over the last 18 months, we see a great opportunity to capture a bigger share of consumers' wallets going forward. 
As to e-commerce, we continue to be pleased with the sales at our U.S. and U.K. online businesses. We are excited to launch e-commerce on homegoods.com in the third quarter. We believe this is something our existing customers have been waiting for and is another way for us to attract new shoppers. Similar to our other online businesses, homegoods.com will be complementary to our physical stores and allow customers to shop our great values 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 
Beyond this year, we are convinced that we are set up extremely well to significantly grow our market share and improve our profitability. Let me take a moment and share the characteristics of our business that we believe will continue to draw consumers to our retail banners going forward. 
First, we are confident that the appeal of our treasure hunt shopping experience will continue to resonate with consumers. Our merchandise assortments are constantly changing, so there's always something new to surprise, excite and inspire shoppers in our stores and online. Further, we offer great value every day. So our customers know they are getting excellent deals every time they visit, and they don't have to think about coupons or promotions. 
Second, we believe our stores offer consumers a much more eclectic assortment of merchandise versus traditional department and specialty stores. Our more than 1,100 global buyers are in the marketplace every week sourcing fresh, exciting merchandise from a universe of about 21,000 vendors around the world. Our planning and allocation teams curate these goods to create a differentiated store-by-store mix that we believe no one else's offering. 
Next, we locate our stores in convenient, easy-to-access locations to make it easy for shoppers to visit our stores in a timely and efficient way. For example, in the U.S., we estimate that we have a T.J. Maxx or a Marshalls store within 10 miles of approximately 80% of the population. Our retail banners are located across urban, suburban and rural markets, which allows us to reach consumers across a very wide customer demographic. 
Lastly, the flexibility of our business model allows us to adjust our buying, store formats and distribution to take advantage of hot categories and brands and adapt to changing consumer preferences. In terms of profitability, I want to emphasize that we are highly focused on improving our pretax margin profile next year and beyond. Clearly, our ability to keep gaining market share and drive outsized sales is our best opportunity. 
In addition, we feel great about the opportunities we are pursuing that we believe will help offset the margin pressures that we have seen over the last several years. One of these is to surgically look for opportunities to adjust retails in select areas, while maintaining our great values to our shoppers, just as we have throughout our history. Scott will discuss this in more detail in a moment. 
Now I would like to share some information about corporate responsibility at TJX. For our nearly 45-year history, our mission has been consistent to deliver great value every day. And similarly, since the very beginning, we have also committed to acting as a responsible corporate citizen. 
Throughout the pandemic, the health and safety of our associates and our customers has been a top priority and remains so today. Simultaneously, over the past 1.5 years, important issues like equity and racial justice and climate change have become even more critical. To be clear, these are areas that we have been committed to for many years and are proud of the actions we have taken recently to make additional progress. 
Let me share a few key points on these. In terms of equity and racial justice for our 45-year history, we have been committed to making TJX an inclusive workplace. In June, we shared with our associates and on tjx.com the most recent steps that we are taking to help us become a more inclusive and diverse organization at all levels. These efforts include initiatives related to recruitment practices, associate education, training and development and an expanded focus on our process and programs to support an inclusive work environment. We know we have work to do and are committed to improving in this important area. 
As to the increasing importance of environmental sustainability, we have made progress working towards the goal we set last June for a science-based greenhouse gas emissions target mapped to the Paris Climate Agreement 1.5-degree Celsius guidelines. In the coming weeks, we will make our annual update to the environmental sustainability portion of tjx.com, including information about our climate and energy strategy, along with waste and chemicals management. 
These are just a few of our initiatives. We recognize there is an increasing interest in our efforts related to environmental, social and governance, or ESG practices, and we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. Our commitment to corporate responsibility is as important as ever. And as always, there is a lot of information on tjx.com. 
In closing, I want to again thank each of our associates around the globe who stepped up to support the business and helped us achieve outstanding second quarter results. I could not be prouder of the collective efforts of our associates over the past 18 months and their commitment to working as one TJX throughout this health crisis. 
I am extremely pleased with our excellent top and bottom line performance in the second quarter, and I'm optimistic on the remainder of the year. As an op price leader in every country we operate in, I am convinced that TJX is set up extremely well to gain market share for many years to come. I am confident that our sales and traffic initiatives as well as our global store growth plans, will draw even more shoppers to our retail banners. 
In terms of the bottom line, we are very confident in the opportunities we see to drive higher profit margins beyond this year. I truly believe the characteristics of our off-price business model will continue to be a winning retail formula and that TJX is on its way to becoming a $60 billion-plus revenue company. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Scott for a few additional comments, and then we'll open it up for questions."

In terms of the third quarter, we are very pleased that overall open-only comp store sales trends are up very strongly to start the quarter at the mid-teens level. This is despite what we believe is a negative sales impact from the Delta variant that we've seen since the last week of July. Currently, all of our stores in the U.S., Canada and Europe are open and approximately, 40 of our Australian stores are closed. While we are not planning for overall store closures in the third quarter to be significant, sales could also be negatively impacted if new COVID-related regulations are put in place. 
As we mentioned in the press release, due to continued uncertainty with COVID, we are not providing guidance for the third quarter or the second half of the year today. 
Lastly, I want to pick up on Ernie's point about improving our margin profile next year and beyond as we pursue opportunities, both on the macro level and within our business. First, while we expect the combination of freight, supply chain and wage costs to be higher in the back half of the year, we do not envision freight and wage -- we do envision freight and wage beginning to moderate as we move through next year. 
Second, to the extent we can drive outsized comps, that is the easiest way for us to improve our margin going forward. Further, we will remain focused on continuing to buy even better and opening more vendors. Also, we are seeing a less promotional environment and rising inflation as well as stronger sales in our apparel categories. 
We see all of these factors as opportunities for higher retails. At the same time, we remain laser-focused on continuing to offer consumers great values, just as we have throughout our 45-year history. 
In closing, we feel great about the strength of the business, both operationally and financially, and we are confident that we are capturing market share. We are extremely pleased to be in a strong financial position to make important investments in our business and return significant value to our shareholders through both our share buyback and dividend programs. 
Now we're happy to take your questions. As we do every quarter, we're going to ask that you please limit your questions to 1 per person and 1 part to each question. We respectfully ask that everyone stick with this request both to keep the call on schedule and so that we can answer questions from as many analysts as we can. Thanks, and now we'll open it up for questions."

We believe perhaps there might be a little bit more opportunity that we're seeing in the home area. But we are, in effect, talking about all of the banners. We also have seen that we started a big change from the first quarter when we had talked about this is we want to more wait and see what happens around us. And as you would have expected, with the inflation of the cost pressures that I think all the other retailers are receiving, we're observing that there is less promotion as well as more pockets than we saw a quarter ago in terms of ability to raise retail surgically and selectively in certain areas of the store. 
And again, that applies not just in the home area. Even though I think the home area is disproportionately a place where we'll do more of that. We also think that the freight that has hit everybody, by the way, has created freight and wage, which we all knew this could be an unusual time to see this opportunity. First quarter, again, when we talked about this, we were going to be looking hard at it. We have just seen the ability to do that more than we were thinking we could do before. And I'm sorry, the second -- what was your second part of the question?"

It's a little like we used to talk to on our average ticket, and we'd say our ticket was down or whatever. Although that's been moderating in a nice direction and we're feeling good about that upside as we move forward. But our buyers drive where the retail adjustment opportunities are. It is not top-down-driven as far as what items we do that on. 
So the first mission, as always, and again, in the script, I mentioned this a couple of times as we've done in our 40-plus year history, we're always making sure our retail adjustment is providing still a tremendous gap and value for us versus the out the door retails of competition. So buyers do not do that unless we are still showing a great value. 
So if it wasn't for the fact that the retails around us are up a little bit or less promotional, we wouldn't be able to do what we're doing there to the degree that we think we can do it. And by the way, to the degree which we think we'll be able to do it going forward. We also feel the -- another cost pressure we have been dealing with for the last handful of years was the ticket lowering. And in this environment, what we're starting to see now is that moderating. 
So again, what Scott and I have looked at it with the teams, as we look at next year, really, as we get to fourth quarter into next year, I think we really start seeing these -- really start seeing more opportunity to do more of what we just talked about because we have just started this mission. I think we are in a great position to surgically look at the way we're retailing goods really throughout the whole corporation over the next couple of years. And I think that's going to bode well for us. But great questions."

So Matt, I will go first and then Scott will back clean up, as they say. And the market -- you saw market share, man. We see it on a lot of fronts.

And the market -- you saw market share, man. We see it on a lot of fronts. So clearly, the most obvious one is the home area, which we've talked about and in the script, we're -- truly phenomenal results in our home area. Yes. We see that as a continued strength in that we are so differentiated. You know this. Our home area is very fashion-driven, extremely fast-turning. It's eclectic with great value, great brands, all the different categories in the world you would want. And it's probably our most impulsive-oriented right form of shopping banner that we have. 
So when a customer walks in, and let's talk -- we didn't talk much about it earlier in the script about the entertainment treasure hunt value in HomeGoods. It is off the charts, as we know, which is why we are having these just amazing outsized comps there. And just so you know, the home business throughout the corporation and the full family stores, so whether that's in Maxx or Marshalls, the same thing applies. Our home business is there are just as healthy. 
And when we look at international, also very healthy. So I would say the #1 market share thing will continue to be home. However, as we mentioned on the call, our apparel and some other areas of the store, which I don't want to put out there specifically right now, has been extremely healthy across men's, ladies, kids. And as those start to kick in, as you know, in our business, that helps us with our average ticket, but it also helps us, I think, with continued market share gain because based on a lot of store closures around us, a lot of them were granted apparel retailers where certain boxes have closed. 
And I think this presents an unusual opportunity for us to continue to gain more market share because of our branded content being really second to none, I think, in terms of also doing good, better and best which is another advantage we have when you look at some of our competition. They tend to be a little narrower in their scope of goods. They don't trade up as quite as high. And I think that range for us will allow us to continue to gain. That's why I'm so excited about it. 
Before I hand it over to Scott, the other thing I would like to say is on the margins that -- what we're seeing here is another plus is all of these areas, just like Lorraine had asked me, are presenting opportunities for us to either raise our ticket in total or adjust our retail surgically on select amount of goods and doing it in the right way, but I think that's going to kind of play out as we move forward next year. 
And it does allow us a goal. You were asking Scott about the margins overall internationally, et cetera. But we're feeling pretty bullish about really starting to get back to those double-digit margins as we look out to next year, are getting very close. And I'm sure Scott will -- and I'm talking in total, but I'm sure he will get into more of that international that you asked about."

So I think we wouldn't be looking for any one division to get better. We're really looking for all divisions to get better in getting -- not necessarily -- it's not -- I think, as Ernie said, it's going to be a pace. We have to see what -- we want to make sure we're doing this prudently and do it right. But it would be over the course of time. 
I think the first thing is we get up to those double digits is once we get there and go beyond, is that we would be looked -- and I think it's mostly going to be through a strong merchandise margin, offsetting a lot of the cost pressures. But I think Ernie alluded to the higher average retail or the moderation in retail, I think, then resulting in a higher average retail will some of those expenses will moderate on the store and distribution and freight line as we get a higher average retail. 
And to be determined on the pace of that, but it could be 2/3 merchandise margin, 1/3 on the expenses because you do get a significant benefit. But a lot of that will be the pace, and we'll have to see as we move through the fourth quarter into next year as we start buying and get this benefit, that's when we would expect more of it to happen as next year. 
I think the other point that Ernie was making is that once we get to those levels, the first point is get to a point where our -- we can leverage on a -- we'd be flat or better on a low -- the 3, 4 type of comp. And that's what our expectations would be in the longer-term of getting to that level. Once we get to that, then I think we'll be talking about higher overall pretax levels. 
But first, as you know, for many, many years, we've been delevering slightly on some strong comps. And I think now would be how do we get to a point, and we feel confident that we can do it, that we can stop that bleeding but on a low- to mid-single comp."

Let me unpack Q2 a little better because it's not straight. As you know, there's a lot of noise quarter-to-quarter and some -- there are things that are different quarter-to-quarter. When you just look at the surface on our 28% overall growth in SG&A",389,"Yes. Let me unpack Q2 a little better because it's not straight. As you know, there's a lot of noise quarter-to-quarter and some -- there are things that are different quarter-to-quarter. When you just look at the surface on our 28% overall growth in SG&A compared to the 23%, you'd say on the surface, not that great and accounting for that deleverage of the 70 basis points. 
But if you if you exclude and you look at it on a per-store basis, just the COVID cost, which we don't believe will be hopefully around next year, we had approximately a 21% per store growth and about 19% after stripping out COVID growth. So leveraged a bit there. There was one line item that we don't think will be as -- it was more of a catch-up due to the strong sale growth over our own plans in profit, both in the first and second quarter, made us do a bit of a catch-up on a lot of line items on the incentive accruals. It's a bit just the way when things are either lower than plan or underwater and then all of a sudden the catch-up, we had a bit of that. 
When you strip out the incentive accruals this quarter, we had approximately a 6% growth per store on a 10% comp growth when you look at it over 2 years. Remember, a lot of these are over a 2- year period. So I would say that we felt pretty good. And when you look to the third quarter, although not giving guidance, that incentive accruals will be -- there'll be some of it, but much, much, much less. And so the level of deleverage, if there is deleverage, will be less than what it is this quarter. 
So when you strip out just 2 line items, which we don't think are comparable and not necessarily go-forward, we feel pretty good about that. In terms of long term going forward, a little hard to say. That will depend on the level of sales and the level of what Ernie said on the growth on the average ticket. So too early to call, but don't see anything in the SG&A that's unusual other than the same level of minimum wage growth that we would expect to see going forward."

So we had the -- we had other delevers in terms of supply chain and wage as well. And then obviously, we called out the impact from the store closures. So the 150 was just freight. And that's a combination of both freight, which is inbound and outbound, but also our ocean freight. 
Ocean freight is probably the bigger sticky one for at least the near term. The rates increases have, as you know, have been up on both intermodal and on trucking and the ocean freight, and that's why we talked and put in, we believe, the costs are still going up higher in the back half as ocean freight rates have, in some cases, gone up 200%, which we would expect in the third and fourth quarter. We don't think this level of freight deleverage, which will be more than that 150, at least what we're seeing now, will be at the sustained levels. If they are, that means the sales levels are going to continue because that means there's a tremendous demand. 
So we would expect those to moderate to some degree and hopefully a lot as we move through next year. So on top of the 150, we had deleverage from wage. We also had the bonus accruals, which was a substantial amount and some supply chain. Again, the strong leverage on the 20 comp and the strong merchandise margin more than offset all that."

So I think I'll go first, and then Scott will come back to you on the merchandise margin. So longer term, also a great question, Paul, because we're looking at this all the time in terms of the growth because, obviously, we have a higher growth opportunity international as a growth rate, not necessarily in dollars. But we are -- as you could see from the results, very pleased with our open-only results in Canada. Europe, Australia has been absolutely terrific. 
So we are also looking -- we didn't get into it on that question a couple of minutes ago, but we are looking at making some positive margin improvements in those divisions also over the next 18 months. We feel there's opportunity there. Regardless of what happens with exchange rates, we would love to see the exchange rate obviously going in the right direction since we buy so much in U.S. dollars, specifically for Canada and Europe. But regardless of that, we're feeling very bullish on the market share opportunities. 
Many store closures, Paul, in the U.K. and in Canada continue -- and Canada is one of our most dominant market shares that we're already in. We have a higher market share there than we even do in the states. So very bullish. I think more opportunity in terms of pure growth rate in Europe in terms of new stores, I think you mentioned new store opportunity. So what we did there, and you've seen the cycle, as when things got more challenging there in terms of Brexit, margin, exchange rate and then what was going on obviously with COVID, we pulled back on store openings there, but now we are relooking at that and ramping it up to a more of a selectively, obviously, because we have to look at the right sites that make sense for us in the different countries, such as in Germany, where we've still had a tremendous amount of new store opportunities and still do. 
So we're pretty bullish on that. And obviously, Poland and Austria and Netherlands all have performed well. So pretty bullish on margins and sales overseas improving. One thing I would like to mention, it ties in with the new stores there as well as here, is overall we are pretty -- we have a remodel program, which we moderated recently during COVID, but now that as we can see how strong we're coming out of this and how well we're starting to -- so good about leveraging going forward. Scott and I have been looking at really ramping up our remodel program and all the divisions to continue with this market share. 
That would apply to -- that would apply to Europe in Canada. And not as much Australia because those are all relatively new. HomeGoods and Marmaxx specifically because we're capturing all these new customers along with existing customers and one of the best ways to invest cash and the use of our cash is to invest in the business, and we feel remodels, given what's going on for us right now, are a great return on investment in terms of maintaining our new customer shopper. 
So I know you didn't kind of ask about that, but it does relate to, I think, our international opportunities as well. And I'll turn it back to Scott as far as the merchandise margin."

We are up over -- we are up 70 basis points after including that freight. So approximately 220 basis points up prior to freight. Could be really broken down half between markdowns and mark-on. Again, the markdowns was a function -- some of it was -- we had a little over accrual in some of our European business on -- when we were closed, but just strong markdown performance across the board. 
And then mark-on, again, was very strong as well. So again, that's very pleased with that similar type of performance we had in the first quarter on that as well. The one thing we would say is that freight line feels to be pressured as we -- at least move through the third and fourth quarter."

As you know, our -- boy, some of our most passionate customers. I think you and I have talked about this in the past, right, our HomeGoods customers are so passionate. So with that, there is a little tweak in the strategy. And I think we've talked about this briefly, but you're asking for a little bit more color, which I'm happy to provide here. 
It is a little different in the approach than Marmaxx is for a couple of reasons. And I think I'm going to answer both of your questions at the same time because your second part of the question was, is there any opportunity to have it be a little more connected. And so we would say, yes. And so as opposed to having a different buying organization completely, which is we have at Maxx and Marshalls, HomeGoods, as you know, is our fastest turning most eclectic business that we have out there. So by by a natural nature of the beast, even our HomeGoods stores tend to vary more from store to store, they turn so fast and there are so many SKUs. 
So we've approached the HomeGoods online business to try to get the best of both worlds. So we have we're really leveraging actually our merchant organization in HomeGoods, and we are really peeling off goods from our HomeGoods inventories and using that to create the site and the eventual shipping, but really using our merchants and our planning organizations are more joined together in HomeGoods than they are in Marmaxx. And the way we're buying we have more point people at HomeGoods, but we're really buying the similar mix, which is I think what you were asking about. 
So the other benefit is when you want to get multiple purchases as you know, we tend to ship some things not in complete sets. We ship a set. But when they're in the store, the customer could buy 2 of something and leave 2 chairs, et cetera. This is where our homegoods.com business should be extremely complementary because it allows a customer to be more connected like you were asking. So if somebody sees something in the store and online, they can almost execute a buy complementary where it all kind of goes together. So you could really outfit a room or a whole look a little easier by kind of supplementing your in-store purchases with your online purchases with HomeGoods. 
And that's why it's been a bit of a different strategy on the way we're buying it, which, by the way, should leverage profit for us faster. We don't have as much overhead as we do in the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls online as we do there. This is much leaner setup. And we are currently playing with a shipping strategy on how we're going to ask the customer to pay for shipping. That might be a little different, but I won't get into that here. 
It's just what you need to know is it -- we believe it's really set up to supplement in a very conducive way where we should get multiple purchases and it shouldn't actually help our store and online at the same time. So a great question, the way you asked it because it is going to be executed differently. Now I will have Scott."

First, it was a it wasn't necessarily due -- you're right. We do have stores closed in Australia. It wasn't -- that really wasn't the -- really what our comment was about that we put in the release in the script. It was more that we pretty much in the U.S. and in Canada, we had seen a slowdown. I used the word because the sales are still very strong and they're strong both in apparel and in-home versus -- as we moved into the last week of July and the first 2 weeks of of August. The basket has remained strong. Our traffic is still up. 
But the other thing I also would say is that as a reminder, the Q3 of FY '20 that we're reporting and going against also had a higher comp, both in the overall third quarter than the second quarter and also was higher in the beginning of the third quarter as well. So that's probably a piece of it when you look at it on a 2-year stack."

Obviously, we didn't specifically say, but we certainly have a lot on order and talk about our ability to -- availability has been great. 
The inventory position, like we said, compared to 2 years ago, we have less store inventory. Structurally, the way the stores from a shopability and all that, we have less fixtures and all that. So approximately 10% is just due at the store level due to that. So we have -- we're turning faster, almost 1 turn faster both in the first and second quarter due to having the lower inventory, and it's paid dividends in terms of the markdown. So we feel good about that. 
And the other thing is part of it, which is hard to -- we have less packaway inventory. So that's a bit of the piece of it in our DCs. And the last thing is, particularly in the first quarter and in the second quarter, the trends, we were buying to better trends. Clearly, we saw the home trends were up, but the apparel trends have gone also up. And so we're chasing more than we typically would have been compared to 2 years ago."

And when I say that the buyers, our logistics teams, our distribution services teams, the stores getting the goods out. So what we've done here is every functional areas had to really execute a little differently and it varies by category, but I'm very proud of all of them because they've been as you alluded to, it's been -- it's a strange market out there, and the inventories at points in times have been up and down. 
But a couple of things that have been happening. The buyers when -- if they're in a category when things were a little light, they've been pulling the trigger a little sooner in buying with longer lead times than we typically would. Versus as there are out there, there are many categories that are extremely loaded, and they'll buy it even closer hand to mouth. So I really give them a lot of credit. 
The logistics teams have been securing the freight capacity, we need to get the goods to our DCs and stores to meet our strong demand, and we're paying more when we need to do. So as always, and I know we've talked to you and others about this, we do that because we think we will figure out -- as witnessed by what we're talking about today, we'll figure out later how to offset the cost, but we want to continue to gain the market share and gain customers for the future. Again, the best thing for our business for the next couple of years is to continue to grab this outpaced market share -- market share opportunity that we're on right now. 
Here's the ironic thing. I believe the disruption in the supply chain is going to create a future buying opportunity for us. So when you look out at the end of this year, here's what I think. So we've talked about these margin opportunities for next year, but what we haven't factored in because those are really more based on retail adjustments, average ticket going up. What we're not factoring in is if the supply chain continues to be choppy, which it has been. 
We will be -- this is going to be classic off-price textbook execution where there will be more uneasiness out there, which in my eyes, typically creates even more opportunity, buying opportunities. So in that case, we probably get the buy goods a little bit better. So then you're getting it out of the cost and helping your merchandise margin on the other side. So I'm just kind of pretty excited about what's going on right now, but I'm glad you asked that because it really is -- there's a lot going on on that front right now in terms of inventory and supply chain, et cetera."

I'd like to start our call today by once again thanking all of our global associates for their continued hard work and dedication to TJX. We are especially grateful for their efforts over the past 18 months and for their commitment to the health and safety of our associates and customers. 
Now to an overview of our second quarter results. First, I am extremely pleased that our overall open-only comp store sales, when compared to our fiscal year 2020 or calendar year 2019, increased an outstanding 20%, which well exceeded our plans. Comp growth in home continued to be excellent, and we also saw a very strong low teens comp increase in apparel as that category continued its upward trend this quarter. 
We were particularly pleased with the strong execution we saw across each of our divisions, which all drove double-digit, open-only comp sales growth versus fiscal 2020. Clearly, our branded mix and great values continue to resonate with consumers in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Australia. 
Next, overall sales were $12.1 billion, over $2 billion more than the second quarter of fiscal 2020. And overall segment profit increased more than $300 million over the same period. We are convinced that our sales growth and profit in the second quarter demonstrate that we are capturing profitable market share. We are confident that many of our loyal customers have returned to our stores and are shopping us more frequently and that we are attracting new shoppers with our marketing and exciting treasure hunt shopping experience. 
Third, I am very pleased with the sequential improvement of our pretax margin versus the first quarter. Our strong sales growth and merchandise margin increased more than offset the persistent expense headwinds we have been facing. The buying environment has been excellent, and our teams have done a terrific job sourcing the right mix of goods and getting them to our stores to satisfy the strong customer demand. 
Lastly, second quarter earnings per share of $0.64 were also well above our plans. As a reminder, this includes a negative $0.15 impact from a debt extinguishment charge and the impact from our temporary store closures. Our strong earnings per share in the second quarter were over EPS of $0.62 in fiscal 2020. 
Now I'll turn it over to Scott to cover more of our second quarter financial results in more detail."
306688,1676152163,2381568,"The TJX Companies, Inc., Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Aug 18, 2021",2021-08-18,"Earnings Calls","The TJX Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ernie, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to echo Ernie's comments and thank all of our global associates for their hard work and continued commitment to our business.

I'd like to echo Ernie's comments and thank all of our global associates for their hard work and continued commitment to our business. 
I'll start with some additional details of our second quarter results. As Ernie mentioned, overall open-only comp store sales increased 20% over fiscal '20, well above our plans and segment profit was very strong. In the second quarter, we continued to see an increase in our average basket across all divisions, driven by customers putting more items into their carts. Overall, average ticket was down slightly versus fiscal '20, but improved significantly compared to the first quarter, primarily due to the improved strength in apparel. 
Further, average ticket improved each month of the quarter and was up in July. Overall, customer traffic in the United States, where we were open the entire quarter with minimal occupancy restrictions, was up mid-single digits versus fiscal '20. 
Across each of our divisions, second quarter open-only comp store sales growth was also excellent and exceeded our plans. At Marmaxx, open-only comp store sales increased an outstanding 18% and profit dollars were up 19% versus fiscal '20. Marmaxx's home business continued its excellent performance and once again posted a comp increase in line with HomeGoods. Apparel comps were up mid-teens and improved significantly versus the first quarter. Further, sales were strong across all geographies and by age of store. 
At HomeGoods, open-only comps increased a phenomenal 36% with consistent strength across all major categories and geographic regions for HomeGoods and HomeSense. We were also very pleased with HomeGoods profit dollars, which were up 42% versus fiscal '20. As a reminder, HomeGoods margin is disproportionately impacted by freight increases due to its product mix and further pressured by supply chain costs related to its new distribution center and wages. 
When looking at our HomeGoods -- Marmaxx and HomeGoods divisions combined versus fiscal '20, total open-only comp store sales for the U.S. increased 21% and profit dollars were up 22%. 
During the second quarter, Canada, Europe and Australia each face challenges with temporary store closures and occupancy restrictions. Despite these limitations, we saw very healthy sales when we were open with TJX's Canada's second quarter open-only comp store sales, increasing 18% and TJX's international comp sales increasing 12%. 
Moving on, overall sales increased 22% over the second quarter of fiscal '20. As we detailed in our press release this morning, we estimate that sales were negatively impacted by about $300 million to $350 million due to the temporary closing of our stores for about 3% of the quarter. Pretax margin for the second quarter was 8.7%. This includes a 200 basis point negative impact due to a debt extinguishment charge and an estimated 60 basis points negative impact from the temporary store closures. Net COVID costs moderated significantly versus the first quarter and negatively impacted pretax margin by only 30 basis points in the second quarter. 
Again, we are extremely pleased with our improved pretax margin in the second quarter. Our very strong sales and excellent merchandise margin increase more than offset the 150 basis points of incremental freight expense, the substantial supply chain and wage costs and higher incentive compensation accruals. 
Moving to the bottom line. Second quarter earnings per share were $0.64 and well above our plans. Second quarter EPS includes a $0.15 negative impact due to the debt extinguishment charge and an estimated $0.05 to $0.07 negative impact from the temporary store closures. Again, EPS in the second quarter of fiscal '20 was $0.62 per share. 
As for balance sheet inventory, it was down 3% on a constant currency basis versus the second quarter of fiscal '20. Store inventories were down, but essentially where we want them to be. In our distribution and centers, inventory was lower as we have less packaway and more goods on order and in-transit. Our bars are doing a great job sourcing merchandise and have been able to chase the goods we need to satisfy the current strong consumer demand. To reiterate, the availability of merchandise is excellent. 
Moving on to our cash flow and liquidity. During the second quarter, we generated $1.4 billion in operating cash flow and ended the quarter with $7.1 billion in cash. In June, we completed the make-whole calls for $2 billion of principal outstanding notes which resulted in a pretax debt extinguishment charge of $242 million. As a result of these actions, we have reduced our outstanding debt by $2.75 billion this year and lowered our annual interest expense by over $90 million. 
As for the shareholder distributions, in the second quarter, we returned $614 million to shareholders through our buyback and dividend programs. For the full year, we have increased our stock buyback by $250 million and now expect to repurchase $1.25 billion to $1.5 billion of TJX stock. 
Now I will turn it back to Ernie."
306688,1676152163,2381568,"The TJX Companies, Inc., Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Aug 18, 2021",2021-08-18,"Earnings Calls","The TJX Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Scott. Looking ahead, I'd like to highlight the opportunities that we believe will allow us to drive sales and traffic in the second half of the year.

Looking ahead, I'd like to highlight the opportunities that we believe will allow us to drive sales and traffic in the second half of the year. First, we are convinced that our relentless focus on value is a tremendous advantage. In an inflationary environment, we believe even more consumers will be seeking out value. We are confident that our value position will be a very attractive option for consumers looking to stretch their dollars without sacrificing on quality and brands. 
Second, we are excited about our store and online merchandising plans for the back half of the year, especially the back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons. The marketplace is loaded with a great selection of apparel and home merchandise across good, better and best brands. We have enormous confidence that our teams will execute on these initiatives to bring consumers the right brands and fashions at the right values every day. 
Next, we are planning exciting marketing campaigns for television and digital media for the fall and holiday season. We believe these campaigns will help us continue to attract new shoppers and stay top-of-mind with our existing customers. Each of our divisions will showcase our differentiated shopping experience by reinforcing our value leadership while also highlighting discovery, fashion and quality. 
Further, in an ever-evolving media landscape, we continue to learn and adapt to new digital outlets so that we can broaden our consumer reach and ensure we are connecting with shoppers on the platforms where they are spending their time. Additionally, our research tells us that, overall, our marketing campaigns and great assortment of values continue to attract new shoppers of all ages into our stores, including an outsized number of Gen Z and millennial shoppers. We are also encouraged by our strong overall customer satisfaction scores. 
Lastly, while most of our European and Canadian stores were open in the second quarter, many of them were still operating with stringent COVID-related occupancy restrictions. Many of these restrictions have eased, and assuming this trend continues, we expect overall sales and customer traffic to improve in the second half of the year in these regions. Further, with a significant number of permanent retail closures in these geographies over the last 18 months, we see a great opportunity to capture a bigger share of consumers' wallets going forward. 
As to e-commerce, we continue to be pleased with the sales at our U.S. and U.K. online businesses. We are excited to launch e-commerce on homegoods.com in the third quarter. We believe this is something our existing customers have been waiting for and is another way for us to attract new shoppers. Similar to our other online businesses, homegoods.com will be complementary to our physical stores and allow customers to shop our great values 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 
Beyond this year, we are convinced that we are set up extremely well to significantly grow our market share and improve our profitability. Let me take a moment and share the characteristics of our business that we believe will continue to draw consumers to our retail banners going forward. 
First, we are confident that the appeal of our treasure hunt shopping experience will continue to resonate with consumers. Our merchandise assortments are constantly changing, so there's always something new to surprise, excite and inspire shoppers in our stores and online. Further, we offer great value every day. So our customers know they are getting excellent deals every time they visit, and they don't have to think about coupons or promotions. 
Second, we believe our stores offer consumers a much more eclectic assortment of merchandise versus traditional department and specialty stores. Our more than 1,100 global buyers are in the marketplace every week sourcing fresh, exciting merchandise from a universe of about 21,000 vendors around the world. Our planning and allocation teams curate these goods to create a differentiated store-by-store mix that we believe no one else is offering. 
Next, we locate our stores in convenient, easy-to-access locations to make it easy for shoppers to visit our stores in a timely and efficient way. For example, in the U.S., we estimate that we have a T.J. Maxx or a Marshalls store within 10 miles of approximately 80% of the population. Our retail banners are located across urban, suburban and rural markets, which allows us to reach consumers across a very wide customer demographic. 
Lastly, the flexibility of our business model allows us to adjust our buying, store formats and distribution to take advantage of hot categories and brands and adapt to changing consumer preferences. In terms of profitability, I want to emphasize that we are highly focused on improving our pretax margin profile next year and beyond. Clearly, our ability to keep gaining market share and drive outsized sales is our best opportunity. 
In addition, we feel great about the opportunities we are pursuing that we believe will help offset the margin pressures that we have seen over the last several years. One of these is to surgically look for opportunities to adjust retails in select areas, while maintaining our great values to our shoppers, just as we have throughout our history. Scott will discuss this in more detail in a moment. 
Now I would like to share some information about corporate responsibility at TJX. For our nearly 45-year history, our mission has been consistent to deliver great value every day. And similarly, since the very beginning, we have also committed to acting as a responsible corporate citizen. 
Throughout the pandemic, the health and safety of our associates and our customers has been a top priority and remains so today. Simultaneously, over the past 1.5 years, important issues like equity and racial justice and climate change have become even more critical. To be clear, these are areas that we have been committed to for many years and are proud of the actions we have taken recently to make additional progress. 
Let me share a few key points on these. In terms of equity and racial justice for our 45-year history, we have been committed to making TJX an inclusive workplace. In June, we shared with our associates and on tjx.com the most recent steps that we are taking to help us become a more inclusive and diverse organization at all levels. These efforts include initiatives related to recruitment practices, associate education, training and development and an expanded focus on our process and programs to support an inclusive work environment. We know we have work to do and are committed to improving in this important area. 
As to the increasing importance of environmental sustainability, we have made progress working towards the goal we set last June for a science-based greenhouse gas emissions target mapped to the Paris Climate Agreement 1.5-degree Celsius guidelines. In the coming weeks, we will make our annual update to the environmental sustainability portion of tjx.com, including information about our climate and energy strategy, along with waste and chemicals management. 
These are just a few of our initiatives. We recognize there is an increasing interest in our efforts related to environmental, social and governance, or ESG practices, and we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. Our commitment to corporate responsibility is as important as ever. And as always, there is a lot of information on tjx.com. 
In closing, I want to again thank each of our associates around the globe who stepped up to support the business and helped us achieve outstanding second quarter results. I could not be prouder of the collective efforts of our associates over the past 18 months and their commitment to working as one TJX throughout this health crisis. 
I am extremely pleased with our excellent top and bottom line performance in the second quarter, and I'm optimistic on the remainder of the year. As an op price leader in every country we operate in, I am convinced that TJX is set up extremely well to gain market share for many years to come. I am confident that our sales and traffic initiatives as well as our global store growth plans, will draw even more shoppers to our retail banners. 
In terms of the bottom line, we are very confident in the opportunities we see to drive higher profit margins beyond this year. I truly believe the characteristics of our off-price business model will continue to be a winning retail formula and that TJX is on its way to becoming a $60 billion-plus revenue company. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Scott for a few additional comments, and then we'll open it up for questions."

In terms of the third quarter, we are very pleased that overall open-only comp store sales trends are up very strongly to start the quarter at the mid-teens level. This is despite what we believe is a negative sales impact from the Delta variant that we've seen since the last week of July. Currently, all of our stores in the U.S., Canada and Europe are open and approximately, 40 of our Australian stores are closed. While we are not planning for overall store closures in the third quarter to be significant, sales could also be negatively impacted if new COVID-related regulations are put in place. 
As we mentioned in the press release, due to continued uncertainty with COVID, we are not providing guidance for the third quarter or the second half of the year today. 
Lastly, I want to pick up on Ernie's point about improving our margin profile next year and beyond as we pursue opportunities, both on the macro level and within our business. First, while we expect the combination of freight, supply chain and wage costs to be higher in the back half of the year, we do not envision freight and wage -- we do envision freight and wage beginning to moderate as we move through next year. 
Second, to the extent we can drive outsized comps, that is the easiest way for us to improve our margin going forward. Further, we will remain focused on continuing to buy even better and opening more vendors. Also, we are seeing a less promotional environment and rising inflation as well as stronger sales in our apparel categories. 
We see all of these factors as opportunities for higher retails. At the same time, we remain laser-focused on continuing to offer consumers great values, just as we have throughout our 45-year history. 
In closing, we feel great about the strength of the business, both operationally and financially, and we are confident that we are capturing market share. We are extremely pleased to be in a strong financial position to make important investments in our business and return significant value to our shareholders through both our share buyback and dividend programs. 
Now we're happy to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thanks, and now we'll open it up for questions."

We believe perhaps there might be a little bit more opportunity that we're seeing in the home area. But we are, in effect, talking about all of the banners. We also have seen that we started a big change from the first quarter when we had talked about this is we want to more wait and see what happens around us. And as you would have expected, with the inflation of the cost pressures that I think all the other retailers are receiving, we're observing that there is less promotion as well as more pockets than we saw a quarter ago in terms of ability to raise retail surgically and selectively in certain areas of the store. 
And again, that applies not just in the home area. Even though I think the home area is disproportionately a place where we'll do more of that. We also think that the freight that has hit everybody, by the way, has created -- freight and wage, which we all knew this could be an unusual time to see this opportunity. First quarter, again, when we talked about this, we were going to be looking hard at it. We have just seen the ability to do that more than we were thinking we could do before.

It's a little like we used to talk to on our average ticket, and we'd say our ticket was down or whatever. Although that's been moderating in a nice direction and we're feeling good about that upside as we move forward. But our buyers drive where the retail adjustment opportunities are. It is not top-down-driven as far as what items we do that on. 
So the first mission, as always, and again, in the script, I mentioned this a couple of times as we've done in our 40-plus year history, we're always making sure our retail adjustment is providing still a tremendous gap and value for us versus the out-the-door retails of competition. So buyers do not do that unless we are still showing a great value. 
So if it wasn't for the fact that the retails around us are up a little bit or less promotional, we wouldn't be able to do what we're doing there to the degree that we think we can do it. And by the way, to the degree, which we think we'll be able to do it going forward. We also feel the -- another cost pressure we have been dealing with for the last handful of years was the ticket lowering. And in this environment, what we're starting to see now is that moderating. 
So again, what Scott and I have looked at it with the teams, as we look at next year, really, as we get to fourth quarter into next year, I think we really start seeing these -- really start seeing more opportunity to do more of what we just talked about because we have just started this mission. I think we are in a great position to surgically look at the way we're retailing goods really throughout the whole corporation over the next couple of years. And I think that's going to bode well for us. But great questions."

So Matt, I will go first and then Scott will back -- clean up, as they say. And the market -- you saw market share, man, we see it on a lot of fronts.

And the market -- you saw market share, man, we see it on a lot of fronts. So clearly, the most obvious one is the home area, which we've talked about and in the script, we're -- truly phenomenal results in our home area. Yes. We see that as a continued strength in that we are so differentiated. You know this. Our home area is very fashion-driven, extremely fast-turning. It's eclectic with great value, great brands, all the different categories in the world you would want. And it's probably our most impulsive-oriented right form of shopping banner that we have. 
So when a customer walks in, and let's talk -- we didn't talk much about it earlier in the script about the entertainment treasure hunt value in HomeGoods. It is off the charts, as we know, which is why we are having these just amazing outsized comps there. And just so you know, the home business throughout the corporation and the full family stores, so whether that's in Maxx or Marshalls, the same thing applies. Our home business is there are just as healthy. 
And when we look at international, also very healthy. So I would say the #1 market share thing will continue to be home. However, as we mentioned on the call, our apparel and some other areas of the store, which I don't want to put out there specifically right now, has been extremely healthy across men's, ladies, kids. And as those start to kick in, as you know, in our business, that helps us with our average ticket, but it also helps us, I think, with continued market share gain because based on a lot of store closures around us, a lot of them were branded apparel retailers where certain boxes have closed. 
And I think this presents an unusual opportunity for us to continue to gain more market share because of our branded content being really second to none, I think, in terms of also doing good, better and best which is another advantage we have when you look at some of our competition. They tend to be a little narrower in their scope of goods. They don't trade up as quite as high. And I think that range for us will allow us to continue to gain. That's why I'm so excited about it. 
Before I hand it over to Scott, the other thing I would like to say is on the margins that -- what we're seeing here is another plus is all of these areas, just like Lorraine had asked me, are presenting opportunities for us to either raise our ticket in total or adjust our retail surgically on select amount of goods and doing it in the right way, but I think that's going to kind of play out as we move forward next year. 
And it does allow us a goal. You were asking Scott about the margins overall internationally, et cetera. But we're feeling pretty bullish about really starting to get back to those double-digit margins as we look out to next year, are getting very close. And I'm sure Scott will -- and I'm talking in total, but I'm sure he will get into more of that international that you asked about."

So I think we wouldn't be looking for any one division to get better. We're really looking for all divisions to get better in getting -- not necessarily -- it's not -- I think, as Ernie said, it's going to be a pace. We have to see what -- we want to make sure we're doing this prudently and do it right. But it would be over the course of time. 
I think the first thing is we get up to those double digits is once we get there and go beyond, is that we would be looked -- and I think it's mostly going to be through a strong merchandise margin, offsetting a lot of the cost pressures. But I think Ernie alluded to the higher average retail or the moderation in retail, I think, then resulting in a higher average retail will some of those expenses will moderate on the store and distribution and freight line as we get a higher average retail. 
And to be determined on the pace of that, but it could be 2/3 merchandise margin, 1/3 on the expenses because you do get a significant benefit. But a lot of that will be the pace, and we'll have to see as we move through the fourth quarter into next year as we start buying and get this benefit, that's when we would expect more of it to happen as next year. 
I think the other point that Ernie was making is that once we get to those levels, the first point is get to a point where our -- we can leverage on a -- we'd be flat or better on a low -- the 3, 4 type of comp. And that's what our expectations would be in the longer term of getting to that level. Once we get to that, then I think we'll be talking about higher overall pretax levels. 
But first, as you know, for many, many years, we've been delevering slightly on some strong comps. And I think now would be how do we get to a point, and we feel confident that we can do it, that we can stop that bleeding but on a low- to mid-single comp."

But what becomes more leverageable as you look out to 2022? I know a lot of the focus in your prior answer was on the shift in retails that you spoke about."

Let me unpack Q2 a little better because it's not straight. As you know, there's a lot of noise quarter-to-quarter and some -- there are things that are different quarter-to-quarter. When you just look at the surface on our 28% overall growth in SG&A",385,"Yes. Let me unpack Q2 a little better because it's not straight. As you know, there's a lot of noise quarter-to-quarter and some -- there are things that are different quarter-to-quarter. When you just look at the surface on our 28% overall growth in SG&A compared to the 23%, you'd say on the surface, not that great and accounting for that deleverage of the 70 basis points. 
But if you exclude and you look at it on a per-store basis, just the COVID cost, which we don't believe will be hopefully around next year, we had approximately a 21% per-store growth and about 19% after stripping out COVID growth. So leveraged a bit there. There was one line item that we don't think will be as -- it was more of a catch-up due to the strong sale growth over our own plans in profit, both in the first and second quarter, made us do a bit of a catch-up on a lot of line items on the incentive accruals. It's a bit just the way when things are either lower than plan or underwater and then all of a sudden the catch-up, we had a bit of that. 
When you'd strip out the incentive accruals this quarter, we had approximately a 6% growth per store on a 10% comp growth when you look at it over 2 years. Remember, a lot of these are over a 2-year period. So I would say that we felt pretty good. And when you look to the third quarter, although not giving guidance, that incentive accruals will be -- there'll be some of it, but much, much, much less. And so the level of deleverage, if there is deleverage, will be less than what it is this quarter. 
So when you strip out just 2 line items, which we don't think are comparable and not necessarily go-forward, we feel pretty good about that. In terms of long term going forward, a little hard to say. That will depend on the level of sales and the level of what Ernie said on the growth on the average ticket. So too early to call, but don't see anything in the SG&A that's unusual other than the same level of minimum wage growth that we would expect to see going forward."

So we had other delevers in terms of supply chain and wage as well. And then obviously, we called out the impact from the store closures. So the 150 was just freight. And that's a combination of both freight, which is inbound and outbound, but also our ocean freight. 
Ocean freight is probably the bigger sticky one for at least the near term. The rates increases have, as you know, have been up on both intermodal and on trucking and the ocean freight, and that's why we talked and put in, we believe, the costs are still going up higher in the back half as ocean freight rates have, in some cases, gone up 200%, which we would expect in the third and fourth quarter. We don't think this level of freight deleverage, which will be more than that 150, at least what we're seeing now, will be at the sustained levels. If they are, that means the sales levels are going to continue because that means there's a tremendous demand. 
So we would expect those to moderate to some degree and hopefully a lot as we move through next year. So on top of the 150, we had deleverage from wage. We also had the bonus accruals, which was a substantial amount and some supply chain. Again, the strong leverage on the 20 comp and the strong merchandise margin more than offset all that."

So I think I'll go first, and then Scott will come back to you on the merchandise margin. So longer term, also a great question, Paul, because we're looking at this all the time in terms of the growth because, obviously, we have a higher growth opportunity, international as a growth rate, not necessarily in dollars. But we are -- as you could see from the results, very pleased with our open-only results in Canada. Europe, Australia has been absolutely terrific. 
So we are also looking -- we didn't get into it on that question a couple of minutes ago, but we are looking at making some positive margin improvements in those divisions also over the next 18 months. We feel there's opportunity there. Regardless of what happens with exchange rates, we would love to see the exchange rate obviously going in the right direction since we buy so much in U.S. dollars, specifically for Canada and Europe. But regardless of that, we're feeling very bullish on the market share opportunities. 
Many store closures, Paul, in the U.K. and in Canada continue -- and Canada is one of our most dominant market shares that we're already in. We have a higher market share there than we even do in the States. So very bullish. I think more opportunity in terms of pure growth rate in Europe in terms of new stores, I think you mentioned new store opportunity. So what we did there, and you've seen the cycle, as when things got more challenging there in terms of Brexit, margin, exchange rate and then what was going on obviously with COVID, we pulled back on store openings there, but now we are relooking at that and ramping it up to a more of a selectively, obviously, because we have to look at the right sites that make sense for us in the different countries, such as in Germany, where we've still had a tremendous amount of new store opportunities and still do. 
So we're pretty bullish on that. And obviously, Poland and Austria and Netherlands all have performed well. So pretty bullish on margins and sales overseas improving. One thing I would like to mention, it ties in with the new stores there as well as here, is overall we are pretty -- we have a remodel program, which we moderated recently during COVID, but now that as we can see how strong we're coming out of this and how well we're starting to -- so good about leveraging going forward. Scott and I have been looking at really ramping up our remodel program and all the divisions to continue with this market share. 
That would apply to Europe in Canada. And not as much Australia because those are all relatively new. HomeGoods and Marmaxx specifically because we're capturing all these new customers along with existing customers and one of the best ways to invest cash and the use of our cash is to invest in the business, and we feel remodels, given what's going on for us right now, are a great return on investment in terms of maintaining our new customer shopper. 
So I know you didn't kind of ask about that, but it does relate to, I think, our international opportunities as well. And I'll turn it back to Scott as far as the merchandise margin."

Again, the markdowns was a function -- some of it was -- we had a little over accrual in some of our European business on -- when we were closed, but just strong markdown performance across the board. 
And then mark-on, again, was very strong as well. So again, that's very pleased with that similar type of performance we had in the first quarter on that as well. The one thing we would say is that freight line feels to be pressured as we -- at least move through the third and fourth quarter."

As you know, our -- boy, some of our most passionate customers. I think you and I have talked about this in the past, right, our HomeGoods customers are so passionate. So with that, there is a little tweak in the strategy. And I think we've talked about this briefly, but you're asking for a little bit more color, which I'm happy to provide here. 
It is a little different in the approach than Marmaxx is for a couple of reasons. And I think I'm going to answer both of your questions at the same time because your second part of the question was, is there any opportunity to have it be a little more connected. And so we would say, yes. And so as opposed to having a different buying organization completely, which is we have at Maxx and Marshalls, HomeGoods, as you know, is our fastest turning, most eclectic business that we have out there. So by a natural nature of the beast, even our HomeGoods stores tend to vary more from store to store, they turn so fast and there are so many SKUs. 
So we've approached the HomeGoods online business to try to get the best of both worlds. So we have -- we're really leveraging actually our merchant organization in HomeGoods, and we are really peeling off goods from our HomeGoods inventories and using that to create the site and the eventual shipping, but really using our merchants and our planning organizations are more joined together in HomeGoods than they are in Marmaxx. And the way we're buying, we have more point people at HomeGoods, but we're really buying the similar mix, which is I think what you were asking about. 
So the other benefit is when you want to get multiple purchases as you know, we tend to ship some things not in complete sets. We ship a set. But when they're in the store, the customer could buy 2 of something and leave 2 chairs, et cetera. This is where our homegoods.com business should be extremely complementary because it allows a customer to be more connected like you were asking. So if somebody sees something in the store and online, they can almost execute a buy complementary where it all kind of goes together. So you could really outfit a room or a whole look a little easier by kind of supplementing your in-store purchases with your online purchases with HomeGoods. 
And that's why it's been a bit of a different strategy on the way we're buying it, which, by the way, should leverage profit for us faster. We don't have as much overhead as we do in the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls online as we do there. This is much leaner setup. And we are currently playing with a shipping strategy on how we're going to ask the customer to pay for shipping. That might be a little different, but I won't get into that here. 
It's just what you need to know is it -- we believe it's really set up to supplement in a very conducive way where we should get multiple purchases and it shouldn't actually help our store and online at the same time. So a great question, the way you asked it because it is going to be executed differently. Now I will have Scott."

We had a lot of in-transit inventory at the end of the first quarter, a lot of in-transit inventory at the end of the second quarter. Obviously, we didn't specifically say, but we certainly have a lot on order and talk about our ability to -- availability has been great. 
The inventory position, like we said, compared to 2 years ago, we have less store inventory. Structurally, the way the stores from a shopability and all that, we have less fixtures and all that, so approximately 10% is just due at the store level due to that. So we have -- we're turning faster, almost 1 turn faster both in the first and second quarter due to having the lower inventory, and it's paid dividends in terms of the markdown. So we feel good about that. 
And the other thing is part of it, which is hard to -- we have less packaway inventory. So that's a bit of the piece of it in our DCs. And the last thing is, particularly in the first quarter and in the second quarter, the trends, we were buying to better trends. Clearly, we saw the home trends were up, but the apparel trends have gone also up. And so we're chasing more than we typically would have been compared to 2 years ago."

And when I say that, the buyers, our logistics teams, our distribution services teams, the stores getting the goods out. So what we've done here is every functional areas had to really execute a little differently and it varies by category, but I'm very proud of all of them because they've been as you alluded to, it's been -- it's a strange market out there, and the inventories at points in times have been up and down. 
But a couple of things that have been happening. The buyers when -- if they're in a category when things were a little light, they've been pulling the trigger a little sooner in buying with longer lead times than we typically would. Versus as there are out there, there are many categories that are extremely loaded, and they'll buy it even closer hand to mouth. So I really give them a lot of credit. 
The logistics teams have been securing the freight capacity, we need to get the goods to our DCs and stores to meet our strong demand, and we're paying more when we need to. So as always, and I know we've talked to you and others about this, we do that because we think we will figure out -- as witnessed by what we're talking about today, we'll figure out later how to offset the cost, but we want to continue to gain the market share and gain customers for the future. Again, the best thing for our business for the next couple of years is to continue to grab this outpaced market share -- paced market share opportunity that we're on right now. 
Here's the ironic thing. I believe the disruption in the supply chain is going to create a future buying opportunity for us. So when you look out at the end of this year, here's what I think. So we've talked about these margin opportunities for next year, but what we haven't factored in because those are really more based on retail adjustments, average ticket going up. What we're not factoring in is if the supply chain continues to be choppy, which it has been. 
We will be -- this is going to be classic off-price textbook execution where there will be more uneasiness out there, which in my eyes, typically creates even more opportunity, buying opportunities. So in that case, we probably get the buy goods a little bit better. So then you're getting it out of the cost and helping your merchandise margin on the other side. So I'm just kind of pretty excited about what's going on right now, but I'm glad you asked that because it really is -- there's a lot going on, on that front right now in terms of inventory and supply chain, et cetera. 
Okay. That was our last call. We really appreciate and thank you all for joining us today. We'll be updating you again on our third quarter earnings call in November. And I really can't say enough from the team here at TJX. We hope you all stay well and wish you good health. Thank you, everybody."

I'd like to start our call today by once again thanking our global associates for their continued hard work and commitment to TJX. As I've said before, I want to give special recognition to those associates who have been physically coming into work in our stores and distribution centers throughout the pandemic. 
In recognition of their continued efforts we have awarded a vast majority of them an appreciation bonus, which was the sixth appreciation bonus we have paid during the pandemic. Now to an overview of our third quarter results. I am extremely pleased with both our top and bottom line performance in the third quarter. Overall, open-only comp store sales when compared to fiscal 2020 or calendar year 2019 and increased an outstanding 14%. 
Importantly, our open-only comp sales growth was just as strong at the end of the quarter as it was at the start of the quarter. 
Once again, we saw phenomenal comp growth in our home categories across each of our divisions as well as a mid-single-digit comp increase in our overall apparel businesses. 
Clearly, our great brands and amazing values continue to resonate with shoppers. 
Overall sales were $12.5 billion, which was over $2 billion more than the third quarter of fiscal 2020 and total segment profit increased by $285 million over the same period. 
Our strong results are a testament to our flexible off-price business model and our associates. I truly believe we have the best business model and the best people in retail. Throughout the third quarter in the midst of uncertainty in the marketplace around supply chain delays and consumer behavior, our buying, planning and allocation, logistics and store operations teams all did an outstanding job. They ensured our stores had plenty of merchandise for our shoppers every time they visited. Our flexible model has been a tremendous advantage in this environment. We've been able to expand and contract categories and merchandise in our stores so that customers have full racks and shelves to shop when they visit. I am very happy with our third quarter pretax margin increase. Our excellent sales growth and strong merchandise margin increase more than offset the outsized expense headwinds that we have been facing. Our strategy to surgically raise retails on select items is well underway, and we believe it is working very effectively as shoppers continue to see outstanding value every day. 
Lastly, third quarter earnings per share increased an outstanding 24% to $0.84. 
As we look to the fourth quarter, overall open-only comp sales are off to a very strong start. We continue to see excellent availability of merchandise in the marketplace and are extremely happy with the mix of good, better and best brands that we are offering consumers. We are confident that we'll have plenty of great merchandise in our stores and online this holiday season, and we will be emphasizing this in our marketing. I'll talk more about the fourth quarter in a moment. But first, I'll turn it over to Scott to cover our third quarter financial results in more detail. Scott?"
306688,1686974637,2442752,"The TJX Companies, Inc., Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 17, 2021",2021-11-17,"Earnings Calls","The TJX Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ernie, and good morning, everyone.

I'd like to echo Ernie's comments and express our sincere gratitude to all of our global associates for their continued hard work and dedication to our business. I'll start today with some additional details of our third quarter results. 
As Ernie mentioned, overall open-only comp store sales increased 14% over fiscal '20 and overall sales increased 20% over the same period. This quarter marks the third straight quarter that overall comp sales increased mid-teens or better. I want to recognize the excellent execution on the part of our teams for managing through the supply chain issues facing all of retail and ensuring a consistent flow of exciting merchandise to our stores to support the outsized comp sales we've seen all year. 
In the third quarter, we saw consistent strength in our overall comp sales every month. Once again, we saw a very strong increase in our average basket across all divisions, driven by customers putting more items into their carts. 
Overall, average ticket was flat and improved for the fourth consecutive quarter. Overall, customer traffic was up, driven by a mid-single-digit traffic increase in the United States. 
As Ernie mentioned, we believe pricing initiative is working as we've rolled it out to -- rolled it out to very select items across categories. We're extremely pleased that sales, inventory turns and the markdown rates in the third quarter remained very strong, where we have selectively adjusted our retails. 
Across each of our division's third quarter open-only comp store sales increase was also excellent. At Marmaxx, open-only comp store sales increased a very strong 11% and and divisional profit dollars were up 21% versus fiscal '20. Marmaxx's home business continued its outstanding performance, posting a comp increase in line with home goods and apparel comp sales were up mid-single digits. 
Further, Marmaxx increase in customer traffic had a very strong average basket and sales across all geographies were excellent. 
At HomeGoods, open-only comp store sales increased a phenomenal 34% with consistent strength across all major categories and geographic regions for both HomeGoods and HomeSense. HomeGoods saw outstanding increases in both customer traffic and average basket. 
We're also very pleased with HomeGoods divisional profit dollars, which were up 52% versus fiscal '20. As a reminder, HomeGoods margin is disproportionately impacted by freight increases due to its product mix. 
When looking at Marmaxx and HomeGoods divisions combined versus fiscal '20, total open-only comp store sales for the U.S. increased 16% and profit dollars were up 26%. 
In Canada, open-only comp store sales were up 8% and and at TJX International comp store sales were up 10%. Comp sales at both divisions were driven by strong [indiscernible] in average basket. 
Further, similar to the U.S. home sales across all of our Canadian and European divisions were outstanding. 
Next, our overall pretax margin for TJX in the third quarter was 11%, up 30 basis points versus fiscal '20. Our pretax margin increase reflects strong expense leverage due to our excellent sales growth. We also saw a significant increase in our merchandise margin, driven by strong mark-on and lower markdowns despite 160 basis points of incremental freight expense. These increases more than offset substantial investments to expand our distribution capacity, higher incentive accruals and wage costs as well as 50 basis points of net COVID costs. 
Moving to the bottom line. Third quarter earnings per share of $0.84 were up an outstanding 24% versus $0.68 in fiscal '20. Our balance sheet inventory is up 4% on a constant currency basis versus the third quarter of fiscal '20. We were very pleased that our inventory levels on a per store basis improved in the third quarter versus both the first and second quarters. Again, and we can't emphasize this enough, availability of quality branded merchandise is excellent, and we're confident that we have plenty of inventory in our stores and online for the holiday season. 
Moving on to our liquidity and shareholder distributions. During the third quarter, we generated $1 billion in operating cash flow and ended the quarter with $6.8 billion in cash. In the third quarter, we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through our buyback and dividend programs. For the full year, we have increased our range of our buyback by $500 million and now expect to repurchase $1.75 billion to $2.0 billion of TJX stock. 
And now I will turn it back to Ernie."

Now I'd like to highlight the opportunities that we see to drive sales in the fourth quarter. First and most importantly, we will deliver great gifts and value for the holidays.

First and most importantly, we will deliver great gifts and value for the holidays. We are in a terrific position to flow fresh product multiple times a week to all of our stores and online this holiday season. Since reopening our stores last year, we have been buying with longer lead times from many of our approximately 21,000 vendors to compensate for supply chain delays. 
Further, our vast vendor universe is by far the largest in off-price and has always allowed us to have quality branded merchandise for our shoppers. 
Importantly, most of the inventory we need for the holiday season has already been delivered to us or is scheduled to arrive in stores and online in time for the holidays. 
This leads me to my second point, which is that we are set up extremely well as a gifting destination for consumers this holiday season. Our store shelves are full with great gifting selections today and we expect them to continue to be that way throughout the holiday shopping season. We expect to have something for everyone on consumer shopping lists and to offer an exciting and inspiring treasure hunt shopping experience. 
We also believe that our great values will resonate with consumers as much as ever in an inflationary environment. 
Third, our store locations are convenient for shoppers. Our stores are generally in easy-to-access script centers and often near other high-traffic retailers like grocery stores that consumers visit multiple times throughout the season, making for an efficient shopping trip. 
Next, we believe our holiday marketing campaigns, which started earlier this month, will help drive new and existing customers to our banners. This year, each of our divisions will showcase our differentiated shopping experience by reinforcing our value leadership while also highlighting the fresh flow of merchandise throughout the holiday season with messaging such as endless selection, great prices, all season long. 
In the U.S. and in Canada, we will leverage the strength of our retail brands together in multi-banner campaigns. In Europe, we have a strong cross-channel marketing plan, which includes TV for the first time ever across all of our European markets. 
At the e-commerce, we launched homegoods.com in September and are happy to offer consumers our exciting and collect the come selections 24/7. 
Looking ahead, we plan to bring more home categories to homegoods.com. On all of our e-commerce sites in the U.S. and in the U.K., we plan to offer exciting gift selections for the holidays that complement our in-store assortments Like our stores, new merchandise will be arriving frequently on our sites, making for an exciting online shopping experience. 
Okay. Beyond this year, we believe we are set up extremely well significantly grow our market share and improve our profitability. On the top line, we see tremendous opportunities with our sales and traffic-driving initiatives and our global store growth plans. We have gained significant market share this year, and we see excellent opportunities to keep attracting more consumers around the world. Giving us confidence is the appeal of our values, great brands and treasure hunt shopping experience. In all of the countries, we have brought our off-price concept around the world, too. It has resonated with consumers seeking great brands and fashions at great value. 
In terms of profitability, I want to reiterate that we remain highly focused on improving our pretax margin profile over the medium to long term. We believe our top line initiatives can lead to outsized sales which is our best opportunity to offset some of the persistent cost pressures we face. In addition, we're very optimistic about the margin opportunity from our strategy to surgically adjust retails while maintaining our value proposition for consumers. 
Turning to our ESG efforts. I'll start by saying that protecting the health and well-being of our associates and our customers remains a top priority as it has throughout the pandemic. I also am pleased to share with you that our 2021 global corporate responsibility report was published this past quarter and is available on tjx.com. The report summarizes our fiscal 2021 initiatives and progress within our 4 areas of focus: workplace, communities, environmental sustainability and responsible business. 
In addition to our report, we have published an appendix of relative ESG data and frameworks, including our first disclosure that is aligned to select metrics from the sustainability accounting standards book, or SASB. You can learn more about our efforts in our report, but I'd like to share a few highlights of our latest work with you now. I spoke on our last call about our commitment to inclusion and diversity and our work to help support a more inclusive and diverse organization. 
Since that time, we are well on our way to launching a variety of new programs for our associates, including new mentoring programs, associate-led inclusion anniversary advisory boards and expanded partnerships with community-based organizations to support our recruitment efforts. We also recently completed our global associate Inclusion and Diversity survey, which will help inform our longer-term priorities. 
Looking ahead, we expect to publish our 2020 EE01 data by the end of the year. 
In environmental sustainability, we made progress in our global science-based emissions reduction target. We are pleased to report a 32% reduction at the end of fiscal 2021 in greenhouse gas emissions from our direct operations against fiscal 2017. Our global approach to reducing our climate impact includes emissions reductions actions focused on reducing our energy consumption and expense. Also investing in energy efficiency projects and sourcing low carbon and renewable energy sources for our direct operations. I look forward to continuing to update you on our progress in this important area. And as always, there was a lot more information on tjx.com. 
In closing, I want to again thank each of our associates around the globe who helped us achieve outstanding third quarter results. We feel terrific about our overall execution, a very strong start to the fourth quarter and our initiatives this holiday season. We are in an excellent inventory position to flow goods to our stores and are confident our associates are in place to meet the sales demand. 
I want to reiterate my comments in the future of TJX and our ability to grow our top line and profitability over the medium to long term. As an off-price leader in every country we operate in, we believe we are in an excellent position to capture additional market share for many years to come and to become a $60 billion plus revenue company. 
Now I'll call back to Scott for a few additional comments, and then we'll open it up for questions."

In terms of the fourth quarter, we are very pleased that overall open-only comp store sales growth to start the fourth quarter is up mid-teens. Keep in mind that comp sales growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 was a very strong 6%. 
As to our fourth quarter pretax margin, we're continuing to face significant expense headwinds and specifically, we're currently expecting incremental freight costs to be about 80 to 90 basis points more than the third quarter. This is primarily due to the significantly higher market rates we're paying in order to secure capacity to ensure our stores continue to have plenty of inventory. 
Further, we anticipate that the combination of investments to expand our distribution capacity, incremental wage and net COVID costs will be similar to the third quarter levels. Looking to next year, we feel great about our sales and customer traffic opportunities, the buying environment and our merchandise margin and our ability to surgically adjust retail. As a reminder, this year, we've been benefiting from the huge expense leverage on our outsized double-digit comp sales. Again, we feel great about our top line and margin opportunities, but it's still too early to forecast comp sales or costs for next year. I want to reiterate what we said on our second quarter call, which is despite the continuation of outsized expense pressures in the macro environment, we believe our pretax margin can get very close to the double digits next year. 
To be clear, we expect the level of margin deleverage from the combination of investments in distribution capacity and the incremental freight and wage costs to be higher than it was pre-COVID, but less than this year. 
In closing, we feel great about our execution and strength of the business, both operationally and financially entering the fourth quarter. We have a strong balance sheet, and we are well positioned to take advantage of inventory opportunities, including packaway that we will believe -- that we believe will arise from the disruption in the supply chain while also continuing to invest in the growth of our business and return significant cash to shareholders.

So yes, we're getting new market share, new customers the data we show, but we're also getting an increased basket Scott can talk to that a little bit, but that's been happening really consistently. I think we mentioned that in the script. There's also a conversion thing that's also happening, Matt, I think when the customers come in, we believe we're converting at a higher rate, so they're making the purchase because there are certain times you have customers come in and they don't purchase, right? And so I believe we're running at a successful way in that manner because we have such good brands and great value out there. And the fact, obviously, at the same time, we've been surgically addressing the retail is a great -- is a great indicator for the future, right? Because if we're getting the new customer, if we're getting increased visits, I would also look at it this way. We have a certain percent of our customers that are more occasional visitors and certain that are more regular visitors. And we're getting, we believe, increased visits as well. And again, conversion is at a higher rate. So all cylinders are hitting. I guess I would caution us not to assume that we will run kind of at more like a triple the rate of what we used to run as you look down the road. On the other hand, the market share we're gaining now and we think many of these customers are going to stick, right? We're going to -- we're capturing it. We're obviously making many of them very happy with what they're experiencing when they come in. So that bodes well for that we're acquiring and we'll be retaining some of these new customers as we go forward, which, again, all is a great indicator.

So we are -- the teams -- I would like to put in a plug again for our teams where I give them so much credit on the way they manage, I think we have more unknown and volatility given the supply chain ups and downs. And the way our business is trending back and we talked to you and many, as we talked back in the first half of the year, right, as you could see our trends starting to take place. I give the team's credit for stepping out and buying earlier, as we said in the script, buying more earlier to time the cadence of when we get the deliveries and then anticipating some of the supply chain obstacles that were going to be out. And obviously, as we said in the script, we have figured out a way, it doesn't mean we're not getting hit with the -- paying the rates of moving goods at the supply. We're getting hit with all of that. But the teams figured out how to get the goods here. So we -- they've established, and I give the merchants, the buying teams, logistics, as I said in the script, everyone has participated in making this happen planning and allocation. Those same teams have -- I get to see every week what we're placing for further out. So I get to see the calendar '22 that you're asking about. And I can see the trend that we're on for opening up for first quarter, for example, which is the beginning of what you're talking about next year. And we are already heading to a very good place for February, March from what I can see on the on order. So yes, I have no concern. And then 1 of the other things that's happened in COVID TJX, I believe, when you look at all the branded that. We are probably more important today than we've ever been. We're probably more important to the marketplace than we were pre-COVID. When you look at the amount of volume that we're doing with those upstairs brands, I believe that we will continue to be able to leverage those relationships well through '22. So hopefully that answers your question."

The way people are very -- and you've probably seen a lot of data on this people or outdoors more and probably that will continue, which is affecting which type of apparel the world is selling, including us. I expect all of those related categories to continue to stay at a, I guess, disproportionate percent to our business and trend that way, which we're excited about. Now the home business pre-COVID, for us was already trending. If anyone looks back, it's easy to forget about it, was already trending very strongly. Now we are just trending more off the charts, I do believe that levels off, but leveling off when you're running 30 comps still leaves you in an extremely bullish home trend, I think, for quite a while. And as we've seen and mentioned in the script, our apparel business has been reemerging and really some high single digits here. And I believe we are going to be one of the -- when consumers continue to be value-driven, especially on apparel. I believe we take more market share there as we look out. So I would see -- but then when you look to more of the, I would call it, more of the active inspired apparel will continue to be something that we will, I think, shine in as well as home. And then there are certain accessory categories, I think we will tend to outpace them. So hopefully, yes, we see a lot of opportunity there, a great question."

So direct sourcing, what we always do let's start with where closeout driven, okay? So we, in season hand-to-mouth by the bulk of what we do. We buy very opportunistically that way. So that were continuing -- I would say that will continue the way it's going. And we've had -- all indications are, again, what I said earlier, that a lot of those key brands by the way, good retail around the board, as you've seen the results. Retail is pretty strong out there, obviously, right? And what that does create though, is for a lot of the public company brands that are wholesalers, it allows them -- they want to keep chasing that business with their more regular price accounts -- So it allows them to get bullish knowing that we're always there on the backside for the excess inventory. So let's start with that dynamic that's happening, which will happen more as which is why we always like it when everyone's business is good in this environment as we go to next year, I think you're going to see a lot of wholesalers now stepping out to be a little more bullish on their upfront orders for those retailers knowing that they have for the later for the cleanup, so to speak. So I think that whole piece, which is probably one of the biggest pieces of our business is looking forward to a tremendous opportunity as we move forward because of that dynamic. 
Direct sourcing, I think what you're getting at, which is we all do some business that way. I think that is just a piece where we'll look at if there's a void in a mix, and we'll do it very selectively. What you talked about on packaways. So you mentioned packaways. I think that is something we very possibly, as we come out of holiday, could see a tremendous amount of packaways based on the supply chain challenges that a lot of the other retailers are going to -- the whole market is going to run into. And if they end up with some late deliveries that don't make it in for Christmas, which is very possible, if they didn't plan their cadence correctly, then I think that is going to spill off a great opportunity for us to have increased packaways for next year -- for next fall that we would be buying this January, February. And I'm anticipating that could be a huge benefit to us. I think. I think I'm missing. What's the fourth -- there was a fourth aspect?"

So the -- wow, so the challenge we've had is we're buying very frequently in the size of the buys vary by vendor a lot. So what's been an interesting dynamic is we have some -- and obviously, we don't talk about them on the call, but we've had some amazing brands in 1 moment can have an enormous amount of goods. And it's interesting because they could be trying to unload the goods now a little early, knowing that maybe they're running into trouble later. And then we'll have some other brands that have a lot less and aren't necessarily yielding as much as a brand who's typically is comparable of size. Overall, we're having the slowed we've had to slow down as we were getting into the time period here because there's still more availability in total than we could handle. I would say it's a -- that piece ironically is almost the same as pre-COVID where you'll read some articles where the brands will say certain brands, and I won't mention who they will say, oh, we're not going to -- we're cutting back on the discount ""off-price channel."" But they've said that for years pre-COVID. And then what happens is it goes in cycles where all of a sudden, they say that for 3 to 6 months and then they are more loaded later. And then -- so we might do less business with a certain brand for 6 months, but we're just going to do more with a different brand for that 6 months. And then the cycle goes back the other way. 
And what's interesting on this is we watch for those situations because typically -- and this is better post-COVID since we mean more to the market in general, I think some of those vendors that are saying they're going to go less to discount are actually the ones that are still going to want to, for the future, place some more orders upfront that allow them reorders with some of the hot retailers, which in turn should come back and leave more availability. Hopefully, that all makes sense. Probably more than you need to know. It's a great question, great question."

And then I Scott, wanted to ask you about the benefit in gross margin. You talked about a nice expansion in the merchandise margin from higher IMU, maybe that's a piece of the pricing and strong full price selling -- But I'm trying to just sort of unpack the moving parts in that gross margin line to uncover or reveal just exactly how great that performance is in merchandise margins. So if you could just help us with some of the moving pieces in gross margin, specifically since you saw that nice boost versus 2019? That would be helpful."

And we did start -- we started very early actually as we were coming out of second quarter and going into third quarter, we were starting to do this pretty aggressively. But surgically. So we did it very selectively, and that's how we're going to continue to do it. And the merchants are doing a great job at approaching it in extremely analytical and as well as verifying that, again, our out-the-door retail is significantly below anyone else's out-the-door retail. Remember, the foundation of this is what's going on in this country, which is that wages and supply chain costs are hitting really like never before altogether. And it is forcing retailers around us to either promote less or raise their retail. So it is just creating a window of opportunity that we -- and the wage thing, I have no reason to believe that ends. So our teams, yes, started back then. We had a significant amount of the selective adjusting at retails, and we have had very good success during the third quarter."

So whatever we're doing selective to the retail has had to the best week and determined no impact from a customer perspective, and as I think we said multiple times, we were looking at the turns, the sales, the categories and everything has been consistent and strong, similar to the first and second quarter. So we can't see any impact in. And so that's just from that perspective. In terms of the merchandise margin, we've seen similar again to the second quarter, half of our benefit is coming from reduced markdowns due to the strong sales and the other is by an increased mark on. We are seeing some cost increases, but we're having a retailing increases that are offsetting some of that. I think one of the benefits to having our average retail come down or improve over the last couple of quarters is as that happens, our cost helps us on our cost structure as well as it takes -- you'll have fewer units to move in our stores, DC and freight. So we're seeing some of the benefit on that as well. But to answer your question, it's about half of our benefit is coming from mark-on and half of it is coming from markdowns. And in total, we offset a bit -- even with the higher freight costs, we went up slightly in our merchandise margin this quarter versus last quarter."

But yes, I would say there is a little shifting just like the environment has shifted. So certain categories are performing a lot better, which includes certain brands. So what's happening is in those categories that represent certain brands we're ending up with more brands there. And this won't surprise you. Overall, I would say, in the store, Simeon, we're ending up with some of the more, I guess, you'd call it, casual brands because that's the way the market has kind of gone, if you know what I mean. 
Having said that as apparel has kicked back in, we do have some dressier parts of apparel where some of the more traditional brands are still I would say, they've ramped back up a little bit. But if you look overall, I would say the casual brands have shifted to make up a greater percent of our mix and less dressy, which, again, that's a behavioral issue going on. And probably that type of trend continues for a while. And then I'm not going to be the actual categories, but in home, as you can imagine, that's a greater percent of our business. So we have some home labels that I think we're doing more business with today than we were a couple of years ago that have ramped up and the complexion looks that way. And what we do, Simeon, is at the end of the day, no matter who the brand is, the buyers are their first focus is to make sure we're at the right value. So it's interesting. We won't force -- we try not to -- too much predetermined which brand which brands we're going to emphasize based on just what the brand is. We kind of do it based on how exciting is the value. I'll let Scott jump in on the second question."

Having said that, our -- as we've said, our -- both store and distribution on a per store basis versus '20 was improved versus the second quarter where we ended at the end of the third quarter versus the second quarter, which also had improved versus the first quarter. So we've -- even despite our sales increases, we've been continuing to improve that inventory position, both in the stores and DCs. Given that we have a fair amount of inventory coming in, it should bode well for the fresh flow of inventory as a lot of -- all of this -- the vast majority of this inventory will be coming in over the next several weeks.

Again, I think we're extremely bullish on the real estate, both what we've seen this year. First, in terms of our new store openings, we are -- we've been experiencing as good as ever in terms of beating our -- both our pro formas across our divisions. So that's exciting. As we said, we expect approximately the ability to open 170-plus stores next year and then historically get back to that 4% growth where we were over 200 stores a year for many, many years averaging on that with, as you know, very 3 to 5 closings a year. So we love that aspect. 
In terms of the remodels we're doing over 300 this year. We don't have a number for next year, but it's going to be significantly higher across our divisions. Part of that is -- and that's something that's very important to us as one of the things that we have just continually seen in this -- all this year, we've seen the same thing where there's very little difference when you go from a store that's 10 years old to 20 years old to 30 years old. So part of that is we're just keeping these stores look fresh and that's why I think our ability to run the comps has been good as it's doing. And then I think we've also in the lease rates on both the hundreds of stores that we come to a renewal period. Our teams have done a great job across the board in getting lease renewals at lower rates than what we had contracted at. And that's continued all year long. And it's starting as you get over time to being some meaningful dollars. So I feel real good about that. And then the availability for the sites and what we're seeing, we expect to see that for years to come given the amount of store closures that have happened in the past 2 years."

Our marketing spend -- I mean, we're going after it this holiday in terms of driving -- continuing to gain market share. So our marketing spend is planned up significantly in Q4 versus FY '20 and with the idea to allow us to be top of mind for consumers during the holiday season. As you know, Dana, it gets very noisy around marketing, and we want to break through. Our campaigns are designed to break through as best they can with the budget in terms of our creative campaigns the way we execute them. By the way, more than half of our marketing goals are going to be allocated to digital advertising, which is where the consumers are. And we're really. I think I briefly mentioned that we're really laser-focused on capturing the market share and driving customer traffic, and we'll be reinforcing and a lot of the messages are really built around the competitive advantages on value that we show, our unique selection. We do that by showing certain product categories to remind the customer that we're going to be in these categories for gift giving, I think that's always key for us because sometimes customers forget that we have such a wide assortment of categories. And our goal is really to win discovery shopping occasions, which is roughly half of all shopping occasions where people are seeking inspiration and a bit of our treasure hunt retail therapy that I think we can provide for the customer. And then we're leveraging the power of influencers and brand fans and we're giving her a choice via multichannel messaging and we're just -- this is how we're spending the money, and I just think -- We are so well positioned to -- let's start with well positioned with our store execution, our merchandise and then our marketing to help drive them into the stores."

And then we flex our models up and down with our own assumptions on comps. But is that a fair assumption? And then I'm just trying to think through the puts and takes on how you're thinking about it. You said deleverage on the combination of investments in distribution capacity. But your COVID costs were pretty big burden this year, your store volumes will be much higher in 2019.

Longer term, we, again, feel real good if the ones we have some level of stabilization, as we said that we would expect, if we have headwinds that are closer to what we saw pre-COVID that we would with a 3 to 4 comp as Ernie just said on a go-forward basis, we would expect to be flat or leverage our business in the longer term from wherever we end up at the end of next year."

I think this starts to go away as we get into next year on the less luxury brands and also as the apparel cycle, the more traditional, slightly dresser apparel cycle comes back.

A few other departments right now that are bigger deal than, say, luxury vendors that we are actually very low on, but we're running 15 comps. So it's -- the stores are flexing.

No, we did not isolate the strategy to any one banner or any category. So the selective retailing goods applies to Max, Marshalls, HomeGoods or every division we have in Canada, Europe, every banner, Australia. So it is not a -- by any means, and we have all the merchants in every marketplace looking at this. And the approach to your second question, and it's -- I'm glad you asked this because you could think that we actually don't approach a cost plus. That is a formula we don't do. That is a formula that a traditional retailer does. And what our buyers do is they determine the retail first. And almost we say, forget about what the cost is, what's the exciting value retail and then we work it back from there. And so that's where -- and how do you determine the value of retail, you take your fashion in your brand and you look at where it's being sold at other retailers. And from there, we determine the significant retail gap we need to have between us and the other retail. And that's how we established the retail, not at what the cost is. And that philosophy, I just discussed just now. That is what is being utilized, I guess, you would say, in every division that is doing this. And again, it is international, it's everywhere. And that is what allows us to make sure that the retail is still providing tremendous value because we're using comp shopping of what is the retail and that item at other retailers. What is it selling for, and that's how we do it. We don't do what the cost is to us or our -- and that's what we referred to as a markup wheel, which traditional retailers do, do that. We do not do that. And it's a great question, though, because you want to do one with -- I like the way you asked it because you want 1 without the -- you don't want to go around surgically addressed a retailer if we were doing it off the cost, that you could run into trouble. So this is, again, good question.

I'd like to start our call today by once again thanking our global associates for their continued hard work and commitment to TJX. As I've said before, I want to give special recognition to those associates who have been physically coming into work in our stores and distribution centers throughout the pandemic. 
In recognition of their continued efforts we have awarded a vast majority of them an appreciation bonus, which was the sixth appreciation bonus we have paid during the pandemic. Now to an overview of our third quarter results. I am extremely pleased with both our top and bottom line performance in the third quarter. Overall, open-only comp store sales when compared to fiscal 2020 or calendar year 2019 and increased an outstanding 14%. 
Importantly, our open-only comp sales growth was just as strong at the end of the quarter as it was at the start of the quarter. 
Once again, we saw phenomenal comp growth in our home categories across each of our divisions as well as a mid-single-digit comp increase in our overall apparel businesses. 
Clearly, our great brands and amazing values continue to resonate with shoppers. 
Overall sales were $12.5 billion, which was over $2 billion more than the third quarter of fiscal 2020 and total segment profit increased by $285 million over the same period. 
Our strong results are a testament to our flexible off-price business model and our associates. I truly believe we have the best business model and the best people in retail. Throughout the third quarter in the midst of uncertainty in the marketplace around supply chain delays and consumer behavior, our buying, planning and allocation, logistics and store operations teams all did an outstanding job. They ensured our stores had plenty of merchandise for our shoppers every time they visited. Our flexible model has been a tremendous advantage in this environment. We've been able to expand and contract categories and merchandise in our stores so that customers have full racks and shelves to shop when they visit. I am very happy with our third quarter pretax margin increase. Our excellent sales growth and strong merchandise margin increase more than offset the outsized expense headwinds that we have been facing. Our strategy to surgically raise retails on select items is well underway, and we believe it is working very effectively as shoppers continue to see outstanding value every day. 
Lastly, third quarter earnings per share increased an outstanding 24% to $0.84. 
As we look to the fourth quarter, overall open-only comp sales are off to a very strong start. We continue to see excellent availability of merchandise in the marketplace and are extremely happy with the mix of good, better and best brands that we are offering consumers. We are confident that we'll have plenty of great merchandise in our stores and online this holiday season, and we will be emphasizing this in our marketing. I'll talk more about the fourth quarter in a moment. But first, I'll turn it over to Scott to cover our third quarter financial results in more detail. Scott?"

I'd like to echo Ernie's comments and express our sincere gratitude to all of our global associates for their continued hard work and dedication to our business. I'll start today with some additional details of our third quarter results. 
As Ernie mentioned, overall open-only comp store sales increased 14% over fiscal '20 and overall sales increased 20% over the same period. This quarter marks the third straight quarter that overall comp sales increased mid-teens or better. I want to recognize the excellent execution on the part of our teams for managing through the supply chain issues facing all of retail and ensuring a consistent flow of exciting merchandise to our stores to support the outsized comp sales we've seen all year. 
In the third quarter, we saw consistent strength in our overall comp sales every month. Once again, we saw a very strong increase in our average basket across all divisions, driven by customers putting more items into their carts. 
[indiscernible] Overall, average ticket was flat and improved for the fourth consecutive quarter. Overall, customer traffic was up, driven by a mid-single-digit traffic increase in the United States. As Ernie mentioned, we believe our pricing initiative is working as we've rolled it out to -- rolled it out to very select items across categories. We're extremely pleased that sales, inventory turns and the markdown rates in the third quarter remained very strong, where we have selectively adjusted our retails. 
Across each of our divisions, third quarter open-only comp store sales increase was also excellent. At Marmaxx, open-only comp store sales increased a very strong 11% and  divisional profit dollars were up 21% versus fiscal '20. Marmaxx's home business continued its outstanding performance, posting a comp increase in line with home goods and apparel comp sales were up mid-single digits. Further, Marmaxx increase in customer traffic, had a very strong average basket, and sales across all geographies were excellent. 
At HomeGoods, open-only comp store sales increased a phenomenal 34% with consistent strength across all major categories and geographic regions for both HomeGoods and HomeSense. HomeGoods saw outstanding increases in both customer traffic and average basket. We're also very pleased with HomeGoods' divisional profit dollars, which were up 52% versus fiscal '20. As a reminder, HomeGoods margin is disproportionately impacted by freight increases due to its product mix. 
When looking at Marmaxx and HomeGoods divisions combined versus fiscal '20, total open-only comp store sales for the U.S. increased 16% and profit dollars were up 26%. In Canada, open-only comp store sales were up 8% and at TJX International, comp store sales were up 10%. Comp sales at both divisions were driven by strong increase in average basket. Further, similar to the U.S. home sales across all of our Canadian and European divisions were outstanding. 
Next, our overall pretax margin for TJX in the third quarter was 11%, up 30 basis points versus fiscal '20. Our pretax margin increase reflects strong expense leverage due to our excellent sales growth. We also saw a significant increase in our merchandise margin, driven by strong mark-on and lower markdowns despite 160 basis points of incremental freight expense. These increases more than offset substantial investments to expand our distribution capacity, higher incentive accruals and wage costs as well as 50 basis points of net COVID costs. 
Moving to the bottom line. Third quarter earnings per share of $0.84 were up an outstanding 24% versus $0.68 in fiscal '20. Our balance sheet inventory is up 4% on a constant currency basis versus the third quarter of fiscal '20. We were very pleased that our inventory levels on a per store basis improved in the third quarter versus both the first and second quarters. Again, and we can't emphasize this enough, availability of quality branded merchandise is excellent, and we're confident that we have plenty of inventory in our stores and online for the holiday season. 
Moving on to our liquidity and shareholder distributions. During the third quarter, we generated $1 billion in operating cash flow and ended the quarter with $6.8 billion in cash. In the third quarter, we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through our buyback and dividend programs. For the full year, we have increased our range of our buyback by $500 million and now expect to repurchase $1.75 billion to $2.0 billion of TJX stock. 
And now I will turn it back to Ernie."

First and most importantly, we will deliver great gifts and value for the holidays. We are in a terrific position to flow fresh product multiple times a week to all of our stores and online this holiday season. Since reopening our stores last year, we have been buying with longer lead times from many of our approximately 21,000 vendors to compensate for supply chain delays. Further, our vast vendor universe is by far the largest in off-price and has always allowed us to have quality branded merchandise for our shoppers. Importantly, most of the inventory we need for the holiday season has already been delivered to us or is scheduled to arrive in stores and online in time for the holidays. 
This leads me to my second point, which is that we are set up extremely well as a gifting destination for consumers this holiday season. Our store shelves are full with great gifting selections today, and we expect them to continue to be that way throughout the holiday shopping season. We expect to have something for everyone on consumer shopping lists and to offer an exciting and inspiring treasure hunt shopping experience. We also believe that our great values will resonate with consumers as much as ever in an inflationary environment. 
Third, our store locations are convenient for shoppers. Our stores are generally in easy-to-access script centers and often near other high-traffic retailers like grocery stores that consumers visit multiple times throughout the season, making for an efficient shopping trip. 
Next, we believe our holiday marketing campaigns, which started earlier this month, will help drive new and existing customers to our banners. This year, each of our divisions will showcase our differentiated shopping experience by reinforcing our value leadership while also highlighting the fresh flow of merchandise throughout the holiday season with messaging such as endless selection, great prices, all season long. 
In the U.S. and in Canada, we will leverage the strength of our retail brands together in multi-banner campaigns. In Europe, we have a strong cross-channel marketing plan, which includes TV for the first time ever across all of our European markets. At the e-commerce, we launched homegoods.com in September and are happy to offer consumers our exciting and collect to come selections 24/7. 
Looking ahead, we plan to bring more home categories to homegoods.com. On all of our e-commerce sites in the U.S. and in the U.K., we plan to offer exciting gift selections for the holidays that complement our in-store assortments Like our stores, new merchandise will be arriving frequently on our sites, making for an exciting online shopping experience. 
Okay. Beyond this year, we believe we are set up extremely well to significantly grow our market share and improve our profitability. On the top line, we see tremendous opportunities with our sales and traffic-driving initiatives and our global store growth plans. We have gained significant market share this year, and we see excellent opportunities to keep attracting more consumers around the world. Giving us confidence is the appeal of our values, great brands and treasure hunt shopping experience. In all of the countries, we have brought our off-price concept around the world, too. It has resonated with consumers seeking great brands and fashions at great value. 
In terms of profitability, I want to reiterate that we remain highly focused on improving our pretax margin profile over the medium to long term. We believe our top line initiatives can lead to outsized sales which is our best opportunity to offset some of the persistent cost pressures we face. In addition, we're very optimistic about the margin opportunity from our strategy to surgically adjust retails while maintaining our value proposition for consumers. 
Turning to our ESG efforts. I'll start by saying that protecting the health and well-being of our associates and our customers remains a top priority, as it has throughout the pandemic. I also am pleased to share with you that our 2021 global corporate responsibility report was published this past quarter and is available on tjx.com. The report summarizes our fiscal 2021 initiatives and progress within our 4 areas of focus: workplace, communities, environmental sustainability and responsible business. 
In addition to our report, we have published an appendix of relative ESG data and frameworks, including our first disclosure that is aligned to select metrics from the sustainability accounting standards book, or SASB. You can learn more about our efforts in our report, but I'd like to share a few highlights of our latest work with you now. 
I spoke on our last call about our commitment to inclusion and diversity and our work to help support a more inclusive and diverse organization. Since that time, we are well on our way to launching a variety of new programs for our associates, including new mentoring programs, associate-led inclusion anniversary advisory boards and expanded partnerships with community-based organizations to support our recruitment efforts. We also recently completed our global associate inclusion and diversity survey, which will help inform our longer-term priorities. Looking ahead, we expect to publish our 2020 EE01 data by the end of the year. 
In environmental sustainability, we made progress in our global science-based emissions reduction target. We are pleased to report a 32% reduction at the end of fiscal 2021 in greenhouse gas emissions from our direct operations against fiscal 2017. Our global approach to reducing our climate impact includes emissions reductions actions focused on reducing our energy consumption and expense, also investing in energy efficiency projects and sourcing low carbon and renewable energy sources for our direct operations. I look forward to continuing to update you on our progress in this important area. And as always, there is a lot more information on tjx.com. 
In closing, I want to again thank each of our associates around the globe who helped us achieve outstanding third quarter results. We feel terrific about our overall execution, a very strong start to the fourth quarter and our initiatives this holiday season. We are in an excellent inventory position to flow goods to our stores and are confident our associates are in place to meet the sales demand. 
I want to reiterate my comments in the future of TJX and our ability to grow our top line and profitability over the medium to long term. As an off-price leader in every country we operate in, we believe we are in an excellent position to capture additional market share for many years to come and to become a $60 billion-plus revenue company. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Scott for a few additional comments, and then we'll open it up for questions."

In terms of the fourth quarter, we are very pleased that overall open-only comp store sales growth to start the fourth quarter is up mid-teens. Keep in mind that comp sales growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 was a very strong 6%. 
As to our fourth quarter pretax margin, we're continuing to face significant expense headwinds. Specifically, we're currently expecting incremental freight costs to be about 80 to 90 basis points more than the third quarter. This is primarily due to the significantly higher market rates we're paying in order to secure capacity to ensure our stores continue to have plenty of inventory. Further, we anticipate that the combination of investments to expand our distribution capacity, incremental wage and net COVID costs will be similar to the third quarter levels. Looking to next year, we feel great about our sales and customer traffic opportunities, the buying environment and our merchandise margin and our ability to surgically adjust retail. As a reminder, this year, we've been benefiting from the huge expense leverage on our outsized double-digit comp sales. Again, we feel great about our top line and margin opportunities, but it's still too early to forecast comp sales or costs for next year. I want to reiterate what we said on our second quarter call, which is despite the continuation of outsized expense pressures in the macro environment, we believe our pretax margin can get very close to the double digits next year. To be clear, we expect the level of margin deleverage from the combination of investments in distribution capacity and the incremental freight and wage costs to be higher than it was pre-COVID, but less than this year. 
In closing, we feel great about our execution and strength of the business, both operationally and financially entering the fourth quarter. We have a strong balance sheet, and we are well positioned to take advantage of inventory opportunities, including packaway, that we will believe -- that we believe will arise from the disruption in the supply chain while also continuing to invest in the growth of our business and return significant cash to shareholders. 
Now we are happy to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thanks. And now, we will open it up for questions."

So Ernie, I think you've made it crystal clear how you feel about availability of product today and through holiday. So I won't touch on that. But my question is, your mid-teens stack comp implies a top line run rate exiting this crisis. It's nearly double your pre-pandemic trend. Is this new customers? Is this larger basket? Is it a combination of both? 
Scott, are you seeing any pushback at all on pricing? And how best to think about expansion of the AUR initiative from here?"

Clearly, the run rate we're having is based on numerous things or I think we wouldn't be achieving these outsized comps. So yes, we're getting new market share, new customers from the data we showed, but we're also getting an increased basket. Scott can talk to that a little bit, but that's been happening really consistently. I think we mentioned that in the script. 
There's also a conversion thing that's also happening, Matt, where I think when the customers come in, we believe we're converting at a higher rate, so they're making the purchase because there are certain times you have customers come in and they don't purchase, right? And so I believe we're running at a successful way in that manner because we have such good brands and great value out there. And the fact, obviously, at the same time, we've been surgically addressing the retail is a great indicator for the future, right? Because if we're getting the new customer, if we're getting increased visits, I would also look at it this way: We have a certain percent of our customers that are more occasional visitors and certain that are more regular visitors. And we're getting, we believe, increased visits as well. And again, conversion is at a higher rate. So all cylinders are hitting. 
I guess I would caution us not to assume that we will run kind of at more like a triple the rate of what we used to run as you look down the road. On the other hand, the market share we're gaining now, and we think many of these customers are going to stick, right? We're going to -- we're capturing it. We're obviously making many of them very happy with what they're experiencing when they come in. So that bodes well for -- that we're acquiring and we'll be retaining some of these new customers as we go forward, which, again, all is a great indicator. 
Your second question, was it around the margin, or no? On the -- the average retail, I guess? Matt?"

It's been very few and far between where we've run into any hiccups on the adjusting of retail, which means as we continue to go ahead -- and again, we will not do anything that jeopardizes our mix being at better retail than anyone around us on like-for-like product. 
And we can't talk to price points, obviously, on different products. We're not responsible for the quality or the brands where they retail -- that we don't carry from other retailers. But on the upstairs brand, so to speak, department store brands, we are feeling there's a lot more room for us to surgically do this well into the next few years. So we're feeling very bullish about next year as well. So hopefully, that answers your question."

I think we have more unknown and volatility given the supply chain ups and downs and the way our business is trending back. And we talked to you and many, as we talked back in the first half of the year, right? As you could see, our trend's starting to take place. 
I give the teams credit for stepping out and buying earlier, as we said in the script. Buying more earlier to time the cadence of when we get the deliveries, and then anticipating some of the supply chain obstacles that were going to be out. And obviously, as we said in the script, we have figured out a way, it doesn't mean we're not getting hit with the -- paying the rates of moving goods at the supply. We're getting hit with all of that. But the teams figured out how to get the goods here. So we -- they've established, and I give the merchants, the buying teams, logistics, as I said in the script, everyone has participated in making this happen, planning and allocation. Those same teams have -- I get to see every week what we're placing further out. So I get to see the calendar '22 that you're asking about. And I can see the trend that we're on for opening up for first quarter, for example, which is the beginning of what you're talking about next year. And we are already heading to a very good place for February, March from what I can see on the on order. So yes, I have no concern. 
And then one of the other things that's happened in COVID is TJX, I believe, when you look at all the branded vendors of the market, we are probably more important today than we've ever been. We're probably more important to the marketplace than we were pre-COVID. When you look at the amount of volume that we're doing with those upstairs brands, I believe that we will continue to be able to leverage those relationships well through '22. So hopefully that answers your question."

The way people are very -- and you've probably seen a lot of data on this, people are outdoors more, and probably that will continue, which is affecting which type of apparel the world is selling, including us. I expect all of those related categories to continue to stay at a, I guess, disproportionate percent to our business and trend that way, which we're excited about. 
Now the home business pre-COVID, for us was already trending. If anyone looks back, it's easy to forget about it, was already trending very strongly. Now we are just trending more off the charts. I do believe that levels off, but leveling off when you're running 30 comp still leaves you in an extremely bullish home trend, I think, for quite a while. And as we've seen and mentioned in the script, our apparel business has been reemerging and really some healthy high single digits here. And I believe we are going to be one of the -- when consumers continue to be value-driven, especially on apparel. I believe we take more market share there as we look out. 
So I would see -- but then when you look to more of the, I would call it, more of the active-inspired apparel, will continue to be something that we will, I think, shine in, as well as home. And then there are certain accessory categories, I think, we will tend to outpace them. So hopefully, yes, we see a lot of opportunity there. Great question."

So that were continuing -- I would say that will continue the way it's going. And we've had -- all indications are, again, what I said earlier, that a lot of those key brands -- by the way, good retail around the board, as you've seen the results. Retail is pretty strong out there, obviously, right? And what that does create though, is for a lot of the public company brands that are wholesalers, it allows them -- they want to keep chasing that business with their more regular price accounts. So it allows them to get bullish knowing that we're always there on the backside for the excess inventory. So let's start with that dynamic that's happening, which will happen more as -- which is why we always like it when everyone's business is good in this environment as we go to next year. I think you're going to see a lot of wholesalers now stepping out to be a little more bullish on their upfront orders for those retailers, knowing that they have TJX for the later, for the cleanup, so to speak. So I think that whole piece, which is probably one of the biggest pieces of our business, is looking forward to a tremendous opportunity as we move forward because of that dynamic. 
Direct sourcing, I think what you're getting at, which is we all do some business that way. I think that is just a piece where we'll look at if there's a void in a mix, and we'll do it very selectively. 
What you talked about on packaways. So you mentioned packaways. I think that is something we very possibly, as we come out of holiday, could see a tremendous amount of packaways based on the supply chain challenges that a lot of the other retailers are going to -- the whole market's going to run into. And if they end up with some late deliveries that don't make it in for Christmas, which is very possible, if they didn't plan their cadence correctly, then I think that is going to spill off a great opportunity for us to have increased packaways for next year -- for next fall that we would be buying this January, February. And I'm anticipating that could be a huge benefit to us. I think. 
I think I'm missing. What's the fourth -- there was a fourth aspect?"

So the -- wow, so the challenge we've had is we're buying very frequently, and the sizes of the buys vary by vendor a lot. So what's been an interesting dynamic is we have some -- and obviously, we don't talk about them on the call, but we've had some amazing brands, and one moment can have an enormous amount of goods. And it's interesting because they could be trying to unload the goods now a little early, knowing that maybe they're running into trouble later. And then we'll have some other brands that have a lot less and aren't necessarily yielding as much as a brand who's typically as comparable a size. 
Overall, we're having a slowed -- we've had to slow down as we were getting into the time period here because there's still more availability in total than we could handle. I would say it's a tip -- that piece, ironically, is almost the same as pre-COVID, where you'll read some articles where the brands will say certain brands, and I won't mention who the h*** will say, oh, we're not going to -- we're cutting back on the discount ""off-price channel."" And -- but they've said that for years pre-COVID. And then what happens is it goes in cycles, where all of a sudden, they say that for 3 to 6 months, and then they are more loaded later. And then -- so we might do less business with a certain brand for 6 months, but we're just going to do more with a different brand for that 6 months. And then the cycle goes back the other way. 
And what's interesting on this is we watch for those situations, because typically -- and this is better post-COVID, since we mean more to the market in general, I think some of those vendors that are saying they're going to go less to discount are actually the ones that are still going to want to, for the future, place some more orders upfront that allow them reorders with some of the hot retailers, which in turn should come back and leave more availability. Hopefully, that all makes sense. Probably more than you need to know. [indiscernible] It's a great question. Great question."

I think you said the surgical price increase strategy is well underway. I'm assuming that means you started executing it here in the third quarter. It sounds like you've already got a reasonably good kind of level of feedback on how those price increases are being received by consumers with basically no price resistance. I just want to make sure I understand that correctly. 
And then, Scott, wanted to ask you about the benefit in gross margin. You talked about a nice expansion in the merchandise margin from higher IMU, maybe that's a piece of the pricing, and strong full price selling. But I'm trying to just sort of unpack the moving parts in that gross margin line to uncover or reveal just exactly how great that performance is in merchandise margins. So if you could just help us with some of the moving pieces in gross margin, specifically since you saw that nice boost versus 2019? That would be helpful."

And we did start -- we started very early actually as we were coming out of second quarter and going into third quarter, we were starting to do this pretty aggressively, but surgically. So we did it very selectively, and that's how we're going to continue to do it. And the merchants are doing a great job at approaching it in extremely analytical, and as well as verifying that, again, our out-the-door retail is significantly below anyone else's out-the-door retail. 
Remember, the foundation of this is what's going on in this country, which is that wages and supply chain costs are hitting really like never before altogether. And it is forcing retailers around us to either promote less or raise their retail. So it is just creating a window of opportunity that we -- and the wage thing. I have no reason to believe that ends. So our teams, yes, started back then. We had a significant amount of the selective adjusting at retails, and we have had very good success during the third quarter."

So whatever we're doing selective to the retail has had to the best week and determined no impact from a customer perspective, and as I think we said multiple times, we were looking at the turns, the sales, the categories and everything has been consistent and strong, similar to the first and second quarter. So we can't see any impact in. And so that's just from that perspective. 
In terms of the merchandise margin, we've seen similar again to the second quarter, half of our benefit is coming from reduced markdowns due to the strong sales, and the other is by an increased mark on. We are seeing some cost increases, but we're having a retailing increases that are offsetting some of that. I think one of the benefits to having our average retail come down or improve over the last couple of quarters is as that happens, our cost -- it helps us on our cost structure as well as it takes -- you'll have fewer units to move in our stores, DC and freight. So we're seeing some of the benefit on that as well. 
But to answer your question, it's about half of our benefit is coming from mark-on and half of it is coming from markdowns. And in total, we offset a bit -- even with the higher freight costs, we went up slightly in our merchandise margin this quarter versus last quarter."

But yes, I would say there is a little shifting just like the environment has shifted. So certain categories are performing a lot better, which includes certain brands. So what's happening is in those categories that represent certain brands, we're ending up with more brands there. And this won't surprise you. Overall, I would say, in the store, Simeon, we're ending up with some of the more, I guess, you'd call it, casual brands because that's the way the market has kind of gone, if you know what I mean. 
Having said that, as apparel has kicked back in, we do have some dressier parts of apparel where some of the more traditional brands are still, I would say, they've ramped back up a little bit. But if you look overall, I would say the casual brands have shifted to make up a greater percent of our mix and less dressy, which, again, that's a behavioral issue going on. And probably that type of trend continues for a while. 
And then I'm not going to do the actual categories, but in home, as you can imagine, that's a greater percent of our business. So we have some home labels that I think we're doing more business with today than we were a couple of years ago that have ramped up, and the complexion looks that way. And what we do, Simeon, is at the end of the day, no matter who the brand is, the buyers are -- their first focus is to make sure we're at the right value. So it's interesting. We won't force -- we try not to -- too much predetermine which brand  we're going to emphasize based on just what the brand is. We kind of do it based on how exciting is the value. I'll let Scott jump in on the second question."

So yes, it is in that 5% range more as a percent of the total than it would have been total than 2 years ago. 
Having said that, our -- as we've said, our -- both store and distribution on a per store basis versus '20 was improved versus the second quarter where we ended at the end of the third quarter versus the second quarter, which also had improved versus the first quarter. So we've -- even despite our sales increases, we've been continuing to improve that inventory position, both in the stores and DCs. 
Given that we have a fair amount of inventory coming in, it should bode well for the fresh flow of inventory as a lot of -- all of this -- the vast majority of this inventory will be coming in over the next several weeks.

First, in terms of our new store openings, we are -- we've been experiencing as good as ever in terms of beating our -- both our pro formas across our divisions. So that's exciting. As we said, we expect approximately the ability to open 170-plus stores next year, and then historically, get back to that 4% growth where we were over 200 stores a year for many, many years averaging on that with, as you know, very 3 to 5 closings a year. So we love that aspect. 
In terms of the remodels, we're doing over 300 this year. We don't have a number for next year, but it's going to be significantly higher across our divisions. Part of that is -- and that's something that's very important to us as one of the things that we have just continually seen in this -- all this year we've seen the same thing where there's very little difference when you go from a store that's 10 years old to 20 years old to 30 years old. So part of that is we're just keeping these stores look fresh, and that's why I think our ability to run the comps has been as good as it's doing. 
And then I think we've also, in the lease rates on both the hundreds of stores that we come to a renewal period, our teams have done a great job across the board in getting lease renewals at lower rates than what we had contracted at. And that's continued all year long. And it's starting, as you get over time, to being some meaningful dollars. So we feel real good about that. And then the availability for the sites and what we're seeing, we expect to see that for years to come given the amount of store closures that have happened in the past 2 years."

As you know, Dana, it gets very noisy around marketing, and we want to break through. Our campaigns are designed to break through as best they can with the budget in terms of our creative campaigns the way we execute them. 
By the way, more than half of our marketing dollars are going to be allocated to digital advertising, which is where the consumers are. And we're really -- I think I briefly mentioned it, we're really laser-focused on capturing the market share and driving customer traffic, and we'll be reinforcing. And a lot of the messages are really built around the competitive advantages on value that we show, our unique selection. We do that by showing certain product categories to remind the customer that we're going to be in these categories for gift giving. I think that's always key for us, because sometimes, customers forget that we have such a wide assortment of categories. And our goal is really to win discovery shopping occasions, which is roughly half of all shopping occasions where people are seeking inspiration and a bit of our treasure hunt retail therapy that I think we can provide for the customer. 
And then we're leveraging the power of influencers and brand fans, and we're giving her a choice via multichannel messaging and we're just -- this is how we're spending the money.

I wanted to ask a follow-up on some of the discussions you've been having around the pricing actions you've taken, given the inflationary environment. Maybe -- especially around the term surgical, does that mean only a certain banner? Did you do it across banner? Did you try international? Or do you -- is it only certain products and categories? 
And also kind of strategically, as you -- are you thinking differently about how you price your goods? Your merchants may be used to use a cost-plus mentality, and now, you're approaching it more from a value perspective, especially given the inflationary environment. Any kind of philosophical change in how you think about price and value would be helpful to understand."

No, we did not isolate the strategy to any one banner or any category. So the selective retailing goods applies to Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods, or every division we have in Canada, Europe, every banner, Australia. So it is not a -- by any means, and we have all the merchants in every marketplace looking at this. And the approach to your second question, and it's -- I'm glad you asked this because you could think that we actually don't approach a cost plus. That is a formula we don't do. That is a formula that a traditional retailer does. And what our buyers do is they determine the retail first. And almost we say, forget about what the cost is. What's the exciting value retail? And then we work it back from there. And so that's where -- and how do you determine the value of retail? You take your fashion in your brand and you look at where it's being sold at other retailers. And from there, we determine the significant retail gap we need to have between us and the other retail. And that's how we established the retail, not at what the cost is. 
And that philosophy, I just discussed just now, that is what is being utilized, I guess, you would say, in every division that is doing this. And again, it is international, it's everywhere. And that is what allows us to make sure that the retail is still providing tremendous value, because we're using comp shopping of what is the retail in that item at other retailers, what is it selling for. And that's how we do it. 
We don't do what the cost is to us or -- and that's what we referred to as a markup wheel, which traditional retailers do, do that. We do not do that. And it's a great question, though, because you want to do one with -- I like the way you asked it because you want one without the -- you don't want to go around surgically address the retailer that we were doing it off the cost, that you could run into trouble. So this, again, good question. 
Thank you, Omar. And I believe that was our -- Missy, that was our last question for the group. 
Thank you all for joining us today, and we'll be updating you again on our fourth quarter earnings call in February. Let me just say from the team here at TJX, we hope you all stay well, and we wish you good health and happy Thanksgiving."
