Good morning. I'm very pleased to speak with you today about the conclusion of another extraordinary year for Charles River, our expectations for 2021 and the expansion of our early-stage research and manufacturing support portfolio into a c",3884,"Thanks, Todd. Good morning. I'm very pleased to speak with you today about the conclusion of another extraordinary year for Charles River, our expectations for 2021 and the expansion of our early-stage research and manufacturing support portfolio into a complementary high-growth sector. 
2020 was an unprecedented year. COVID-19 pandemic challenged us in many ways. But to date, we've navigated it successfully and reinforced our position as the leading nonclinical CRO. Our success in 2020 was due to the resilience of our business model, a comprehensive business continuity plans that enabled us to keep our worldwide operating sites open and adequately staffed. Our broad scientific capabilities and flexible outsourcing solutions that support our clients' needs and our employees around the world who met client needs through their commitment and dedication. 
As a result, we have now become even more integral to our value clients and more differentiated from the competition. Despite the short-term impact of COVID-related client disruptions, we benefited from robust underlying client demand across most of our businesses. This was largely driven by clients' intensified use of strategic outsourcing to overcome challenges at their own sites as they partnered with us to move their early-stage research programs forward during the pandemic. 
In addition, the record biotech funding environment, which eclipsed $130 billion last year, is allowing our clients to place greater emphasis on R&D investments, particularly in the early stage pipelines. We believe these factors drove our exceptional financial results in the fourth quarter and for the full year. 
We are extremely pleased to report organic revenue growth above 10% in the fourth quarter and 7% for the year. Both metrics are in line with or above our high single-digit organic growth target despite the short-term challenges associated with COVID-19 last year. 
We also achieved our 2-year operating margin target of 20% for the full year, 1 year ahead of schedule. We are continuing to closely monitor COVID-19, but believe our strong performance in 2020 and a continuation of robust demand trends, including record booking and proposal activity in the Safety Assessment business position us well to get off to a strong start in 2021. 
COVID-19 pandemic has also enhanced the global focus on scientific innovation, which is generating biomedical breakthroughs across multiple therapeutic areas, including through COVID-19 vaccines. This innovation has fueled continued investment in and the proliferation of more complex research techniques involving advanced drug modalities, such as cell and gene therapies. The complexity of these new modalities is increasing our clients' reliance on a high science outsourcing to Charles River. 
To enhance our ability to meet our clients' needs in these emerging areas of scientific innovation and to take advantage of the significant growth opportunity that these again struck modalities present we are expanding our portfolio and scientific expertise through a combination of acquisitions, strategic partnerships and internal investments. This morning, we announced our intent to acquire Cognate BioServices, a premier CDMO partner for clients comprehensive cell and gene therapy development and manufacturing needs. We believe Cognate, which will become part of our manufacturing segment, is an excellent opportunity to enter the CDMO market because it will allow us to participate in a niche value-added sector with a high-growth profile that adds to our existing nonclinical development and manufacturing support capabilities. 
Let me start by highlighting 3 key aspects of the strategic rationale. Cognate has solutions across the major CDMO platforms for cell and gene therapies. Integrating manufacturing and required analytical testing is critical to drive efficiency, and the cell and gene therapy sector offers exceptional growth potential, Cognate's scientific expertise makes us a particularly attractive transaction. It provides CDMO services across both cell and gene therapies with its primary area of expertise in the CGMP cell therapy manufacturing. Cognate also has capabilities in the production of plasma DNA, which is a foundational tool for the development of gene-modified cell therapies and gene therapy as well as other inputs in the CDMO value chain. Cell and gene therapies are emerging drug modalities. And as such, the science will continue to evolve. However, Cognate's broad capability should enable it to better adapt to shifts in the marketplace. Cognate has a track record of producing various cell types and technologies, use in cellular immunotherapy and immuno-oncology, regenerative medicine and advanced cell therapy. 
The synergistic fit is the second pillar of the rationale. Cognate will be highly complementary to our existing nonclinical capabilities establishing a premier scientific partner for cell and gene therapy development, testing and manufacturing and providing clients with an integrated solution from basic research through GMP production. Biopharmaceutical clients are seeking to drive greater efficiency and leverage scientific benefits by working with fewer trusted partners who have broad integrated capabilities. 
As we are already a provider of extensive nonclinical services for cell and gene therapies, the acquisition of Cognate will enable us to produce drugs in these advanced mobilities. We believe the strategic expansion of our portfolio is particularly synergistic with our Biologics testing Solutions business. It will be ideal for clients to be able to seamlessly conduct analytical testing, process development and manufacturing for advanced modalities with the same scientific partner, enabling them to achieve their goal of driving greater efficiency. Our Biologics business is a premier provider of quality control testing, the cell and gene therapies, including assay development, analytical testing and cell banking. Which are all critical steps in the manufacturing scale-up and commercial production processes. 
Clients will also have access to our cellular products as the starting point for the cell therapy program. And we'll be able to work with Charles River through every step of the research and early-stage development process before moving into CGMP production with Cognate accelerating our clients' speed to market for advanced drug modalities. With Charles River and Cognate combined, we expect to effectively double the revenue base of our comprehensive cell and gene therapy capabilities to approximately 10% of our total revenue. We believe Cognate will also immediately enhance our growth potential by expanding our capabilities and scale into this complementary high-growth cell and gene therapy sector. The addressable market for Cognate's CDMO services, principally cell therapy and plasmin production, is currently estimated at approximately $1.5 billion and expected to grow at least 25% annually over the next 5 years. 
Growth is being fueled by the robust biotech funding environment. Approximately $20 billion was invested in cell and gene therapy companies in 2020, fueling the rapid rise of cell and gene therapies in the R&D pipeline, which now total over 2,000 programs. We believe the demand for Cognate services will intensify as more of these programs progress into late-stage development and commercialization. The companies that are successful in the market will be able to provide the science, the space and the integrated solutions to broadly support clients cell and gene therapy programs. We intend to be one of these successful companies. 
The purchase price for Cognate is expected to be approximately $875 million in cash and the valuation will be consistent with comparable high growth, high science transactions in the cell and gene therapy CDMO sector. Cognate is expected to generate annual revenue of approximately $140 million in 2021, which we project to grow at or above the estimated market rate of at least 25% annually over the next 5 years. 
Because of the market growth potential and the emerging role of cell and gene therapies as treatments for oncology and rare diseases in particular, we believe Cognate will meaningfully enhance our revenue and earnings growth potential and the transaction will achieve our hurdle rates for investment returns. David will provide additional financial details on the transaction, including the estimated 2021 financial impact. We look forward to welcoming Cognate's dedicated employees to the Charles River family. 
Now let me give you the highlights of our fourth quarter and full year performance. We reported revenue of $791 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of 14.4% on a reported basis. Robust client demand across all 3 business segments drove organic revenue growth of 10.3%. The DSA and manufacturing segments reported low double-digit organic growth. The RMS segment's organic growth rate rebounded to a mid- single-digit rate, recovering from COVID-related client disruptions principally in the second quarter. For 2020, revenue was $2.92 billion, with a reported growth rate of 11.5% and an organic growth rate of 7%. We're very pleased with this high single-digit organic growth rate, particularly in light of the revenue headwind from COVID-19. 
The operating margin was 20.8% in the fourth quarter, a decrease of 60 basis points year-over-year. Margin improvement in both RMS and manufacturing segments was offset by DSA operating margin decline. 
For the full year, the operating margin increased by 100 basis points to 20%, achieving our target 1 year ahead of schedule. This was an exceptional performance, resulting primarily from the inherent operating leverage in our business, our continued efforts to drive operating efficiency and build a more scalable infrastructure and the benefits from the temporary cost reduction initiatives related to COVID-19. Despite achieving our 20% target, we believe we are well positioned to achieve modest operating margin improvement in 2021. 
Earnings per share were $2.39 in the fourth quarter, an increase of 18.9% from $2.01 in the fourth quarter of 2019. For the full year, earnings per share were $8.13, a 20.8% increase over the prior year. We exceeded our prior guidance range of $7.75 to $7.85 due primarily to robust, low double-digit organic revenue growth and favorable below the line items for the fourth quarter, including a lower tax rate. 
We are very enthusiastic about the outlook for 2021. We believe our exceptional market position, the strategic expansion of our unique portfolio and our focus on operational excellence, combined with continuing robust client demand, position us extremely well for the year ahead. Excluding Cognate, we expect organic revenue growth of 9% to 11% and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $9.00 to $9.25, or an increase of 11% to 14% year-over-year. The acquisition of Cognate is expected to be neutral to non-GAAP earnings per share in '21 and add approximately 400 basis points to the reported revenue growth rate, which equates to a reported revenue growth outlook of 16% to 18% in 2021. 
I'd like to provide you with additional details on our fourth quarter segment performance and our expectations for 2021, beginning with the DSA segment's results. DSA revenue in the fourth quarter was $495 million, an 11.3% increase on an organic basis,driven by robust demand from global biopharmaceutical and biotechnology clients in both Discovery and Safety Assessment. 
For the full year, DSA organic revenue growth was 9.4%. We expect organic revenue growth will be approaching 10% in the DSA segment in 2021. Because clients, both large and small, are increasingly choosing to partner with a large, reliable CRO like Charles River. Clients know that utilizing our science, our broad early stage portfolio and our flexible outsource inclusions will propel their research efforts faster and more efficiently than they could do it alone. This was amply demonstrated during the pandemic when they face challenges at their own sites. Robust biotech funding also continues to fuel a healthy demand environment. 
Our Safety Assessment business continued to perform extremely well driven by higher study volume and price increases in the fourth quarter. Bookings and proposal volume reached record levels in the fourth quarter across all regions and major service areas, which we believe positions the Safety Assessment business favorably for a strong first half of 2021. 
We're pleased with the extensive depth and breadth of our Safety Assessment portfolio and remain intently focused on continuing to enhance the value we provide to our clients. 
We're also seeing greater opportunities to conduct safety and efficacy testing on cell and gene therapies. We believe there is meaningful growth potential inherent in the more than 2,000 programs currently in the cell and gene therapy pipeline. Approximately 2/3 of which are in the preclinical phase. The testing requirements of cell and gene therapies vary by molecule from complex combination pharmacology safety studies to certain cell therapies. The safety programs that are similar to a traditional large molecules for gene therapies. 
We've already built one of the largest early stage testing platforms to support this emerging high-growth sector and intend to continue to adapt and enhance our capabilities to meet the specific needs of these emerging drug modality. 
We are continuing to add new capabilities across many of our businesses, including through strategic partnerships. Our partnership strategy has proven to be very successful to stay current with cutting-edge technologies and add innovative capabilities with limited upfront risk. 
In the last several months, we have added new partnerships or expanded existing ones across several businesses, including with Cypre for 3D tumor modeling and screening immuno-oncological compounds in our Discovery business. And with Pat Aquest and Jade Biomedical in our Biologics business. 
In addition, last month, we announced the acquisition of Distributed Bio, formerly a strategic partner, through which we established our integrated large molecule discovery platform. This platform filled the gap in our portfolio and expanded our early discovery expertise in the comp like drug modality that few CROs can successfully offer. We believe our clients' willingness to outsource more of their discovery programs will be predicated on our ability to continue to add innovative capabilities to meet their critical research needs. 
We believe the combination of the strategic outsourcing trend, deep scientific expertise and our willingness to forge flexible relationships with clients led to the tremendous performance of the Discovery business, which had another exceptional quarter and year. Broad-based demand for our suite of early discovery, oncology and CNS services drove the fourth quarter performance. To achieve our goals in 2021 and beyond, we will continue to strengthen our portfolio by expanding our scale, our science and our innovative technologies. By doing so, we are enabling our clients to remain with 1 scientific partner from target identification through IND filing and solidifying our position as the leading early stage CRO. 
The DSA operating margin was 23.2% in the fourth quarter, a decrease of 240 basis points for the fourth quarter of 2019. The decrease was driven by increased costs due in part to performance-based bonuses and a slightly less favorable study mix in the Safety Assessment business. 
For 2020, the DSA operating margin improved by 140 basis points to 23.4%. We are pleased with the full year margin expansion in the DSA segment and believe there will be incremental opportunities for improvement. 
RMS revenue in the fourth quarter was $156.7 million, an increase of 5.2% on an organic basis. For the year, RMS organic revenue declined by 3.3%, reflecting an impact of approximately 7% from COVID-19, principally in the second quarter. Our outlook for RMS organic revenue growth will be in the high teens for 2021 as a result of the recovery from last COVID-19 headwinds and the incremental benefit from adding the high-growth self-supply businesses to the organic revenue base following the respective anniversaries of the HemaCare and Solero acquisitions. 
As anticipated, global demand for research models improved in the fourth quarter both on a year-over-year and sequential basis as clients return to normalized order activity in all geographic regions following COVID-related disruptions earlier in the year, demand accelerated nicely in the fourth quarter, particularly in China. 
We believe that we benefited from market share gains in 2020, especially with academic clients as research sites reopened, and not all suppliers can meet the clients' needs. We will continue to monitor the evolving COVID-19 situation globally, but at this point, it appears that most academic and biopharmaceutical clients have adapted their protocols to continue working during the pandemic. 
The research model services also continue to perform well. GEMS is benefiting from renewed outsourcing demand due in part to COVID-19 challenges at our client sites earlier in the year, as well as scientists use of more complex research models. We're the natural partner for our GEMS clients since we have extensive animal husbandry expertise which enables us to manage their proprietary model safely and efficiency. 
We're also continuing to generate client interest for in-sourcing solutions through both our cradle initiative, where we provide turnkey research capacity to our clients as well as through more traditional in-sourced staffing arrangements. Revenue for our self-supply businesses, HemaCare and Solero, increased in the fourth quarter on a comparative basis, but remained at a growth rate below the targeted 30% level. We anticipate that this growth rate will accelerate as COVID-19 constraints ease, and we expect to achieve our growth rate for these businesses in 2021. We continue to work diligently to expand our donor base in the U.S. and add more comprehensive capabilities at all our sites to accommodate the robust demand in the cell therapy market. 
The acquisition of Cognate also positions Charles River as a trusted partner that can move cell therapy program forward using the same cellular product through each step. Of the research and early-stage development phases and into CGMP production at Cognate. 
The RMS operating margin was 25.1% in the fourth quarter, an increase of basis points from the fourth quarter of '19. The increase was driven by operating leverage from higher sales volumes in the research model business as well as the benefit from operating efficiency initiatives. For 2020, the RMS operating margin declined by 420 basis points to 22% to almost entirely to the impact of COVID-19. With the financial impact of COVID-19 believed to be largely behind us, we expect the RMS operating margin will rebound well above the 25% level in 2021. 
Manufacturing revenue was $139.3 million for the fourth quarter, a growth rate of 12.4% on an organic basis driven primarily by the Biologics businesses. 
The Microbial Solutions and Avian vaccines businesses were also meaningful contributors to the fourth quarter revenue growth. Organic revenue growth for the year was 10.4%. Microbial Solutions revenue growth rate improved again in the fourth quarter in part to year-end ordering trends for Endosafe testing cartridges. We continue to have delayed instrument installations resulting from COVID-19 restrictions at certain client sites. We expect this will constrain the Microbial Solutions revenue growth rate well into 2021, primarily because the incremental revenue stream associated with corresponding sale of consumables, including cartridges reagents and Accugenix microbial identification services that generally follow the installation of our high throughput systems will be delayed. This is the primary factor that is expected to cause the segment's organic growth rate to be slightly below 10% in 2021. 
Beyond the COVID-19 related impact, we continue to firmly believe that our ability to provide clients with a comprehensive, rapid and efficient microbial testing solution as well as the high-quality and accurate testing platform are key differentiators from the competition and will lead clients to continue to choose Charles River for the critical quality control testing requirements. 
The Biologics business reported an exceptional quarter in the year with strong double-digit revenue growth. We believe that robust market demand will continue to support Biologics revenue growth in 2021 due largely to demand for testing of cell and gene therapies. We've developed a comprehensive suite of new assays required to support the unique needs of cell and gene therapies and we'll continue to add assays in 2021 to accommodate the robust demand. 
The acquisition of Cognate is also expected to be highly synergistic to our Biologics business. This client will now be able to outsource GMP cell and gene therapy production and required analytical testing to 1 scientific partner, reducing the bottlenecks and inefficiencies of utilizing multiple outsource providers. We also expect to derive a benefit from COVID-19 testing. 
We believe our Biologics business will be providing required reduction testing as many of the vaccines move into the commercial production phase and some of the early stage testing activity subsides. Given the strength of the demand environment, we are continuing to build, applying our extensive portfolio of services to support the safe manufacture of biologics and ensure we have available capacity to accommodate client demand. As part of this strategy, we were pleased to recently announce that we have expanded our partnership with PathoQuest to build a next-generation sequencing lab at our Pennsylvania site and partner with J Biomedical to enhance our biologic testing capabilities and geographic reach in China. 
Due to the leverage from strong revenue growth, the manufacturing support segment's operating margin was 37.3% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 10 basis points. For the year, the operating margin was 37.4%, above our mid-30% target and consistent with our expectations for 2021, excluding Cognate. 
As I mentioned earlier, we believe that the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that we are even more integral to our clients now. We have been intently focused on accommodating their evolving needs during these challenging times, and many clients have told us that they could move their research forward without us. Clients have outsourced incremental work to us across multiple therapeutic areas, because of our deep scientific expertise in the ease and flexibility of working with an integrated early stage CRO like Charles River. As a result, we generated approximately $60 million of revenue last year from our work on COVID-19 vaccines and related therapeutics. We're proud to have worked on all of the COVID-19 vaccines that have been approved for emergency use by the FDA and in the U.K. to date, including the AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccine. ASTRAZENECA and Moderna, our 2 leading biopharmaceutical companies that we have worked closely with under our respective strategic relationships for many years as they have embraced the benefits of outsourcing and driving efficiency through their R&D organizations. 
Our relationships with Moderna and AstraZeneca demonstrate how we can work together towards a common mission to bring breakthrough treatments to market to save lives, which has been particularly critical now as we strive to find a solution to the pandemic. 
As 2020 has demonstrated, we are operating in a robust business environment with excellent growth potential. To continue to successfully execute our strategy to maintain and enhance Charles River's position as the leading early stage CRO to expand our manufacturing support to CDMO capabilities, we will continue to make investments in our scientific capability through M&A, strategic partnerships and internal development, expand capacity and staff to accommodate demand and exploit our digital enterprise to provide critical data for internal use and to enhance connectivity with our clients. 
We will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities across our businesses and across a number of drug modalities and scientific capabilities. We will invest in a disciplined manner, strengthening our portfolio and focusing on speed and responsiveness as we meet our clients' individual needs and promote a more efficient drug development model. Our goal is to enhance our position as a trusted scientific partner for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and government and nongovernmental organizations worldwide. By providing exceptional value to our clients, we believe we will continue to deliver greater value to our shareholders. 
In conclusion, I want to thank our employees for their exceptional work and commitment, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. And our shareholders for their support. 
Now I'd like David Smith to give you additional details on our financial performance and 2021 guidance as well as additional details on the acquisition of Cognate."

Before I begin, may I remind you that I'll be speaking primarily to non-GAAP results, which exclude amortization and other acquisition-related charges, costs related primarily to our global efficiency initiatives, our ven",1598,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Before I begin, may I remind you that I'll be speaking primarily to non-GAAP results, which exclude amortization and other acquisition-related charges, costs related primarily to our global efficiency initiatives, our venture capital and other strategic investment performance and certain other items. Many of my comments will also refer to organic revenue growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation. 
My discussion this morning will focus primarily on our financial guidance for 2021, which principally excludes the impact of Cognate buying services. We expect 2021 reported revenue growth of 12% to 14%, excluding Cognate and organic revenue growth of 9% to 11%, which includes a benefit of the favorable year-over-year comparison to last year's COVID-19 revenue impact. Sustained client demand, including record fourth quarter bookings and proposal volume in our Safety Assessment business and a robust biotech funding environment support our growth outlook for 2021. 
Based on this strong revenue growth and with modest operating margin expansion in 2021, we believe we are well positioned this year to deliver non-GAAP earnings per share between $9 and $9.25. This equates to year-over-year earnings per share growth of approximately 11% to 14%, which is similar to our top line growth outlook as higher revenue and margin improvement will be partially offset by a higher tax rate. 
Foreign exchange is expected to provide a 200 to 250 basis points benefit to our reported revenue growth guidance for 2021 as a result of the weakening U.S. dollar. Our FX rate estimates are based on the bank forecast for the year, which are currently very close to spot rates. We have provided information on our 2020 revenue by currency and the foreign exchange rates that we are assuming for 2021 on Slide 40, and we'll continue to monitor fluctuations in the currency market as we progress through the year. 
From a segment perspective, our revenue outlook reflects the strong business environment and the fact that most of our businesses have recovered from COVID-19-related destructions in 2020. The RMS segment is expected to achieve high teens organic revenue growth in 2021 as claim order activity for research models rebounds from COVID-19 and the growth rate of HemaCare and Solero cell supply businesses accelerates to targeted levels. We expect the DSA segment to deliver organic revenue growth approaching 10% in 2021 and manufacturing to grow slightly below 10% on an organic basis as robust biologics demand is partially offset by the continuing impact of COVID on Microbial Solutions. We were very pleased that the operating margin improved by 100 basis points to 20% in 2020 and that we achieved our target of a 20% full year operating margin 1 year ahead of plan. 
Building upon this performance, we believe that we are well positioned to drive additional margin improvement for the full year 2021 despite modest pressures on manufacturing due to Cognate as we continue to leverage strong revenue growth and maintain our focus on operational excellence. 
On a segment basis, RMS is expected to be a primary contributor to margin improvement in 2021, increasing from the COVID suppressed levels of 2020 to well above 25% this year. The DSA operating margin is expected to continue to make progress toward the mid-20s target, and the manufacturing operating margin is expected to be similar to the 2020 level before COVID made. We expect unallocated corporate expense in 2021 to be in the mid-5% range as a percentage of revenue or similar to 5.6% of revenue last year. 
Our scalable infrastructure enables us to drive greater efficiency, even as we periodically reinvest to meet our goals and the needs of our claim. 
Total adjusted net interest expense is expected to decrease to a range of $68 million in 2021, excluding Cognate compared to approximately $74 million last year. We expect the decrease driven by lower average debt balances as well as lower variable interest rates. The non-GAAP tax rate for 2021 is expected to be in the low 20% range, an increase from 18.9% in 2020. The increase in the tax rate is principally an issue of comparison to 2020 because last year's tax rate was reduced mainly by discrete tax benefits associated with state tax returns and foreign tax credits. 
As a reminder, the first quarter tax rate has been meaningfully lower in recent years due primarily to the excess tax benefit related to stock compensation. Given our current stock price, we expect this to be true in 2021, resulting in a non-GAAP tax rate in the mid-teens in the first quarter. 
We remain intently focused on driving strong free cash flow growth as a key measure of our financial performance. In 2020, free cash flow was $380 million, an increase of 12% from 2019, but below our prior guidance. The decrease in the fourth quarter resulted primarily from higher capital expenditures which totaled $166.6 million. This was above our prior outlook of $130 million due to 2 factors: paying capital invoices ahead of schedule in order to do a discount as well as the timing of capital projects. Some projects that were slow due to the COVID-related challenges in the second quarter resumed in response to the reacceleration of growth and business activity. 
At the end of the fourth quarter, our total debt balance was essentially unchanged sequentially to $1.9 million, but our gross leverage ratio decreased to 2.3x, primarily because of the strong fourth quarter performance. 
With our leverage ratio below 2.5x, we will benefit from interest savings on our variable rate debt, reducing the rate by 12.5 basis points to LIBOR plus 112.5 basis points. 
For 2021, we expect free cash flow to be in the range of $415 million to $435 million based on the anticipated strong operating performance of our business and our continued focus on working capital management. 
Capital expenditures this year are expected to total approximately $180 million excluding Cognate. 
Currently, we do not intend to repurchase any shares in 2021 and expect to exit the year with a diluted share count slightly more than 51 million shares. The FX benefit is expected to largely offset the earnings per share dilution from the higher share count. A summary of our 2021 financial guidance, excluding Cognate, can be found on Slide 49. 
Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2021, we expect year-over-year revenue growth will be in the low double-digit range on a reported basis and approaching 10% on an organic basis. We expect earnings per share to increase at a high teens rate year-over-year from $1.84 in the first quarter of last year. 
As I mentioned earlier, the first quarter tax rate is expected to be in the mid-teens, primarily due to the excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation. 
Before I conclude, I'll provide some details on our financial outlook, including the acquisition of Cognate. Assuming the acquisition closes by the end of the first quarter, Cognate is expected to add approximately $110 million to revenue for the partial year, resulting in a revenue growth outlook of 16% to 18%. We expect Cognate to be neutral to non-GAAP earnings per share in 2021 we so do not expect the acquisition to have a meaningful impact on our current guidance. The acquisition is not expected to have a meaningful impact to Charles River's consolidated operating margin this year so we continue to expect to generate modest margin improvement with Cognate. We believe there will be opportunities to improve Cognate's operating margin over the next few years as we deliver acquisition synergies, enhance the scale of the business and drive operating efficiency. We intend to update our full guidance and other financial metrics to reflect Cognate next quarter once the acquisition closes. 
From both strategic and financial perspective, we believe the acquisition will deliver a compelling benefit that will generate value for shareholders. As a premier cell and gene therapy CDMO, we expect Cognate to boost the growth potential of our business and be increasingly accretive to non-GAAP earnings after the first year. 
Due to the high-growth nature of the emerging cell and gene therapy sector, we expect to pay 23x adjusted EBITDA for the next 12 months after the close. We expect the transaction will achieve our return on invested capital hurdle rate, which is to meet or exceed our cost of capital by year 3 or 4. We plan to finance the Cognate acquisition through our current revolving credit facility and we will also evaluate opportunities to further optimize our capital structure given the attractive interest rate environment. Our pro forma gross leverage ratio at closing is expected to increase into the low 3x range, which is consistent with the levels after the recent transactions. 
Also consistent with prior deals, we will focus on repaying debt in a timely manner following the acquisition and reducing leverage to our targeted level below 3x. 
In conclusion, we are very pleased with our 2020 financial performance and believe that we are positioned to have another strong year in 2021. Over the past 5 years, we have achieved compound annual growth of 15% for revenue, 16% for earnings per share, 15% for operating cash flow and 10% for free cash flow. With Cognate and future acquisitions as well as a continuation of the robust underlying demand environment, we believe that we will be able to achieve similar growth metrics over the next 5 years. We intend to provide a business update and more details on our longer-term outlook, including our updated financial targets at a virtual Investor Day in the spring. Thank you."

And then secondarily, there were some comments on mix and safety being slightly disfavorable in the short term. I'm curious if we could get a little more detail on what the driver of that was and what the outlook is for the mix going into 2021?"

But I think your question is also about how we might fund it. So we know the interest rates are very low at the moment. If that holds, then we will be looking to see how we might structure our long-term debt to finance Cognate. So we'll say more, of course, in a few weeks or a months' time when we come to do that. But yes, I think it's definitely on the cards that with a low interest rate environment, we ought to take advantage of that. And so although we can fund the investment initially through our revolver, and we'll do that. We will be keeping a close actually what markets might do in terms of longer-term interest rates for bonds. 
In terms of the DSA margin, there were 2 aspects that drove that. But if I just step back a moment, you -- as everybody knows, we've been trying to get to the 20% overall margin per Charles River for some time now. Really pleased that we've achieved it this year. Really pleased that we did it 1 year ahead of schedule. And DSA was a meaningful contributor to that. 
So the margin grew 140 basis points over the full year. But we did have a slight decline in Q4. And that's partly to do with higher performance-based compensation. I mean we had the 9.4% organic revenue growth. I just mentioned, the 140 basis point margin improvement so the wider DSA team absolutely leads the compensation that they've got there. 
Secondly, to your question on the study mix. And we've had this conversation a few years ago, where we have a situation where we've got a disproportion amount of studies that have large models. And so as additional costs initially when those studies kick off. But of profitability improves over the course of the study. And overall, you end up with similar sorts of margins. 
So mix is to tend to fluctuate sometimes it balances off to get the portfolio occasionally, you get like we have in Q4 like we had a few years ago, where we've got a particular heavy load and the like on studies that have larger costs at the beginning. 
So overall, yes, we're very pleased with the potential for DSA. Still striving to move that towards the 25%, which I think Jim mentioned in his prepared remarks as well. So this Q4 impact is mostly trends."

And you'll recall, kind of we sold it that we told you and other analysts and shareholders that we had done an exhaustive analysis of the industry, and we had decided that it was there were some very, very big players. And it would be difficult for us to achieve scale. And since we like to be, if possible, the premier player in the spaces in which we work. We just -- we thought it was best to exit, which we did. And at the time, perhaps overstated, I desire to remain out of it. But as you know, over the last couple of years in conversations with us, I think several things have happened. Number one, cell and gene therapy is heated up dramatically. Number two, that brings with us both an opportunity to make a niche play in the CDMO space and be minimally a leader, which we're entering with this asset as a leader in the space. And potentially will leader over time. So we -- so that sort of dovetails with the original comments that we made. You've got this $20 billion of investment in cell and gene therapy just in 2020. You've got 2,000 drugs that have been filed. The vast majority over 2/3 or 3 quarters, I think, are in preclinical and Phase I. So the demand has heated up dramatically. We have a lot of inbound. Our M&A is derived from requests from clients for products and services that they need that they'd like us to have, either because they trust us more, they're enable and capable of getting these elsewhere. This feels like -- it feels a very important gap in the portfolio. I don't think it would be legal. Had we not done this, but it would cause clients to have to go outside to get the drugs manufactured. So just to continue to comment and answer your second question. We now have an extremely broad portfolio. So you're starting with us literally with the cells via research and development. We're going to be able to do process development for you of your drug. We're all obviously going to be able to test that drug in our Discovery and Safety business. We're going to be able to manufacture that drug for the clinic and hopefully, the commercial purposes and our Biologics business is going to test those drugs before they're going to the clinic or into the marketplace. So it's a very, very comprehensive suite. As you heard us say, cell and gene therapy is going to move with this deal from about 5% of our consolidated revenues in fiscal '21 to 10%. So it's a major move for us strategically, but we're doing that entirely in response to our clients. So clients can stay with us through the development of the cell and gene therapy products, particularly cell therapy products where we have the preponderance of this business is focused and an opportunity to be a leading player in this segment."

Obviously, there's very few commercial products that exist in cell and gene therapy period. Although so many being worked on right now. So that certainly would be the goal and the strategy We anticipate. We certainly have the technical ability, regulatory ability knowledge of CGMP production in cellular therapy from people that had come from a host of different company backgrounds to form a very strong management team there. 
Capacity, like all of our businesses that are growing will be important as we built out somewhat in advance of having the demand and anticipating the demand. I do think the clients of Cognate's will be very pleased to see it in our hands because there's the uncertainty of being private equity owned and what's the future and what's the investment portfolio. So I do think that clients who are working with this company now in the clinic, whose drugs are progressing nicely, will have a hydro confidence if the drug makes it that we could and perhaps should be their commercial producers. So we like that sort of entry point here with a bunch of increased business with our access to clients with their footprint and with this being part of our overall portfolio."

And my question is around the margin profile clearly, you exceeded your margin expectations by a year. But from everything I'm hearing, it sounds like there's a real nice opportunity for long-term margin expansion, right? You talked about the complexity of the projects that you are -- that you are working on. And even when I think about sort of the strategic outsourcing, it seems that we're starting to hear from some companies that they're looking to downsize their own facilities and their own sort of workspace, which I equate to kind of like 5, 10 years ago, what we saw in the talks were kind of like capacity was coming down, which gave you an opportunity. So how should we think about that margin expansion and opportunity? And when you give us those long-term goals, is it going to be kind of like 2-year goal? Or are we thinking longer-term here, especially given kind of like out the COVID acquisition that really opens this new and growing market opportunity."

And I think we'll leave sort of the overall deep dive on this important subject of until we give longer-term guidance. But I think at the bottom line proposition, we are organized to drive efficiency throughout all of our businesses. Organized, we had G&A load as flat as possible as the business continues to grow, and it can be demonstrated that over the last few years. We've also demonstrated our ability to drive efficiency. We're going to be doing some more work on the digital front, which will provide greater connectivity amongst our sites internally and externally and we'll certainly take time out of the process that should generate better returns also. We certainly will continue to have pricing power across all of our businesses, which I think you are alluding to with the outsourcing demand. There's basically biotech. We have a big pharma footprint biotech as a principal driver of our growth. Biotech is extraordinarily well funded, and biotech has no internal capacity and doesn't want to have it. 
So I would say, first and foremost, our biggest business segment, which is DSA, definitely has meaningful margin opportunity going forward. We still have some major acquisitions in that business that have improved nicely but still have more margin to contribute. And I think efficiency across all of those businesses will be significant. The company that we just bought. We'll continue to have improved margin opportunity. You've got to see RMS get back to kind of historical levels to '21. And then I think it should improve, particularly since it has that attractive cell product aspect to it. 
I think the Manufacturing segment can always get better. Well see what we decide to say about that. The margins being at 37% are obviously quite extraordinary. 
Having said that, I think there's probably still opportunity in the Biologics business to drive growth. So you should see some modest improvement in '21, as we said in our prepared remarks and certainly more on a forward going basis, and we'll give you a deep definitive dive on that in the not-too-distant future."

Are you seeing a benefit in your research model volumes clients might need to migrate towards smaller volumes in the absence of the bigger models? This is a dynamic that I've been sort of tracking. 
And then the last thing is on HemaCare and Solero, it seems like the revenue that came in, in the quarter was a little bit lighter than expected. And so just curious if you're seeing a lingering impact from the pandemic on the donation centers? I'll leave it there."

We had shut it down, and then we opened it in May. It's been improving steadily. There's still some -- obviously, some social distressing going on, and we're always looking for new donors. So probably some slight drag coming out of the year. As we said in our prepared remarks, we anticipate that we'll continue to improve both as COVID becomes less severe, hopefully. But even if it doesn't, we feel we have the operational knowledge to structure this in a way that we should achieve the goal. So we had initial stars, which is north of 30%. So that will continue to participate -- to grow nicely. 
In fact, you're going to ask another question on nonhuman primate. So I'll answer the one I thought you were going to ask an answer that you did ask, why is that the supply is definitely constrained around the world. I think we've done an exceptional job in adding, ensuring, tightening up, expanding our supply sources, so that we have multiple supply sources for multiple countries such that we can support the demand, which is quite significant. The sort of changing out of species and moving to smaller species, maybe we should have an offline conversation on that. I just don't think that's -- I don't think that's happening. Work on large molecules really has to be done on larger species to get the sort of quality results that we're looking for. So I think NHPs will continue to play a critical role. 
In terms of pent-up demand for RMS, I think we've seen much of that play through the academic medical that were totally or partially shut in -- basically in all 3 geographic locals. Asia, Europe and the U.S. have essentially all opened. We don't believe, regardless of the level of infection with COVID, that they're going to go down and go back and the lockdown. The research is too important. The story that they shut them down, and they definitely now a to work with agents around them given their laboratories and usually outdid that. 
So we think that we're back in kind of a normal cadence in RMS for the products, which is principally what you're talking about, the services, obviously, we're not only unaffected, but I think benefited from some of the COVID disruption that our competitors saw. 
But in terms of production sale of research models, I think we're back to normal cadence, both of volume and price, enhanced by the cellular products of business. That continues to grow."

So just wanted to understand a little bit better what needs to kind of change at the client front in your mind to see a reacceleration of these installations? And then relatedly, I think you gave some commentary on margins by segment, but overall, it looks like 20 to 30 basis points improved EBIT margins. How could that look if, in fact, these installations start to come back in faster in 2021 just to the overall enterprise margin?"

So it's an imperfect world to predict this, but we feel pretty confident in what we've told you all, which is that for sure, we have had difficulty accessing clients to install our largest and most complex systems. And in a few cases, we have been able to do this some of our larger systems on a virtual basis. So the client really were really needed these systems that were willing to dedicate the people and the time to do it with us. And of course, we had to be creative and fast to do things virtually. 
Now having said that, we've had the FDA and other regulatory agencies auditing us virtually all year, all and clients have done that. And we've done virtual audits of lots of things ourselves, including some aspects of the company that we're in the process of buying. So we're in a virtual world. So kind to predict how comfortable people will get doing things virtually or whether they're just going to want to wait. We think it will be a similar cadence to what we're on. The virus is pretty rough right now. Obviously, so limitation in many of the countries in which we work and we place these systems in the United States, in the U.S. are severe. We're not letting outsiders into our facilities, for instance. 
So the impact of that is as follows: that we don't place the systems, which are large systems, they got large ASPS, and they're quite profitable. But even more importantly than that, every one of these big systems generate substantial amount of revenue of cartridges, reagents and to some extent, and in some instances, our Accugenix ID business. So we're losing all of that associated incremental revenue on all of these systems that weren't placed and still haven't been placed in fiscal '20. 
What you saw in the end of '20, which is, I think, confusing you and I understand why, is less that the sites opened up and more that there was just a surge of demand for cartridges at the end of the year, pretty much with people that have -- we have a large installed base of thousands and thousands of systems, most of which are relatively small. And those -- that's probably a commentary probably to a small extent that people who couldn't get large systems that they're going to use their smaller ones more readily. 
But more importantly than out of commentary on just how much work is out there on testing all of these drugs before they get into the market enhanced slightly by COVID and somewhat by cell and gene therapy. 
So the business -- the demand for the business frustratingly has probably never been as good as it is now. We'll do the best we can being created in installing those systems. But has been not installed, we don't get the incremental revenue, and that's why we're projected to be slightly below the 10% growth. 
The answer to the second part of your question, margins are exceptional in that business, both in the Microbial business into the whole Manufacturing segment. Having said that, they have steadily improved. We think there's a lot of improvement in biologics. And there has been some improvement in our manufacturing capability in Microbial, which has improved the margins as well. So stay tuned."

If we look at some of the other CDMOs, whether it's Catalent with Paragon a Master Cell or Thermal with Brammer, the cost of building out facilities here are not insignificant in the kind of $150 million to $250 million range for commercial cell and gene therapy facilities.

Obviously, there's a substantial installed base already that we're buying. This business is principally GMP cell therapy manufacturing. And secondarily, the production of plasma DNAs. And while the CapEx is substantial, it's less substantial in some aspects of contract manufacturing. So we're not really going head-to-head, for instance, with [indiscernible] Catalent that are more gene therapy manufacturing businesses. And so it's difficult to get sort of what this spend is versus what actually will be, what it will be.

So in terms of COVID and the sort of headwind tailwind here the short answer is we've contemplated a sensible approach, at least we believe, a central approach to what COVID will do in our guidance. So that's baked in. Of course, we don't know what we don't know. Just to unpack that a little bit. So we -- obviously, we had some significant losses because of COVID, particularly in RMS. And we did say at the last earnings call that we expected RMS broadly exiting the year with COVID behind us, and we still believe that to be true. Academics clients seem to be open, and we're not expecting that do a U-turn, but we'll keep an eye out for that. 
We generated $60 million of revenue that was COVID related, both in DSA, some vaccines and some other aspects. Not all of that will go away. We expect to see some of that continue into '21. And that's also baked into the guidance. So there are broadly we feel, the way we're looking at it, we've broadly got COVID behind us other than the things that's already been called out late. We've just been talking about Microbial, for instance, that's a lit bit of a headwind. 
Moving here to your margin question. Just want to call out a few potential opportunities. I just want to make sure that you're cognizant of the unallocated corporate costs. So historically, we've seen a 50 basis point improvement as a percentage of revenue. This year, we're guiding towards pretty much flat to 2020. And the reason for that is that we have got some investments that we are contemplating or in the process of putting in. In fact, when Jim talked at the JPMorgan conference, we talked about 5 different strategic imperatives and 1 of those strategic comparatives was to champion technology. And indeed, I think Jim's just mentioned a few moments ago, the desire to put in best-in-class technology should help our clients essentially access scientific data in real time. So there is some set-up costs associated with that, which means that the unallocated corporate cost is not giving that 50% basis points that we've historically had, but we would expect to have that behind us this year."

We definitely have seen a change in demand, outsourcing demand on the service side of our RMS business, almost entirely from the academic sector, who really were up against it with COVID with facilities that literally were shutting prematurely and a significant amount of research was at risk. And the fact that we were open, that we were capable of doing this and have been able to do it so well for them for this long period of time. I think it's demonstrated sort of the frailties of them continuing to do this internally. So there's no question that we've seen incremental work that was done internally be outsourced. And we're highly confident that a meaningful amount of that has stuck. 
And just a quick side. Similarly, you asked the question about RMS, we saw some of this in Discovery and safety in the second quarter. With clients who either they were using another provider who was incapable of supporting them during the . So the kind of initial outbreaks of COVID and/or their own facilities were shut for some meaningful a period of time, and that caused them to either contemplate outsourcing for the first time, we contemplate more outsourcing that they had done historically. And definitely, based upon the feedback we've gotten from these clients, really pleased with the services that we provide and the speed with which we're doing it and the price points as well. So there's no question that we've got. It's an incremental share that was perhaps not available to anybody that was being done by the clients themselves. And for sure, some work that was outsourced to competition, both in RMS and where they were unable to do that. And that incremental share gain and expectation of continuing to gain share in certain aspects of our business is certainly baked into our 2021 numbers."

Good morning. I'm very pleased to speak with you today about the conclusion of another extraordinary year for Charles River, our expectations for 2021 and the expansion of our early-stage research and manufacturing support portfolio into a complementary high-growth sector.  
2020 was an unprecedented year. COVID-19 pandemic challenged us in many ways. But to date, we've navigated it successfully and reinforced our position as the leading nonclinical CRO. Our success in 2020 was due to the resilience of our business model, a comprehensive business continuity plan that enabled us to keep our worldwide operating sites open and adequately staffed. Our broad scientific capabilities and flexible outsourcing solutions that support our clients' needs and our employees around the world who met client needs through their commitment and dedication.  
As a result, we have now become even more integral to our value clients and more differentiated from the competition. Despite the short-term impact of COVID-related client disruptions, we benefited from robust underlying client demand across most of our businesses. This was largely driven by clients' intensified use of strategic outsourcing to overcome challenges at their own sites as they partnered with us to move their early-stage research programs forward during the pandemic.  
In addition, the record biotech funding environment, which eclipsed $130 billion last year, is allowing our clients to place greater emphasis on R&D investments, particularly in the early stage pipelines. We believe these factors drove our exceptional financial results in the fourth quarter and for the full year.  
We are extremely pleased to report organic revenue growth above 10% in the fourth quarter and 7% for the year. Both metrics are in line with or above our high single-digit organic growth target despite the short-term challenges associated with COVID-19 last year. We also achieved our 2-year operating margin target of 20% for the full year, 1 year ahead of schedule. 
We are continuing to closely monitor COVID-19, but believe our strong performance in 2020 and a continuation of robust demand trends, including record booking and proposal activity in the Safety Assessment business position us well to get off to a strong start in 2021.  
COVID-19 pandemic has also enhanced the global focus on scientific innovation, which is generating biomedical breakthroughs across multiple therapeutic areas, including through COVID-19 vaccines. This innovation has fueled continued investment in and the proliferation of more complex research techniques involving advanced drug modalities, such as cell and gene therapies. The complexity of these new modalities is increasing our clients' reliance on a high-science outsourcing partner like Charles River.  
To enhance our ability to meet our clients' needs in these emerging areas of scientific innovation and to take advantage of the significant growth opportunity that these advanced drug modalities present, we are expanding our portfolio and scientific expertise through a combination of acquisitions, strategic partnerships and internal investments. 
This morning, we announced our intent to acquire Cognate BioServices, a premier CDMO partner for clients comprehensive cell and gene therapy development and manufacturing needs. We believe Cognate, which will become part of our manufacturing segment, is an excellent opportunity to enter the CDMO market because it will allow us to participate in a niche value-added sector with a high-growth profile that adds to our existing nonclinical development and manufacturing support capabilities.  
Let me start by highlighting 3 key aspects of the strategic rationale. Cognate has solutions across the major CDMO platforms for cell and gene therapies. Integrating manufacturing and required analytical testing is critical to drive efficiency, and the cell and gene therapy sector offers exceptional growth potential. Cognate's scientific expertise makes this particularly attractive transaction. It provides CDMO services across both cell and gene therapies with its primary area of expertise in the CGMP cell therapy manufacturing. 
Cognate also has capabilities in the production of plasmid DNA, which is a foundational tool for the development of gene-modified cell therapies and gene therapies as well as other inputs in the CDMO value chain. Cell and gene therapies are emerging drug modalities. And as such, the science will continue to evolve. However, Cognate's broad capability should enable it to better adapt to shifts in the marketplace. Cognate has a track record of producing various cell types and technologies used in cellular immunotherapy and immuno-oncology, regenerative medicine and advanced cell therapy.  
The synergistic fit is the second pillar of the rationale. Cognate will be highly complementary to our existing nonclinical capabilities, establishing a premier scientific partner for cell and gene therapy development, testing and manufacturing and providing clients with an integrated solution from basic research through GMP production. Biopharmaceutical clients are seeking to drive greater efficiency and leverage scientific benefits by working with fewer trusted partners who have broad integrated capabilities.  
As we are already a provider of extensive nonclinical services for cell and gene therapies, the acquisition of Cognate will enable us to produce drugs in these advanced mobilities. We believe the strategic expansion of our portfolio is particularly synergistic with our Biologics Testing Solutions business. It will be ideal for clients to be able to seamlessly conduct analytical testing, process development and manufacturing for advanced modalities with the same scientific partner, enabling them to achieve their goal of driving greater efficiency. 
Our Biologics business is a premier provider of quality control testing, the cell and gene therapies, including assay development, analytical testing and cell banking, which are all critical steps in the manufacturing scale-up and commercial production processes.  
Clients will also have access to our cellular products as the starting point for their cell therapy program and will be able to work with Charles River through every step of the research and early-stage development process before moving into CGMP production with Cognate, accelerating our clients' speed to market for advanced drug modalities. 
With Charles River and Cognate combined, we expect to effectively double the revenue base of our comprehensive cell and gene therapy capabilities to approximately 10% of our total revenue. We believe Cognate will also immediately enhance our growth potential by expanding our capabilities and scale into this complementary high-growth cell and gene therapy sector. The addressable market for Cognate's CDMO services, principally cell therapy and plasmid production, is currently estimated at approximately $1.5 billion and expected to grow at least 25% annually over the next 5 years.  
Growth is being fueled by the robust biotech funding environment. Approximately $20 billion was invested in cell and gene therapy companies in 2020, fueling the rapid rise of cell and gene therapies in the R&D pipeline, which now total over 2,000 programs. We believe the demand for Cognate services will intensify as more of these programs progress into late-stage development and commercialization. The companies that are successful in the market will be able to provide the science, the space and the integrated solutions to broadly support clients cell and gene therapy programs. We intend to be one of these successful companies.  
The purchase price for Cognate is expected to be approximately $875 million in cash and the valuation will be consistent with comparable high-growth, high-science transactions in the cell and gene therapy CDMO sector. Cognate is expected to generate annual revenue of approximately $140 million in 2021, which we project to grow at or above the estimated market rate of at least 25% annually over the next 5 years.  
Because of the market growth potential and the emerging role of cell and gene therapies as treatments for oncology and rare diseases in particular, we believe Cognate will meaningfully enhance our revenue and earnings growth potential and the transaction will achieve our hurdle rates for investment returns. David will provide additional financial details on the transaction, including the estimated 2021 financial impact.  
We look forward to welcoming Cognate's dedicated employees to the Charles River family.  
Now let me give you the highlights of our fourth quarter and full year performance. We reported revenue of $791 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of 14.4% on a reported basis. Robust client demand across all 3 business segments drove organic revenue growth of 10.3%. The DSA and Manufacturing segments reported low double-digit organic growth. The RMS segment's organic growth rate rebounded to a mid-single-digit rate, recovering from COVID-related client disruptions principally in the second quarter. For 2020, revenue was $2.92 billion, with a reported growth rate of 11.5% and an organic growth rate of 7%. We're very pleased with this high single-digit organic growth rate, particularly in light of the revenue headwind from COVID-19.  
The operating margin was 20.8% in the fourth quarter, a decrease of 60 basis points year-over-year. Margin improvement in both RMS and Manufacturing segments was offset by DSA operating margin decline. For the full year, the operating margin increased by 100 basis points to 20%, achieving our target 1 year ahead of schedule. 
This was an exceptional performance, resulting primarily from the inherent operating leverage in our business, our continued efforts to drive operating efficiency and build a more scalable infrastructure and the benefits from the temporary cost reduction initiatives related to COVID-19. Despite achieving our 20% target, we believe we are well positioned to achieve modest operating margin improvement in 2021.  
Earnings per share were $2.39 in the fourth quarter, an increase of 18.9% from $2.01 in the fourth quarter of 2019. For the full year, earnings per share were $8.13, a 20.8% increase over the prior year. We exceeded our prior guidance range of $7.75 to $7.85 due primarily to robust, low double-digit organic revenue growth and favorable below-the-line items for the fourth quarter, including a lower tax rate.  
We are very enthusiastic about the outlook for 2021. We believe our exceptional market position, the strategic expansion of our unique portfolio and our focus on operational excellence, combined with continuing robust client demand position us extremely well for the year ahead. Excluding Cognate, we expect organic revenue growth of 9% to 11% and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $9.00 to $9.25, or an increase of 11% to 14% year-over-year. The acquisition of Cognate is expected to be neutral to non-GAAP earnings per share in '21 and add approximately 400 basis points to the reported revenue growth rate, which equates to a reported revenue growth outlook of 16% to 18% in 2021.  
I'd like to provide you with additional details on our fourth quarter segment performance and our expectations for 2021, beginning with the DSA segment's results. DSA revenue in the fourth quarter was $495 million, an 11.3% increase on an organic basis, driven by robust demand from global biopharmaceutical and biotechnology clients in both Discovery and Safety Assessment.  
For the full year, DSA organic revenue growth was 9.4%. We expect organic revenue growth will be approaching 10% in the DSA segment in 2021 because clients, both large and small, are increasingly choosing to partner with a large, reliable CRO like Charles River. Clients know that utilizing our science, our broad, early-stage portfolio and our flexible outsourcing solutions will propel their research efforts faster and more efficiently than they could do it alone. This was amply demonstrated during the pandemic when they face challenges at their own sites. Robust biotech funding also continues to fuel a healthy demand environment.  
Our Safety Assessment business continued to perform extremely well driven by higher study volume and price increases in the fourth quarter. Bookings and proposal volume reached record levels in the fourth quarter across all regions and major service areas, which we believe positions the Safety Assessment business favorably for a strong first half of 2021. We're pleased with the extensive depth and breadth of our Safety Assessment portfolio and remain intently focused on continuing to enhance the value we provide to our clients.  
We're also seeing greater opportunities to conduct safety and efficacy testing on cell and gene therapies. We believe there is meaningful growth potential inherent in the more than 2,000 programs currently in the cell and gene therapy pipeline, approximately 2/3 of which are in the preclinical phase. The testing requirements of cell and gene therapies vary by molecule from complex combination pharmacology safety studies to certain cell therapies to safety programs that are similar to a traditional large molecules for gene therapies.  
We've already built one of the largest, early-stage testing platforms to support this emerging high-growth sector and intend to continue to adapt and enhance our capabilities to meet the specific needs of these emerging drug modalities.  
We are continuing to add new capabilities across many of our businesses, including through strategic partnerships. Our partnership strategy has proven to be very successful to stay current with cutting-edge technologies and add innovative capabilities with limited upfront risk. In the last several months, we have added new partnerships or expanded existing ones across several businesses, including with Cypre for 3D tumor modeling and screening immuno-oncological compounds in our Discovery business. And with PathoQuest and JADE Biomedical in our Biologics business.  
In addition, last month, we announced the acquisition of Distributed Bio, formerly a strategic partner, through which we established our integrated large molecule discovery platform. This platform filled the gap in our portfolio and expanded our early discovery expertise in the complex drug modality that few CROs can successfully offer. We believe our clients' willingness to outsource more of their discovery programs will be predicated on our ability to continue to add innovative capabilities to meet their critical research needs.  
We believe the combination of the strategic outsourcing trend, deep scientific expertise and our willingness to forge flexible relationships with clients led to the tremendous performance of the Discovery business, which had another exceptional quarter and year. Broad-based demand for our suite of early discovery, oncology and CNS services drove the fourth quarter performance. To achieve our goals in 2021 and beyond, we will continue to strengthen our portfolio by expanding our scale, our science and our innovative technologies. By doing so, we are enabling our clients to remain with one scientific partner from target identification through IND filing and solidifying our position as the leading, early-stage CRO.  
The DSA operating margin was 23.2% in the fourth quarter, a decrease of 240 basis points for the fourth quarter of 2019. The decrease was driven by increased costs due in part to performance-based bonuses and a slightly less favorable study mix in the Safety Assessment business. For 2020, the DSA operating margin improved by 140 basis points to 23.4%. We are pleased with the full year margin expansion in the DSA segment and believe there will be incremental opportunities for improvement.  
RMS revenue in the fourth quarter was $156.7 million, an increase of 5.2% on an organic basis. For the year, RMS organic revenue declined by 3.3%, reflecting an impact of approximately 7% from COVID-19, principally in the second quarter. Our outlook for RMS organic revenue growth will be in the high teens for 2021 as a result of the recovery from last year's COVID-19 headwinds and the incremental benefit from adding the high-growth cell supply businesses to the organic revenue base following the respective anniversaries of the HemaCare and Cellero acquisitions.  
As anticipated, global demand for research models improved in the fourth quarter both on a year-over-year and sequential basis as clients returned to normalized order activity in all geographic regions following COVID-related disruptions earlier in the year. Demand accelerated nicely in the fourth quarter, particularly in China.  
We believe that we benefited from market share gains in 2020, especially with academic clients as research sites reopened and not all suppliers could meet the clients' needs. We will continue to monitor the evolving COVID-19 situation globally, but at this point, it appears that most academic and biopharmaceutical clients have adapted their protocols to continue working during the pandemic.  
The Research Model Services also continue to perform well. GEMS is benefiting from renewed outsourcing demand due in part to COVID-19 challenges at our client sites earlier in the year as well as scientists' use of more complex research models. We're the natural partner for our GEMS clients since we have extensive animal husbandry expertise, which enables us to manage their proprietary model safely and efficiently.  
We're also continuing to generate client interest for Insourcing Solutions through both our CRADL initiative, where we provide turnkey research capacity to our clients as well as through more traditional in-sourced staffing arrangements. 
Revenue for our cell supply businesses, HemaCare and Cellero, increased in the fourth quarter on a comparative basis, but remained at a growth rate below the targeted 30% level. We anticipate that this growth rate will accelerate as COVID-19 constraints ease, and we expect to achieve our growth rate for these businesses in 2021. We continue to work diligently to expand our donor base in the U.S. and add more comprehensive capabilities at all our sites to accommodate the robust demand in the cell therapy market.  
The acquisition of Cognate also positions Charles River as a trusted partner that can move cell therapy program forward using the same cellular product through each step of the research and early-stage development phases and into CGMP production at Cognate.  
The RMS operating margin was 25.1% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 50 basis points from the fourth quarter of '19. The increase was driven by operating leverage from higher sales volumes in the Research Model Business as well as the benefit from operating efficiency initiatives. For 2020, the RMS operating margin declined by 420 basis points to 22% due almost entirely to the impact of COVID-19. With the financial impact of COVID-19 believed to be largely behind us, we expect the RMS operating margin will rebound well above the 25% level in 2021.  
Manufacturing revenue was $139.3 million for the fourth quarter, a growth rate of 12.4% on an organic basis, driven primarily by the Biologics businesses. The Microbial Solutions and Avian Vaccine businesses were also meaningful contributors to the fourth quarter revenue growth. Organic revenue growth for the year was 10.4%. 
Microbial Solutions revenue growth rate improved again in the fourth quarter due in part to year-end ordering trends for Endosafe testing cartridges. We continue to have delayed instrument installations resulting from COVID-19 restrictions at certain client sites. We expect this will constrain the Microbial Solutions revenue growth rate well into 2021, primarily because the incremental revenue stream associated with corresponding sale of consumables, including cartridges, reagents and Accugenix microbial identification services that generally follow the installation of our high-throughput systems will be delayed. This is the primary factor that is expected to cause the segment's organic growth rate to be slightly below 10% in 2021.  
Beyond the COVID-19-related impact, we continue to firmly believe that our ability to provide clients with a comprehensive, rapid and efficient microbial testing solution as well as a high-quality and accurate testing platform are key differentiators from the competition and will lead clients to continue to choose Charles River for the critical quality control testing requirements.  
The Biologics business reported an exceptional quarter in the year with strong double-digit revenue growth. We believe that robust market demand will continue to support Biologics revenue growth in 2021, due largely to demand for testing of cell and gene therapies. We've developed a comprehensive suite of new assays required to support the unique needs of cell and gene therapies and will continue to add assays in 2021 to accommodate the robust demand.  
The acquisition of Cognate is also expected to be highly synergistic to our Biologics business as clients will now be able to outsource GMP cell and gene therapy production and required analytical testing to one scientific partner, reducing the bottlenecks and inefficiencies of utilizing multiple outsourced providers. We also expect to derive a benefit from COVID-19 testing.  
We believe our Biologics business will be providing required reduction testing as many of the vaccines move into the commercial production phase and some of the early-stage testing activity subsides. Given the strength of the demand environment, we are continuing to build upon our extensive portfolio of services to support the safe manufacture of biologics and ensure we have available capacity to accommodate client demand. 
As part of this strategy, we were pleased to recently announce that we have expanded our partnership with PathoQuest to build a next-generation sequencing lab at our Pennsylvania site and partnered with JADE Biomedical to enhance our biologic testing capabilities and geographic reach in China. 
Due to the leverage from strong revenue growth, the Manufacturing Support segment's operating margin was 37.3% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 10 basis points. For the year, the operating margin was 37.4%, above our mid-30% target and consistent with our expectations for 2021, excluding Cognate. 
As I mentioned earlier, we believe that the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that we are even more integral to our clients now. We have been intently focused on accommodating their evolving needs during these challenging times, and many clients have told us that they couldn't move their research forward without us. Clients have outsourced incremental work to us across multiple therapeutic areas because of our deep scientific expertise and the ease and flexibility of working with an integrated, early-stage CRO like Charles River. 
As a result, we generated approximately $60 million of revenue last year from our work on COVID-19 vaccines and related therapeutics. We're proud to have worked on all of the COVID-19 vaccines that have been approved for emergency use by the FDA and in the U.K. to date, including the AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines. AstraZeneca and Moderna are 2 leading biopharmaceutical companies that we have worked closely with under our respective strategic relationships for many years as they have embraced the benefits of outsourcing and driving efficiency through their R&D organizations.  
Our relationships with Moderna and AstraZeneca demonstrate how we can work together towards a common mission to bring breakthrough treatments to market to save lives, which has been particularly critical now as we strive to find a solution to the pandemic.  
As 2020 has demonstrated, we are operating in a robust business environment with excellent growth potential. To continue to successfully execute our strategy to maintain and enhance Charles River's position as the leading, early-stage CRO and expand our manufacturing support to CDMO capabilities, we will continue to make investments in our scientific capabilities through M&A, strategic partnerships and internal development, expand capacity and staff to accommodate demand and exploit our digital enterprise to provide critical data for internal use and to enhance connectivity with our clients.  
We will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities across our businesses and across a number of drug modalities and scientific capabilities. We will invest in a disciplined manner, strengthening our portfolio and focusing on speed and responsiveness as we meet our clients' individual needs and promote a more efficient drug development model. Our goal is to enhance our position as a trusted scientific partner for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, and government and nongovernmental organizations worldwide. By providing exceptional value to our clients, we believe we will continue to deliver greater value to our shareholders.  
In conclusion, I want to thank our employees for their exceptional work and commitment, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. And our shareholders for their support.  
Now I'd like David Smith to give you additional details on our financial performance and 2021 guidance as well as additional details on the acquisition of Cognate."
91093,701730044,2213769,"Charles River Laboratories International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2021",2021-02-17,"Earnings Calls","Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Before I begin, may I remind you that I'll be speaking primarily to non-GAAP results, which exclude amortization and other acquisition-related charges, costs related primarily to our global efficiency initiatives, our ven",1595,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Before I begin, may I remind you that I'll be speaking primarily to non-GAAP results, which exclude amortization and other acquisition-related charges, costs related primarily to our global efficiency initiatives, our venture capital and other strategic investment performance and certain other items. Many of my comments will also refer to organic revenue growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation.  
My discussion this morning will focus primarily on our financial guidance for 2021, which principally excludes the impact of Cognate BioServices. We expect 2021 reported revenue growth of 12% to 14%, excluding Cognate, and organic revenue growth of 9% to 11%, which includes a benefit of the favorable year-over-year comparison to last year's COVID-19 revenue impact. 
Sustained client demand, including record fourth quarter bookings and proposal volume in our Safety Assessment business and a robust biotech funding environment support our growth outlook for 2021.  
Based on this strong revenue growth and with modest operating margin expansion in 2021, we believe we are well positioned this year to deliver non-GAAP earnings per share between $9 and $9.25. This equates to year-over-year earnings per share growth of approximately 11% to 14%, which is similar to our top line growth outlook as higher revenue and margin improvement will be partially offset by a higher tax rate.  
Foreign exchange is expected to provide a 200 to 250 basis points benefit to our reported revenue growth guidance for 2021 as a result of the weakening U.S. dollar. Our FX rate estimates are based on the bank forecast for the year, which are currently very close to spot rates. 
We have provided information on our 2020 revenue by currency and the foreign exchange rates that we are assuming for 2021 on Slide 40, and we'll continue to monitor fluctuations in the currency market as we progress through the year.  
From a segment perspective, our revenue outlook reflects the strong business environment and the fact that most of our businesses have recovered from COVID-19-related disruptions in 2020. The RMS segment is expected to achieve high teens organic revenue growth in 2021 as client order activity for research models rebounds from COVID-19 and the growth rate of HemaCare and Cellero cell supply businesses accelerates to targeted levels. 
We expect the DSA segment to deliver organic revenue growth approaching 10% in 2021 and Manufacturing to grow slightly below 10% on an organic basis as Robust Biologics demand is partially offset by the continuing impact of COVID on Microbial Solutions. We were very pleased that the operating margin improved by 100 basis points to 20% in 2020 and that we achieved our target of a 20% full year operating margin 1 year ahead of plan.  
Building upon this performance, we believe that we are well positioned to drive additional margin improvement for the full year 2021 despite modest pressures on Manufacturing due to Cognate as we continue to leverage strong revenue growth and maintain our focus on operational excellence.  
On a segment basis, RMS is expected to be a primary contributor to margin improvement in 2021, increasing from the COVID-suppressed levels of 2020 to well above 25% this year. The DSA operating margin is expected to continue to make progress toward the mid-20s target, and the Manufacturing operating margin is expected to be similar to the 2020 level before Cognate. 
We expect unallocated corporate expense in 2021 to be in the mid-5% range as a percentage of revenue or similar to 5.6% of revenue last year. Our scalable infrastructure enables us to drive greater efficiency, even as we periodically reinvest to meet our goals and the needs of our clients.  
Total adjusted net interest expense is expected to decrease to a range of $66 million to $68 million in 2021, excluding Cognate compared to approximately $74 million last year. We expect the decrease driven by lower average debt balances as well as lower variable interest rates. 
The non-GAAP tax rate for 2021 is expected to be in the low 20% range, an increase from 18.9% in 2020. The increase in the tax rate is principally an issue of comparison to 2020 because last year's tax rate was reduced mainly by discrete tax benefits associated with state tax returns and foreign tax credits.  
As a reminder, the first quarter tax rate has been meaningfully lower in recent years due primarily to the excess tax benefit related to stock compensation. Given our current stock price, we expect this to be true in 2021, resulting in a non-GAAP tax rate in the mid-teens in the first quarter.  
We remain intently focused on driving strong free cash flow growth as a key measure of our financial performance. In 2020, free cash flow was $380 million, an increase of 12% from 2019, but below our prior guidance. The decrease in the fourth quarter resulted primarily from higher capital expenditures, which totaled $166.6 million. This was above our prior outlook of $130 million due to 2 factors: paying capital invoices ahead of schedule in order to give a discount as well as the timing of capital projects. Some projects that were slow due to the COVID-related challenges in the second quarter resumed in response to the reacceleration of growth and business activity.  
At the end of the fourth quarter, our total debt balance was essentially unchanged sequentially at $1.9 million, but our gross leverage ratio decreased to 2.3x, primarily because of the strong fourth quarter performance.  
With our leverage ratio below 2.5x, we will benefit from interest savings on our variable rate debt, reducing the rate by 12.5 basis points to LIBOR plus 112.5 basis points.  
For 2021, we expect free cash flow to be in the range of $415 million to $435 million based on the anticipated strong operating performance of our business and our continued focus on working capital management.  
Capital expenditures this year are expected to total approximately $180 million, excluding Cognate.  
Currently, we do not intend to repurchase any shares in 2021 and expect to exit the year with a diluted share count slightly more than 51 million shares. The FX benefit is expected to largely offset the earnings per share dilution from the higher share count. 
A summary of our 2021 financial guidance, excluding Cognate, can be found on Slide 49.  
Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2021, we expect year-over-year revenue growth will be in the low double-digit range on a reported basis and approaching 10% on an organic basis. We expect earnings per share to increase at a high-teens rate year-over-year from $1.84 in the first quarter of last year. As I mentioned earlier, the first quarter tax rate is expected to be in the mid-teens, primarily due to the excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation.  
Before I conclude, I'll provide some details on our financial outlook, including the acquisition of Cognate. Assuming the acquisition closes by the end of the first quarter, Cognate is expected to add approximately $110 million to revenue for the partial year, resulting in a revenue growth outlook of 16% to 18%. We expect Cognate to be neutral to non-GAAP earnings per share in 2021, so do not expect the acquisition to have a meaningful impact on our current guidance. 
The acquisition is not expected to have a meaningful impact to Charles River's consolidated operating margin this year so we continue to expect to generate modest margin improvement with Cognate. We believe there will be opportunities to improve Cognate's operating margin over the next few years as we deliver acquisition synergies, enhance the scale of the business and drive operating efficiency. We intend to update our full guidance and other financial metrics to reflect Cognate next quarter once the acquisition closes.  
From both strategic and financial perspective, we believe the acquisition will deliver a compelling benefit that will generate value for shareholders. As a premier cell and gene therapy CDMO, we expect Cognate to boost the growth potential of our business and be increasingly accretive to non-GAAP earnings after the first year.  
Due to the high-growth nature of the emerging cell and gene therapy sector, we expect to pay 23x adjusted EBITDA for the next 12 months after the close. We expect the transaction will achieve our return on invested capital hurdle rate, which is to meet or exceed our cost of capital by year 3 or 4. 
We plan to finance the Cognate acquisition through our current revolving credit facility, and we will also evaluate opportunities to further optimize our capital structure given the attractive interest rate environment. Our pro forma gross leverage ratio at closing is expected to increase into the low 3x range, which is consistent with the levels after other recent transactions. Also consistent with prior deals, we will focus on repaying debt in a timely manner following the acquisition and reducing leverage to our targeted level below 3x.  
In conclusion, we are very pleased with our 2020 financial performance and believe that we are positioned to have another strong year in 2021. Over the past 5 years, we have achieved compound annual growth of 15% for revenue, 16% for earnings per share, 15% for operating cash flow, and 10% for free cash flow. With Cognate and future acquisitions as well as continuation of the robust underlying demand environment, we believe that we will be able to achieve similar growth metrics over the next 5 years. We intend to provide a business update and more details on our longer-term outlook, including our updated financial targets at a virtual Investor Day in the spring. Thank you."

So we'll say more, of course, in a few weeks or a months' time when we come to do that. But yes, I think it's definitely on the cards that with a low interest rate environment, we ought to take advantage of that. And so although we can fund the investment initially through our revolver, and we'll do that, we will be keeping a close eye on actually what markets might do in terms of longer-term interest rates for our bonds.  
In terms of the DSA margin, there were 2 aspects that drove that. But if I just step back a moment, you -- as everybody knows, we've been trying to get to the 20% overall margin for Charles River for some time now. Really pleased that we've achieved it this year. Really pleased that we did it 1 year ahead of schedule. And DSA was a meaningful contributor to that.  
So the margin grew 140 basis points over the full year. But we did have a slight decline in Q4. And that's partly to do with higher performance-based compensation. I mean we had the 9.4% organic revenue growth. I just mentioned, the 140 basis point margin improvement so the wider DSA team absolutely deserve the compensation that they've got there.  
Secondly, to your question on the steady mix. And we've had this conversation a few years ago, where we have a situation where we've got a disproportion amount of studies that have large models and so did additional costs initially when those studies kick off. But if profitability improves over the course of the study and overall, you end up with similar sorts of margins.  
So mix is to tend to fluctuate. Sometimes it balances off to get the portfolio occasionally, you get like we have in Q4, like we had a few years ago, where we've got a particular heavy load and the like on studies that have larger costs at the beginning.  
So overall, yes, we're very pleased with the potential for DSA. Still striving to move that towards the 25%, which I think Jim mentioned in his prepared remarks as well. So this Q4 impact is mostly transitory."

Jim, in the WIL acquisition, there was a small CDMO that came along with it, and you decided to sell that, kind of decided that you didn't want to be at least in that CDMO business. So Part A of the question here is elaborate a little bit on why the CDMO opportunity in cell and gene therapy is more attractive to you for Charles River to get into. 
And then Part B, the question is to flesh out a little bit more of the pieces that you've now assembled with your cell supply, your complementary biologics testing capabilities, et cetera, a little bit more of the continuum? And are there -- is that fairly complete at this point? Or are there other additional capabilities that you feel like you need to fill into white space in your C&GT business?"

So many years ago, we did acquire a small molecule CDMO. And it was a perfectly good business. And you'll recall, kind of we told that we -- we told you and other analysts and shareholders that we had done an exhaustive analysis of the industry, and we had decided that it was -- there were some very, very big players and it would be difficult for us to achieve scale. And since we like to be, if possible, the premier player in the spaces in which we work, we just -- we thought it was best to exit, which we did. And at that time, perhaps overstated, I desired to remain out of it. 
But as you know, over the last couple of years in conversations with us, I think several things have happened. Number one, cell and gene therapy has heated up dramatically. Number two, that brings with us both an opportunity to make a niche play in the CDMO space and be minimally a leader, which we're entering with this asset as a leader in the space and potentially the leader over time. So we -- so that sort of dovetails with the original comments that we made. 
You've got this $20 billion of investment in cell and gene therapy. Just in 2020, you've got 2,000 drugs that have been filed. The vast majority, over 2/3 or 3 quarters, I think, are in preclinical and Phase I. So the demand has heated up dramatically. We have a lot of inbound. Our M&A is derived from requests from clients for products and services that they need that they'd like us to have, either because they trust us more or they're unable or incapable of getting these elsewhere. So this feels like -- it fills a very important gap in the portfolio. I don't think it would be lethal had we not done this, but it would cause clients to have to go outside to get their drugs manufactured. 
So just to continue to comment and answer your second question. We now have an extremely broad portfolio. So you're starting with us literally with the cells via research and development. We're going to be able to do process development for you of your drug. We're all obviously going to be able to test that drug in our Discovery and Safety business. We're going to be able to manufacture that drug for the clinic and hopefully, the commercial purposes. And our Biologics business is going to test those drugs before they're going to the clinic or into the marketplace. 
So it's a very, very comprehensive suite. As you heard us say, cell and gene therapy is going to move with this deal from about 5% of our consolidated revenues in fiscal '21 to 10%. So it's a major move for us strategically, but we're doing that entirely in response to our clients. So clients can stay with us through the development of the cell and gene therapy products, particularly cell therapy products where the preponderance of this business is focused and an opportunity to be a leading player in this segment."

Obviously, there's very few commercial products that exist in cell and gene therapy period, although so many being worked on right now. 
So that certainly would be the goal and the strategy we anticipate. We certainly have the technical ability, regulatory ability, knowledge of CGMP production in cellular therapy from people that have come from a host of different company backgrounds to form a very strong management team there.  
Capacity, like all of our businesses that are growing, will be important as we built out somewhat in advance of having the demand and anticipating the demand. I do think the clients of Cognate's will be very pleased to see it in our hands because there's the uncertainty of being private equity owned and what's the future and what's the investment portfolio. So I do think that clients who are working with this company now in the clinic, whose drugs are progressing nicely, will have a high degree of confidence if the drug makes it that we could and perhaps should be their commercial producers. So we like that sort of entry point here with a bunch of increased business with our access to clients with their footprint and with this being part of our overall portfolio."

So congratulations. My question is around the margin profile. Clearly, you exceeded your margin expectations by a year. But from everything I'm hearing, it sounds like there's a real nice opportunity for long-term margin expansion, right? You talked about the complexity of the projects that you are working on. And even when I think about sort of the strategic outsourcing, it seems that we're starting to hear from some companies that they're looking to downsize their own facilities and their own sort of workspace, which I equate to kind of like 5, 10 years ago, what we saw in the talks were kind of like capacity was coming down, which gave you an opportunity. 
So how should we think about that margin expansion and opportunity? And when you give us those long-term goals, is it going to be kind of like a 2-year goal? Or are we thinking longer-term here, especially given kind of like the Cognate acquisition that really opens this new and growing market opportunity?"

And I think we'll leave sort of the overall deep dive on this important subject with you entirely until we give longer-term guidance. But I think as a bottom line proposition, we are organized to drive efficiency throughout all of our businesses. We are organized to keep our G&A load as flat as possible as the business continues to grow and could -- we've demonstrated that over the last few years. We've also demonstrated our ability to drive efficiency. We're going to be doing some more work on the digital front, which will provide greater connectivity amongst our sites internally and externally, and we'll certainly take time out of the process that should generate better returns also. 
We certainly will continue to have pricing power across all of our businesses, which I think you are alluding to with the outsourcing demand. There's basically biotech. We have a big pharma footprint. Biotech is the principal driver of our growth. Biotech is extraordinarily well funded, and biotech has no internal capacity and doesn't want to have it.  
So I would say, first and foremost, our biggest business segment, which is DSA, definitely has meaningful margin opportunity going forward. We still have some major acquisitions in that business that have improved nicely but still have more margin to contribute. And I think efficiency across all of those businesses will be significant. The company that we just bought will continue to have improved margin opportunity. You've got to see RMS get back to kind of historical levels to '21. And then I think it should improve, particularly since it has that attractive cell product aspect to it. I think the Manufacturing segment can always get better. We'll see how we decide to say about that. The margins being at 37% are obviously quite extraordinary.  
Having said that, I think there's probably still opportunity in the Biologics business to drive growth. So you should see some modest improvement in '21, as we said in our prepared remarks and certainly more on a forward going basis, and we'll give you a deep definitive dive on that in the not-too-distant future."

Are you seeing a benefit in your Research Model volumes as clients might need to migrate towards smaller volumes in the absence of the bigger models? This is a dynamic that I've been sort of tracking.  
And then the last thing is on HemaCare and Cellero, it seems like the revenue that came in, in the quarter was a little bit lighter than expected. And so just curious if you're seeing a lingering impact from the pandemic on the donation centers? I'll leave it there."

We had shutters down, and then we opened it in May. It's been improving steadily. There's still some -- obviously, some social distancing going on, and we're always looking for new donors. So probably some slight drag coming out of the year. As we said in our prepared remarks, we anticipate that we'll continue to improve both as COVID becomes less severe, hopefully. But even if it doesn't, we feel we have the operational knowledge to structure this in a way that we should achieve the goal. So we had next year's targets, which is north of 30%. So that will continue to participate -- to grow nicely.  
In fact, you're going to ask another question on nonhuman primate. So I'll answer the one I thought you were going to ask and answer the one that you did ask, why is that the supply is definitely constrained around the world? I think we've done an exceptional job in adding, ensuring, tightening up, expanding our supply sources so that we have multiple supply sources for multiple countries such that we can support the demand, which is quite significant. The sort of changing out of species and moving to smaller species, maybe we should have an offline conversation on that. I just don't think that's -- I don't think that's happening. Work on large molecules really has to be done on larger species to get the sort of quality results that we're looking for. So I think NHPs will continue to play a critical role.  
In terms of pent-up demand for RMS, I think we've seen much of that play through the academic medical centers that were totally or partially shut in -- basically in all 3 geographic locals. Asia, Europe and the U.S. have essentially all opened. We don't believe, regardless of the level of infection with COVID, that they're going to go down -- go back in the lockdown. The research is too important. They're sorry that they shut them down, and they definitely now had to work with other agents around and given that their laboratories are usually all gone down.  
So we think that we're back in kind of a normal cadence in RMS for the products, which is principally what you're talking about, the services, obviously, we're not only unaffected, but I think benefited from some of the COVID disruption that our competitors saw. But in terms of production sale of research models, I think we're back to normal cadence, both in volume and price, enhanced by the cellular products of business that continues to grow."

So just wanted to understand a little bit better what needs to kind of change at the client front in your mind to see a reacceleration of these installations? And then relatedly, I think you gave some commentary on margins by segment, but overall, it looks like 20 to 30 basis points improved EBIT margins. How could that look if, in fact, these installations start to come back in faster in 2021 just to the overall enterprise margin?"

So it's an imperfect world to predict this, but we feel pretty confident in what we've told you, which is that, for sure, we have had difficulty accessing clients to install our largest and most complex systems. And in a few cases, we have been able to do this with some of our larger systems on a virtual basis. So the clients really were -- really needed these systems and were willing to dedicate the people and the time to do with us. And of course, we had to be creative and facile to do things virtually.  
Now having said that, we've had the FDA and other regulatory agencies auditing us virtually all year, all of 2020, and clients have done that. And we've done virtual audits of lots of things ourselves, including some aspects of the company that we're in the process of buying. So we're in a virtual world. So it's hard to predict how comfortable people will get doing things virtually or whether they're just going to want to wait. We think it will be a similar cadence to what we're on. The virus is pretty rough right now, obviously. So limitations in many of the countries in which we work and we place these systems in many of the states in the U.S. are severe. We're not letting outsiders into our facilities, for instance.  
So the impact of that is as follows that we don't place the systems which are large systems. They got large ASPs, and they're quite profitable. But even more importantly than that, every one of these big systems generate substantial amount of revenue of cartridges, reagents and to some extent and in some instances, our Accugenix ID business. So we're losing all of that associated incremental revenue on all of these systems that weren't placed and still haven't been placed in fiscal '20.  
What you saw in the end of '20, which is, I think, confusing you and I understand why, is less that the sites opened up and more that there was just a surge of demand for cartridges at the end of the year, pretty much with people that have -- we have a large installed base of thousands and thousands of systems, most of which are relatively small. And those -- that's probably a commentary probably to a small extent that people who couldn't get large systems that they're going to use their smaller ones more readily. But more importantly than out of commentary on just how much work is out there on testing all of these drugs before they get into the market enhanced slightly by COVID and somewhat by cell and gene therapy.  
So the business -- the demand for the business frustratingly has probably never been as good as it is now. We'll do the best we can being created in installing those systems. But as they are not installed, we don't get the incremental revenue, and that's why we're projected to be slightly below the 10% growth. 
The answer to the second part of your question, margins are exceptional in that business, both in the Microbial business and the whole Manufacturing segment. Having said that, they have steadily improved. We think there's a lot of improvement in Biologics. And there has been some improvement in our manufacturing capability in Microbial, which has improved the margins as well. So stay tuned."

Jim, starting with Cognate. I want to go back to John Kreger's question on CapEx. If we look at some of the other CDMOs, whether it's Catalent with Paragon and MaSTherCell or Thermo with Brammer, the cost of building out facilities here are not insignificant in the kind of $150 million to $250 million range for commercial cell and gene therapy facilities. So in the context of your CapEx guidance being $180 million, I'm just curious how we should be thinking about your willingness to take on maybe more -- much more significant investments.  
And then 2 quick follow-ups for David on guidance. I'm curious if you can break out any COVID contribution. I know it was $60 million in 2020. So what's baked in for 2021? And then on the margins, it does seem like there's a couple of potential drivers to the upside here. You did have the DSA price increase you flagged. RMS recovering from COVID suppressed levels and then the Manufacturing installation tailwinds -- sorry, headwinds wearing off. So all of those seem like they could get you above modest improvement, but I'm just curious if there are more meaningful offsets that would continue that."

Obviously, there's a substantial installed base already that we're buying. This business is principally GMP cell therapy manufacturing. And secondarily, the production of plasmid DNAs. And while the CapEx is substantial, it's less substantial in some aspects of contract manufacturing. 
So we're not really going head-to-head, for instance, with Thermo and Catalent that are more gene therapy manufacturing businesses. And -- so it's difficult to get sort of what the spend is versus what actually will be. They won't be -- it won't be insignificant, but it will be a lower order of magnitude, one that we're pretty confident we'll get substantial returns on and that we've already obviously baked through our model, and we'll give you clarity on it as soon as we close this deal.

So that's baked in. Of course, we don't know what we don't know. Just to unpack that a little bit. So we -- obviously, we had some significant losses because of COVID, particularly in RMS. And we did say at the last earnings call that we expected RMS to be broadly exiting the year with COVID behind us, and we still believe that to be true. In academics, clients seem to be open, and we're not expecting that do a U-turn, but we'll keep an eye out for that.  
We generated $60 million of revenue that was COVID related, both in DSA, some vaccines and some other aspects. Not all of that will go away. We expect to see some of that continue into '21. And that's also baked into the guidance. So there are puts, there are takes. Broadly, we feel, the way we're looking at it, we've broadly got COVID behind us other than the things that's already been called out late. We've just been talking about Microbial, for instance, that's a lit bit of a headwind.  
Moving ahead to your margin question. Just want to call out a few potential opportunities. I just want to make sure that you're cognizant of the unallocated corporate costs. So historically, we've seen a 50 basis point improvement as a percentage of revenue. This year, we're guiding towards pretty much flat 2020. And the reason for that is that we have got some investments that we are contemplating or in the process of putting in. 
In fact, when Jim talked at the JPMorgan conference, we talked about 5 different strategic imperatives and 1 of those strategic imperatives was to champion technology. And indeed, I think Jim's just mentioned a few moments ago, the desire to put in best-in-class technology should help our clients essentially access scientific data in real time. So there is some set-up costs associated with that, which means that the unallocated COVID cost is not giving that 50% basis points that we've historically had, but we would expect to have that behind us this year."

We definitely have seen a change in demand, outsourcing demand on the service side of our RMS business, almost entirely from the academic sector, who really were up against it with COVID with facilities that literally were shutting prematurely and a significant amount of research was at risk. And the fact that we were open, that we were capable of doing this and have been able to do it so well for them for this amount of period of time, I think it demonstrated sort of the frailties of them continuing to do this internally. So there's no question that we've seen incremental work that was done internally be outsourced. And we're highly confident that a meaningful amount of that has stuck.  
And just a quick side. Similarly, you asked the question about RMS, we saw some of this in Discovery and Safety in the second quarter with clients who either they were using another provider who was incapable of supporting them during the sort of -- kind of initial outbreaks of COVID and/or their own facilities were shut for some meaningful period of time, and that caused them to either contemplate outsourcing for the first time and contemplate more outsourcing that they had done historically. And definitely, based upon the feedback we've gotten from these clients, really pleased with the services that we provide and the speed with which we're doing it and the price points as well. So there's no question that we've got. It's an incremental share that was perhaps not available to anybody, that was being done by the clients themselves. And for sure, some work that was outsourced to competition, both in RMS and in DSA where they were unable to do that. And that incremental share gain and expectation of continuing to gain share in certain aspects of our business is certainly baked into our 2021 numbers."

Theoretically and practically utilizing, if you take a look at the data that we have on thousands and thousands and thousands of molecules some of which have succeeded and many of which have failed, is -- can be highly important and predictive. 
How robust that technology is, how quickly regulators adopt it, how quickly our clients embrace it is really hard to tell. What technology do we utilize as we make these small investments in these technology deals, we're going to definitely get access to multiple different ways of utilizing that data. And we may use them in combination or we may just have one that prevails. We've done a lot of work on this internally and with a bunch of world-class experts. And while we think there's an ongoing role, we want to be very careful in terms of how we invest the shareholders' money and the assumptions that we make on sort of adoption by the users and not either invest in a wrong technology or invest too aggressively prematurely. 
So on a very measured but very thoughtful basis, we're going to continue to play in it. And I would say that it's more than use the word dabble. I don't really feel that we're dabbling in. I think that we're -- we're seriously investigating the best way to utilize our capabilities in concert with some powerful AI tools.

Good morning. I'm very pleased to speak with you today about another exceptional quarter at Charles River. Our robust first quarter financial performance, highlighted by 13% organic revenue growth and 170 basis points of year-over-year opera",2395,"Thanks, Todd. Good morning. I'm very pleased to speak with you today about another exceptional quarter at Charles River. Our robust first quarter financial performance, highlighted by 13% organic revenue growth and 170 basis points of year-over-year operating margin improvement, demonstrates the strength of the biopharmaceutical market environment and the power of our unique portfolio, both of which we believe are as strong as they have ever been. We believe clients are increasingly choosing to partner with us for our flexible and efficient outsourcing solutions, with scientific depth and breadth of our portfolio and our unwavering focus on seamlessly serving their diverse needs. Clients are opting to work with a smaller number of CROs who offer broader scientific capabilities which enables them to drive greater efficiency and accelerate the speed of the research, nonclinical development and manufacturing programs. The complexity of scientific research is also increasing our clients' reliance on a high-science outsourcing partner like Charles River. 
To further differentiate ourselves from the competition, We are strategically expanding our portfolio in areas that deliver the greatest value to clients and offers significant growth potential. Already this year, we have enhanced our scientific capabilities for advanced drug modalities through the acquisitions of Distributed Bio, Cognate BioServices and Retrogenix. Distributed Bio and Retrogenix strengthen our discovery portfolio; and the acquisition of Cognate, which was completed on March 29, provides an excellent growth opportunity by allowing us to offer CDMO services in the high-growth, high-science cell and gene therapy sector. We are very pleased to welcome the talented staff of each organization to Charles River and believe that by continuing to invest in our portfolio and our people, we are maintaining and enhancing our position as the leading nonclinical CRO. We believe the strength of our portfolio and robust industry fundamentals are leading to unprecedented client demand across most of our businesses. 
In the first quarter, we experienced a continuation of the robust demand from the end of last year, including new record booking and proposal levels in the Safety Assessment business. Organic revenue was about 10% for a second consecutive quarter, even after normalizing for last year's COVID-19 impact. Overall, we believe our robust first quarter performance and solid business trends support our improved outlook for the year. 
I will now provide highlights of our first quarter performance. Quarterly revenue surpassed $800 million for the first time and an $824.6 million for the first quarter of 2021, represented a 16.6% increase over last year. Organic revenue growth of 13% was driven by double-digit growth across all 3 segments. The year-over-year comparison to last year's COVID-related revenue impact, which primarily affected the RMS segment, contributed approximately 140 basis points to the revenue growth rate this quarter. 
We experienced broad-based growth across all client segments, with biotech clients leading the way as they continue to benefit from a robust funding environment. The operating margin was 20.7%, an increase of 170 basis points year-over-year. The improvement was driven by RMS and DSA segments and reflected operating leverage and the robust revenue growth as well as our continued efforts to drive efficiency. We expect the same factors will drive margin improvement for the year and believe the operating margin will approach 21%, above our prior target. 
Earnings per share were $2.53 in the first quarter, an increase of 37.5% from $1.84 in the first quarter of last year. This outstanding earnings growth principally reflected the double-digit revenue growth and meaningful operating margin improvement. Based on the first quarter performance and our positive outlook for the remainder of the year, we are meaningfully increasing our revenue growth and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance for 2021. We now expect organic revenue growth in a range of 12% to 14%, a 300 basis point increase from our prior range. 
Normalized for last year's COVID-19 impact, we would still expect low double-digit organic revenue growth this year. Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be $9.75 to $10, which represents 20% to 23% year-over-year growth and an increase of $0.75 at the midpoint from our prior outlook. 
I'd like to provide you with details on the first quarter segment performance, beginning with the DSA segment. Revenue was $501.2 million in the first quarter, an 11.6% increase on an organic basis over the first quarter 2020 driven by broad-based demand for both Discovery and Safety Assessment. Safety Assessment business continued to perform exceptionally well, reflecting robust demand from both biotech and global biopharma clients and price increases. Bookings and proposal volume reached record highs in the first quarter, with strength across all regions and major service areas. Bookings increased substantially more than our target. Clients are expanding our preclinical pipeline and intensifying their focus on complex biologics. And we believe they are securing space with us further in advance to ensure they do not delay the research, which in turn provides us with greater visibility. We believe this positions the Safety Assessment business extremely well and supports low double-digit organic revenue growth in the DSA segment this year, which is higher than our prior outlook. We are pleased with the extensive depth and breadth of our Safety Assessment portfolio and remain intently focused on continuing to enhance the value we provide to our clients. 
The Discovery business had another exceptional quarter, led by broad-based demand for oncology, early discovery and CNS services. Our efforts to broaden and strengthen our discovery capabilities and enhance our scientific expertise are enabling us to expand the support we provide for our clients' discovery research, and clients increasingly view Charles River as a premier scientific partner who can support their efforts to identify new drug targets and discover novel therapeutics. 
We intend to build our Discovery portfolio so that clients can outsource complex discovery projects to us, including for advanced modalities. Our recent acquisitions Distributed Bio and Retrogenix enhance our large molecule discovery capabilities. Retrogenix through its proprietary cell microarray technology offers target receptor identification and off-target screening services, which will enhance our clients' early discovery efforts and also enable them to explore potential preclinical safety liabilities. Combination of Distributed Bio, our large molecule discovery platform and Retrogenix capabilities will further strengthen our integrated end-to-end solution to therapeutic antibody and cell and gene therapy discovery and development. 
We are also continuing to add cutting-edge technologies through our strategic partnership strategy, most recently with the new artificial intelligence or AI drug discovery partner Valence Discovery. The DSA operating margin increased by 180 basis points to 23.8% in the first quarter. Leverage from the robust DSA revenue growth was the primary driver of margin improvement, and we expect this trend will continue to propel the DSA margin into the mid-20% range for the year. 
RMS revenue was $176.9 million, an increase of 14.8% on an organic basis over the first quarter of 2020. Robust demand for research models in China was the primary driver of first quarter RMS revenue growth, and higher revenue for research model services, including GEMS and our CRADL initiative, also contributed. Approximately 620 basis points of the increase was attributable to the comparison to last year's COVID-related revenue impact from client site closures and disruption. 
Demand trends for the research models were largely consistent with those prior to the pandemic, with growth in China widely outpacing mature markets. Research models business in China had an exceptional quarter even after normalizing for last year's COVID-19 impact, driven by a resurgence in demand across all segments. Biomedical research in China has returned to pre-COVID levels, and in some areas, even greater levels. In the U.S. and Europe, client order activity has also rebounded. 
Research Model Services also continued to perform well. GEMS is benefiting from renewed outsourcing demand as our clients seek greater flexibility and efficiency afforded to them when we manage their proprietary model colonies, as we did for many clients during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, complex research models will play an increasingly critical role as drug research continues to shift to oncology, rare disease and cell and gene therapies, which reinforces the value proposition for the GEMS business. 
We are also continuing to generate substantial client interest for our CRADL initiative or Charles River Accelerator and Development Labs, as both small and large biopharmaceutical clients increasingly seek turnkey research capacity, which allows them to invest in people and research instead of infrastructure. We have CRADL sites in the Boston, Cambridge, Massachusetts area and South San Francisco Biohubs and are actively expanding in these regions to accommodate client demand. Utilizing CRADL also provides clients with collaborative opportunities to seamlessly access other Charles River services from Discovery to GEMS, which further enhances the speed and efficiency of their research programs. 
Revenue growth for our cell supply businesses, HemaCare and Cellero, remained below the targeted level in the first quarter due to some limitations on donor access. We believe cell supply revenue will increase during the year as donor availability continues to improve. We are also continuing to work diligently to expand our donor base in the U.S. and add more comprehensive capabilities at all of our sites to accommodate the robust demand in the broader cell therapy market. We believe that the acquisition of Cognate is particularly timing -- timely because it creates new business opportunities for HemaCare and Cellero in the cell and gene therapy development area. Our expanded capabilities are expanding -- are establishing Charles River as a trusted partner, who can move clients programs forward using the same cellular products through each step of research and early-stage development phases and into CGMP production. 
In the first quarter, the RMS operating margin increased 570 basis points to 28.7%. This significant improvement is due to 2 factors. First, last year's 23% margin was depressed by the onset of COVID-related client disruptions and the resulting impact on the research model order activity. In addition, this year's performance reflects the operating leverage attributable to the robust revenue growth, particularly for research models in China. 
Revenue for the Manufacturing segment was $146.5 million, a 15.6% increase on an organic basis over the first quarter of last year. The increase was driven by double-digit revenue growth in both the Biologics Testing Solutions and Microbial Solutions businesses. The Manufacturing segment's first quarter operating margin was stable at 35.5%. This is consistent with the historical trend in the first quarter and in line with our revised expectations in 2021 for a mid-30% operating margin when factoring in the Cognate acquisition. 
Microbial Solutions growth rate rebounded above the 10% level in the first quarter, reflecting strong demand for our Endosafe endotoxin testing systems, cartridges and core reagents for all geographic regions. We continue to work through the delayed instrument installations that resulted from COVID-19 restrictions and are gaining access to more client sites. 
We are pleased with the strength of the underlying demand for our endotoxin testing platform, which performs FDA-mandated lot-release testing for our clients' critical quality control testing needs. Clients prefer our comprehensive and efficient microbial testing solutions because of the quality, speed and accuracy of our testing platform. 
The Biologics business reported another exceptional quarter of strong double-digit revenue growth principally driven by robust market demand for testing cell and gene therapies and COVID-19 therapeutics. We believe cell and gene therapies will continue to be significant growth drivers for the years to come. And demand for COVID-19 vaccine testing is intensifying as these therapies move on to the commercial production phase even as some of the early-stage testing activity subsides. Given the strength of the demand environment, we are continuing to build our extensive portfolio of services to support the safe manufacture of Biologics to ensure we have available capacity to accommodate client demand. 
We believe the acquisition of Cognate will be highly complementary to our Biologics business and our portfolio as a whole. The acquisition establishes Charles River as a premier scientific partner to cell and gene therapy development, testing and manufacturing. 
Our broader services will provide clients with an integrated solution from basic research through CGMP production, enabling them to outsource CGMP cell therapy production and the required analytical testing to one scientific partner, reducing the bottlenecks and efficiencies of utilizing multiple outsourced providers. Because we already were a provider of extensive nonclinical services for cell and gene therapies, our integration process, which is proceeding smoothly, is particularly focused on unlocking new business opportunities across our portfolio. The acquisition of Cognate is part of our ongoing strategy to broaden our unique portfolio and scientific expertise in order to support new paradigms in therapeutic areas of research. 
As biopharmaceutical clients seek to drive greater efficiency and leverage scientific benefits by working with fewer trusted partners who have broad integrated capabilities, we have transformed our business over the last decade to accommodate their needs through M&A, scientific partnerships, internal investment and by promoting a culture of continuous improvement in everything that we do. 
We built the leading safety assessment franchise in the world and established an integrated end-to-end discovery offering for both small and large molecules. So given the emerging importance of complex biologics and cell and gene therapies, adding CDMO capabilities is a logical extension for our portfolio. 
We will continue to move our growing -- growth strategy forward. Disciplined M&A and strategic partnerships remain vital components of our strategy as we endeavor to further enhance the scientific expertise, global reach and innovative technologies that we can offer clients across all 3 of our business segments. Investing in our scientific capabilities as well as internally in the necessary staff and resources will help us ensure that we can meet the needs of our clients and support the robust growth in our markets. 
The biotech funding environment has never been stronger. Clients are investing more in research and development, and it is incumbent upon us to be the scientific partner who can help them move their programs forward, from concept to nonclinical development, to the safe manufacture of their life segment therapeutics. 
We look forward to discussing our strategy with you and where we think that we can take the company over the next several years at our upcoming virtual Investor Day on May 27. 
In conclusion, I'd like to thank our clients and shareholders for their support and our employees for their exceptional work and commitment. 
Now David Smith will give you additional details on our first quarter results and 2021 guidance."
91093,711191119,2268204,"Charles River Laboratories International, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 04, 2021",2021-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Before I begin, may I remind you that I'll be speaking primarily to non-GAAP results, which exclude amortization and other acquisition-related charges, costs related primarily to our global efficiency initiatives, our ven",1316,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Before I begin, may I remind you that I'll be speaking primarily to non-GAAP results, which exclude amortization and other acquisition-related charges, costs related primarily to our global efficiency initiatives, our venture capital and other strategic investment performance and certain other items. Many of my comments will also refer to organic revenue growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation. 
We're very pleased with our accomplishments in the first quarter, which widely outperformed our outlook. We delivered strong revenue growth, well above the 10% level on an organic basis and significant operating margin expansion of 170 basis points, which drove earnings per share growth of 37.5% to $2.53. The operating margin performance was particularly encouraging as the consistent margin improvement reflects our efforts to build a more scalable and efficient infrastructure and leverage the robust growth in our end market. 
As Jim mentioned, we have increased this year's financial guidance to reflect the enhanced growth profile for the full year, including the strong performance for the first quarter and the addition of Cognate and other acquisitions that we have completed. We now expect to deliver reported revenue growth of 19% to 21% and organic revenue growth in a range of 12% to 14% for the full year. 
Given the robust top line performance, we expect to drive meaningful operating margin improvement this year with the full year margin approaching 21%. This is expected to drive better-than-expected earnings per share in a range of $9.25 to $10, which represents year-over-year growth above 20%. 
By segment, our outlook for 2021 continues to reflect the strong business environment and the differentiated capabilities we provide to support our clients' needs. RMS organic revenue growth guidance for the year is unchanged from our initial high-teens outlook, reflecting recovery from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic last year, exceptional growth in China and the expectation of our cell supply revenue growth will improve during the year. The DSA segment is now expected to deliver low double-digit growth for the full year, reflecting the strong first quarter performance and intensified early-stage research activity. 
For the Manufacturing segment, we now expect to achieve mid-teens organic revenue growth, with both the Biologics and Microbial Solution businesses contributing. Including the acquisition of Cognate, Manufacturing's reported revenue growth rate is expected to be in the high-30% range. With regard to operating margin, RMS will continue to be a primary contributor to the overall improvement for the year, with the segment margin meaningfully above 25%. We also expect the DSA segment operating margin to increase over the prior year into the mid-20% range. When factoring in Cognite, the Manufacturing segment's operating margin is expected to be in the mid-30% range this year or moderately below its 2020 level. 
Unallocated corporate costs was slightly higher than our expectations, totaling 6.2% of total revenue or $51.2 million in the first quarter compared to 5.6% of revenue in the first quarter of last year. The increase was primarily the result of continued investments to support the growth of our businesses and higher performance-based compensation costs due in part to the first quarter operating outperformance. Despite the higher expenses in the first quarter, we continue to expect unallocated corporate costs to be in the mid-5% range as a percentage of revenue for the full year. 
The first quarter tax rate was 14.5%, a 20 basis point increase year-over-year and consistent with our outlook in February, which calls for a tax rate in the mid-teens due to dicing of the excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation. We continue to expect our full year tax rate will be in the low-20% range on a non-GAAP basis, which is unchanged from our outlook provided in February. 
Total adjusted net interest expense for the first quarter was $17.1 million, which was essentially flat sequentially and a decrease of nearly $2 million year-over-year due to lower average debt levels, which resulted in interest rate savings based on our leverage ratio. At the end of the first quarter, we had $2.2 billion outstanding debt, representing a gross leverage ratio of 2.3x and a net leverage ratio of 1.9x. 
In March, we issued $1 billion of senior notes to further optimize our capital structure and take advantage of the attractive interest rate environment. The proceeds of this bond offering we used to redeem a previously issued higher-rate $500 million bond to pay down the existing term loan and a portion of the revolving credit facility and to finance a portion of the Cognate acquisition. 
In April, we also amended our existing credit agreement to establish a new revolver with borrowing capacity of up to $3 billion. The net result of these actions will reduce our average interest rate on debt by approximately 50 basis points to 2.65%. An overview of our current capital structure is provided on Slide 36. 
On a pro forma basis, including the Cognate and Retrogenix acquisitions, our gross leverage ratio was just under 3x, and we had total debt outstanding of slightly below $3 billion. For the year, the higher debt balances due primarily to Cognate acquisition will be partially offset by the lower average interest rate from these refinancing activities, which is expected to result in total adjusted net interest expense of $83 million to $86 million. 
Free cash flow was $142.2 million in the first quarter, a significant increase compared to $42.9 million last year. The primary reason for the improvement was the strong first quarter operating performance, along with our continued focus on working capital management. Capital expenditures were $28 million in the first quarter compared to $25.7 million last year. 
Looking ahead, we are increasing our CapEx guidance for 2021 by $40 million to approximately $220 million. The increase primarily reflects the investments we are making in Cognate to support its high-growth business. Even with the additional capital, we expect CapEx will remain below 7% of our total revenue this year, which is consistent with the target that we provided at our last Investor Day in 2019. 
For the full year, we are updating our free cash flow guidance to the upper end of the prior range and now expect free cash flow of approximately $435 million for the full year. We are pleased to be able to increase free cash flow due primarily to the strong first quarter operating performance, even after incorporating the transaction costs and capital needs of Cognate. A summary of our revised financial guidance for the full year, including Cognate, can be found on Slide 38. 
For the second quarter, our updated outlook reflects a continuation of the strong demand environment. We now expect second quarter reported revenue growth at or near the 30% level, including the contribution of Cognate. On an organic basis, we expect the second quarter growth rate to be at or near 20%. This reflects the prior year comparison to the COVID-related revenue impact, which will contribute approximately 700 basis points to the second quarter revenue growth. 
As a result of the impact of COVID-19 on the second quarter of last year, we expect this year's second quarter non-GAAP operating margin and earnings per share to increase significantly versus the prior year. Our expectation for non-GAAP earnings per share is a growth rate of more than 50% year-over-year. 
In conclusion, we are very pleased with our strong first quarter performance, which included robust revenue aims and free cash flow growth. We remain confident about our prospects for the year and our ability to consistently grow the top line, bottom line and cash generation, and as such, believe this is reflected in the substantial improvement in our outlook. 
We look forward to hosting our upcoming virtual Investor Day in a few weeks. At that time, we plan to update our longer-term financial targets, which we believe will reflect the strong demand environment. Thank you."

We're going to see attributes or aspects of this, I think, all around our portfolio. We don't see this as a replacement for things that we do, but we see them as augmentative and/or earlier -- provide earlier indications of how a drug is likely to perform before we get into, let's say, nonregulated and certainly regulated safety trials. 
So the advent of AI should both enhance speed, and hopefully, outcomes in terms of the numbers of drugs that get to market. And between the rich data sets that we have and their facility with AI, it should be a very interesting combination, albeit very early days."

But as we reiterated in our prepared remarks, we're going to keep -- CapEx is going to stay below 7% of revenue even wi",566,"Sure. The sites continuing to invest appropriately in our businesses, all of which are growing. So most of our CapEx is growth-related. But as we reiterated in our prepared remarks, we're going to keep -- CapEx is going to stay below 7% of revenue even with the addition of Cognate and the capacity that's required there. 
But all of our businesses require additional capacity, certainly. Certainly, Safety does as well. So putting that aside, we're going to continue to do these technology deals in which we have about a dozen that are signed and another dozen in conversation. Distributed Bio was one of those that turned into an acquisition. Retrogenix began to be one of those and just pivoted immediately into an acquisition. And we have other deals in AI and bioinformatics and digital pathology, next-generation sequencing, environment traumatic and 3D tumor modeling that are cutting-edge technologies, and we're going to invest small amounts in those businesses or loan them some money and some of those, for sure, will be acquisitions. 
And they won't be particularly large companies and particularly expensive acquisitions, but they will grow rapidly. They'll enhance the portfolio, and they will distinguish us from the competition, not entirely, but particularly in the discovery. 
And I would say, besides those deals, which I don't know what the cadence will be, but I think we'll have a couple of dozen things that we're kind of participating in, and we'll buy some of them. We're going to do some straight up M&A in the discovery space. We're going to hopefully do some more straight-up M&A, so in the general ambit of cell and gene therapy. We'll do some more straight-up M&A sort of lab sciences area. We'll do more work in sort of aspects of biologics and microbial. And we actually have a couple of things that would fall into RMS. 
So the conversations, as always, are several. They're almost all private equity-owned businesses, which means that they're also sale at the right time and in the right price. Nothing would take us off the reservation. They would be continued additions of what we're doing. If you have -- if the -- if your -- the underlying thesis of the question is, what additionally might you do in the CDMO space, specifically? I can't say that categorically, except to say that our focus for the foreseeable future is primarily in cell therapy and secondarily in aspects of gene therapy. And I think that we are currently a meaningful player in the cell therapy space and could be the most meaningful player in that space, where we just continue to grow the business and add additional parts and pieces. 
And I think you understand fully that surrounding the cell and -- surrounding the CDMO activities and cell and gene therapy is the cell product businesses and buttressed by the Biologics business. So that's a powerful portfolio, and then that's added further with the combination trials for pharmacology and toxicology. 
So it's a broad suite of offerings in cell and gene therapy, which is the largest and potentially the most exciting modality. And we'll see where it all goes. There's a couple of thousand drugs that are being worked on right now. We're probably working on a significant number of those. 
Yes. So that's the nature of our focus in M&A, and particularly, in cell and gene therapy."

So we have been adding incremental amounts of capacity every year. I'm going to say 5 or 6 years, but I think it's longer because the Safety Assessment business began to come back strong -- began to sort of flatten out in 2012 and began to come back",756,"Sure. So we have been adding incremental amounts of capacity every year. I'm going to say 5 or 6 years, but I think it's longer because the Safety Assessment business began to come back strong -- began to sort of flatten out in 2012 and began to come back strong in 2013. So probably -- it's probably 7 or 8 years. 
And since proximity is important and since we have a dozen Safety Assessment sites, we can't and won't just add space at one locale nor would we add all the space in the U.S. or all the space in Europe. 
So I don't know. We added at least half a dozen sites incremental amounts of space, depending on client demand, depending on capabilities, depending on how the space is currently utilized and depending on where we see the market going. So we have always done that. So we did in 2020 for this year. We're doing it now for next year and probably for '23. We're obviously realtime as we -- as the demand is exceeding our plan and our original guidance, which is a high-class problem, thinking very carefully about do we have to add more incremental capacity for this year. And I don't think we have an answer to that. 
If we do, it will be subtle. So those of you who are concerned about our CapEx spend, for whatever reason that might be, shouldn't be concerned. We have a high-growth business, and we have to provide the capacity we won't have the business. 
We love the fact, by the way, that clients are booking earlier. That's so good for us. It's so much more orderly. I think there's a conduit there with pricing. So I think that the pricing is still an issue with them. Don't get me wrong, but I think they're less concerned about price and more concerned about science and getting a slot. 
So keeping capacity relatively tight, so our margins are good, and so clients are desirous of getting in the queue early is a really good thing, subject to the caveat that you don't want to run out of space and turn clients away. So as you indicated in your question, we're always walking that tight rope. 
I think we're really good at it. It's not a perfect science. But we will add additional space. We're adding it right now, and we'll continue to add through the year. We probably will crank it up a little more than we would have as long as we feel that this demand will continue certainly through the back half of this year, which I think we've guided to and for next year. 
On the CDMO space, particularly on the Cognate space, particularly with cell therapy manufacturing aspects of it, there is -- we bought incremental capacity. That's in place. So we're fine. We obviously have to finish -- add and finish additional space for next year and beyond based upon both -- not only the client demand but the nature of the demand. So is it some -- to clients in Phase II? Are they in Phase III? And are they hinting about and wanting us to gear up for commercial launch or not? So we have to roll all of those things up. 
We have certainly sufficient capacity to accommodate the demand for this year and probably the beginning of next year, and we'll add more space there. So capacity and head count, the rate-limiting factors in the business, not demand. Demand is not a right limiting factor right now, which is a beautiful thing. Having the space is -- I don't mean to be flip about it, but it's relatively straightforward. It's just planning and cash. And you've got to get the planning really early because it takes a while to build space. And tox is probably 18 months or so, maybe 2 years to get the space we built and validated its greenfield, maybe 12 to 18 months of an addition. And maybe it's a little bit shorter in the CDMO space. It's probably 9 to 12 months. 
So getting the space built ahead of when we need it and getting people hired and trained ahead of when they need it accommodates the -- there's sufficient capacity to accommodate to the demand and allows us not to be sure. And by the same token, we don't want to have too much space or too many people sitting around, nothing to do. So it's a constant balancing act."

The numbers that we called out last year that were clearly COVID-related, I think, fall into a different category than what we're going to see this year, what we're seeing this year. Plus I don't think it's a useful piece about it. I mean we teased out last year because we had a tough second quarter, where revenue was down in RMS and a little bit in Microbial and a few other things that we were watching accost tightly and et cetera, et cetera. We were trying to make sense of it for our investors. 
I think on a forward-going basis, while there's going to be some meaningful but modest, as modest as last year, going to be some amount of continued work on COVID-related therapeutics, monoclonal antibodies and antivirals drives to treat people who get the disease, perhaps at the vaccinated or not. 
On an ongoing basis, though, our Biologics business is going to do a lot of testing of COVID-related vaccines. And I think we're probably going to move into a genre of it being flu-like. And there'll be booster shots next year and new variants every year, and they will always make it. I don't know who give will be. At least the 4 companies who already have vaccines and perhaps others and companies like that will continue to test it. So I don't think it's all that useful to break it out or try to break it out going forward because I think it will just be an ongoing business. And so Biologics, while a really strong business for us and there's lots of large molecule products besides what I'm about to say, like monoclonal antibodies and others -- and there's no question that cell and gene therapy COVID-related work will be really, really critical. 
Why someone would work with us? Well, the -- I think the 2 companies that you mentioned are principally in the gene therapy manufacturing space. So cell therapy manufacturing space, we have smaller clients -- sorry, smaller competitors who are around the same size as we are in cell therapy manufacturing but don't have the large suite of services. So the ability to work with us from very, very early research to process development through the clinic to end-use work, I think it's a distinguishing feature of our portfolio. And by the way, we continue -- hope to continue to add to that. So hopefully, more of a holistic approach to the competition helps clients with speed to market, and they don't have to pause at each step and work with somebody else."

Those models are critically and increasingly important for basic drug research. There's a whole bunch of services associated with producing those animals, and they're complicated to produce and providing them with clients. 
I think we got a little pop because of COVID, which we will keep. And I think the demand for these models, which continue to be more sophisticated, made more easily through CRISPR and other technologies, is a really strong demand for us. We're doing that pretty much across the globe at all of our sites. 
We're pleased with DSA pricing, even though we're not going to break that out. And we're really pleased with the growth in the dome and demand there. I don't see any rationale given the funding environment, given the new modalities like cell and gene therapy and immunotherapies that -- and yes, we got a little bit of incremental work there, to your question, specifically in Discovery, I would say, that cause some clients to take a look at us that hadn't. So -- and I think they're quite happy. So we will retain that work. And as we add new services like D Bio and like Retrogenix, I think we'll get incremental work. 
So I would think that the pricing paradigm would hold up. I would think that clients -- as long as the demand remained strong, there's no reason or indications that it will soften; that we'll see more clients booking slots earlier, which is great for them; and as I said earlier, way better for us in terms of visibility planning; and getting our calendar straight in terms of how our space is utilized because maximizing that capacity is really powerful for the bottom line."

We had a couple of clients that would book -- just book capacity on a take-or-pay basis and pay for it to be empty until they needed it so they never had to get in line. I think I've said to you and others countless times, but if I was running R&D for one of the big drug companies, I for sure would commit to space like that so I didn't have to worry about it. 
It's a relatively trivial enough of the cost of developing a drug, and the hopeful clinical cost is about 20% of the cost of development and drug and being on tax as some percentage of that. So mostly money spent in the clinic. 
So we've had a few passing questions and thoughts about that as some vibrations with some clients. So thinking about it, I wouldn't want to project or predict whether that will happen and not. I just seem reluctant to do that. Although increasingly, we're not seeing people book slots earlier. I think if they book slots earlier and they're -- for whatever reason, I'm happy with the slot. Let's say it may -- let's say they want to start a study in June. And we say to them, ""Yes, we can't start until September,"" then that requires them to to back it out further or do something about taking the space on a take-or-pay basis. 
So anything is possible. I do think the market dynamics are such that it would support the basis for your question.

It depends on the geographic locale. And some term geographic locale, it's easier to hire people; some, there's greater competition.

I think I followed that. You said that really quickly. But yes, look, the consolidation on the clinical side of the business, which you're referring to, is really no different than the consolidation that not only we saw but we participate heavily in, in the preclinical side. So as you know, we have a We have 12 different sites and probably 8 or 9 different acquisitions in the Safety business. So all -- that whole business is directly side with acquisition and consolidating the industry so that we had more scientific depth and capabilities and we had a broader geographic footprint. 
So you are seeing and will continue to see the exact same phenomenon in the clinical space. Now that it started, I think it will continue. I don't know where it will end up, 2 or 3 players probably. 
Your question about what that means or portend for us, look, we look at the clinical space often. Look -- when I say, look, I think we always discuss it often. I think you know that we used to have a clinical -- small clinical CDMO capability, which in the small molecule, which we sold is because it's under scale. And now we're back in it with cell and gene therapy. 
So we sort of have 2 big moves: 1 is CDMO space, 1 is the clinical space. So we dipped that toe into the CDMO space and like it, at least on the cell therapy side. 
On the clinical side, we could do that, I guess. It doesn't seem that there's a client need, and I don't think we should make -- even contemplate a move like that unless the clients are requesting it. So the only company that has a clinical and preclinical capabilities is Covance, I think it's a failed experiment. I don't think clients buy from them on that basis nor have contracts to do preclinical work all the way through the clinic that's a year. Nobody buys that way. 
So we haven't had a conversation in the last decade with the clinical CRO about paying together. No one's ever called me a clinical CRO that came together with them. And I don't think any of us would even contemplate that move, although it would provide a bigger share of the client's wallet. So that would be attractive. 
But since the clients aren't buying that way or thinking that way and not desirous of any of us doing that, until that changes, I don't see any logical rationale for the preclinical side and other people have clinical site to get together. Having said that, I learned a long time ago never to say never about anything. So I don't know at what point the demand quotient will change and clients would want one company or multiple companies to do both. If and when that happens, we'll explore."

Good morning. I'm very pleased to speak with you today about another exceptional quarter at Charles River. Our robust first quarter financial performance, highlighted by 13% organic revenue growth and 170 basis points of year-over-year opera",2393,"Thanks, Todd. Good morning. I'm very pleased to speak with you today about another exceptional quarter at Charles River. Our robust first quarter financial performance, highlighted by 13% organic revenue growth and 170 basis points of year-over-year operating margin improvement demonstrates the strength of the biopharmaceutical market environment and the power of our unique portfolio, both of which we believe are as strong as they have ever been.
We believe clients are increasingly choosing to partner with us for our flexible and efficient outsourcing solutions, with scientific depth and breadth of our portfolio and our unwavering focus on seamlessly serving their diverse needs. Clients are opting to work with a smaller number of CROs who offer broader scientific capabilities which enables them to drive greater efficiency and accelerate the speed of the research, nonclinical development and manufacturing programs. The complexity of scientific research is also increasing our clients' reliance on a high-science outsourcing partner like Charles River.
To further differentiate ourselves from the competition, we are strategically expanding our portfolio in areas that deliver the greatest value to clients and offers significant growth potential. Already this year, we have enhanced our scientific capabilities for advanced drug modalities through the acquisitions of Distributed Bio, Cognate BioServices and Retrogenix.
Distributed Bio and Retrogenix strengthen our discovery portfolio. And the acquisition of Cognate, which was completed on March 29, provides an excellent growth opportunity by allowing us to offer CDMO services in the high-growth, high-science cell and gene therapy sector. We are very pleased to welcome the talented staff of each organization to Charles River and believe that by continuing to invest in our portfolio and our people, we are maintaining and enhancing our position as the leading nonclinical CRO. We believe the strength of our portfolio and robust industry fundamentals are leading to unprecedented client demand across most of our businesses.
In the first quarter, we experienced a continuation of the robust demand from the end of last year, including new record booking and proposal levels in the Safety Assessment business. Organic revenue was about 10% for a second consecutive quarter, even after normalizing for last year's COVID-19 impact. Overall, we believe our robust first quarter performance and solid business trends support our improved outlook for the year.
I will now provide highlights of our first quarter performance. Quarterly revenue surpassed $800 million for the first time and an $824.6 million for the first quarter of 2021 represented a 16.6% increase over last year. Organic revenue growth of 13% was driven by double-digit growth across all 3 segments. The year-over-year comparison to last year's COVID-related revenue impact, which primarily affected the RMS segment, contributed approximately 140 basis points to the revenue growth rate this quarter.
We experienced broad-based growth across all client segments, with biotech clients leading the way as they continue to benefit from a robust funding environment. The operating margin was 20.7%, an increase of 170 basis points year-over-year. The improvement was driven by RMS and DSA segments and reflected operating leverage and the robust revenue growth as well as our continued efforts to drive efficiency. We expect the same factors will drive margin improvement for the year and believe the operating margin will approach 21%, above our prior target.
Earnings per share were $2.53 in the first quarter, an increase of 37.5% from $1.84 in the first quarter of last year. This outstanding earnings growth principally reflected the double-digit revenue growth and meaningful operating margin improvement. Based on the first quarter performance and our positive outlook for the remainder of the year, we are meaningfully increasing our revenue growth and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance for 2021. We now expect organic revenue growth in a range of 12% to 14%, a 300 basis point increase from our prior range.
Normalized for last year's COVID-19 impact, we would still expect low double-digit organic revenue growth this year. Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be $9.75 to $10, which represents 20% to 23% year-over-year growth and an increase of $0.75 at the midpoint from our prior outlook.
I'd like to provide you with details on the first quarter segment performance, beginning with the DSA segment. Revenue was $501.2 million in the first quarter, an 11.6% increase on an organic basis over the first quarter 2020 driven by broad-based demand for both Discovery and Safety Assessment. Safety Assessment business continued to perform exceptionally well, reflecting robust demand from both biotech and global biopharma clients and price increases.
Bookings and proposal volume reached record highs in the first quarter, with strength across all regions and major service areas. Bookings increased substantially more than our target. Clients are expanding our preclinical pipeline and intensifying their focus on complex biologics. And we believe they are securing space with us further in advance to ensure they do not delay the research, which in turn provides us with greater visibility. We believe this positions the Safety Assessment business extremely well and supports low double-digit organic revenue growth in the DSA segment this year, which is higher than our prior outlook. We are pleased with the extensive depth and breadth of our Safety Assessment portfolio and remain intently focused on continuing to enhance the value we provide to our clients.
The Discovery business had another exceptional quarter, led by broad-based demand for oncology, early discovery and CNS services. Our efforts to broaden and strengthen our discovery capabilities and enhance our scientific expertise are enabling us to expand the support we provide for our clients' discovery research, and clients increasingly view Charles River as a premier scientific partner who can support their efforts to identify new drug targets and discover novel therapeutics.
We intend to build our Discovery portfolio so that clients can outsource complex discovery projects to us, including for advanced modalities. Our recent acquisitions Distributed Bio and Retrogenix enhance our large molecule discovery capabilities. Retrogenix through its proprietary cell microarray technology offers target receptor identification and off-target screening services, which will enhance our clients' early discovery efforts and also enable them to explore potential preclinical safety liabilities. Combination of Distributed Bio, our large molecule discovery platform, and Retrogenix capabilities will further strengthen our integrated end-to-end solution to therapeutic antibody and cell and gene therapy discovery and development.
We are also continuing to add cutting-edge technologies through our strategic partnership strategy, most recently with the new artificial intelligence or AI drug discovery partner, Valence Discovery. The DSA operating margin increased by 180 basis points to 23.8% in the first quarter. Leverage from the robust DSA revenue growth was the primary driver of margin improvement, and we expect this trend will continue to propel the DSA margin into the mid-20% range for the year.
RMS revenue was $176.9 million, an increase of 14.8% on an organic basis over the first quarter of 2020. Robust demand for research models in China was the primary driver of first quarter RMS revenue growth, and higher revenue for research model services, including GEMS and our CRADL initiative, also contributed. Approximately 620 basis points of the increase was attributable to the comparison to last year's COVID-related revenue impact from client site closures and disruption.
Demand trends for the research models were largely consistent with those prior to the pandemic, with growth in China widely outpacing mature markets. Research models business in China had an exceptional quarter even after normalizing for last year's COVID-19 impact, driven by a resurgence in demand across all segments. Biomedical research in China has returned to pre-COVID levels, and in some areas, even greater levels. In the U.S. and Europe, client order activity has also rebounded.
Research Model Services also continued to perform well. GEMS is benefiting from renewed outsourcing demand as our clients seek greater flexibility and efficiency afforded to them when we manage their proprietary model colonies, as we did for many clients during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, complex research models will play an increasingly critical role as drug research continues to shift to oncology, rare disease and cell and gene therapies, which reinforces the value proposition for the GEMS business.
We are also continuing to generate substantial client interest for our CRADL initiative or Charles River accelerator and development labs, as both small and large biopharmaceutical clients increasingly seek turnkey research capacity, which allows them to invest in people and research instead of infrastructure. We have CRADL sites in the Boston, Cambridge, Massachusetts area and South San Francisco biohubs and are actively expanding in these regions to accommodate client demand. Utilizing CRADL also provides clients with collaborative opportunities to seamlessly access other Charles River services from Discovery to GEMS, which further enhances the speed and efficiency of their research programs.
Revenue growth for our cell supply businesses, HemaCare and Cellero, remained below the targeted level in the first quarter due to some limitations on donor access. We believe cell supply revenue will increase during the year as donor availability continues to improve. We are also continuing to work diligently to expand our donor base in the U.S. and add more comprehensive capabilities at all of our sites to accommodate the robust demand in the broader cell therapy market.
We believe that the acquisition of Cognate is particularly timing -- timely because it creates new business opportunities for HemaCare and Cellero in the cell and gene therapy development area. Our expanded capabilities are expanding -- are establishing Charles River as a trusted partner, who can move clients programs forward using the same cellular products through each step of research and early-stage development phases and into CGMP production.
In the first quarter, the RMS operating margin increased 570 basis points to 28.7%. This significant improvement is due to 2 factors. First, last year's 23% margin was depressed by the onset of COVID-related client disruptions and the resulting impact on the research model order activity. In addition, this year's performance reflects the operating leverage attributable to the robust revenue growth, particularly for research models in China.
Revenue for the Manufacturing segment was $146.5 million, a 15.6% increase on an organic basis over the first quarter of last year. The increase was driven by double-digit revenue growth in both the Biologics Testing Solutions and Microbial Solutions businesses. The Manufacturing segment's first quarter operating margin was stable at 35.5%. This is consistent with the historical trend in the first quarter and in line with our revised expectations in 2021 for a mid-30% operating margin when factoring in the Cognate acquisition.
Microbial Solutions growth rate rebounded above the 10% level in the first quarter, reflecting strong demand for our Endosafe endotoxin testing systems, cartridges and core reagents for all geographic regions. We continue to work through the delayed instrument installations that resulted from COVID-19 restrictions and are gaining access to more client sites.
We are pleased with the strength of the underlying demand for our endotoxin testing platform, which performs FDA-mandated lot-release testing for our clients' critical quality control testing needs. Clients prefer our comprehensive and efficient microbial testing solutions because of the quality, speed and accuracy of our testing platform.
The Biologics business reported another exceptional quarter of strong double-digit revenue growth, principally driven by robust market demand for testing cell and gene therapies and COVID-19 therapeutics. We believe cell and gene therapies will continue to be significant growth drivers for the years to come. And demand for COVID-19 vaccine testing is intensifying as these therapies move on to the commercial production phase even as some of the early-stage testing activity subsides.
Given the strength of the demand environment, we are continuing to build our extensive portfolio of services to support the safe manufacture of Biologics to ensure we have available capacity to accommodate client demand.
We believe the acquisition of Cognate will be highly complementary to our Biologics business and our portfolio as a whole. The acquisition establishes Charles River as a premier scientific partner to cell and gene therapy development, testing and manufacturing.
Our broader services will provide clients with an integrated solution from basic research through CGMP production, enabling them to outsource CGMP cell therapy production and the required analytical testing to one scientific partner, reducing the bottlenecks and efficiencies of utilizing multiple outsourced providers. Because we already were a provider of extensive nonclinical services for cell and gene therapies, our integration process, which is proceeding smoothly, is particularly focused on unlocking new business opportunities across our portfolio. The acquisition of Cognate is part of our ongoing strategy to broaden our unique portfolio and scientific expertise in order to support new paradigms in therapeutic areas of research.
As biopharmaceutical clients seek to drive greater efficiency and leverage scientific benefits by working with fewer trusted partners who have broad integrated capabilities, we have transformed our business over the last decade to accommodate their needs through M&A, scientific partnerships, internal investment and by promoting a culture of continuous improvement in everything that we do.
We built the leading safety assessment franchise in the world and established an integrated end-to-end discovery offering for both small and large molecules. So given the emerging importance of complex biologics and cell and gene therapies, adding CDMO capabilities is a logical extension for our portfolio.
We will continue to move our growth strategy forward. Disciplined M&A and strategic partnerships remain vital components of our strategy as we endeavor to further enhance the scientific expertise, global reach and innovative technologies that we can offer clients across all 3 of our business segments. Investing in our scientific capabilities as well as internally in the necessary staff and resources will help us ensure that we can meet the needs of our clients and support the robust growth in our markets.
The biotech funding environment has never been stronger. Clients are investing more in research and development, and it is incumbent upon us to be the scientific partner who can help them move their programs forward, from concept to nonclinical development, to the safe manufacture of their life segment therapeutics. 
We look forward to discussing our strategy with you and where we think that we can take the company over the next several years at our upcoming virtual Investor Day on May 27. 
In conclusion, I'd like to thank our clients and shareholders for their support and our employees for their exceptional work and commitment. 
Now David Smith will give you additional details on our first quarter results and 2021 guidance."
91093,711191119,2268611,"Charles River Laboratories International, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 04, 2021",2021-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Before I begin, may I remind you that I'll be speaking primarily to non-GAAP results, which exclude amortization and other acquisition-related charges, costs related primarily to our global efficiency initiatives, our ven",1317,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Before I begin, may I remind you that I'll be speaking primarily to non-GAAP results, which exclude amortization and other acquisition-related charges, costs related primarily to our global efficiency initiatives, our venture capital and other strategic investment performance and certain other items. Many of my comments will also refer to organic revenue growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation.
We're very pleased with our accomplishments in the first quarter, which widely outperformed our outlook. We delivered strong revenue growth, well above the 10% level on an organic basis and significant operating margin expansion of 170 basis points, which drove earnings per share growth of 37.5% to $2.53. The operating margin performance was particularly encouraging as the consistent margin improvement reflects our efforts to build a more scalable and efficient infrastructure and leverage the robust growth in our end market.
As Jim mentioned, we have increased this year's financial guidance to reflect the enhanced growth profile for the full year, including the strong performance for the first quarter and the addition of Cognate and other acquisitions that we have completed. We now expect to deliver reported revenue growth of 19% to 21% and organic revenue growth in a range of 12% to 14% for the full year.
Given the robust top line performance, we expect to drive meaningful operating margin improvement this year with the full year margin approaching 21%. This is expected to drive better-than-expected earnings per share in a range of $9.25 to $10, which represents year-over-year growth above 20%.
By segment, our outlook for 2021 continues to reflect the strong business environment and the differentiated capabilities we provide to support our clients' needs. RMS organic revenue growth guidance for the year is unchanged from our initial high-teens outlook, reflecting recovery from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic last year, exceptional growth in China and the expectation of our cell supply revenue growth will improve during the year. The DSA segment is now expected to deliver low double-digit growth for the full year, reflecting the strong first quarter performance and intensified early-stage research activity.
For the Manufacturing segment, we now expect to achieve mid-teens organic revenue growth, with both the Biologics and Microbial Solution businesses contributing. Including the acquisition of Cognate, Manufacturing's reported revenue growth rate is expected to be in the high-30% range. With regard to operating margin, RMS will continue to be a primary contributor to the overall improvement for the year, with the segment margin meaningfully above 25%. We also expect the DSA segment operating margin to increase over the prior year into the mid-20% range. When factoring in Cognite, the Manufacturing segment's operating margin is expected to be in the mid-30% range this year or moderately below its 2020 level.
Unallocated corporate costs was slightly higher than our expectations, totaling 6.2% of total revenue or $51.2 million in the first quarter compared to 5.6% of revenue in the first quarter of last year. The increase was primarily the result of continued investments to support the growth of our businesses and higher performance-based compensation costs due in part to the first quarter operating outperformance. Despite the higher expenses in the first quarter, we continue to expect unallocated corporate costs to be in the mid-5% range as a percentage of revenue for the full year.
The first quarter tax rate was 14.5%, a 20 basis point increase year-over-year and consistent with our outlook in February, which calls for a tax rate in the mid-teens due to the gating of the excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation. We continue to expect our full year tax rate will be in the low-20% range on a non-GAAP basis, which is unchanged from our outlook provided in February. 
Total adjusted net interest expense for the first quarter was $17.1 million, which was essentially flat sequentially and a decrease of nearly $2 million year-over-year due to lower average debt levels, which resulted in interest rate savings based on our leverage ratio. At the end of the first quarter, we had $2.2 billion of outstanding debt, representing a gross leverage ratio of 2.3x and a net leverage ratio of 1.9x.
In March, we issued $1 billion of senior notes to further optimize our capital structure and take advantage of the attractive interest rate environment. The proceeds of this bond offering we used to redeem a previously issued higher-rate $500 million bond to pay down the existing term loan and a portion of the revolving credit facility and to finance a portion of the Cognate acquisition.
In April, we also amended our existing credit agreement to establish a new revolver with borrowing capacity of up to $3 billion. The net result of these actions will reduce our average interest rate on debt by approximately 50 basis points to 2.65%. An overview of our current capital structure is provided on Slide 36.
On a pro forma basis, including the Cognate and Retrogenix acquisitions, our gross leverage ratio was just under 3x, and we had total debt outstanding of slightly below $3 billion. For the year, the higher debt balances due primarily to Cognate acquisition will be partially offset by the lower average interest rate from these refinancing activities, which is expected to result in total adjusted net interest expense of $83 million to $86 million.
Free cash flow was $142.2 million in the first quarter, a significant increase compared to $42.9 million last year. The primary reason for the improvement was the strong first quarter operating performance, along with our continued focus on working capital management. Capital expenditures were $28 million in the first quarter compared to $25.7 million last year.
Looking ahead, we are increasing our CapEx guidance for 2021 by $40 million to approximately $220 million. The increase primarily reflects the investments we are making in Cognate to support its high-growth business. Even with the additional capital, we expect CapEx will remain below 7% of our total revenue this year, which is consistent with the target that we provided at our last Investor Day in 2019.
For the full year, we are updating our free cash flow guidance to the upper end of the prior range and now expect free cash flow of approximately $435 million for the full year. We are pleased to be able to increase free cash flow due primarily to the strong first quarter operating performance, even after incorporating the transaction costs and capital needs of Cognate. A summary of our revised financial guidance for the full year, including Cognate, can be found on Slide 38. 
For the second quarter, our updated outlook reflects a continuation of the strong demand environment. We now expect second quarter reported revenue growth at or near the 30% level, including the contribution of Cognate. On an organic basis, we expect second quarter growth rate to be at or near 20%. This reflects the prior year comparison to the COVID-related revenue impact, which will contribute approximately 700 basis points to the second quarter revenue growth.
As a result of the impact of COVID-19 on the second quarter of last year, we expect this year's second quarter non-GAAP operating margin and earnings per share to increase significantly versus the prior year. Our expectation for non-GAAP earnings per share is a growth rate of more than 50% year-over-year.
In conclusion, we are very pleased with our strong first quarter performance, which included robust revenue aims and free cash flow growth. We remain confident about our prospects for the year and our ability to consistently grow the top line, bottom line and cash generation, and as such, believe this is reflected in the substantial improvement in our outlook.
We look forward to hosting our upcoming virtual Investor Day in a few weeks. At that time, we plan to update our longer-term financial targets, which we believe will reflect the strong demand environment. Thank you."

And so there's a rich amount of data, and I think Valence is a particularly strong AI company.
We're going to see attributes or aspects of this, I think, all around our portfolio. We don't see this as a replacement for things that we do, but we see them as augmentative and/or earlier -- provide earlier indications of how a drug is likely to perform before we get into, let's say, nonregulated and certainly regulated safety trials.
So the advent of AI should both enhance speed, and hopefully, outcomes in terms of the numbers of drugs that get to market. And between the rich data sets that we have and their facility with AI, it should be a very interesting combination, albeit very early days."

But as we reiterated in our prepared remarks, we're going to keep -- CapEx is going to stay below 7% of revenue even with the addition of Cognate and the capacity that's required there. 
But all of our businesses require additional capacity, certainly. Certainly, Safety does as well. So putting that aside, we're going to continue to do these technology deals in which we have about a dozen that are signed and another dozen in conversation. Distributed Bio was one of those that turned into an acquisition. Retrogenix began to be one of those and just pivoted immediately into an acquisition. 
And we have other deals in AI and bioinformatics and digital pathology, next-generation sequencing, environment traumatic and 3D tumor modeling that are cutting-edge technologies, and we're going to invest small amounts in those businesses or loan them some money and some of those, for sure, will be acquisitions. 
And they won't be particularly large companies and particularly expensive acquisitions, but they will grow rapidly. They'll enhance the portfolio, and they will distinguish us from the competition, not entirely, but particularly in the discovery. 
And I would say, besides those deals, which I don't know what the cadence will be, but I think we'll have a couple of dozen things that we're kind of participating in, and we'll buy some of them. We're going to do some straight up M&A in the discovery space. We're going to hopefully do some more straight-up M&A, sort of in the general ambit of cell and gene therapy. We'll do some more straight-up M&A sort of lab sciences area. We'll do more work in sort of aspects of biologics and microbial. And we actually have a couple of things that would fall into RMS. 
So the conversations, as always, are several. They're almost all private equity-owned businesses, which means that they're all for sale at the right time and in the right price. Nothing would take us off the reservation. They would be continued additions of what we're doing. If you have -- if the -- if your -- the underlying thesis of the question is, what additionally might you do in the CDMO space, specifically? 
I can't say that categorically, except to say that our focus for the foreseeable future is primarily in cell therapy and secondarily in aspects of gene therapy. And I think that we are currently a meaningful player in the cell therapy space and could be the most meaningful player in that space, where we just continue to grow the business in and add additional parts and pieces. 
And I think you understand fully that surrounding this -- surrounding the CDMO activities and cell and gene therapy is the cell product businesses and buttressed by the Biologics business. So that's a powerful portfolio, and then that's added further with the combination trials for pharmacology and toxicology. 
So it's a broad suite of offerings in cell and gene therapy, which is the largest and potentially the most exciting modality. And we'll see where it all goes. There's a couple of thousand drugs that are being worked on right now. We're probably working on a significant number of those. Yes. So that's the nature of our focus in M&A, and particularly, in cell and gene therapy."

I know on Safety Assessment -- just wanted to get a little bit of a better sense on your comments around clients booking further in advance of actual work. And just related to that, how you're thinking about capacity? Do you think, as what you're seeing trend, that you might need to be adding capacity? I know it's always a tricky dynamic to match supply and demand within Safety Assessment. 
And then just the second question around CDMO. I know last quarter, you said you were going to assess if you needed to add more capacity there. Just -- I know it's not too far from when you made that comment, but just curious if there's any updated thoughts on the CDMO footprint."

So we have been adding incremental amounts of capacity every year. I'm going to say 5 or 6 years, but I think it's longer because the Safety Assessment business began to come back strong -- began to sort of flatten out in 2012 and began to come back",755,"Sure. So we have been adding incremental amounts of capacity every year. I'm going to say 5 or 6 years, but I think it's longer because the Safety Assessment business began to come back strong -- began to sort of flatten out in 2012 and began to come back strong in 2013. So it's probably 7 or 8 years. 
And since proximity is important and since we have a dozen Safety Assessment sites, we can't and won't just add space at one locale nor would we add all the space in the U.S. or all the space in Europe. 
So I don't know. We added at least half a dozen sites incremental amounts of space, depending on client demand, depending on capabilities, depending on how the space is currently utilized and depending on where we see the market going. So we have always done that. 
So we did in 2020 for this year. We're doing it now for next year and probably for '23. We're obviously realtime as we -- as the demand is exceeding our plan and our original guidance, which is a high-class problem, thinking very carefully about do we have to add more incremental capacity for this year. And I don't think we have an answer to that. 
If we do, it will be subtle. So those of you who are concerned about our CapEx spend, for whatever reason that might be, shouldn't be concerned. We have a high-growth business, and we have to provide the capacity we won't have the business. 
We love the fact, by the way, that clients are booking earlier. That's so good for us. It's so much more orderly. I think there's a conduit there with pricing. So I think that the pricing is still an issue with them. Don't get me wrong, but I think they're less concerned about price and more concerned about science and getting a slot. 
So keeping capacity relatively tight, so our margins are good, and so clients are desirous of getting in the queue early is a really good thing, subject to the caveat that you don't want to run out of space and turn clients away. So as you indicated in your question, we're always walking that tight rope. 
I think we're really good at it. It's not a perfect science. But we will add additional space. We're adding it right now, and we'll continue to add through the year. We probably will crank it up a little more than we would have as long as we feel that this demand will continue certainly through the back half of this year, which I think we've guided to and for next year. 
On the CDMO space, particularly on the Cognate space, particularly with cell therapy manufacturing aspects of it, there is -- we bought incremental capacity. That's in place. So we're fine. We obviously have to finish -- add and finish additional space for next year and beyond based upon both -- not only the client demand but the nature of the demand. So is it some -- the clients in Phase II? Are they in Phase III? And are they hinting about and wanting us to gear up for commercial launch or not? So we have to roll all of those things up. 
We have certainly sufficient capacity to accommodate the demand for this year and probably the beginning of next year, and we'll add more space there. So capacity and head count, the rate-limiting factors in the business, not demand. Demand is not a right limiting factor right now, which is a beautiful thing. 
Having the space is -- I don't mean to be flip about it, but it's relatively straightforward. It's just planning and cash. And you've got to get the planning really early because it takes a while to build space. And tox is probably 18 months or so, maybe 2 years to get the space we built and validated its greenfield, maybe 12 to 18 months of an addition. And maybe it's a little bit shorter in the CDMO space. It's probably 9 to 12 months. 
So getting the space built ahead of when we need it and getting people hired and trained ahead of when they need it accommodates the -- there's a sufficient capacity to accommodate to the demand and allows us not to be short. And by the same token, we don't want to have too much space or too many people sitting around, nothing to do. So it's a constant balancing act."

The numbers that we called out last year that were clearly COVID-related, I think, fall into a different category than what we're going to see this year, what we're seeing this year. Plus I don't think it's a useful piece about it. I mean we teased out last year because we had a tough second quarter, where revenue was down in RMS and a little bit in Microbial and a few other things that we were watching accost tightly and et cetera, et cetera. We were trying to make sense of it for our investors. 
I think on a forward-going basis, while there's going to be some meaningful but modest, because it was modest last year, going to be some amount of continued work on COVID-related therapeutics, monoclonal antibodies and antivirals. Drugs to treat people who get the disease, perhaps if they have been vaccinated or not. 
On an ongoing basis, though, our Biologics business is going to do a lot of testing of COVID-related vaccines. And I think we're probably going to move into a genre of it being flu-like. And there'll be booster shots next year and new variants every year, and they will always make it. I don't know who give will be. At least the 4 companies who already have vaccines and perhaps others and companies like that will continue to test it. 
So I don't think it's all that useful to break it out or try to break it out going forward because I think it will just be an ongoing business. And so Biologics, while a really strong business for us and there's lots of large molecule products besides what I'm about to say, like monoclonal antibodies and others -- and there's no question that cell and gene therapy COVID-related work will be really, really critical. 
Why someone would work with us? Well, the -- I think the 2 companies that you mentioned are principally in the gene therapy manufacturing space. So cell therapy manufacturing space, we have smaller clients -- sorry, smaller competitors who are around the same size as we are in cell therapy manufacturing but don't have the large suite of services. 
So the ability to work with us from very, very early research to process development through the clinic to end-use work, I think it's a distinguishing feature of our portfolio. And by the way, we continue -- hope to continue to add to that. So hopefully, more of a holistic approach. The competition helps clients with speed to market, and they don't have to pause at each step and work with somebody else."

Those models are critically and increasingly important for basic drug research. There's a whole bunch of services associated with producing those [ models ], and they're complicated to produce and providing them to the clients. 
I think we got a little pop because of COVID, which we will keep. And I think the demand for these models, which continue to be more sophisticated, made more easily through CRISPR and other technologies, is a really strong demand for us. We're doing that pretty much across the globe at all of our sites. 
We're pleased with DSA pricing, even though we're not going to break that out. And we're really pleased with the growth in the dome and demand there. I don't see any rationale given the funding environment, given the new modalities like cell and gene therapy and immunotherapies that -- and yes, we got a little bit of incremental work there, to your question. Specifically in Discovery, I would say, that caused some clients to take a look at us that hadn't. So -- and I think they're quite happy. So we will retain that work. And as we add new services like D-Bio and like Retrogenix, I think we'll get incremental work. 
So I would think that the pricing paradigm would hold up. I would think that clients -- as long as the demand remains strong, there's no reason or indications that it will soften; that we'll see more clients booking slots earlier, which is great for them; and as I said earlier, way better for us in terms of visibility planning; and getting our calendar straight in terms of how our space is utilized because maximizing that capacity is really powerful for the bottom line."

I think that would -- that logically follows from the market situation. I'm a bit -- we had this over a decade ago. We had a couple of clients that would book -- just book capacity on a take-or-pay basis and pay for it to be empty until they needed it so they never had to get in line. I think I've said to you and others countless times, but if I was running R&D for one of the big drug companies, I for sure would commit to space like that so I didn't have to worry about it. 
It's a relatively trivial enough of the cost of developing a drug, and the hopeful clinical cost is about 20% of the cost of development and drug and being on tox as some percentage of that. And mostly money is spent in the clinic. 
So we've had a few passing questions and thoughts about that as some vibrations with some clients  thinking about it. I wouldn't want to project or predict whether that will happen or not. I just seem reluctant to do that. Although increasingly, we're not seeing people book slots earlier. 
I think if they book slots earlier and they're -- for whatever reason, I'm happy with the slot. Let's say it may -- let's say they want to start a study in June. And we say to them, ""Yes, we can't start until September,"" then that requires them to back it out further or do something about taking the space on a take-or-pay basis. 
So anything is possible. I do think the market dynamics are such that it would support the basis for your question. I just think that the big drug companies, in particular, have been reluctant to do those sorts of deals. And I would say that we don't have any concrete evidence that that's on the horizon."

It depends on the geographic locale. And some term geographic locale, it's easier to hire people; some, there's greater competition.

We have no doubt that the thesis is a very strong one, but clients who can use us starting very, very early in the process through process development and scale up through the clinic out to commercial quantities is powerful.

Look, it's no different than everything else we do. We provide a comprehensive, holistic portfolio of products and services so it's more of a solution for clients because -- particularly small biotech companies -- everyone, but particularly them, they don't have the time or the ability or the desire to work with half a dozen different providers across those different streams of business.

I think I followed that. You said that really quickly. But yes, look, the consolidation on the clinical side of the business, which you're referring to, is really no different than the consolidation that not only we saw but we participate heavily in, in the preclinical side. So as you know, we have a We have 12 different sites and probably 8 or 9 different acquisitions in the Safety business. So all -- that whole business is directly side with acquisition and consolidating the industry so that we had more scientific depth and capabilities and we had a broader geographic footprint. 
So you are seeing and will continue to see the exact same phenomenon in the clinical space. Now that it started, I think it will continue. I don't know where it will end up, 2 or 3 players probably. 
Your question about what that means or portends for us, look, we look at the clinical space often. Look -- when I say, look, I think we always discuss it often. I think you know that we used to have a clinical -- small clinical CDMO capability, which in the small molecule, which we sold is because it's under scale. And now we're back in it with cell and gene therapy. 
So we sort of have 2 big moves: one is CDMO space, one is the clinical space. So we dipped that toe into the CDMO space and like it, at least on the cell therapy side. 
On the clinical side, we could do that, I guess. It doesn't seem that there's a client need, and I don't think we should make -- even contemplate a move like that unless the clients are requesting it. So the only company that has a clinical and preclinical capabilities is Covance, I think it's a failed experiment. I don't think clients buy from them on that basis nor have contracts to do preclinical work all the way through the clinic that's years. Nobody buys that way. 
So we haven't had a conversation in the last decade with the clinical CRO about paying together. No one's ever called me a clinical CRO that came together with them. And I don't think any of us would even contemplate that move, although it would provide a bigger share of the client's wallet. So that would be attractive. 
But since the clients aren't buying that way or thinking that way and not desirous of any of us doing that, until that changes, I don't see any logical rationale for us in the preclinical side and other people have clinical site to get together. Having said that, I learned a long time ago never to say never about anything. So I don't know at what point the demand quotient will change and clients would want one company or multiple companies to do both. If and when that happens, we'll explore."

The strength of our leading nonclinical portfolio was clearly demonstrated in our second quarter financial performance. Robust industry fundamentals are leading to unprecedented client demand across most of our businesses, and we're extremely well positioned to succeed in this environment. 
Second quarter organic growth -- revenue growth was in the mid-teens, even after normalizing for last year's COVID-19 impact and exceeded the long-term low double-digit target that we recently provided at our Investor Day in May. Clients are increasingly choosing to partner with us for our flexible and efficient outsourcing solutions, the scientific depth and breadth of our portfolio, and our unwavering focus on flawlessly serving the diverse needs. Utilizing our capabilities enables them to drive greater efficiency and accelerate the speed of their research, nonclinical development and manufacturing programs. We believe that the efforts we have made and continue to make to differentiate ourselves from the competition are critical as clients choose to work with a smaller number of CROs who offer broader scientific capabilities. 
Due to the sustained demand, we are keenly focused on the execution of our strategy. We are strengthening our portfolio as we did through the acquisition of gene therapy CDMO, Vigene Biosciences in late June, strategically adding staff and capacity to accommodate the robust demand and support our clients and enhancing our digital enterprise to provide greater connectivity and exceptional service to them. We believe we will make these investments and remain well positioned to achieve our operating margin target of 22.5% in 2024. 
We believe the success of our strategy is reflected in our second quarter performance. So let me provide some of the highlights. Quarterly revenue surpassed $900 million for the first time, and a $914.6 million in the second quarter of '21 represented a 34% increase over last year. Organic revenue growth of 24.1% was increased by approximately 8% when compared to last year's COVID-19 impact in the second quarter of 2020, with the greatest impact in the Research Models and Services segment. 
Even after normalizing for the COVID impact, we reported mid-teens organic growth, with double-digit increases across all 3 business segments. The operating margin was 20.8%, an increase of 350 basis points year-over-year. The improvement was principally driven by the RMS segment, reflecting operating leverage from significantly higher sales volume for Research Models due in part to the comparison to last year's COVID-19 impact. Notwithstanding this favorable year-over-year comparison, we were pleased with the margin progression in the first half of the year and are on track to achieve a full year operating margin of approximately 21% or 100 basis points higher than last year. 
Earnings per share were $2.61 in the second quarter, an increase of 65.2% from $1.58 in the second quarter of last year. This result widely exceeded our prior outlook of more than 50% earnings growth for the quarter, primarily as a result of the exceptional demand environment. 
Based on the second quarter performance and our expectation for sustained demand through the remainder of the year, we are increasing our revenue growth and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance for 2021. We now expect organic revenue growth in a range of 13% to 15%, 100 basis point increase from our prior range. Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be in the range from $10.10 to $10.35, which represents 24% to 27% year-over-year growth and an increase of $0.35 at midpoint from our prior outlook. We attribute this exceptional performance and outlook to the success of our ongoing efforts to enhance our position as the leading nonclinical contract research and manufacturing organization as well as the pace of scientific innovation that's fueling a significant increase in biotech funding and FDA approvals, both of which are tracking to near record levels through the first half of the year. 
I'd like to provide you with details on the second quarter segment performance, beginning with the DSA segment. Revenue was $540.1 million in the second quarter, an 18.1% increase on an organic basis over the second quarter of '20, driven by broad-based demand for both Discovery and Safety Assessment Services. COVID only had a small impact on the DSA segment last year, so it wasn't a meaningful driver of the year-over-year growth. 
Safety Assessment business continued to perform exceptionally well, reflecting robust demand from both biotech and global biopharma clients and price increases. Bookings and proposal volume continued to achieve record highs in the second quarter, with strength across all regions and major service areas. The strength of biotech funding is enabling clients to meaningfully invest in early-stage programs. And due to the unprecedented demand, we are now booking work into next year. As I mentioned last quarter, clients are expanding their preclinical pipelines and intensifying their focus on complex biologics. To ensure they do not delay their research, we believe clients are securing space with us further in advance, which, in turn, provides us with greater visibility. To support our clients, we are continuing to add staff, capacity and the resources necessary to effectively manage the current demand environment and provide our clients with a timely, efficient and high-quality service that they have come to expect from Charles River. We believe these investments position Safety Assessment business well and will support low double-digit organic revenue growth in the DSA segment this year. 
We believe the combination of the robust funding environment as well as our deep scientific expertise and willingness to forge flexible relationships with our clients led to another exceptional quarter for the Discovery business. Our comprehensive portfolio of oncology, CNS, early discovery and discovery capabilities, which we recently enhanced through the Distributed Bio and Retrogenix acquisitions, is resonating with clients, and clients are increasingly choosing to outsource -- to integrated Discovery partners like Charles River. Despite the robust funding, biotech clients continue to maintain limited or no internal infrastructure, opting instead to invest in their pipelines and utilize our services to move their programs forward. 
To support the robust demand from biotech and global biopharmaceutical clients, we will continue to strengthen our portfolio by expanding our scale, our science and our innovative technologies through a combination of internal investment, M&A and our strategic partnership strategy. By doing so, we are enabling our clients to remain with one scientific partner from Target ID through IND filing and beyond and solidifying our position as the leading nonclinical CRO. 
The DSA operating margin increased by 30 basis points to 23.5% in the second quarter. Leverage from the robust DSA revenue growth was the primary driver of the margin improvement. Foreign exchange reduced the DSA operating margin by 150 basis points in the quarter as revenue and costs are not naturally hedged at certain DSA sites, including our Safety Assessment operations in Canada. We continue to expect the DSA margin will be in the mid-20% range for the year. 
RMS revenue was $176.7 million, an increase of 44.5% on an organic basis over the second quarter of '20. Approximately 33.4% of this growth was attributable to the comparison to last year's COVID-related revenue impact from client site closures and disruptions, which reduced research model order activity. Adjusted for the COVID impact, the RMS growth rate was above 10% as strong research activity across biopharmaceutical academic and government clients led most RMS businesses to grow above their targeted growth rates. Robust demand for research models in China continued to be the primary driver of RMS revenue growth. There has been a resurgence of research activity this year, and model volumes far exceed pre-COVID levels. 
Severe Western markets, the client base in China has transitioned from one dominated by academic and government accounts to a vibrant mid-tier biotech and CRO client base, which now represents the majority of our clients in China. We believe the expansion of our client base is fueling increased demand. And to accommodate the growth, we are continuing to expand our model and services offering and our geographic footprint in Western and Southern China. We are currently experiencing strong double-digit revenue growth in China. 
Demand for Research Models outside of China was also quite strong. We believe this correlates with the increased level of nonclinical research that's being conducted by biopharmaceutical and academic clients in Western markets. Research investments have led to biomedical breakthroughs and new drug modalities, and we believe the global focus on scientific innovation is sustainable. 
We also continue to win new academic clients in the second quarter, resulting from the COVID-19-related client shutdowns last year, and more recently, from digital engagements targeting the academic client base. Research Model and Services also performed very well. GEMS is benefiting from strong outsourcing demand as our clients seek the greater flexibility and efficiency they gain when we manage their proprietary model colonies. The greater complexity of scientific research and the proprietary models that our clients are creating further reinforce the value proposition for the GEMS business. 
Clients need for greater flexibility and efficiency is also driving demand for our Insourcing Solutions, or IS business, particularly for our CRADL initiative, which provides both small and large biopharmaceutical clients with turnkey research capacity at Charles River sites. In addition to expanding our existing CRADL presence and adding clients in the Boston, Cambridge and South San Francisco biohubs, we're also looking to expand into other regions to provide a flexible capacity solution for our clients in emerging biohubs. Utilizing CRADL also provides clients with collaborative opportunities to seamlessly access other Charles River services, which further enhances the speed and efficiency of their research programs. 
The revenue growth rate for our self-supply businesses, HemaCare and Cellero, improved in the second quarter but remain below the targeted level due to continued limitations on donor access. We believe cell supply revenue will increase during the second half of the year as donor availability and capacity improved. 
We have expanded capabilities, including donor capacity, at our cell supply sites in Massachusetts and Washington State, which we believe will enable us to further expand our donor base in the U.S. and accommodate the robust demand in the broader cell therapy market. We expect HemaCare and Cellero will provide the critical tools for our new cell and gene therapy CDMO business, Cognate and Vigene. We believe this will be highly synergistic for both Charles River and our clients because it will enable us to move client cell therapy programs forward using the same cellular products from research to CGMP production. 
The RMS operating margin increased to 27.4% from 9.1% in the second quarter of last year. The significant improvement was primarily due to the comparison to last year's depressed margin associated with COVID-related client disruptions and the corresponding reduction in Research Model order activity. 
Revenue for the Manufacturing segment was $197.8 million, a 26.6% increase on an organic basis over the second quarter of last year. The increase was driven by strong double-digit revenue growth in both the Biologics Testing Solutions and Microbial Solutions businesses. COVID-19 did not have a meaningful impact on the segment's revenue last year, but testing on COVID vaccine -- COVID-19 vaccines has helped accelerate Biologics revenue growth rate this year. 
Consistent with the first quarter, Microbial Solutions growth rate in the second quarter was well above the 10% level, reflecting strong demand for our Endosafe endotoxin testing systems, cartridges and core reagents in all geographic regions as well as Accugenix microbial identification services. With COVID-related client access restrictions effectively behind us, we were pleased with the strength of the underlying demand for our endotoxin testing platform, which reforms FDA mandated lot release testing for our clients' critical quality control testing needs. The advantages of our comprehensive portfolio continue to resonate with clients, and we believe that our ability to provide a total microbial testing solution will enable Microbial Solutions to deliver at least low double-digit organic revenue growth this year and beyond, which is consistent with the historical trend pre-COVID. 
The Biologics Testing business reported another exceptional quarter of strong revenue growth that was well above the 20% growth target for this business. Robust demand for cell and gene therapy testing services continue to be the primary growth driver. There has been a rapid increase in the number of cell and gene therapy programs in development to approximately 3,000 programs now in the pipeline, with approximately 2/3 in the preclinical phase, which is expected to continue to fuel the strong growth. COVID-19 vaccine work was also a meaningful driver of Biologics second quarter growth, but the underlying Biologics growth trends remained above the 20% level, even without the incremental COVID-19 testing revenue. 
We believe cell and gene therapies will continue to be significant growth drivers over the long term, and demand for COVID-19 vaccine testing is showing no signs of abating. We believe the commercial production of COVID vaccines will continue for many years to come, supporting the demand for our services. These factors are contributing to the strength of the demand environment, and we continue to build our extensive portfolio of manufacturing services to ensure we have available capacity to accommodate client demand. 
The Manufacturing segment second quarter operating margin declined by 420 basis points to 33.2%. The primary driver of the decline was the addition of Cognate's CDMO business as well as higher production costs in the microbial business. Cognate is a profitable business with a solid operating margin, but its margin is below the Manufacturing segment. Coupled with the addition of Vigene in the third quarter, we expect a full year Manufacturing margin slightly below the mid-30% range. However, beyond 2021, we expect this headwind to gradually dissipate as we drive efficiency and as the significant growth we anticipate generates greater economies of scale and optimizes throughout our CDMO sites. 
Early in the second quarter, Cognate BioServices officially joined Charles River, followed by Vigene Biosciences in late June. We were very pleased to welcome both teams to the company. Aligned with HemaCare and Cellero, these businesses form the core of our cell and gene therapy offering, and we believe they will be highly complementary to our Biologics business and our portfolio as a whole. We are pleased with the initial progress on the integrations and the addition of the cell and gene therapy CDMO services to a comprehensive portfolio, which is resonating with clients. 
Our clients are beginning to explore opportunities to streamline their biologics development workflows by using Cognate's and Vigene's services, and their legacy clients are already looking to utilize other products and services within the Charles River portfolio to drive greater efficiency in their development and manufacturing activities. We believe the acquisition of Vigene Biosciences with its viral vector-based gene delivery solutions fulfills our objective to create a comprehensive cell and gene therapy portfolio, which spans each of the major CDMO platforms: gene-modified cell therapy, viral vector and plasmid DNA production. 
In combination with Cognate's Memphis-based operations, we have established an end-to-end gene-modified cell therapy solution in the U.S., which we believe is critical to support our clients more seamlessly. Our goal is to enable clients to conduct analytical testing, process development and manufacturing for these advanced modalities with the same scientific partner, enabling them to achieve their goal of driving greater efficiency and accelerating the speed to market. 
As a result of the successful execution of our strategy to date, we believe that our portfolio is the strongest it has ever been. Our efforts to enhance our scientific capabilities, deliver flexible outsourcing solutions and provide greater value to our clients have made Charles River an important partner for our clients. With the biopharmaceutical industry benefiting from record funding levels, we are experiencing robust demand for our essential products and services. To support this demand and to continue to enhance the value we provide to clients, we will continue to move our growth strategy forward. Acquisitions and strategic partnerships remain vital components of our strategy as we endeavor to expand the scientific expertise, global reach and innovative technologies that we can offer clients across all 3 of our business segments. 
Investing in our scientific capabilities as well as internally on the necessary staff, resources and our digital enterprise will help us ensure that we can meet the needs of our clients. The successful execution of our strategy will not only enable us to enhance our position as our clients' partner of choice from concept to nonclinical development to the safe manufacture of their life-saving therapeutics. It will also allow us to achieve our longer-term financial targets of low double-digit organic revenue growth and an average of approximately 50 basis points of operating margin improvement beyond 2021. 
In conclusion, I'd like to thank our clients and shareholders for their support and our employees for their exceptional work and commitment. And now I'll ask David to give you additional details on our second quarter results and updated 2021 guidance."

Before I begin, may I remind you that I'll be speaking primarily to non-GAAP results, which exclude amortization and other acquisition-related charges, costs related primarily to our global efficiency initiative, our vent",1159,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Before I begin, may I remind you that I'll be speaking primarily to non-GAAP results, which exclude amortization and other acquisition-related charges, costs related primarily to our global efficiency initiative, our venture capital and other strategic investment performance and certain advances. Many of our comments will also refer to organic revenue growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation. 
Once again, we are very pleased with another strong performance in the second quarter. Robust revenue and earnings per share growth outperformed our prior outlook. Organic revenue growth of 24.1%, including 8% related to last year's COVID-19 impact and operating margin expansion of 350 basis points, were the primary drivers behind earnings per share growth of 65.2% to $2.61. These results also reflect a favorable comparison to the second quarter of last year in which we experienced the peak of the COVID-related impact and client disruptions. 
Based on our strong second quarter results and expectations for the underlying strength of demand to continue, we have increased our full year financial guidance and now expect to deliver organic revenue growth in a range of 13% to 15% for the full year. Primarily as a result of the enhanced growth prospects this year, and to a lesser extent, a favorable tax rate, we raised our earnings per share guidance by $0.35 to a range of $10.10 to $10.35, which represents year-over-year growth of 24% to 27%. 
By segment, our updated outlook for 2021 reflects the strong business environment. For RMS, we continue to expect organic revenue growth in the high teens driven by the recovery in Research Model order activity from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic last year as well as exceptional growth in China. Our outlook for DSA is unchanged, with low double-digit organic revenue growth for the full year, reflecting continued strength in early-stage research activity. For the Manufacturing segment, we now expect to achieve high-teens organic revenue growth. Our revised outlook is based on exceptionally strong demand in Biologics driven primarily by cell and gene therapy programs and an increase in contribution from the Microbial Solutions business, which is expected to return to at least low double-digit growth for the full year. Including the acquisitions of Cognate and, more recently, Vigene Biosciences, Manufacturing's reported revenue growth rate is expected to be in the low to mid-40% range. 
With regard to operating margin, our expectations for segment contributions remain mostly unchanged from our prior outlook, with the RMS operating margin meaningfully above 25% for the full year, DSA in the mid-20% range and Manufacturing slightly below the prior mid-30% outlook, principally reflecting the addition of Vigene in late June. 
Lower unallocated corporate costs contributed to the second quarter margin expansion, totaling 5.6% of revenue or $51.2 million in the second quarter compared to 6.1% of revenue last year. Our scalable infrastructure enables us to drive greater efficiencies even as we continue to make investments to support the growth of our businesses and meet the needs of our clients. We continue to expect unallocated corporate costs to be in the mid-5% range as a percentage of revenue for the full year. 
The second quarter non-GAAP tax rate was 20.4%, representing a 60 basis point decline from 21% in the second quarter of last year. The decrease was due to a favorable excess tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation, which resulted from increased equity exercise and award activity at higher stock price levels during the quarter. This benefit was partially offset by higher tax expense associated with the U.K. tax law change. 
For the full year, we are reducing our tax rate outlook to a range of 19.5% to 20.5% from our prior outlook of a tax rate in the low 20% range, principally driven by a higher benefit from stock-based compensation. 
Total adjusted net interest expense for the second quarter was $20.8 million, an increase of $3.7 million sequentially and $1.7 million year-over-year due to higher debt balances primarily to fund the Cognate acquisition. At the end of the second quarter, we had an outstanding debt balance of $2.7 billion, representing gross and net leverage ratios of about 2.5x. 
Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we completed the acquisition of Vigene on June 28. On a pro forma basis, including Vigene, our gross leverage ratio remained below 3x, which we attribute to our robust free cash flow generation that has enabled us to repay debt ahead of our expectations. For the full year, we now expect total adjusted net interest expense to be slightly below our prior outlook in a range of $82 million to $85 million, primarily reflecting the accelerated debt repayment. 
Free cash flow was $140.2 million in the second quarter, an increase of 3.5% over the $135.5 million for the same period last year. The primary drivers of the increase were our strong second quarter operating performance and distributions from our VC investments, partially offset by higher capital expenditures. In view of our robust results in the first half of the year, we have increased our free cash flow outlook by $65 million and now expect free cash flow of approximately $500 million for the full year. 
CapEx was $46.4 million in the second quarter compared to $26.8 million last year. The increase was due primarily to the timing of projects. Some investments, which were slowed or deferred during the COVID-19 disruptions last year, are now back on track. We continue to expect CapEx to be approximately $220 million for the full year. 
A summary of our revised financial guidance for the full year, including all recent acquisitions, can be found on Slide 39. 
For the third quarter, our outlook reflects a continuation of the strong demand environment. We do expect that growth rates will normalize from the second quarter levels because we have anniversarized the peak of the COVID-19-related revenue loss last year. Accordingly, we expect organic revenue growth in the low to mid-teens range and reported revenue growth in the low 20% range. 
You should note that we are not forecasting a meaningful difference between the first half and second half organic growth rate after normalizing last year's COVID impact, which is not surprising as we believe the robust demand environment is showing no signs of abating. We expect low double-digit earnings per share growth when compared to last year's third quarter level of $2.33. 
I will remind you that the DSA operating margin in the third quarter of last year included a 50 basis point benefit from a discovery milestone payment, which will impact the year-over-year comparison. 
In closing, we are very pleased with our second quarter results, which included another quarter of robust revenue, earnings and free cash flow growth. We continue to be focused on the continued execution of our strategy and achieving our financial and operational targets, which will move us forward toward our longer-term targets for 2024. 
Thank you."

We're investing capacity thoughtfully, aggressively, geographically, multiple sites at once, not dissimilar to what we've done historically. We're continually reviewing where we think the demand will be for the next few years and ensuring that our capacity needs are -- that our capacity is sufficient to accommodate that. 
I don't think it's a bad thing that clients are reserving space earlier, which allows us to plan better, obviously, gives us greater visibility from a staffing and expense point of view. It also provides a more orderly business model, frankly. And it's not all that dissimilar to the way it was years ago where we had similar types of demand even though the client base was quite different. So where I'd say the principal conversations around here are ensuring -- working hard and ensuring that we have sufficient headcount and physical capacity to accommodate the demand, not just in Safety, by the way. Obviously, Safety is our biggest business. So principally, the conversation goes there, but certainly across Biologics and Discovery and other businesses -- and certainly China and RMS as well. 
We're thrilled focusing on ensuring that we have sufficient capacity. It's what we put this portfolio together for to service the clients as they outsource more work. So we are very much on top of that, Eric."

We have the cells, which, for cell therapy, obviously, there is no cell therapy R&D or scale up without that. So we like that we start first with that. We now have significant capability in cell therapy manufacturing, particularly modified cell therapies. And we have this viral vector and plasma DNA capability in both sides of the pond now, U.S. and Europe, which give us a substantial capability as well. 
There may be some nuances. And of course, we're always looking at M&A opportunities. So I don't want to get too specific, except to say that I think that M&A would be principally around in just increased scale and enhanced geographic dispersion and diversity and growth. I do think that not unlike other businesses, geographic proximity, particularly when you're dealing with live cells is not unimportant and would be beneficial, and clients still like the ability to be relatively close to their external providers of services, if possible. So there's still a fair number of assets out there that we're quite interested in there, a variety of sizes. I'd say most of them are on the smaller side. Some larger ones we may have wanted, but those are no longer available. 
If we are unable, for whatever reason or unwilling because of the price point, to buy any of the targets we currently have, I think we do have a very -- we have a terrific installed base, and the growth rates will be such that will become a big business. 
And of course, just want to remind you that we look at the cell and gene therapy assets, which are whatever it is, now 18 to 24 months old. We look at those very much in combination with our Biologics business, which is very high growth right now. You heard us talk about north of 20%. Terrific capacity here. Those businesses are joined that they have for the testing of those cell and gene therapy products before they go into the clinic. And hopefully, after they're approved, before they go into patients, will be just as essential as the contract manufacturing pieces of it. So we're thrilled to be able to piece those together. Pretty big portfolio now. I think that we didn't update it on this call, but I think we said our cell and gene therapy revenues are greater than 10% of total Charles River. It's a big number, and it's going to grow disproportionately fast. So very pleased with the portfolio."

This IS business is increasingly more interesting. The CRADL -- these CRADL locations in -- principally in Cambridge, Mass and South San Francisco and eventually other important parts of the world are both high-revenue generators, high-margin businesses and significant feeders to other parts of our business, particularly service enterprises. So being in those environments, being part of the Cambridge sort of Kendall Square universe has been critically important to us.

So huge investment by the Chinese government in the life sciences, venture capital firms are plenty. And so we're seeing significant investment in sort of classic and new pharma companies and mostly biotech companies. So while I don't personally think the market will overtake the U.S., I think it's going to be the second largest market for sure. 
Yes, I mean, provides enormous demand for us. I think, look, we'll always try to get more price. It's a general proposition, including in China. So I wouldn't say otherwise. 
You know that the cost structure is significantly lower than other parts of the world as the price points, but the margins are comparable. We have to be careful given the fact that we have lower -- we have a lot of local Chinese competitors who I think are, in part or in whole, financed by the government. And so they have the ability to really go after us always on price, just like we've seen in the U.S. and Europe. 
I mean our RMS competitors worldwide principally compete with us on price and not so much on quality or service. But having said that, we'll continue to drive price as much as we can because, of course, costs go up in China as well. And of course, we've -- we're growing at least the RMS franchise very nicely. So lots of investments in services, IS, GEMS, et cetera, lab testing, [indiscernible] in China and significant investments in new production facilities. 
Your second question is a tough one to answer. So I'll just remind you, we have a large and growing RMS business. We have a -- we actually have a large Microbial business. It's just that since the testing isn't regulated over there, the total revenue contribution is relatively modest. And we have recently, within the last 12 months, done sort of a joint venture in our Biologics business, which we're pretty excited about because we have many of our major competitors over there. 
I think as a general proposition, we would like to do everything we do in China, and we certainly would like to do Discovery and Safety. And as we've said catalyst times, M&A multiples are a real deterrent for us. I mean there's no way we can rationally buy companies over there to build out our portfolio without crushing our returns. So we're not going to do that. 
So the issue for us is when do we want to enter and how do we do that thoughtfully and fiscally responsibly with sort of a JV type thing like we've done with Biologics, that's always a possibility, and/or greenfield, our activities there, which is it's slower, which we wouldn't like to that. It's obviously a little less [indiscernible] than buying a company, but it's not insignificant. We're just going to have to continue to evaluate the market demand. 
I would tell you that we are so busy, as you know, from our numbers in the U.S. and Europe that we have lots of work and great growth rates and escalating operating margins without the complexity and some of the challenges of doing work in China. So we're not particularly frustrated with it right now. I would say it's a longer-term strategic conversation that we're having all the time within Charles River."

Both of those businesses have a significant amount of available capacity. By that, I mean they were in the process of expanding capacity when we bought for both of them were actually. So that will continue. It's a significant amount of space. 
It's an interesting one, John, that the business is so potentially so explosive. The ability to take clients, particularly in the manufacturing pieces, the pure CDMO piece for biotype cell therapies, to take those from clinical production to commercial, which we can see with a couple of the clients, at least, depending on how impactful those new drugs are will lead up a lot of capacity. So we're just going to have to live through it. We're going to always have to have incremental capacity available. By that, I mean, rent space, have a plan to finish it either all at once or in slices, sort of chunk it out there and stay very close to the clients, how the drugs are doing, what phase they're in, how well financed are they, what's the competitive scenario. And we're doing that really well. So I think we're in a very good place right now as we see capacity for the next, I don't know, a couple of years, but we're going to have to stay ahead of it. 
The guidance that we gave recently about we anticipate that CapEx will be around 7% of our revenue, that incorporates and accommodates for significant growth certainly in Safety, certainly in Discovery and certainly in the CDMO business, which is obviously a new business for us. I don't think it's particularly more capital-intensive than lots of other things that we do. And I know that -- and particularly the at the cell therapy type of work that we're doing is -- I'm not saying it's not capital-intensive, but it's not as intensive as some other aspects of the CDMO space. So we think we have our arms around sort of scale, growth and cost."

If you look at just -- if you look certainly at most of our large clients, I would say that they buy most and some by everything that we sell, all our products and all of our services. So we are an increasingly more",395,"Yes. I mean we see it progressing well. If you look at just -- if you look certainly at most of our large clients, I would say that they buy most and some by everything that we sell, all our products and all of our services. So we are an increasingly more important provider, significant spend with those companies. We're dealing with very senior people there, and they look at us as an essential provider of a whole bunch of things that they need. The smaller clients get, particularly our biotech clients, while many of them are pre-revenue, lots of them are public, and they put $10 billion or $15 billion or $20 billion market caps. So they're not small companies, and they have -- while they may have the money, they have no, as I said in my prepared remarks, 0 desire to build these things out internally. And I think that's going to get increasingly more nuanced, that they're going to have less of a desire, particularly in things like cell and gene therapy or Biologics Testing, or for sure, Safety. So the broader the portfolio, I think the more client capture that we have. 
We're already seeing almost immediately, as I commented on briefly in my remarks, clients who were working with Cognate and Vigene interested in the broader range of services that Charles River has and conversely clients that we're working with Charles River were very interested that we now have the cell and gene therapy capabilities. So everything is about speed to market with all of these companies regardless of their size. The ability to work with a -- do as much as possible with a single source to kind of get the pricing behind you and not have to renegotiate every step of the way definitely accelerates the whole process. Also with some of these small companies, our regulatory capability is really helpful to them to kind of guide them for their FDA filings or filings with other regulatory agencies around the world. 
So given the fact that there are 3,000 cell and gene therapy drugs in development, 2/3 of which are in preclinical, hopefully, a large number of which we are already working with and will continue to work with having these capabilities was really essential for us to participate in a really large portion of the marketplace."

And actually, we actually think the second half of the year would be somewhat similar. That said, in respect to your question about how the FX might turn out in the longer term, as we've seen through history, we should see that reverse. I can't predict when that FX will reverse. But at some point, we should see some benefits coming in certainly over the period to 2024. 
In respect to the question around the CDMO drag on the margins, and in particular, Cognate, we -- well, to start, we're not expecting to see a meaningful impact on the consolidated operating margin. But to your question, yes, there is a drag on the Manufacturing segment's margin. And as we said before, we expect to see modest margin improvement over the next few years. And as we deliver the acquisition synergies, there's -- we've got a great procurement department. We've got good back-office functions that can bring some synergies to those businesses. We will continue to enhance the scale of the business. And like we do with every operating unit, we're looking to drive operating efficiency. 
And with the high revenue growth where we're expecting north of 25% for the foreseeable future, we would get economies as those, if you like, the fixed costs become less prevalent with respect to the whole business. 
So in terms of margin progression, we would expect to see with time the manufacturing business improve, certainly, from today's position. And in terms of long-term guidance that we gave just 2 months ago, we did say that we were expecting to get into the mid-30% range. Clearly, we will do what we can to improve that further. But at this stage, we're posting over the next year's mid-30s for Manufacturing."

I mean like many people you picked up that many companies, it's a global issue, pressures across most industries, I can't say heavy industry, but certainly most of industries and regions. 
[Audio Gap] 
And yes, we're seeing our revenue growth is ahead of our initial expectations. So as you can imagine, we're working very hard in multiple geographies to actually make sure we're hiring and meeting that robust demand. 
So really, the -- to your question about splitting that between workgroups, it's more about bringing in the staff or the sort of the wider growth that we're seeing as opposed to specific categories. Of course, with 19,000 people, there's going to be some departments where we may feel that there are some needs to pay more to make sure that we can get that type of result in. But we're not seeing a blanket issue with respect to scientific staff or with other staff. It's more about just managing the shear growth within Charles River, vis-à-vis the wider churn that we're seeing in the wider economy. Because of COVID, people -- many people are looking for change. So we continue to drive some of these work-life balance type issues because that will go a long way to helping with retention as well. 
But notwithstanding all that, that I've described, we've factored that into the guidance for this year. We still feel that, that's still relevant in respect to the longer-term guidance that we've given. So we should still see that 150 basis point increase over the next 3 years after this year. How that will pan out within the years, too early to call. But certainly, we feel with the extra growth that we're benefiting from, that helps pay for some of these global issues that we're all facing."

So every once in a while, we get a quasi serious question about that. So what would that look like? And we give them a quote, and I guess it's too expensive. 
We're really pleased with the price. Again, we're not going to disclose the price, we haven't for years, but we're really pleased with the pricing that we're getting in Safety with the studies continue to be incredibly complex, more complex they used to be, oftentimes, endpoints are added as the drug progresses and looks more promising, those studies get more expensive. And we continue to have a nice mix between what we call general toxicology and special toxicology, which provides an enhancement to the overall price paradigm. 
We have to be conscious and cognizant and professional about the pricing because not unlike so many of our other businesses, like RMS, for instance, we have competitors, particularly smaller ones that compete with us principally on price, allegedly on speed and flexibility, which is not true. I'd like to play the card that Charles River must be too slow because it's so big. That's just not true. 
So -- and when we have new opportunities to build on new work unless we're trying to take work from our competitor, but pretty much always driving the price up. So I would say that pricing is increasingly -- it's certainly an important focus of our clients. But I would say as demand has intensified and as capacity continues to fill, even with new capacity being built, that price is not the first thing the clients talk about, and I think it's provided some opportunities for us. 
We've been pretty pleased with the pricing yields for the last, I'd say, 3 years anyway. And I wouldn't anticipate any change in that going forward."

Good morning. The strength of our leading nonclinical portfolio was clearly demonstrated in our second quarter financial performance.

The strength of our leading nonclinical portfolio was clearly demonstrated in our second quarter financial performance. Robust industry fundamentals are leading to unprecedented client demand across most of our businesses, and we're extremely well positioned to succeed in this environment. 
Second quarter organic growth -- revenue growth was in the mid-teens, even after normalizing for last year's COVID-19 impact and exceeded the long-term low double-digit target that we recently provided at our Investor Day in May. Clients are increasingly choosing to partner with us for our flexible and efficient outsourcing solutions, the scientific depth and breadth of our portfolio, and our unwavering focus on flawlessly serving the diverse needs.
Utilizing our capabilities enables them to drive greater efficiency and accelerate the speed of their research, nonclinical development and manufacturing programs. We believe that the efforts we have made and continue to make to differentiate ourselves from the competition are critical as clients choose to work with a smaller number of CROs who offer broader scientific capabilities.
Due to the sustained demand, we are keenly focused on the execution of our strategy. We are strengthening our portfolio as we did through the acquisition of gene therapy CDMO, Vigene Biosciences in late June, strategically adding staff and capacity to accommodate the robust demand and support our clients and enhancing our digital enterprise to provide greater connectivity and exceptional service to them. We believe we will make these investments and remain well positioned to achieve our operating margin target of 22.5% in 2024.
We believe the success of our strategy is reflected in our second quarter performance. So let me provide some of the highlights. Quarterly revenue surpassed $900 million for the first time, and the $914.6 million in the second quarter of '21 represented a 34% increase over last year. Organic revenue growth of 24.1% was increased by approximately 8% when compared to last year's COVID-19 impact in the second quarter of 2020, with the greatest impact in the Research Models and Services segment.
Even after normalizing for the COVID impact, we reported mid-teens organic growth with double-digit increases across all 3 business segments. The operating margin was 20.8%, an increase of 350 basis points year-over-year. The improvement was principally driven by the RMS segment, reflecting operating leverage from significantly higher sales volume for Research Models due in part to the comparison to last year's COVID-19 impact. Notwithstanding this favorable year-over-year comparison, we were pleased with the margin progression in the first half of the year and are on track to achieve a full year operating margin of approximately 21% or 100 basis points higher than last year.
Earnings per share were $2.61 in the second quarter, an increase of 65.2% from $1.58 in the second quarter of last year. This result widely exceeded our prior outlook of more than 50% earnings growth for the quarter, primarily as a result of the exceptional demand environment.
Based on the second quarter performance and our expectation for sustained demand through the remainder of the year, we are increasing our revenue growth and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance for 2021. We now expect organic revenue growth in a range of 13% to 15%, 100 basis point increase from our prior range.
Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be in the range from $10.10 to $10.35, which represents 24% to 27% year-over-year growth and an increase of $0.35 at midpoint from our prior outlook. We attribute this exceptional performance and outlook to the success of our ongoing efforts to enhance our position as the leading nonclinical contract research and manufacturing organization as well as the pace of scientific innovation that's fueling a significant increase in biotech funding and FDA approvals, both of which are tracking to near record levels through the first half of the year.
I'd like to provide you with details on the second quarter segment performance, beginning with the DSA segment. Revenue was $540.1 million in the second quarter, an 18.1% increase on an organic basis over the second quarter of '20, driven by broad-based demand for both Discovery and Safety Assessment services. COVID only had a small impact on the DSA segment last year, so it wasn't a meaningful driver of the year-over-year growth.
Safety Assessment business continued to perform exceptionally well, reflecting robust demand from both biotech and global biopharma clients and price increases. Bookings and proposal volume continued to achieve record highs in the second quarter, with strength across all regions and major service areas. The strength of biotech funding is enabling clients to meaningfully invest in early-stage programs. And due to the unprecedented demand, we are now booking work into next year.
As I mentioned last quarter, clients are expanding their preclinical pipelines and intensifying their focus on complex biologics. To ensure they do not delay their research, we believe clients are securing space with us further in advance, which, in turn, provides us with greater visibility.
To support our clients, we are continuing to add staff, capacity and the resources necessary to effectively manage the current demand environment and provide our clients with a timely, efficient and high-quality service that they have come to expect from Charles River. We believe these investments position Safety Assessment business well and will support low double-digit organic revenue growth in the DSA segment this year.
We believe the combination of the robust funding environment as well as our deep scientific expertise and willingness to forge flexible relationships with our clients led to another exceptional quarter for the Discovery business. Our comprehensive portfolio of oncology, CNS, early discovery and antibody discovery capabilities, which we recently enhanced through the Distributed Bio and Retrogenix acquisitions, is resonating with clients, and clients are increasingly choosing to outsource to integrated discovery partners like Charles River. Despite the robust funding, biotech clients continue to maintain limited or no internal infrastructure, opting instead to invest in their pipelines and utilize our services to move their programs forward.
To support the robust demand from biotech and global biopharmaceutical clients, we will continue to strengthen our portfolio by expanding our scale, our science and our innovative technologies through a combination of internal investment, M&A and our strategic partnership strategy. By doing so, we are enabling our clients to remain with one scientific partner from target ID through IND filing and beyond and solidifying our position as the leading nonclinical CRO.
The DSA operating margin increased by 30 basis points to 23.5% in the second quarter. Leverage from the robust DSA revenue growth was the primary driver of the margin improvement. Foreign exchange reduced the DSA operating margin by 150 basis points in the quarter as revenue and costs are not naturally hedged at certain DSA sites, including our Safety Assessment operations in Canada. We continue to expect the DSA margin will be in the mid-20% range for the year.
RMS revenue was $176.7 million, an increase of 44.5% on an organic basis over the second quarter of '20. Approximately 33.4% of this growth was attributable to the comparison to last year's COVID-related revenue impact from client site closures and disruptions, which reduced research model order activity.
Adjusted for the COVID impact, the RMS growth rate was above 10% as strong research activity across biopharmaceutical academic and government clients led most RMS businesses to grow above their targeted growth rates. Robust demand for research models in China continued to be the primary driver of RMS revenue growth. There has been a resurgence of research activity this year, and model volumes far exceed pre-COVID levels.
Similar to Western markets, the client base in China has transitioned from one dominated by academic and government accounts to a vibrant mid-tier biotech and CRO client base, which now represents the majority of our clients in China. We believe the expansion of our client base is fueling increased demand. And to accommodate the growth, we are continuing to expand our model and services offering and our geographic footprint in Western and Southern China. We are currently experiencing strong double-digit revenue growth in China.
Demand for Research Models outside of China was also quite strong. We believe this correlates with the increased level of nonclinical research that's being conducted by biopharmaceutical and academic clients in Western markets. Research investments have led to biomedical breakthroughs and new drug modalities, and we believe the global focus on scientific innovation is sustainable.
We also continue to win new academic clients in the second quarter, resulting from the COVID-19-related client shutdowns last year and more recently, from digital engagements targeting the academic client base. Research Models and Services also performed very well.
GEMS is benefiting from strong outsourcing demand as our clients seek the greater flexibility and efficiency they gain when we manage their proprietary model colonies. The greater complexity of scientific research and the proprietary models that our clients are creating further reinforce the value proposition for the GEMS business.
Clients' need for greater flexibility and efficiency is also driving demand for our Insourcing Solutions or IS business, particularly for our CRADL initiative, which provides both small and large biopharmaceutical clients with turnkey research capacity at Charles River sites. In addition to expanding our existing CRADL presence and adding clients in the Boston, Cambridge and South San Francisco biohubs, we're also looking to expand into other regions to provide a flexible capacity solution for our clients in emerging biohubs. Utilizing CRADL also provides clients with collaborative opportunities to seamlessly access other Charles River services, which further enhances the speed and efficiency of their research programs.
The revenue growth rate for our cell supply businesses, HemaCare and Cellero, improved in the second quarter but remain below the targeted level due to continued limitations on donor access. We believe cell supply revenue will increase during the second half of the year as donor availability and capacity improve.
We have expanded capabilities, including donor capacity, at our cell supply sites in Massachusetts and Washington State, which we believe will enable us to further expand our donor base in the U.S. and accommodate the robust demand in the broader cell therapy market. We expect HemaCare and Cellero will provide the critical tools for our new cell and gene therapy CDMO business, Cognate and Vigene. We believe this will be highly synergistic for both Charles River and our clients because it will enable us to move client cell therapy programs forward using the same cellular products from research to CGMP production. 
The RMS operating margin increased to 27.4% from 9.1% in the second quarter of last year. The significant improvement was primarily due to the comparison to last year's depressed margin associated with COVID-related client disruptions and the corresponding reduction in Research Model order activity.
Revenue for the Manufacturing segment was $197.8 million, a 26.6% increase on an organic basis over the second quarter of last year. The increase was driven by strong double-digit revenue growth in both the Biologics Testing Solutions and Microbial Solutions businesses. COVID-19 did not have a meaningful impact on the segment's revenue last year, but testing on COVID vaccine -- COVID-19 vaccines has helped accelerate Biologics revenue growth rate this year.
Consistent with the first quarter, Microbial Solutions growth rate in the second quarter was well above the 10% level, reflecting strong demand for our Endosafe endotoxin testing systems, cartridges and core reagents in all geographic regions as well as Accugenix microbial identification services. With COVID-related client access restrictions effectively behind us, we were pleased with the strength of the underlying demand for our endotoxin testing platform, which reforms FDA-mandated lot release testing for our clients' critical quality control testing needs.
The advantages of our comprehensive portfolio continue to resonate with clients, and we believe that our ability to provide a total microbial testing solution will enable Microbial Solutions to deliver at least low double-digit organic revenue growth this year and beyond, which is consistent with the historical trend pre-COVID.
The Biologics Testing business reported another exceptional quarter of strong revenue growth that was well above the 20% growth target for this business. Robust demand for cell and gene therapy testing services continue to be the primary growth driver.
There has been a rapid increase in the number of cell and gene therapy programs in development to approximately 3,000 programs now in the pipeline, with approximately 2/3 in the preclinical phase, which is expected to continue to fuel the strong growth. COVID-19 vaccine work was also a meaningful driver of Biologics second quarter growth, but the underlying Biologics growth trends remained above the 20% level, even without the incremental COVID-19 testing revenue.
We believe cell and gene therapies will continue to be significant growth drivers over the long term, and demand for COVID-19 vaccine testing is showing no signs of abating. We believe the commercial production of COVID vaccines will continue for many years to come, supporting the demand for our services. These factors are contributing to the strength of the demand environment, and we continue to build our extensive portfolio of manufacturing services to ensure we have available capacity to accommodate client demand.
The Manufacturing segment second quarter operating margin declined by 420 basis points to 33.2%. The primary driver of the decline was the addition of Cognate's CDMO business as well as higher production costs in the microbial business. Cognate is a profitable business with a solid operating margin, but its margin is below the Manufacturing segment.
Coupled with the addition of Vigene in the third quarter, we expect a full year Manufacturing margin slightly below the mid-30% range. However, beyond 2021, we expect this headwind to gradually dissipate as we drive efficiency and as the significant growth we anticipate generates greater economies of scale and optimizes throughout our CDMO sites.
Early in the second quarter, Cognate BioServices officially joined Charles River, followed by Vigene Biosciences in late June. We were very pleased to welcome both teams to the company. Aligned with HemaCare and Cellero, these businesses form the core of our cell and gene therapy offering, and we believe they will be highly complementary to our Biologics business and our portfolio as a whole. We are pleased with the initial progress on the integrations and the addition of the cell and gene therapy CDMO services to a comprehensive portfolio, which is resonating with clients.
Our clients are beginning to explore opportunities to streamline their biologics development workflows by using Cognate's and Vigene's services, and their legacy clients are already looking to utilize other products and services within the Charles River portfolio to drive greater efficiency in their development and manufacturing activities. We believe the acquisition of Vigene Biosciences with its viral vector-based gene delivery solutions fulfills our objective to create a comprehensive cell and gene therapy portfolio, which spans each of the major CDMO platforms: gene-modified cell therapy, viral vector and plasmid DNA production.
In combination with Cognate's Memphis-based operations, we have established an end-to-end gene-modified cell therapy solution in the U.S., which we believe is critical to support our clients more seamlessly. Our goal is to enable clients to conduct analytical testing, process development and manufacturing for these advanced modalities with the same scientific partner, enabling them to achieve their goal of driving greater efficiency and accelerating the speed to market.
As a result of the successful execution of our strategy to date, we believe that our portfolio is the strongest it has ever been. Our efforts to enhance our scientific capabilities, deliver flexible outsourcing solutions and provide greater value to our clients have made Charles River an important partner for our clients. With the biopharmaceutical industry benefiting from record funding levels, we are experiencing robust demand for our essential products and services.
To support this demand and to continue to enhance the value we provide to clients, we will continue to move our growth strategy forward. Acquisitions and strategic partnerships remain vital components of our strategy as we endeavor to expand the scientific expertise, global reach and innovative technologies that we can offer clients across all 3 of our business segments.
Investing in our scientific capabilities as well as internally on the necessary staff, resources and our digital enterprise will help us ensure that we can meet the needs of our clients. The successful execution of our strategy will not only enable us to enhance our position as our clients' partner of choice from concept to nonclinical development to the safe manufacture of their life-saving therapeutics. It will also allow us to achieve our longer-term financial targets of low double-digit organic revenue growth and an average of approximately 50 basis points of operating margin improvement beyond 2021.
In conclusion, I'd like to thank our clients and shareholders for their support and our employees for their exceptional work and commitment. And now I'll ask David to give you additional details on our second quarter results and updated 2021 guidance."
91093,1673778088,2362895,"Charles River Laboratories International, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2021",2021-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Before I begin, may I remind you that I'll be speaking primarily to non-GAAP results, which exclude amortization and other acquisition-related charges, costs related primarily to our global efficiency initiative, our vent",1161,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Before I begin, may I remind you that I'll be speaking primarily to non-GAAP results, which exclude amortization and other acquisition-related charges, costs related primarily to our global efficiency initiative, our venture capital and other strategic investment performance and certain [ advancements ]. Many of our comments will also refer to organic revenue growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation.
Once again, we are very pleased with another strong performance in the second quarter. Robust revenue and earnings per share growth outperformed our prior outlook. Organic revenue growth of 24.1%, including 8% related to last year's COVID-19 impact and operating margin expansion of 350 basis points, were the primary drivers behind earnings per share growth of 65.2% to $2.61. These results also reflect a favorable comparison to the second quarter of last year in which we experienced the peak of the COVID-related impact and client disruptions.
Based on our strong second quarter results and expectations for the underlying strength of demand to continue, we have increased our full year financial guidance and now expect to deliver organic revenue growth in a range of 13% to 15% for the full year. Primarily as a result of the enhanced growth prospects this year, and to a lesser extent, a favorable tax rate, we raised our earnings per share guidance by $0.35 to a range of $10.10 to $10.35, which represents year-over-year growth of 24% to 27%.
By segment, our updated outlook for 2021 reflects the strong business environment. For RMS, we continue to expect organic revenue growth in the high teens driven by the recovery in Research Model order activity from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic last year as well as exceptional growth in China. Our outlook for DSA is unchanged with low double-digit organic revenue growth for the full year, reflecting continued strength in early-stage research activity.
For the Manufacturing segment, we now expect to achieve high-teens organic revenue growth. Our revised outlook is based on exceptionally strong demand in Biologics driven primarily by cell and gene therapy programs and an increase in contribution from the Microbial Solutions business, which is expected to return to at least low double-digit growth for the full year. Including the acquisitions of Cognate and more recently, Vigene Biosciences, Manufacturing's reported revenue growth rate is expected to be in the low to mid-40% range.
With regard to operating margin, our expectations for segment contributions remain mostly unchanged from our prior outlook with the RMS operating margin meaningfully above 25% for the full year, DSA in the mid-20% range and Manufacturing slightly below the prior mid-30% outlook, principally reflecting the addition of Vigene in late June.
Lower unallocated corporate costs contributed to the second quarter margin expansion totaling 5.6% of revenue or $51.2 million in the second quarter compared to 6.1% of revenue last year. Our scalable infrastructure enables us to drive greater efficiencies even as we continue to make investments to support the growth of our businesses and meet the needs of our clients. We continue to expect unallocated corporate costs to be in the mid-5% range as a percentage of revenue for the full year.
The second quarter non-GAAP tax rate was 20.4%, representing a 60 basis point decline from 21% in the second quarter of last year. The decrease was due to a favorable excess tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation, which resulted from increased equity exercise and award activity at higher stock price levels during the quarter. This benefit was partially offset by higher tax expense associated with the U.K. tax law change. For the full year, we are reducing our tax rate outlook to a range of 19.5% to 20.5% from our prior outlook of a tax rate in the low 20% range, principally driven by a higher benefit from stock-based compensation.
Total adjusted net interest expense for the second quarter was $20.8 million, an increase of $3.7 million sequentially and $1.7 million year-over-year due to higher debt balances primarily to fund the Cognate acquisition. At the end of the second quarter, we had an outstanding debt balance of $2.7 billion, representing gross and net leverage ratios of about 2.5x.
Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we completed the acquisition of Vigene on June 28. On a pro forma basis, including Vigene, our gross leverage ratio remained below 3x, which we attribute to our robust free cash flow generation that has enabled us to repay debt ahead of our expectations. For the full year, we now expect total adjusted net interest expense to be slightly below our prior outlook in a range of $82 million to $85 million, primarily reflecting the accelerated debt repayment.
Free cash flow was $140.2 million in the second quarter, an increase of 3.5% over the $135.5 million for the same period last year. The primary drivers of the increase were our strong second quarter operating performance and distributions from our VC investments, partially offset by higher capital expenditures. In view of our robust results in the first half of the year, we have increased our free cash flow outlook by $65 million and now expect free cash flow of approximately $500 million for the full year.
CapEx was $46.4 million in the second quarter compared to $26.8 million last year. The increase was due primarily to the timing of projects. Some investments, which were slowed or deferred during the COVID-19 disruptions last year, are now back on track. We continue to expect CapEx to be approximately $220 million for the full year. A summary of our revised financial guidance for the full year, including all recent acquisitions, can be found on Slide 39.
For the third quarter, our outlook reflects a continuation of the strong demand environment. We do expect that growth rates will normalize from the second quarter levels because we have anniversarized the peak of the COVID-19-related revenue loss last year. Accordingly, we expect organic revenue growth in the low to mid-teens range and reported revenue growth in the low 20% range.
You should note that we are not forecasting a meaningful difference between the first half and second half organic growth rates after normalizing last year's COVID impact, which is not surprising as we believe the robust demand environment is showing no signs of abating. We expect low double-digit earnings per share growth when compared to last year's third quarter level of $2.33. I will remind you that the DSA operating margin in the third quarter of last year included a 50 basis point benefit from a discovery milestone payment, which will impact the year-over-year comparison.
In closing, we are very pleased with our second quarter results, which included another quarter of robust revenue, earnings and free cash flow growth. We continue to be focused on the continued execution of our strategy and achieving our financial and operational targets, which will move us forward toward our longer-term targets for 2024. Thank you."

We're investing capacity thoughtfully, aggressively, geographically, multiple sites at once, not dissimilar to what we've done historically. We're continually reviewing where we think the demand will be for the next few years and ensuring that our capacity needs are -- that our capacity is sufficient to accommodate that.
I don't think it's a bad thing that clients are reserving space earlier, which allows us to plan better. It obviously gives us greater visibility from a staffing and expense point of view. It also provides a more orderly business model, frankly. And it's not all that dissimilar to the way it was years ago where we had similar types of demand even though the client base was quite different.
So where I'd say the principal conversations around here are ensuring -- working hard and ensuring that we have sufficient headcount and physical capacity to accommodate the demand, not just in Safety, by the way. Obviously, Safety is our biggest business. So principally, the conversation goes there, but certainly across Biologics and Discovery and other businesses -- and certainly China and RMS as well.
We're thrilled to be focusing on ensuring that we have sufficient capacity. It's what we put this portfolio together for to service the clients as they outsource more work. So we are very much on top of that, Eric."

We have the cells, which, for cell therapy, obviously, there is no cell therapy R&D or scale up without that. So we like that we start first with that. We now have significant capability in cell therapy manufacturing, particularly modified cell therapies. And we have this viral vector and plasmid DNA capability in both sides of the pond now, U.S. and Europe, which give us a substantial capability as well.
There may be some nuances. And of course, we're always looking at M&A opportunities. So I don't want to get too specific, except to say that I think that M&A would be principally around in just increased scale and enhanced geographic dispersion and diversity and growth.
I do think that not unlike other businesses, geographic proximity, particularly when you're dealing with live cells, is not unimportant and would be beneficial. And clients still like the ability to be relatively close to their external providers of services, if possible.
So there's still a fair number of assets out there that we're quite interested in there, a variety of sizes. I'd say most of them are on the smaller side. Some larger ones, we may have wanted, but those are no longer available. If we are unable, for whatever reason or unwilling because of the price point, to buy any of the targets we currently have, I think we do have a very -- we have a terrific installed base, and the growth rates will be such -- that will become a big business.
And of course, just want to remind you that we look at the cell and gene therapy assets, which are, whatever it is, now 18 to 24 months old. We look at those very much in combination with our Biologics business, which is very high growth right now. You heard us talk about north of 20%. Terrific capacity here. Those businesses are joined at the hip, so the testing of those cell and gene therapy products before they go into the clinic and hopefully, after they're approved, before they go into patients, will be just as essential as the contract manufacturing pieces of it.
So we're thrilled to be able to piece those together. Pretty big portfolio now. I think that we didn't update it on this call, but I think we said our cell and gene therapy revenues are greater than 10% of the total Charles River. It's a big number, and it's going to grow disproportionately fast. So very pleased with the portfolio."

The -- but putting aside that COVID pop as it were, this significant demand -- increasing demand for GEMS models and specialty models and more complex models and more translational models for sure. This IS business is increasingly more interesting.
The CRADL -- these CRADL locations in -- principally in Cambridge, Mass and South San Francisco and eventually other important parts of the world are both high-revenue generators, high-margin businesses and significant feeders to other parts of our business, particularly service enterprises. So being in those environments, being part of the Cambridge sort of Kendall Square universe has been critically important to us.

So huge investment by the Chinese government in the life sciences, venture capital firms are plenty. And so we're seeing significant investment in sort of classic and new pharma companies and mostly biotech companies. So while I don't personally think the market will overtake the U.S., I think it's going to be the second largest market for sure.
Yes, I mean, it provides enormous demand for us. I think -- look, we'll always try to get more price. It's a general proposition, including in China. So I wouldn't say otherwise.
You know that the cost structure is significantly lower than other parts of the world as the price points, but the margins are comparable. We have to be careful given the fact that we have lower -- we have a lot of local Chinese competitors who I think are, in part or in whole, financed by the government. And so they have the ability to really go after us always on price, just like we've seen in the U.S. and Europe.
I mean our RMS competitors worldwide principally compete with us on price and not so much on quality or service. But having said that, we'll continue to drive price as much as we can because, of course, costs go up in China as well. And of course, we've -- we're growing at least the RMS franchise very nicely. So lots of investments in services, IS, GEMS, et cetera, lab testing, labs in China and significant investments in new production facilities.
Your second question is a tough one to answer. So I'll just remind you, we have a large and growing RMS business. We have a -- we actually have a large Microbial business. It's just that since the testing isn't regulated over there, the total revenue contribution is relatively modest. And we have recently, within the last 12 months, done sort of a joint venture in our Biologics business, which we're pretty excited about because we have many of our major competitors over there.
I think as a general proposition, we would like to do everything we do in China, and we certainly would like to do Discovery and Safety. And as we've said countless times, M&A multiples are a real deterrent for us. I mean there's no way we can rationally buy companies over there to build out our portfolio without crushing our returns. So we're not going to do that.
So the issue for us is when do we want to enter and how do we do that thoughtfully and fiscally responsibly with sort of a JV-type thing like we've done with Biologics, that's always a possibility, and/or greenfield. Our activities there, which is -- it's slower, which we wouldn't like to that. It's obviously less than buying a company, but it's not insignificant. We're just going to have to continue to evaluate the market demand.
I would tell you that we are so busy, as you know, from our numbers in the U.S. and Europe that we have lots of work and great growth rates and escalating operating margins without the complexity and some of the challenges of doing work in China. So we're not particularly frustrated with it right now. I would say it's a longer-term strategic conversation that we're having all the time within Charles River."

Both of those businesses have a significant amount of available capacity. By that, I mean they were in the process of expanding capacity when we bought for both of them actually. So that will continue. It's a significant amount of space.
It's an interesting one, John. The business is so potentially so explosive. The ability to take clients, particularly in the manufacturing pieces, the pure CDMO piece for biotype cell therapies, to take those from clinical production to commercial, which we can see with a couple of the clients, at least, depending on how impactful those new drugs are, will lead up a lot of capacity.
So we're just going to have to live through it. We're going to always have to have incremental capacity available. By that, I mean, rent space, have a plan to finish it either all at once or in slices, sort of chunk it out there and stay very close to the clients, how the drugs are doing, what phase they're in, how well financed are they, what's the competitive scenario. And we're doing that really well. So I think we're in a very good place right now as we see capacity for the next, I don't know, a couple of years, but we're going to have to stay ahead of it.
The guidance that we gave recently about -- we anticipate that CapEx will be around 7% of our revenue. That incorporates and accommodates for significant growth certainly in Safety, certainly in Discovery and certainly in the CDMO business, which is obviously a new business for us.
I don't think it's particularly more capital-intensive than lots of other things that we do. And I know that -- and particularly the  cell therapy type of work that we're doing is -- I'm not saying it's not capital-intensive, but it's not as intensive as some other aspects of the CDMO space. So we think we have our arms around sort of scale, growth and cost."

If you look at just -- if you look certainly at most of our large clients, I would say that they buy most and some buy everything that we sell, all our products and all of our services. So we are an increasingly more important provider, significant spend with those companies. We're dealing with very senior people there, and they look at us as an essential provider of a whole bunch of things that they need.
The smaller clients get, particularly our biotech clients, while many of them are pre-revenue, lots of them are public, and they put $10 billion or $15 billion or $20 billion market caps. So they're not small companies, and they have -- while they may have the money, they have no -- as I said in my prepared remarks, 0 desire to build these things out internally. And I think that's going to get increasingly more nuanced, that they're going to have less of a desire, particularly in things like cell and gene therapy or Biologics Testing, or for sure, Safety. So the broader the portfolio, I think the more client capture that we have. 
We're already seeing almost immediately, as I commented on briefly in my remarks, clients who were working with Cognate and Vigene interested in the broader range of services that Charles River has and conversely, clients that -- who were working with Charles River, who were very interested that we now have the cell and gene therapy capabilities.
So everything is about speed to market with all of these companies regardless of their size. The ability to work with a -- do as much as possible with a single source to kind of get the pricing behind you and not have to renegotiate every step of the way definitely accelerates the whole process. Also with some of these small companies, our regulatory capability is really helpful to them to kind of guide them for their FDA filings or filings with other regulatory agencies around the world.
So given the fact that there are 3,000 cell and gene therapy drugs in development, 2/3 of which are in preclinical, a lot -- hopefully, a large number of which we are already working with and will continue to work with having these capabilities, was really essential for us to participate in a really large portion of the marketplace."

And actually, we actually think the second half of the year would be somewhat similar.
That said, in respect to your question about how the FX might turn out in the longer term, as we've seen through history, we should see that reverse. I can't predict when that FX will reverse. But at some point, we should see some benefits coming in certainly over the period to 2024.
In respect to the question around the CDMO drag on the margins and in particular, Cognate, we -- well, to start, we're not expecting to see a meaningful impact on the consolidated operating margin. But to your question, yes, there is a drag on the Manufacturing segment's margin. And as we said before, we expect to see modest margin improvement over the next few years.
And as we deliver the acquisition synergies, there's -- we've got a great procurement department. We've got good back office functions that can bring some synergies to those businesses. We will continue to enhance the scale of the business. And like we do with every operating unit, we're looking to drive operating efficiency. And with the high revenue growth where we're expecting north of 25% for the foreseeable future, we would get economies as those, if you like, the fixed costs become less prevalent with respect to the whole business.
So in terms of margin progression, we would expect to see with time the manufacturing business improve certainly from today's position. And in terms of long-term guidance that we gave just 2 months ago, we did say that we were expecting to get into the mid-30% range. Clearly, we will do what we can to improve that further. But at this stage, we're posting over the next year's mid-30s for Manufacturing."

So well, I'll take the broader question first on just wage and inflation pressures. I mean [ unlike ] many people, you picked up many companies, it's a global issue, pressures across most industries, I can't say every industry, but certainly most of industries and regions.
And certainly, wage pressure and recruitment for Charles River has been and always in terms of we're continually growing, and we've got to keep up with that. We've spoken about this at many of our earnings calls. We've discussed some of the investments that we've made and initiatives to address that in the past like the living wage, work-life balance initiatives and so on. 
And yes, we're seeing our revenue growth is ahead of our initial expectations. So as you can imagine, we're working very hard in multiple geographies to actually make sure we're hiring and meeting that robust demand.
So really, the -- to your question about splitting that between workgroups, it's more about bringing in the staff or the sort of the wider growth that we're seeing as opposed to specific categories. Of course, with 19,000 people, there's going to be some departments where we may feel that there are some needs to pay more to make sure that we can get that type of result in.
But we're not seeing a blanket issue with respect to scientific staff or with other staff. It's more about just managing the sheer growth within Charles River vis-à-vis the wider churn that we're seeing in the wider economy. Because of COVID, people -- many people are looking for change. So we continue to drive some of these work-life balance type issues because that will go a long way to helping with retention as well.
But notwithstanding all that, that I've described, we've factored that into the guidance for this year. We still feel that, that's still relevant in respect to the longer-term guidance that we've given. So we should still see that 150 basis point increase over the next 3 years after this year.
How that will pan out within the years, too early to call. But certainly, we feel with the extra growth that we're benefiting from, that helps pay for some of these global issues that we're all facing."

So every once in a while, we get a quasi serious question about that. So what would that look like? And we give them a quote, and I guess it's too expensive.
We're really pleased with the price. Again, we're not going to disclose the price, as we haven't for years, but we're really pleased with the pricing that we're getting in Safety with the studies, continue to be incredibly complex, more complex than they used to be, oftentimes, end points are added as the drug progresses and looks more promising, those studies get more expensive. And we continue to have a nice mix between what we call general toxicology and special toxicology, which provides an enhancement to the overall price paradigm.
We have to be conscious and cognizant and professional about the pricing because not unlike so many of our other businesses, like RMS, for instance, we have competitors, particularly smaller ones that compete with us principally on price, allegedly on speed and flexibility, which is not true. I'd like to play the card that Charles River must be too slow because it's so big. That's just not true.
So -- and when we have new opportunities to build on new work, unless we're trying to take work from our competitor, we're pretty much always driving the price up. So I would say that pricing is increasingly -- it's certainly an important focus of our clients.
But I would say as demand has intensified and as capacity continues to fill, even with new capacity being built, that price is not the first thing the clients talk about, and I think it's provided some opportunities for us.
We've been pretty pleased with the pricing yields for the last, I'd say, 3 years anyway. And I wouldn't anticipate any change in that going forward."

Our; strong third quarter results demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy and the progress we've made on its execution as well as the sustained strength of the industry fundamentals. As anticipated, third quarter revenue increased at a",2917,"Good morning. Our; strong third quarter results demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy and the progress we've made on its execution as well as the sustained strength of the industry fundamentals. As anticipated, third quarter revenue increased at a low teens rate organically, and we reported mid-teens earnings per share growth. We believe that Charles River is a stronger company today than it has ever been. We have seen unprecedented demand across most of our businesses and we believe that this, coupled with the strength of our leading nonclinical portfolio, will enable us to achieve our low double-digit organic revenue growth target over the longer term as well as in 2022.
As a result, we are continuing to invest; to add people and capacity; to accommodate growing client demand and to build a scalable operating model; to enhance our scientifically distinguished portfolio; to strengthen our relationship with clients; and to work with them to devise outsourcing solutions, which enable them to increase productivity and speed to market.
We have maintained our focus on nonclinical drug research and manufacturing solutions, strategically expanding our portfolio to provide clients with the critical capabilities that require to discover, develop and safely manufacture new drugs.
Last month, we divested our RMS operations in Japan and our CDMO site in Sweden for a total of approximately $115 million plus potential contingent payments of up to an additional $25 million. We routinely evaluate the strategic fit and fundamental performance of our global infrastructure for acquisitions and legacy sites alike and have sold or closed operations that didn't meet our key business criteria or may have been underperforming financially. The decision to divest these 2 operations was consistent with our evaluation process, and we intend to redeploy the capital in other growth areas of our business.
Moving to the third quarter. Highlights of our financial performance are as follows. We reported revenue of $895.9 million in the third quarter of '21, a 20.5% increase over last year. Organic revenue growth was 13.6%, with each of our business segments contributing a strong performance. Last year's COVID impact resulted in a modest 170 basis point increase to organic revenue growth.
From a client perspective, biotechs continue to drive revenue growth, with global biopharmaceutical clients also making solid contributions to the quarter. Third quarter reported revenue growth was affected by a $10 million foreign exchange headwind compared to our prior outlook. Notwithstanding the FX impact, we continue to see strong sustained client demand across most of our businesses, with trends largely consistent with the first 2 quarters of this year.
The operating margin was 21.4%, a decrease of 130 basis points year-over-year. As anticipated, the decline was primarily driven by the comparison to the strong third quarter of last year, which benefited from COVID cost controls, as well as the impact of the Cognate and Vigene acquisitions on the Manufacturing segment's operating margin. With an operating margin 21% through the first 9 months of the year, we are squarely on track to achieve our goal of approximately 21% for 2021, which represents a 100 basis point increase over the prior year. This also demonstrates our commitment to driving efficiency and achieving our longer-term margin target of 22.5% in 2024.
Earnings per share were $2.40 in the third quarter, an increase of 15.9% from $2.33 in the third quarter of last year. This result was favorable to our prior outlook due in large part to a lower-than-expected tax rate. David will provide some additional details on the tax rate shortly.
With the sustained strength of the demand environment, our revised financial guidance for '21 reflects 3 primary factors: unfavorable movements in foreign exchange, a lower tax rate and the divestitures. Reported revenue growth was lowered by approximately 150 basis points at midpoint to a range of 19.5% to 20.5% to primarily reflect current FX rates as well as the impact of these RMS Japan and CDMO Sweden divestitures. We have narrowed our organic revenue growth outlook to 13.5% to 14.5%, with approximately 275 basis points of this increase generated by the comparison to last year's COVID-19 impact. Normalized organic growth is expected to be squarely in the low double-digit range this year, and that is consistent with our targeted growth rate next year as well.
We also narrowed non-GAAP earnings per share guidance to a range of $10.20 to $10.30, which represents just over 25% year-over-year growth. We are pleased to have maintained our EPS growth within the previous range even after absorbing the impact of the divestitures.
I'd like to provide you with details on the third quarter segment performance, beginning with the DSA segment. DSA revenue in the third quarter was $531.8 million, a 13% increase on an organic basis with strength in Safety Assessment, including lab sciences and bioanalytical services and Discovery Services. Demand for our services and price increases are driving low double-digit organic growth in the DSA segment, which is a trend that we expect to continue into next year.
Biotech clients are leveraging our expertise rather than investing in internal capabilities, and global biopharmaceutical clients are choosing to partner with us because it's more efficient to leverage our flexible infrastructure instead of maintaining or expanding their own. We believe we have become the principal partner of choice for biotech clients of all sizes. Demand for our services is high because the sustained level of biotech funding is enabling clients to meaningfully invest in early-stage research at an accelerated pace and because they don't have the internal capabilities to do the type of work that we perform for them.
To meet our clients' growing needs, we have focused our business on unmatched scientific expertise, rapid turnaround times, flexible, creative solutions and the ability to accommodate the increasing complexity of our clients' research programs.
The Safety Assessment business continued to perform very well in the third quarter, and bookings and proposal volume continued to track at record levels. As we have mentioned throughout the year, clients are choosing to book their safety assessment studies further in advance, which enhances their ability to start working with us as soon as their molecules are ready. These early bookings, which now extend well into 2022, translate into greater visibility and a stronger book of business for us.
The strong demand for our services requires us to closely manage the current workload by adding staff, capacity and other necessary resources while managing the continual shifts in client time lines and study protocols that are associated with booking work further out. Because of our client-focused business approach, we believe we can balance their priorities and our capabilities effectively, making Charles River an even more indispensable research part of the clients, both large and small. We are also making progress on our goals to continually improve our connectivity with clients, including through digital enhancements, as we strive to take an additional year out of our clients' drug development time lines.
The Discovery business had a strong year driven by our comprehensive portfolio of oncology, CNS, early discovery and antibody discovery capabilities. Biotech clients continue to choose to invest in their pipeline instead of infrastructure and utilize our integrated services to move their programs forward. Global biopharmaceutical companies are continuing to increase their reliance on outsourcing strategies for their discovery programs because they prefer to leverage our cutting-edge and industrialized discovery capabilities and flexible solutions to create a more efficient R&D model.
We are pleased to be working with both biotech and global biopharma clients, partnering with them to discover, develop and bring critical therapies to patients who need them. To support the robust demand from these clients, we will continue to strengthen our portfolio by expanding our scale, our science and our innovative technologies through a combination of internal investment, M&A and our strategic partnership strategy. By doing so, we are enabling our clients to remain with one scientific partner, from target identification through IND filing and beyond, and solidifying our position as the leading nonclinical CRO.
The DSA operating margin decreased by 90 basis points to 24.3% in the third quarter but increased sequentially. The year-over-year decline was due to foreign exchange, which reduced the DSA operating margin by approximately 70 basis points; and a Discovery milestone payment, which contributed 50 basis points to last year's DSA operating margin.
RMS revenue was $171.3 million, an increase of 10.7% on an organic basis over the third quarter of 2020, with approximately 200 basis points of the increase attributable to the comparison to last year's COVID-related revenue impact. The RMS performance largely reflects the trends that we have experienced all year; robust demand for research models, particularly in China; broad-based growth across Research Model Services, partially offset by continued headwinds for the cell supply business.
The research models business continued to experience strong double-digit growth in China as well as solid performance in North America, which we believe correlates with the increased level of nonclinical research activity that's being conducted by biopharmaceutical and academic clients. We believe the global focus on scientific innovation is sustainable and will continue to drive client demand.
However, the biopharmaceutical market in Japan has not participated in this trend. As a result, we chose to divest our RMS operations in Japan with an opportunistic sale to the Jackson Laboratory. We have established a licensing agreement under which JAX will produce and distribute our models in Japan.
Research Model Services performed very well. GEMS is benefiting from strong outsourcing demand as our clients seek the greater flexibility and efficiency they gain when we manage their proprietary model colonies. The greater complexity of scientific research and the proprietary models that our clients are creating further reinforce the value proposition for the GEMS business.
Our clients' need for greater flexibility and efficiency is also driving demand for our Insourcing Solutions, or IS, business, particularly our CRADL initiative, which provides both small and large biopharmaceutical clients with turnkey research capacity at Charles River sites. Last month, we announced the expansion of our CRADL footprint in the Boston Cambridge BioHub, and we'll continue to expand in other regions, including our South San Francisco -- in South San Francisco, to provide a flexible capacity solution for our clients globally. Utilizing CRADL also provides clients with collaborative opportunities to seamlessly access other Charles River services which further enhances the speed and efficiency of their research programs.
The cell supply business, which consists of HemaCare and Cellero, continues to be affected by limitations on donor availability as it has not fully recovered from last year's COVID-related restrictions. We have implemented several improvement initiatives, including expansion of donor capacity across multiple sites, productivity initiatives and enhancing the digital engagement with donors. We anticipate that revenue will improve in the coming quarters because the robust demand in the cell therapy market sector remains firmly intact.
The RMS operating margin decreased by 160 basis points year-over-year to 26.1%, primarily due to the cell supply business. Like many of our businesses, cell suppliers leverage the sales volume, so we expect profitability will meaningfully improve once donor availability and the growth rate rebound.
Revenue for the Manufacturing segment was $192.9 million, a 19.1% increase on an organic basis over the third quarter of last year. The increase was primarily driven by continued strong double-digit revenue growth in both the Biologics Testing Solutions and Microbial Solutions businesses as well as approximately 350 basis points attributable to the comparison to last year's COVID-related revenue impact. Microbial Solutions growth rate in the third quarter remained well above 10%, reflecting strong demand across our portfolio of critical quality control testing solutions.
We were pleased with the strength of the underlying demand for our endotoxin testing systems and cartridges, which performed FDA-mandated lot release testing on injectable drugs and medical devices. The advantages of our comprehensive portfolio continue to resonate with our clients, and we believe that our ability to provide a total microbial testing solution will enable Microbial Solutions to deliver at least low double-digit organic revenue growth for this year and beyond.
The Biologics Testing business reported another exceptional quarter of strong double-digit revenue growth. Robust demand for cell and gene therapy testing services continue to be the primary growth drivers, with COVID-19 vaccines and traditional biologics also being meaningful contributors. We believe cell and gene therapies will continue to be significant growth drivers over the longer term to support our 20% growth target for this business.
The strength of the demand for these services necessitates that we continue to build our extensive portfolio of manufacturing services to ensure we have available capacity to accommodate client demand. The third quarter marks the first full quarter that Cognate and Vigene were part of Charles River. As anticipated, when we acquired Cognate, a large COVID-related project was completed in the second quarter, and we are actively adding new projects in its place.
We continue to make great progress on the integrations and believe our cell and gene therapy CDMO business will be highly complementary to our Biologics business and our portfolio as a whole. We also believe that we now have a comprehensive cell and gene therapy portfolio, which spans each of the major CDMO platforms: gene-modified cell therapy, viral vector and plasmid DNA production. Our goal is to enable clients to conduct analytical testing, process development and manufacturing for these advanced drug modalities with the same scientific partner, allowing them to achieve their goal of driving greater efficiency and accelerating their speed to market.
As mentioned earlier, the decision to divest our CDMO site in Sweden was based on several factors. First, its capabilities, including plasmid DNA, were already duplicated at other CDMO sites in the U.K. and U.S. Second, we determined it would be advantageous to invest in and expand capacity at our other CDMO hubs that are more centrally located and proximate to clients. And finally, this was our smallest and least profitable CDMO site. This divestiture does not reflect any changes in client demand or the cell and gene therapy CDMO sector as we firmly believe the growth profile for this business remains at or above 25% over the longer term.
The Manufacturing segment's third quarter operating margin declined by 640 basis points to 32.7%. The primary driver of the decline was the inclusion both Cognate and Vigene for the full quarter. These businesses are profitable, but their margin is below the overall Manufacturing segment. As noted last quarter, we continue to expect the full year Manufacturing margin will be slightly below the mid-30% range, reflecting the addition of the CDMO business. However, beyond 2021, we expect this headwind to gradually dissipate as we drive efficiency and as the significant growth we anticipate generates greater economies of scale and optimizes throughput at our CDMO sites.
We are operating in a robust business environment with excellent growth potential. Biotech funding in 2021 is continuing to track at or above the robust pre-COVID levels. The sustained funding environment both from the capital markets and the biopharmaceutical industry and the biotech industry's cash reserves are enabling an accelerated pace of scientific innovation. Clients, both large and small, view us as their partner of choice, from concept to nonclinical development to the safe manufacture of their life-saving therapeutics.
To continue to successfully execute our strategy to maintain and enhance Charles River's position as the leading nonclinical CRO and accommodate our clients' growth needs, it's essential that we continue to make investments in our scientific capabilities through M&A, technology partnerships and internal development; enhance our digital enterprise to provide real-time access to critical data for both internal and client use; and also to expand our capacity and staff.
Demand for our services in the current market environment has outpaced our expectations, and we have been hiring ahead of our initial plan this year to accommodate this growth. We have hired 4,000 talented people this year to both support growth and offset attrition and plan to hire an additional 1,000 people in the fourth quarter. We believe we attract qualified employees because of our mission, and the critical work that we do to help our clients develop life-saving therapies distinguishes us from other companies. For a business like Charles River, staffing is a consistent challenge on which we have placed a disproportionate focus. We believe we are effectively managing staffing levels, including increased costs, and we will continue to be thoughtful with respect to compensation heading into 2022 as we strive to maintain or reduce turnover and remain competitive in the marketplace. It will be a headwind, but one that will help us to support the robust client demand and achieve our low double-digit organic growth target that we expect in 2022.
By focusing intently on our strategy, we have become a trusted scientific partner for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and government and nongovernment organizations worldwide. We have demonstrated the value we can provide to clients and believe that is why they have trusted us to work on more than 80% of the drugs approved by the FDA over the last 3 years. We believe that our steady focus on our strategy to continue to enhance our portfolio will enable us to continue to achieve our long-term financial targets and deliver greater value to shareholders.
In conclusion, I'd like to thank our clients and shareholders for their support and our employees for their exceptional work and commitment.
I'll now ask David to give you additional details on our third quarter results and updated 2021 guidance"
91093,1685063708,2422844,"Charles River Laboratories International, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2021",2021-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Before I begin, may I remind you that I'll be speaking primarily to non-GAAP results, which exclude amortization and other transaction-related charges, costs related primarily to our global efficiency initiatives, our ven",1273,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Before I begin, may I remind you that I'll be speaking primarily to non-GAAP results, which exclude amortization and other transaction-related charges, costs related primarily to our global efficiency initiatives, our venture capital and other strategic investment performance and certain other items. Many of my comments will also refer to organic revenue growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency translation.
We are pleased with our strong results for the third quarter, which included 13.6% organic revenue growth and a 15.9% increase in earnings per share. Operating margin for the third quarter was 21.4%. While lower than the prior year as anticipated, it represented a 60 basis point sequential increase and was in line with our full year target of approximately 21%.
In addition to the COVID cost controls last year and the CDMO acquisition this year, as Jim mentioned, the third quarter operating margin was also lower than last year's robust 22.7% level because of our foreign exchange headwind and last year's discovery milestone payment. Although cost inflation and supply chain pressures have made headlines recently, we believe we are effectively managing the tighter labor market in our supply chain, and higher costs in these areas have been reflected in our updated guidance.
Lower unallocated corporate costs contributed to the third quarter operating margin, coming in at 5% of revenue or $45 million compared to 5.5% of revenue last year. Corporate costs are nonlinear, fluctuating from quarter-to-quarter due to several factors, including health and fringe-related costs and performance-based compensation. Despite the third quarter favorability, we continue to expect unallocated corporate costs in the mid-5% range as a percentage of revenue for the full year.
The third quarter non-GAAP tax rate was 17%, representing a 490 basis point decrease from 21.9% in the third quarter of last year. The lower tax rate was due primarily to 2 factors: discrete tax benefits associated with R&D tax credits and a favorable excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation associated with the higher stock price. These benefits will also result in a reduction of our full year non-GAAP tax rate to a range of 18% to 19% from our prior outlook of 19.5% to 20.5%.
Total adjusted net interest expense in the third quarter was $20.7 million, an increase of $2 million year-over-year, reflecting higher debt balances to fund the Cognate and Vigene acquisitions, but was essentially flat sequentially. At the end of the third quarter, we had an outstanding debt balance of $2.9 billion, representing a gross leverage ratio of 2.7x and a net leverage ratio of 2.6x. For the full year, we now expect total adjusted net interest expense to be slightly lower than our prior outlook in the range of $80 million to $82 million, reflecting debt repayment and continued low variable interest rates.
Free cash flow was $119.2 million in the third quarter, representing a decrease of 21% over $151.1 million for the same period last year. The lower free cash flow was primarily due to higher capital expenditures, which increased by nearly $30 million to $55.5 million. There were 2 reasons for the increase in capital expenditures: we continued to invest in capacity additions and other growth projects to meet client demand, and last year's level was still constrained by COVID-related project rate. For the year, our free cash flow and CapEx guidance remains unchanged at approximately $500 million and $220 million, respectively. CapEx is expected to total over 6% of total revenue in 2021. With a robust demand environment exceeding our expectations this year and expected to continue across our portfolio, we now believe CapEx will be about 9% of total revenue next year as we continue to add capacity to support our growth, particularly in our legacy businesses, including Safety Assessment.
With respect to 2021 guidance, we are updating our full year revenue growth outlook to a range of 19.5% to 20.5% on a reported basis, reflecting the impact of the divestitures and foreign exchange, and organic revenue growth to 13.5% to 14.5%. Foreign exchange is now expected to be less of a benefit than previously anticipated due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the last 3 months, particularly when compared to the British pound and euro. We now expect 150 to 200 basis point benefit from FX for the year compared to our prior outlook of approximately 250 basis points. As Jim mentioned, the strength of the dollar resulted in a headwind that reduced third quarter reported revenue by approximately $10 million compared to our prior outlook.
We have narrowed our earnings per share guidance to a range of $10.20 to $10.30, primarily due to the lower tax rate outlook, partially offset by the divestiture. Please keep in mind that the divestitures are expected to reduce revenue by nearly $20 million and non-GAAP earnings per share by less than $0.10 in the fourth quarter, which is reflected in the full year 2021 financial guidance.
By segment, our updated outlook for 2021 continues to reflect a sustained and healthy business environment. With our organic revenue growth outlook narrowed within our previous range, we have maintained our segment growth expectations, including organic revenue growth in the high teens for the RMS segment, low double digits for the DSA segment and high teens for the Manufacturing segment. On a reported basis, we have moderated the segment outlook to reflect updated FX rates and the divestitures. We now expect revenue growth for the RMS segment in the high teens range, Manufacturing in the low-40% range and DSA unchanged in the mid-teens.
With regard to operating margin, our segment outlook remains effectively unchanged from our prior outlook. A detailed summary of our updated financial guidance for the full year can be found on Slide 39.
With 1 quarter remaining in the year, our fourth quarter outlook is effectively embedded in our guidance for the full year. The RMS demand divestiture will affect the year-over-year comparison in the fourth quarter. On a year-over-year basis, we expect organic revenue growth will be in the high single digits and reported revenue growth in the low double-digit range. When normalized for the COVID impact, we expect our organic revenue growth for the full year will be squarely in the low double-digit range, which is also consistent with the growth that we see next year.
Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be flat to a low single-digit increase in the fourth quarter when compared to last year's level of $2.39. The fourth quarter tax rate is expected to return to the low-20% range, which along with the divestitures will meaningfully constrain the earnings per share growth rate.
I would like to provide one modeling comment with regard to next year. We will add a 53rd week at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, which is periodically required to true up our fiscal year towards December 31 calendar year-end. The 53rd week has historically been characterized a partial week of revenue since it occurs during a holiday but a full week of costs.
To conclude and before we turn the page to next year, we intend to finish the fourth quarter on a strong note and achieve our updated financial guidance for this year. Our expected 2021 performance demonstrates the progress that we are making as well as the investments that are necessary to achieve the 2024 financial targets that we provided at our Investor Day in May, which include low double-digit organic revenue growth and operating margin of approximately 22.5% and non-GAAP earnings per share growth at a faster rate than revenue. Thank you."

And we're enjoying really extraordinary demand pretty much across the whole portfolio. And we anticipate, given the spending paradigm, given the strength of new scientific modalities, given cell and gene therapy, given the nature of our portfolio, that the demand will continue through next year at least, so giving sort of early indications of that.
What we're experiencing this year is it's quite interesting and unique. We had pretty thoughtful and positive plan for this year. We are well in excess of our operating plan as evidenced by a couple of guidance raises and just the changes in the top line guidance. And so we have been working really hard to plan for additional capacity and hire enough people to do the work. And I think we're doing well.
But as we look at next year and beyond, we do think that the capacity needs will continue to be significant, and it's not something you can do sort of at the 11th hour. And the scale and size of the business is just getting to the point where not only did we think it was appropriate, but sort of our early roll-up is showing that CapEx on a percentage basis will be meaningfully higher than we -- last time we had spoken to you folks.
I would say it's the nature of the portfolio as a whole, probably more legacy portions of the portfolio and more probably Safety Assessment than anything else. So sort of a Safety Assessment goes, so does the company these days. So we have terrific growth rates in the Safety Assessment business. We were by far the market leader. A lot of clients depending on us. You have all these new biotech companies created and minted and have no internal capability to do the work. So we thought that both at 9% and the double digit would be a good early glimpse than what we anticipate for next year."

And while we're not going to talk about the 2022 full sort of guidance, there are a number of things that we have kind of called out, but there's a lot of material this morning to go through.
So Jim talked about the strong demand environment, so I won't repeat about that. But that low double-digit organic growth does help fuel some of the headwinds that we're seeing. And by the way, you're aware of microbial access headwinds that we've had this year, which is behind us. Cell supply, we would hope that would be fully behind us when we get into 2022 as well. So that's another tailwind.
And of course, that buoyant double-digit growth helps with our margin expansion goals. You know that we're trying to get to 150 basis points over the next 3 years. That won't be linear. For instance, the investments that we're making in digital, we won't see the returns really kick in until the outer-years. And next year, we have this modest headwind from the 53rd week, which I called out in my remarks.
And then there are other known headwinds that we've got. We'll continue to invest in people, capacity, digital. You're all familiar with the global pressures that we're seeing on hiring and inflation impacting many sectors and regions. So I won't belabor that point, but we'll have our share of that.
However, we are fortunate to be in the industry that we're in. We're not as buffeted by those issues of some, but neither are we immune. So that said, we believe we're effectively managing those time to labor markets and through supply chains, but it will take effort and it will take investment.
And then there are things which we can't call out today, simple ones like FX. That's one of the last pieces we put in the jigsaw piece. We've got that unique item around potential for U.S. tax reform should it be enacted. But I am hearing that there's a good chance that will be punted into 2023.
And then we've got the open questions around inflation. Is it short term as some people would have us believe? Or is it more sustained? And I think that's too early to call.
And finally, great recognition as it's being called. It has to come into an end, but at what point. So we're working on finalizing the plan. In February, we'll put those pieces together and share that with you. But as I said, strong demand that we're seeing, that should help us progress towards these long-term targets, and we should have appropriate numbers for you in '22."

Derik, we put together relatively swiftly through M&A, several cell and therapy assets for the cell product businesses and the CDMO assets. And of course, they show up in 2 different segments. They're working really hard to integrate and connect to those businesses. I think we're doing really well at that. We're also working really hard to connect those businesses, particularly the CDMO piece to our Biologics business because being able to manufacture the drug and test it are really important capability that distinguishes us from most of our competitors.
We -- the cell supply business, as we called out, is -- its growth rate is being hampered right now by sort of COVID-related donor restrictions for donors, but that should ameliorate over time. And growth rate there should be 25% or 30% on an ongoing basis.
And we haven't said that much about the margins. The margin should be -- should not be dilutive to RMS, let's put it that way. On the CDMO piece, we've been really clear that the Manufacturing segment has had mid- to high-30% operating margin, a lot of businesses that would be accretive to that. So it's a bit of a headwind, although that will improve meaningfully and systematically over time as we increase volume as, hopefully, a few clients go from clinical stage to commercial, as we have more digital capability. So it should be less of a drag.
It's tough to say what CDMO will look like from a margin profile out a few years, particularly if we're doing multiple commercial runs for clients. So you'd obviously have just greater efficiency and throughput and consistency of supply, and I think that could invigorate the margin.
So pleased with the growth rates, directionally pleased with the margin rates. We think we put together a nice portfolio sort of on its own and are connecting it thoughtfully and carefully with our legacy businesses, particularly biologics."

So I think that we will have meaningful investments, particularly in AI and machine learning. I do think they can be beneficial to the whole portfolio, maybe particularly cell and gene therapy.
Look, the whole -- per your question, the whole discovery platform is obviously much heavier science, much more cutting-edge science. And I'd say the majority of our strategic deals are discovery-related. So I guess from that vantage point, yes, we're very much focused on it.

This year, the demand has increased more than we expected, which is great. It's setting us up nicely for the future. And we've made meaningful investments this year. So we can continue to make meaningful investments in the business with that revenue pull-through. And that's one of the benefits of having high revenue and double-digit growth. But we do need to invest some of that additional property, if you like, into the business, not just for the short term in terms of head count but also into the medium term in terms of digital. So we will continue to do that. And I don't see next year different in that respect, except we might not see -- we're not going to see a 100 basis point margin improvement in 2022 that we've seen in the last 2 years, right, and particularly this year, where we've got a 100 basis point improvement despite the investments that we have made in the business.
So that's helpful. That's a helpful headwind, if you like, that helps cover some of these tailwinds. In terms of tax, we are -- well, it depends where we end up with Biden. We did call out on our investor call back in May that while we're low 20 traditionally at the moment. Okay, this year, we've had a few discrete items that cases down. But without those discrete items, we would have expected for 2022 to be low 20.
With Biden, that would have moved us up to -- we expect it to move up to the mid-20s. And as I said a few moments ago, I'm hearing that, subject to a vote to the house, we should see the Biden reforms pushed out, '22 into '23. So ergo, if that happened, tax rate would be back to where we've traditionally been at the low 20.
Actually, while I have to let the call again, people are talking about puts and takes. In terms of the divestitures that we called out, we've called out what that impact is for this year. But I'll share with you that broadly, we would expect that to be a $0.20 to $0.25 headwind for 2022 as well."

I would say it's significantly deemphasized as an important issue.
So if you think of the client base, with hundreds of new biotech companies being created every year with literally no internal capacity and big pharma continuing to rapidly reduce their internal capacity, our role is just becoming -- has become increasingly more significant. That's what we're trying to say about this year. I mean this is a high-class problem, right, high-class challenge that we are working really hard to have enough people and to build enough space to accommodate the demand, which is right now significantly ahead of where we thought our business plan would be.
So as we put the final touches on next year's operating plan, we just have to be very thoughtful and make sure that we have capacity and then some. And of course, by the way, anything we build even now is probably not available until '23 anyway. So we have to get ahead of that.
So it's a very -- it's the most attractive supply-demand paradigm that we've ever seen across most of our businesses, but particularly nuanced and safety, just given our scale and scientific depth. And so it's incumbent upon us, if this marketplace is going to depend on us, to make the necessary investments and capacity and people to accommodate them."

We certainly don't think this growth rate is going to slow given biotech funding, given all the new modalities, given our competitive prowess, given the fact that we'll probably do additional M&A to make our portfolio stronger. So given the scale of our business and the demand on our business, I think we would anticipate that that's the new normal, that we'll have CapEx as a percentage of sales around that level going forward. And there's no logical demand reason that, that should slow. But from where we are now, that looks like the right rate to accommodate client demand."

Our strong third quarter results demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy and the progress we've made on its execution as well as the sustained strength of the industry fundamentals. As anticipated, third quarter revenue increased at a",2922,"Good morning. Our strong third quarter results demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy and the progress we've made on its execution as well as the sustained strength of the industry fundamentals. As anticipated, third quarter revenue increased at a low teens rate organically, and we reported mid-teens earnings per share growth. 
We believe that Charles River is a stronger company today than it has ever been. We have seen unprecedented demand across most of our businesses and we believe that this, coupled with the strength of our leading nonclinical portfolio, will enable us to achieve our low double-digit organic revenue growth target over the longer term as well as in 2022. 
As a result, we are continuing to invest to add people and capacity to accommodate growing client demand and to build a scalable operating model; to enhance our scientifically distinguished portfolio; to strengthen our relationship with clients and to work with them to devise outsourcing solutions, which enable them to increase productivity and speed to market. 
We have maintained our focus on nonclinical drug research and manufacturing solutions, strategically expanding our portfolio to provide clients with the critical capabilities they require to discover, develop and safely manufacture new drugs. 
Last month, we divested our RMS operations in Japan and our CDMO site in Sweden for a total of approximately $115 million plus potential contingent payments of up to an additional $25 million. We routinely evaluate the strategic fit and fundamental performance of our global infrastructure for acquisitions and legacy sites alike and have sold or closed operations that didn't meet our key business criteria or may have been underperforming financially. The decision to divest these 2 operations was consistent with our evaluation process, and we intend to redeploy the capital in other growth areas of our business. 
Moving to the third quarter. Highlights of our financial performance are as follows. We reported revenue of $895.9 million in the third quarter of '21, a 20.5% increase over last year. Organic revenue growth was 13.6% with each of our business segments contributing a strong performance. Last year's COVID impact resulted in a modest 170 basis point increase to organic revenue growth. 
From a client perspective, biotechs continued to drive revenue growth with global biopharmaceutical clients also making solid contributions to the quarter. 
Third quarter reported revenue growth was affected by a $10 million foreign exchange headwind compared to our prior outlook. Notwithstanding the FX impact, we continue to see strong sustained client demand across most of our businesses with trends largely consistent with the first 2 quarters of this year. 
The operating margin was 21.4%, a decrease of 130 basis points year-over-year. As anticipated, the decline was primarily driven by the comparison to the strong third quarter of last year, which benefited from COVID cost controls, as well as the impact of the Cognate and Vigene acquisitions on the Manufacturing segment's operating margin. 
With an operating margin of 21% through the first 9 months of the year, we are squarely on track to achieve our goal of approximately 21% for 2021, which represents a 100 basis point increase over the prior year. This also demonstrates our commitment to driving efficiency and achieving our longer-term margin target of 22.5% in 2024. 
Earnings per share were $2.40 (sic) [ $2.70 ] in the third quarter, an increase of 15.9% from $2.33 in the third quarter of last year. This result was favorable to our prior outlook due in large part to a lower-than-expected tax rate. David will provide some additional details on the tax rate shortly. 
With the sustained strength of the demand environment, our revised financial guidance for '21 reflects 3 primary factors: unfavorable movements in foreign exchange, a lower tax rate and the divestitures. Reported revenue growth was lowered by approximately 150 basis points at midpoint to a range of 19.5% to 20.5% to primarily reflect current FX rates as well as the impact of these RMS Japan and CDMO Sweden divestitures. 
We have narrowed our organic revenue growth outlook to 13.5% to 14.5% with approximately 275 basis points of this increase generated by the comparison to last year's COVID-19 impact. Normalized organic growth is expected to be squarely in the low double-digit range this year, and that is consistent with our targeted growth rate next year as well. 
We also narrowed non-GAAP earnings per share guidance to a range of $10.20 to $10.30, which represents just over 25% year-over-year growth. We are pleased to have maintained our EPS growth within the previous range even after absorbing the impact of the divestitures. 
I'd like to provide you with details on the third quarter segment performance, beginning with the DSA segment. DSA revenue in the third quarter was $531.8 million, a 13% increase on an organic basis with strength in Safety Assessment, including lab sciences and bioanalytical services and Discovery Services. 
Demand for our services and price increases are driving low double-digit organic growth in the DSA segment, which is a trend that we expect to continue into next year. Biotech clients are leveraging our expertise rather than investing in internal capabilities. And global biopharmaceutical clients are choosing to partner with us because it's more efficient to leverage our flexible infrastructure instead of maintaining or expanding their own. 
We believe we have become the principal partner of choice for biotech clients of all sizes. Demand for our services is high because the sustained level of biotech funding is enabling clients to meaningfully invest in early-stage research at an accelerated pace and because they don't have the internal capabilities to do the type of work that we perform for them. 
To meet our clients' growing needs, we have focused our business on unmatched scientific expertise; rapid turnaround times; flexible, creative solutions; and the ability to accommodate the increasing complexity of our clients' research programs. 
The Safety Assessment business continued to perform very well in the third quarter, and bookings and proposal volume continued to track at record levels. As we have mentioned throughout the year, clients are choosing to book their safety assessment studies further in advance, which enhances their ability to start working with us as soon as their molecules are ready. These early bookings, which now extend well into 2022, translate into greater visibility and a stronger book of business for us. 
The strong demand for our services requires us to closely manage the current workload by adding staff, capacity and other necessary resources while managing the continual shifts in client time lines and study protocols that are associated with booking work further out. Because of our client-focused business approach, we believe we can balance their priorities and our capabilities effectively, making Charles River an even more indispensable research partner to clients, both large and small. 
We are also making progress on our goals to continually improve our connectivity with clients, including through digital enhancements, as we strive to take an additional year out of our clients' drug development time lines. 
The Discovery business had a strong year driven by our comprehensive portfolio of oncology, CNS, early discovery and antibody discovery capabilities. Biotech clients continue to choose to invest in their pipelines instead of infrastructure and utilize our integrated services to move their programs forward. Global biopharmaceutical companies are continuing to increase their reliance on outsourcing strategies for their discovery programs because they prefer to leverage our cutting-edge and industrialized discovery capabilities and flexible solutions to create a more efficient R&D model. 
We are pleased to be working with both biotech and global biopharma clients, partnering with them to discover, develop and bring critical therapies to patients who need them. 
To support the robust demand from these clients, we will continue to strengthen our portfolio by expanding our scale, our science and our innovative technologies through a combination of internal investment, M&A and our strategic partnership strategy. By doing so, we are enabling our clients to remain with one scientific partner from target identification through IND filing and beyond and solidifying our position as the leading nonclinical CRO. 
The DSA operating margin decreased by 90 basis points to 24.3% in the third quarter, but increased sequentially. The year-over-year decline was due to foreign exchange, which reduced the DSA operating margin by approximately 70 basis points; and a Discovery milestone payment, which contributed 50 basis points to last year's DSA operating margin. 
RMS revenue was $171.3 million, an increase of 10.7% on an organic basis over the third quarter of 2020 with approximately 200 basis points of the increase attributable to the comparison to last year's COVID-related revenue impact. 
The RMS performance largely reflects the trends that we have experienced all year: robust demand for research models, particularly in China; broad-based growth across Research Model Services, partially offset by continued headwinds for the cell supply business. 
The Research Model business continued to experience strong double-digit growth in China as well as solid performance in North America, which we believe correlates with the increased level of nonclinical research activity that's being conducted by biopharmaceutical and academic clients. We believe the global focus on scientific innovation is sustainable and will continue to drive client demand. 
However, the biopharmaceutical market in Japan has not participated in this trend. As a result, we chose to divest our RMS operations in Japan with an opportunistic sale to The Jackson Laboratory. We have established a licensing agreement under which JAX will produce and distribute our models in Japan. 
Research Model Services performed very well. GEMS is benefiting from strong outsourcing demand as our clients seek the greater flexibility and efficiency they gain when we manage their proprietary model -- colonies. The greater complexity of scientific research and the proprietary models that our clients are creating further reinforce the value proposition for the GEMS business. 
Our clients' need for greater flexibility and efficiency is also driving demand for our Insourcing Solutions or IS business, particularly our CRADL initiative, which provides both small and large biopharmaceutical clients with turnkey research capacity at Charles River sites. 
Last month, we announced the expansion of our CRADL footprint in the Boston/Cambridge biohub and we'll continue to expand in other regions, including our South San Francisco -- in South San Francisco to provide a flexible capacity solution for our clients globally. Utilizing CRADL also provides clients with collaborative opportunities to seamlessly access other Charles River services, which further enhances the speed and efficiency of their research programs. 
The cell supply business, which consists of HemaCare and Cellero, continues to be affected by limitations on donor availability as it has not fully recovered from last year's COVID-related restrictions. We have implemented several improvement initiatives, including expansion of donor capacity across multiple sites, productivity initiatives and enhancing the digital engagement with donors. We anticipate that revenue will improve in the coming quarters because the robust demand in the cell therapy market sector remains firmly intact. 
The RMS operating margin decreased by 160 basis points year-over-year to 26.1%, primarily due to the cell supply business. Like many of our businesses, cell suppliers leveraged to sales volume, so we expect profitability will meaningfully improve once donor availability and the growth rate rebound. 
Revenue for the Manufacturing segment was $192.9 million, a 19.1% increase on an organic basis over the third quarter of last year. The increase was primarily driven by continued strong double-digit revenue growth in both the Biologics Testing Solutions and Microbial Solutions businesses as well as approximately 350 basis points attributable to the comparison to last year's COVID-related revenue impact. Microbial Solutions growth rate in the third quarter remained well above 10%, reflecting strong demand across our portfolio of critical quality control testing solutions. 
We were pleased with the strength of the underlying demand for our endotoxin testing systems and cartridges, which perform FDA-mandated lot release testing on injectable drugs and medical devices. The advantages of our comprehensive portfolio continue to resonate with our clients, and we believe that our ability to provide a total microbial testing solution will enable Microbial Solutions to deliver at least low double-digit organic revenue growth for this year and beyond. 
The Biologics Testing business reported another exceptional quarter of strong double-digit revenue growth. Robust demand for cell and gene therapy testing services continued to be the primary growth drivers, with COVID-19 vaccines and traditional biologics also being meaningful contributors. We believe cell and gene therapies will continue to be significant growth drivers over the longer term to support our 20% growth target for this business. The strength of the demand for these services necessitates that we continue to build our extensive portfolio of manufacturing services to ensure we have available capacity to accommodate client demand. 
The third quarter marks the first full quarter that Cognate and Vigene were part of Charles River. As anticipated, when we acquired Cognate, a large COVID-related project was completed in the second quarter and we are actively adding new projects in its place. 
We continue to make great progress on the integrations and believe our cell and gene therapy CDMO business will be highly complementary to our Biologics business and our portfolio as a whole. We also believe that we now have a comprehensive cell and gene therapy portfolio, which spans each of the major CDMO platforms: gene-modified cell therapy, viral vector and plasmid DNA production. Our goal is to enable clients to conduct analytical testing, process development and manufacturing for these advanced drug modalities with the same scientific partner, allowing them to achieve their goal of driving greater efficiency and accelerating their speed to market. 
As mentioned earlier, the decision to divest our CDMO site in Sweden was based on several factors. First, its capabilities, including plasmid DNA, were already duplicated at other CDMO sites in the U.K. and U.S. Second, we determined it would be advantageous to invest in and expand capacity at our other CDMO hubs that are more centrally located and proximate to clients. And finally, this was our smallest and least profitable CDMO site. 
This divestiture does not reflect any changes in client demand or the cell and gene therapy CDMO sector as we firmly believe the growth profile for this business remains at or above 25% over the longer term. 
The Manufacturing segment's third quarter operating margin declined by 640 basis points to 32.7%. The primary driver of the decline was the inclusion of both Cognate and Vigene for the full quarter. These businesses are profitable, but their margin is below the overall Manufacturing segment. 
As noted last quarter, we continue to expect the full year Manufacturing margin will be slightly below the mid-30% range, reflecting the addition of the CDMO business. However, beyond 2021, we expect this headwind to gradually dissipate as we drive efficiency and as the significant growth we anticipate generates greater economies of scale and optimizes throughput at our CDMO sites. 
We are operating in a robust business environment with excellent growth potential. Biotech funding in 2021 is continuing to track at or above the robust pre-COVID levels. The sustained funding environment both from the capital markets and the biopharmaceutical industry and the biotech industry's cash reserves are enabling an accelerated pace of scientific innovation. Clients, both large and small, view us as their partner of choice from concept to nonclinical development, to the safe manufacture of their life-saving therapeutics. 
To continue to successfully execute our strategy to maintain and enhance Charles River's position as the leading nonclinical CRO and accommodate our clients' growth needs, it's essential that we continue to make investments in our scientific capabilities through M&A, technology partnerships and internal development; enhance our digital enterprise to provide real-time access to critical data for both internal and client use; and also to expand our capacity and staff. 
Demand for our services in the current market environment has outpaced our expectations, and we have been hiring ahead of our initial plan this year to accommodate this growth. We have hired 4,000 talented people this year to both support growth and offset attrition and plan to hire an additional 1,000 people in the fourth quarter. We believe we attract qualified employees because of our mission and the critical work that we do to help our clients develop life-saving therapies distinguishes us from other companies. 
For a business like Charles River, staffing is a consistent challenge on which we have placed a disproportionate focus. We believe we are effectively managing staffing levels, including increased costs, and we will continue to be thoughtful with respect to compensation heading into 2022 as we strive to maintain or reduce turnover and remain competitive in the marketplace. It will be a headwind, but one that will help us to support the robust client demand and achieve our low double-digit organic growth target that we expect in 2022. 
By focusing intently on our strategy, we have become a trusted scientific partner for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and government and nongovernment organizations worldwide. We have demonstrated the value we can provide to clients and believe that is why they have trusted us to work on more than 80% of the drugs approved by the FDA over the last 3 years. We believe that our steady focus on our strategy to continue to enhance our portfolio will enable us to continue to achieve our long-term financial targets and deliver greater value to shareholders. 
In conclusion, I'd like to thank our clients and shareholders for their support and our employees for their exceptional work and commitment. 
I'll now ask David to give you additional details on our third quarter results and updated 2021 guidance."
91093,1685063708,2423090,"Charles River Laboratories International, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2021",2021-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Before I begin, may I remind you that I'll be speaking primarily to non-GAAP results, which exclude amortization and other transaction-related charges, costs related primarily to our global efficiency initiatives, our ven",1279,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Before I begin, may I remind you that I'll be speaking primarily to non-GAAP results, which exclude amortization and other transaction-related charges, costs related primarily to our global efficiency initiatives, our venture capital and other strategic investment performance and certain other items. Many of my comments will also refer to organic revenue growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency translation. 
We are pleased with our strong results for the third quarter, which included 13.6% organic revenue growth and a 15.9% increase in earnings per share. Operating margin for the third quarter was 21.4%. While lower than the prior year as anticipated, it represented a 60 basis point sequential increase and was in line with our full year target of approximately 21%. 
In addition to the COVID cost controls last year and the CDMO acquisition this year that Jim mentioned, the third quarter operating margin was also lower than last year's robust 22.7% level because of our foreign exchange headwind and last year's Discovery milestone payment. Although cost inflation and supply chain pressures have made headlines recently, we believe we are effectively managing the tighter labor market and our supply chain, and higher costs in these areas have been reflected in our updated guidance. 
Lower unallocated corporate costs contributed to the third quarter operating margin, coming in at 5% of revenue or $45 million compared to 5.5% of revenue last year. Corporate costs are nonlinear, fluctuating from quarter to quarter due to several factors, including health and fringe-related costs and performance-based compensation. 
Despite the third quarter favorability, we continue to expect unallocated corporate costs in the mid-5% range as a percentage of revenue for the full year. 
The third quarter non-GAAP tax rate was 17%, representing a 490 basis point decrease from 21.9% in the third quarter of last year. The lower tax rate was due primarily to 2 factors: discrete tax benefits associated with R&D tax credits and a favorable excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation associated with the higher stock price. 
These benefits will also result in a reduction of our full year non-GAAP tax rate to a range of 18% to 19% from our prior outlook of 19.5% to 20.5%. 
Total adjusted net interest expense in the third quarter was $20.7 million, an increase of $2 million year-over-year, reflecting higher debt balances to fund the Cognate and Vigene acquisitions, but was essentially flat sequentially. 
At the end of the third quarter, we had an outstanding debt balance of $2.9 billion, representing a gross leverage ratio of 2.7x and a net leverage ratio of 2.6x. 
For the full year, we now expect total adjusted net interest expense to be slightly lower than our prior outlook in the range of $80 million to $82 million, reflecting debt repayment and continued low variable interest rates. 
Free cash flow was $119.2 million in the third quarter, representing a decrease of 21% over $151.1 million for the same period last year. The lower free cash flow was primarily due to higher capital expenditures, which increased by nearly $30 million to $55.5 million. There were 2 reasons for the increase in capital expenditures: we continued to invest in capacity additions and other growth projects to meet client demand, and last year's level was still constrained by COVID-related project rate. 
For the year, our free cash flow and CapEx guidance remains unchanged at approximately $500 million and $220 million, respectively. CapEx is expected to total over 6% of total revenue in 2021. With a robust demand environment exceeding our expectations this year and expected to continue across our portfolio, we now believe CapEx will be about 9% of total revenue next year as we continue to add capacity to support our growth, particularly in our legacy businesses, including Safety Assessment. 
With respect to 2021 guidance, we are updating our full year revenue growth outlook to a range of 19.5% to 20.5% on a reported basis, reflecting the impact of the divestitures and foreign exchange, and organic revenue growth to 13.5% to 14.5%. 
Foreign exchange is now expected to be less of a benefit than previously anticipated due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the last 3 months, particularly when compared to the British pound and euro. We now expect 150 to 200 basis point benefit from FX for the year compared to our prior outlook of approximately 250 basis points. As Jim mentioned, the strength of the dollar resulted in a headwind that reduced third quarter reported revenue by approximately $10 million compared to our prior outlook. 
We have narrowed our earnings per share guidance to a range of $10.20 to $10.30, primarily due to the lower tax rate outlook, partially offset by the divestiture. Please keep in mind that the divestitures are expected to reduce revenue by nearly $20 million and non-GAAP earnings per share by less than $0.10 in the fourth quarter, which is reflected in the full year 2021 financial guidance. 
By segment, our updated outlook for 2021 continues to reflect a sustained and healthy business environment. With our organic revenue growth outlook narrowed within our previous range, we have maintained our segment growth expectations, including organic revenue growth in the high teens for the RMS segment, low double digits for the DSA segment and high teens for the Manufacturing segment. 
On a reported basis, we have moderated the segment outlook to reflect updated FX rates and the divestitures. We now expect revenue growth for the RMS segment in the high teens range, Manufacturing in the low 40% range and DSA unchanged in the mid-teens. 
With regard to operating margin, our segment outlook remains effectively unchanged from our prior outlook. A detailed summary of our updated financial guidance for the full year can be found on Slide 39. 
With 1 quarter remaining in the year, our fourth quarter outlook is effectively embedded in our guidance for the full year. The RMS Japan divestiture will affect the year-over-year comparison in the fourth quarter. On a year-over-year basis, we expect organic revenue growth will be in the high single digits and reported revenue growth in the low double-digit range. When normalized for the COVID impact, we expect our organic revenue growth for the full year will be squarely in the low double-digit range, which is also consistent with the growth that we shall see next year. 
Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be flat to a low single-digit increase in the fourth quarter when compared to last year's level of $2.39. 
The fourth quarter tax rate is expected to return to the low 20% range, which, along with the divestitures, will meaningfully constrain the earnings per share growth rate. 
I would like to provide one modeling comment with regard to next year. We will add a 53rd week at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, which is periodically required to true up our fiscal year to a December 31 calendar year-end. The 53rd week has historically been characterized a partial week of revenue since it occurs during a holiday, but a full week of costs. 
To conclude and before we turn the page to next year, we intend to finish the fourth quarter on a strong note and achieve our updated financial guidance for this year. Our expected 2021 performance demonstrates the progress that we are making as well as the investments that are necessary to achieve the 2024 financial targets that we provided at our Investor Day in May, which include low double-digit organic revenue growth and operating margin of approximately 22.5% and non-GAAP earnings per share growth at a faster rate than revenue. Thank you."

And we anticipate, given the spending paradigm, given the strength of new scientific modalities, given cell and gene therapy, given the nature of our portfolio that the demand will continue through next year at least, so giving sort of early indications of that. 
What we're experiencing this year is it's quite interesting and unique. We had pretty thoughtful and positive plan for this year. We are well in excess of our operating plan as evidenced by a couple of guidance raises and just the changes in the top line guidance. And so we have been working really hard to plan for additional capacity and hire enough people to do the work. And I think we're doing well. 
But as we look at next year and beyond, we do think that the capacity needs will continue to be significant and it's not something you can do sort of at the eleventh hour. And the scale and size of the business is just getting to the point where not only did we think it was appropriate, but sort of our early roll-up is showing that CapEx on a percentage basis will be meaningfully higher than we -- last time we had spoken to you folks. 
I would say it's the nature of the portfolio as a whole, probably more legacy portions of the portfolio and more probably Safety Assessment than anything else. So sort of as Safety Assessment goes, so does the company these days. 
So we have terrific growth rates in the Safety Assessment business. We're by far the market leader. A lot of clients depending on us. You have all these new biotech companies created and minted and have no internal capability to do the work. So we thought that both at 9% and the double digit would be a good early glimpse than what we anticipate for next year."

And while we're not going to talk about the 2022 full sort of guidance, there are a number of things that we have kind of called out, but there's a lot of material this morning to go through. 
So Jim talked about the strong demand environment, so I won't repeat about that. But that low double-digit organic growth does help fuel some of the headwinds that we're seeing. And by the way, you're aware of microbial access headwinds that we've had this year, which is behind us. Cell supply, we would hope that'd be fully behind us when we get into 2022 as well. So that's another tailwind. 
And of course, that buoyant double-digit growth helps with our margin expansion goals. You know that we're trying to get to 150 basis points over the next 3 years. That won't be linear. For instance, the investments that we're making in digital, we won't see the returns really kick in until the outer years. And next year, we have this modest headwind from the 53rd week, which I called out in my remarks. 
And then there are other known headwinds that we've got. We'll continue to invest in people, capacity, digital. You're all familiar with the global pressures that we're seeing on hiring and inflation impacting many sectors and regions, so I won't belabor that point, but we'll have our share of that. 
However, we are fortunate to be in the industry that we're in. We're not as buffeted by those issues as some, but neither are we immune. So that said, we believe we're effectively managing those tighter labor markets and through supply chains, but it will take effort and it will take investment. 
And then there are things, which we can't call out today, simple ones like FX. That's one of the last pieces we put in the jigsaw piece. We've got that unique item around potential for U.S. tax reform should it be enacted. But I am hearing that there's a good chance that, that will be punted into 2023. 
And then we've got the open questions around inflation. Is it short term as some people would have us believe or is it more sustained? And I think that's too early to call. 
And finally, Great Resignation as it's being called. It has to come into an end, but at what point. So we're working on finalizing the plan. In February, we'll put those pieces together and share that with you. But as I said, strong demand that we're seeing, that should help us progress towards these long-term targets and we should have appropriate numbers for you in '22."

Derik, we put together relatively swiftly through M&A several cell and gene therapy assets with the cell product businesses and the CDMO assets. And of course, they show up in 2 different segments.

Derik, we put together relatively swiftly through M&A several cell and gene therapy assets with the cell product businesses and the CDMO assets. And of course, they show up in 2 different segments. They're working really hard to integrate and connect to those businesses. I think we're doing really well at that. 
We're also working really hard to connect those businesses, particularly the CDMO piece, to our Biologics business because being able to manufacture the drug and test it are really important capability that distinguishes us from most of our competitors. 
We -- the cell supply business, as we call those, its growth rate is being hampered right now by sort of COVID-related donor -- restrictions for donors, but that should ameliorate over time. And growth rate there should be 25% or 30% on an ongoing basis. 
And we haven't said that much about the margins. The margin should be -- should not be dilutive to RMS, let's put it that way. On the CDMO piece, we've been really clear that the Manufacturing segment has had mid- to high 30% operating margin, a lot of businesses that would be accretive to that. 
So it's a bit of a headwind, although that will improve meaningfully and systematically over time as we increase volume as, hopefully, a few clients go from clinical stage to commercial, as we have more digital capability. So it should be less of a drag. 
It's tough to say what CDMO will look like from a margin profile out a few years, particularly if we're doing multiple commercial runs for clients. So you'd obviously have just greater efficiency and throughput and consistency of supply, and I think that could invigorate the margin. 
So pleased with the growth rates. Directionally pleased with the margin rates. We think we put together a nice portfolio sort of on its own and are connecting it thoughtfully and carefully with our legacy businesses, particularly Biologics."

And AI is a bit of a wildcard. There's so many shots on goal that we could take and so much impact that this could have on the portfolio. But it's still relatively early days. 
So I think that we will have meaningful investments, particularly in AI and machine learning. I do think they can be beneficial to the whole portfolio, maybe particularly cell and gene therapy. 
Look, the whole -- per your question, the whole Discovery platform is obviously much heavier science, much more cutting-edge science. And I'd say the majority of our strategic deals are Discovery-related. So I guess from that vantage point, yes, we're very much focused on it. I don't think the price points will be necessarily higher though."

Can you help us think about the levers you can pull to drive that earnings leverage next year? And The Street has you up about 11.5% on earnings, in line effectively with revenues. 
But if you're actually going to have the earnings leverage, you mentioned digital. I'm just curious what other leverage you'd have to pull to drive margin expansion and earnings leverage next year. 
And how should we think about tax rate at this point for next year?"

This year, the demand has increased more than we expected, which is great. It's setting us up nicely for the future. And we've made meaningful investments this year, so we can continue to make meaningful investments in the business with that revenue pull-through. And that's one of the benefits of having high revenue and double-digit growth. 
But we do need to invest some of that additional property, if you like, into the business not just for the short term in terms of head count but also into the medium term in terms of digital. So we will continue to do that. And I don't see next year different in that respect except we might not see -- we're not going to see a 100 basis point margin improvement in 2022 that we've seen in the last 2 years, right, and particularly this year where we've got a 100 basis point improvement despite the investments that we have made in the business. So that's helpful. That's a helpful headwind, if you like, that helps cover some of these tailwinds. 
In terms of tax, we are -- well, it depends where we end up with Biden. We did call out on our investor call back in May that while we're low 20% traditionally at the moment -- okay, this year, we've had a few discrete items that put us down. But without those discrete items, we would have expected for 2022 to be low 20s. With Biden, that would have moved us up to -- we expect it to move up to the mid-20s. And as I said a few moments ago, I'm hearing that, subject to a vote in the House, we should see the Biden reforms pushed out to '22 into '23. So ergo, if that happened, tax rate would be back to where we've traditionally been at the low 20%. 
Actually, while I have the call again, people are talking about puts and takes. In terms of the divestitures that we called out, we've called out what that impact is for this year. But I'll share with you that broadly we would expect that to be a $0.20 to $0.25 headwind for 2022 as well."

So do you have room for me? Do you have the scientific capability for me? Can you meet my turnaround times? And oh, by the way, what's the price? 
I'm not saying they're not interested in price. I would say it's significantly deemphasized as an important issue. So if you think of the client base with hundreds of new biotech companies being created every year with literally no internal capacity and big pharma continuing to rapidly reduce their internal capacity, our role is just becoming -- has become increasingly more significant. That's what we're trying to say about this year. I mean this is a high-class problem, right, high-class challenge that we are working really hard to have enough people and to build enough space to accommodate the demand, which is right now significantly ahead of where we thought our business plan would be.
So as we put the final touches on next year's operating plan, we just have to be very thoughtful and make sure that we have capacity and then some. And of course, by the way, anything we build even now is probably not available until '23 anyway. So we have to get ahead of that.
So it's a very -- it's the most attractive supply-demand paradigm that we've ever seen across most of our businesses, but particularly nuanced in Safety just given our scale and scientific depth. And so it's incumbent upon us, if this marketplace is going to depend on us, to make the necessary investments and capacity and people to accommodate them."

I mean, as I said earlier, anybody that's expecting us to get 100 basis points next year, reconsider that, please. And equally, even if you take 150 basis points and you say that's going to be linear, I think you need to consider that as well given the commentary that we've made about some of the pressures this year in terms of wage in particular and inflation.
But we've made some meaningful investments this year in 2021. So I wouldn't want you to feel that we have Draconian pressures on us. We have a portion of pressure, as everybody else in the world does. We think we can cope with that well. But I wouldn't want to leave you the impression that the last 2 years' worth of margin accretion is going to continue.
And indeed, we did try to speak on that at the Investor Day that we would be looking at 150 over 3 years. And we've also got that headwind from the 53rd week in 2022, digital investments that we've been making, which has been quite sizable in amounts will be kicking in, in the outer years. So -- and then, of course, we've got on top of that some of the compensation pressures that we've mentioned.
So our key here is to make sure that we can supply the needs of our clients, continue to get that growth, continue to win new share, make sure that we're in a great position that we become the first call in terms of doing the work for any drug research."

Obviously, if we have a deal sooner than later, we could directly apply it. 
The cell and gene therapy portfolio is pretty robust right now. I think there's some subtle -- I don't want to list them off because we're looking at additional M&A there. But there are some subtle areas that we can improve and enhance just to have a broader connectivity so we never have to outsource anything ourselves.
Having said that, I think it's more about the scale of the current portfolio and the geographic footprint of the current portfolio that we'll primarily do organically, although it's possible we'll do some M&A. 
If you take the businesses that we bought, which are 5, maybe 6, depending on what you think Retrogenix is, and then you add a Biologics business and some of our Safety and Discovery capabilities, it's a very broad portfolio now. And certainly, from a service point of view, it's the broadest of anyone in the industry.
So we have a good base right now and can accommodate a lot of demand from a diverse client base. And so we'll invest in it aggressively, organically. If we can get some of these niche deals done that we're looking at from an M&A point of view, then some of the subtle gaps that would actually be that obvious will be filled."
