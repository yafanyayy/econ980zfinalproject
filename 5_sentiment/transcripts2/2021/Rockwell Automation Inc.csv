Thank you for joining us on the call today. Before we begin discussing our results and outlook, I'd like to make a few opening remarks. On the leadership front, we have 2 exciting announcements today. Fi",1710,"Thank you, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. 
Before we begin discussing our results and outlook, I'd like to make a few opening remarks. 
On the leadership front, we have 2 exciting announcements today. First, we've hired Scott Genereux as our new Chief Revenue Officer. Scott built strong executive level customer relationships and spent most of his career leading global sales forces at major enterprise software and hardware companies. These include Oracle and, most recently, Veritas. And we're thrilled to bring him on board in this newly created role. Scott will be responsible for all worldwide sales and marketing efforts, leading our global go-to-market strategies and accelerating Rockwell's growth, including software sales and annual recurring revenue. 
The second important announcement is that Brian Shepherd has been hired as the new leader of our Software & Control business segment. Brian has extensive experience in the industrial software space and joins Scott in bringing proven knowledge about ways to drive faster recurring revenue growth in our business. Prior to joining us, Brian was President of Production Software and Smart Factory Solutions for Hexagon AB and, before that, was a long-time executive at PTC, where he led strategy and operations for their enterprise software segments. He has strong technical expertise across the design, operate and maintain phases of the customer journey and how industrial software can maximize customer value. We're excited to have him on board. 
Both Scott and Brian begin on February 1. 
Finally, I'm happy to report we are well along in our CFO search and expect to make that announcement shortly. It's been a busy few months, but I'm very pleased with the new talent and fresh perspectives we are adding to our leadership team. 
In other news this quarter, we had a very important win on the legal front. In Q1, Radwell International was found liable for trademark infringement and false advertising relating to its resale of Rockwell products. This latest legal victory underscores our commitment to protecting our intellectual property as well as our authorized distribution network. We're using a portion of the gain that resulted from this ruling to make additional investments this year. This includes investments to pull forward software product launches that will increase recurring revenue in fiscal '22 and beyond as well as sustainability-related investments to drive our ESG goals. 
With that, let me now turn to our Q1 results on Slide 3. In Q1, total reported sales declined 7%. Organic sales were down 10% versus prior year. Total sales included a 2-point positive contribution from our ASEM and Kalypso acquisitions. Note that Sensia is now included in our organic results. 
Through the quarter, we saw a sharp acceleration in order intake, especially for our products. Total orders were back above prepandemic levels. The increased demand was broad based and well above our expectations, and the higher order rates will benefit sales for the balance of the year. More on that in a moment. 
I'll now comment on our new business segments. 
Intelligent Devices organic sales declined 8%. In the quarter, we saw positive year-over-year growth in motion, where we believe we are gaining market share. Orders in this segment returned to positive growth a quarter ahead of our expectations. 
Software & Control organic sales declined 6%. In the quarter, we saw year-over-year growth in network and security infrastructure. 
Lifecycle Services organic sales decline of 16% was led by continued weakness in oil and gas. We did see a 25% sequential uptick in Lifecycle Services' orders in the quarter which will drive sequential sales improvement through the balance of the year. 
In Information Solutions and Connected Services, organic sales were down slightly in the quarter, primarily due to COVID-related project delays. However, we saw double-digit organic orders growth in IS as well as strong demand in the cybersecurity portion of Connected Services. IS/CS built backlog by about 30% versus prior year, and we expect IS/CS to have a great year overall, growing double digits in fiscal '21, with organic sales exceeding $500 million. 
Total backlog grew strong double digits on an organic basis, both year-over-year and sequentially. 
Lifecycle Services book-to-bill reached a record of 1.18, reflecting a significant improvement, both sequentially and year-over-year. 
Turning to profitability. Segment operating margin performance of 20% in the quarter was roughly flat with last year on lower sales, a testament to our increasing business resilience. 
Adjusted EPS grew 11% versus prior year, including the legal settlement gain. Excluding the gain, adjusted EPS came in above our expectations for the quarter. 
Let's now turn to Slide 4, where I'll provide a few highlights of our Q1 end market performance. Figures are for organic sales. 
Our discrete market segment sales declined by approximately 5%. However, we saw strong broad order momentum in the quarter, particularly in North America, that should benefit sales performance for the remainder of the year. Automotive sales declined approximately 10% versus prior year, with mid-single digits growth in EMEA offset by tough comparisons in other regions. Our EV business significantly outperformed the rest of automotive and included key wins from a major auto brand owner in Europe that is building a new line for EV battery manufacturing. We also won at a European Tier 1 OEM, who chose our Independent Cart Technology for the precision motion control necessary to build new electric vehicles. These were both hard-fought wins where our strong customer support and technology differentiation were important factors in our success. 
Semiconductor grew low single digits in the quarter and is expected to improve significantly over the balance of the year. Strong secular tailwinds in this vertical are prompting some of our largest semiconductor customers to increase their CapEx spend this year. As a result, we are raising our semiconductor outlook to high single-digit growth for the year, up from our original guidance of mid-single-digit growth. 
Another highlight within discrete was our performance in e-commerce, with sales growing approximately 40% versus prior year. This is obviously another industry with secular tailwinds, and we are well positioned to provide value that will continue to support its tremendous future growth. Our Independent Cart Technology is a long-term differentiator here, as it is in battery assembly and the packaging of consumer products. 
Turning now to our hybrid market segment. This segment grew by low single digits and accounted for 45% of revenue this quarter. Food and beverage grew low single digits. In addition, packaging OEMs delivered another quarter of double-digit growth versus the prior year. 
Life sciences grew about 10% in Q1, well above our expectation for the quarter, led by strong broad-based demand in North America. 
Thermo Fisher is an important part of the vaccine ecosystem. And we were very proud this quarter to be awarded a significant multiyear enterprise software order to supply software and professional services to enable their pharma 4.0 initiative and drive their COVID readiness and response. That shows Rockwell's FactoryTalk innovation suite, which uniquely integrates MES, IIOT, analytics and augmented reality in a single software solution to drive productivity. FTIS, in combination with strong pharma industry expertise, full Lifecycle Services and best-in-breed digital partner ecosystem were key factors in why Thermo Fisher selected Rockwell. 
While there's a lot of focus on our role in vaccine formulation, we're also working with the broader vaccine ecosystem to support packaging and distribution requirements. For every 1 pallet of vaccines being shipped, 20 to 30 additional pallets of vaccine accessories are required. Based on the broad-based increase in life sciences demand, we're now expecting life sciences to grow mid teens in fiscal '21. 
Process markets were down approximately 25% and weaker than we expected, led by larger declines in oil and gas. Process verticals typically lag our discrete business by about half a year. 
Turning now to Slide 5 and our organic regional sales performance in the quarter. North America organic sales declined by 11% versus the prior year, primarily due to sales declines in oil and gas and automotive. Business conditions improved significantly through the quarter and were reflected in strong product orders. 
EMEA sales declined 8%, led by oil and gas. Sales from food and beverage and water customers were strong in the quarter. 
Sales in the Asia-Pacific region declined 7%, largely due to declines in process industries that were partially offset by growth in mass transit and semiconductor. Asia-Pacific backlog reached a record high in the quarter, and we do expect strong sales growth in the region for both the upcoming quarter and full year. 
In China, we saw growth in auto, with some important greenfield EV battery wins. Sequential orders growth in Q1 and double-digit year-over-year growth in backlog support our full year sales growth outlook in China to be above the company average. 
Latin America declines were led by oil and gas and mining. In the region, we saw good growth in food and beverage and tire. 
Let's now turn to Slide 6 to review highlights for the full year outlook. Orders momentum in the first quarter is expected to drive strong growth in the balance of the year. The higher top line guidance is primarily related to improvements in the outlook for life sciences and e-Commerce in North America as well as in our global outlook for semiconductor growth. 
Our new reported sales outlook assumes 10% year-over-year growth at the midpoint, including 6% organic growth. We expect our new software offerings and expanded services will drive double-digit ARR growth in fiscal '21. Our new hires will be focused on this objective. 
Our new adjusted EPS target of $8.90 at the midpoint of the range represents 13% growth over the prior year. 
A more detailed view into our outlook by end market is found on Slide 7. I won't go into the details on this slide, but as you can see, we expect positive organic sales growth in all of our key end markets this year, with the exception of oil and gas. A market uptick in orders for Sensia in the latter part of Q1 sets the stage for improving sales later in the fiscal year. 
With that, let me now turn it over to Steve, who will elaborate on our first quarter performance and updated financial outlook for fiscal '21. Steve?"
300504,701060214,2181399,"Rockwell Automation, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2021",2021-01-26,"Earnings Calls","Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 8, first quarter key financial information. First quarter reported sales were down 7.1% year-over-year. Organic sales were down 9.7%. Acquisitions contributed 1.8 points of growth. And curr",1378,"Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 8, first quarter key financial information. First quarter reported sales were down 7.1% year-over-year. Organic sales were down 9.7%. Acquisitions contributed 1.8 points of growth. And currency translation increased sales by 0.8 points. 
Segment operating margin was 19.8%, slightly below Q1 of last year. This is the second quarter in a row that segment margin was about flat year-over-year despite lower sales, so a good result. 
Corporate and other expense of $28 million was down about $5 million compared to last year. Last year's amount included transaction fees related to the formation of the Sensia joint venture. Note that previously, we refer to this line item as general corporate net. 
The adjusted effective tax rate for the first quarter was 15.4% compared to 8.3% last year. The increase in the tax rate is primarily due to a large discrete tax benefit recorded in Q1 last year related to the formation of Sensia and other discrete items. 
Moving on to EPS. As a reminder, beginning with this quarter, we changed the definition of adjusted EPS to also exclude the impact of purchase accounting depreciation and amortization expense. First quarter adjusted EPS was $2.38. as Blake mentioned earlier, this result includes $0.45 related to a favorable legal settlement. Adjusted EPS, excluding the legal settlement, was $1.93, identical to last quarter and better than we expected. 
We are pleased with this result since compared to last quarter, we were able to overcome a $0.30 headwind from the reinstatement of incentive compensation and the reversal of temporary cost actions as of the end of November.
I'll cover the year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge for Q1 on a later slide. 
Free cash flow was $319 million in the quarter, including the $70 million legal settlement. Free cash flow conversion was 115% of adjusted income. 
One additional item not shown on the slide, we repurchased 356,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of about $88 million. This is in line with our full year placeholder of about $350 million. At December 31, $766 million remained available under our repurchase authorization. 
Slide 9 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our operating segments. As a reminder, this is the first quarter we're reporting under our 3-segment structure, the new 3-segment structure. 
The Intelligent Devices segment had an organic sales decline of 7.9% in the quarter. Segment margin was 19.4%, 130 basis points lower than last year, mainly due to lower sales, partially offset by temporary and structural cost savings. As Blake highlighted earlier, we had a strong order performance in the quarter, particularly in our product businesses. Intelligent Devices orders grew low single digits year-over-year and high single digits sequentially. 
Software & Control segment organic sales declined 6.2% in the quarter. Acquisitions contributed 2.7% to growth. And segment margin was 30.2%, which was 80 basis points lower than last year's strong margin performance, mainly due to lower sales, partially offset by temporary and structural cost savings. Software & Control orders also grew low single digits year-over-year and high single digits sequentially. 
Organic sales of the Lifecycle Services segment declined 16.3% year-over-year as the recovery in this segment's offerings tends to lag our products businesses. Acquisitions contributed 3.9% to growth and operating margin for this segment increased 50 basis points to 8.9% versus 8.4% a year ago despite lower sales. Contributing to the lower year-over-year margin improvement -- I'm sorry, contributing to the year-over-year margin improvement were temporary and structural cost savings and the absence of Sensia onetime items recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. 
First quarter book-to-bill performance for the Lifecycle Services segment was 1.18, a strong start to the year. 
Next Slide, 10, provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q1 fiscal 2020 to Q1 fiscal 2021. Starting on the left, core performance had a negative impact of about $0.25, driven by lower organic sales. Temporary cost actions partially offset the sales impact by $0.20. These were the salary reductions and 401-K match suspension that we implemented in Q3 of fiscal 2020, which remained in effect through the end of November 2020. Incentive compensation was a year-over-year headwind of about $0.10. Tax was a headwind of about $0.10, primarily due to the Sensia-related tax benefit recorded last year and other discrete items. Acquisitions contributed about $0.05, this represents a positive contribution from acquisitions that we completed in 2020 and so far in 2021. As a reminder, Sensia is now reported in core. Finally, as mentioned earlier, the legal settlement contributed $0.45 to adjusted EPS. 
Moving to Slide 11, monthly product order trends. This slide shows our order -- daily order trends for our Software & Control and Intelligent Devices segments, excluding the longer lead time configured to order offerings. The trends shown here account for about 2/3 of our overall sales. Order intake for products improved again this quarter as the recovery continued. 
As you can see, there was a sharp acceleration in demand in November and December. Orders for the LifeCycle Services segment also improved in the quarter, but are recovering slower than product orders. The strong order performance resulted in record total company backlog growing over 20% year-over-year and double digits sequentially. 
Our quarterly product order trends are shown on Slide 12. This is the same data as the prior slide summarized by quarter. Our order levels in the first quarter are now clearly above prepandemic levels, both for products and the total company. 
This takes us to Slide 13, updated guidance. We are increasing our organic sales growth outlook by 1 point. The new range is 4.5% to 7.5%, with a midpoint of 6%. 
Given the weaker U.S. dollar, we now expect currency translation to contribute about 2.5% to growth. We expect acquisitions to contribute about 1.5%. 
In total, the midpoint of our reported sales guidance range is 10%. 
We have also updated the adjusted EPS guidance range to $8.70 to $9.10. I'll review the bridge from the prior guidance midpoint to the new $8.90 midpoint on the next slide. 
Segment operating margin is now expected to be about 19.5%. The lower margin compared to prior guidance reflects the software investments that Blake mentioned earlier and the impact of the Fiix acquisition. These will primarily affect the software and control segment and will be weighted towards the third and fourth quarters. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be about 14%, the same as prior guidance. As mentioned last quarter, this includes a 300 basis point benefit related to discrete items which we expect to realize late in the fiscal year. 
We continue to project free cash flow conversion of about 100% of adjusted income. 
A few additional comments on the fiscal 2021 guidance. Corporate and other expense is expected to be between $105 million and $110 million. Purchase accounting amortization expense for the full year is expected to be about $50 million. Net interest expense for fiscal 2021 is still expected to be between $90 million and $95 million. Finally, we're still assuming average diluted shares outstanding of about 117 million shares. 
This takes us to Slide 14. This slide bridges the midpoint of our November adjusted EPS guidance range to the midpoint of our new guidance. Starting on the left, there is a higher contribution from core operating performance primarily due to the higher organic sales guidance. Currency is projected to add about $0.05 compared to prior guidance. Next, given the increase in guidance, there is about a $0.10 impact from higher bonus expense. Finally, there is the $0.45 contribution from the Q1 legal settlement, partially offset by about $0.35 for the incremental investments and the impact of the Fiix acquisition. The new midpoint of the guidance range is $8.90. 
Finally, a couple of quick comments regarding fiscal Q2. Given our strong order performance in Q1, we expect Q2 sales to grow sequentially and to be about flat year-over-year. We expect second half year-over-year organic sales growth in the mid to high teens. 
As a reminder, as we mentioned on the last earnings call, Q2 will have the largest year-over-year headwind from the reinstatement of the bonus, in the range of $50 million. 
With that, I'll hand it back to Blake for some additional comments."

Historically, the pace of recovering demand for our products after a recession has come faster than we predicted when we were still in the downturn. This recovery is looking similar so far, and we will see Q2 sales and earnings begin to reflect the torrent of orders we received in November and December, with significant double-digit year-over-year growth expected in the second half of the year. 
The rate of infections in each region around the world has had a direct impact on the timing and rate of their respective economic recoveries. The Americas were last in and seemed to be the last to recover, with our sales most highly correlated to this geography, given our revenue there. 
We are working over time to meet this demand and staying close to our component suppliers around the world. We're actively hiring and additional capacity for Logix is coming online this month. The new Milwaukee manufacturing center is working 2 shifts a day to keep pace with this increased level of orders activity. 
Turning to Slide 15. We're also investing in software development to drive our future growth. Last November at our Investor Day, we talked about how we will be releasing software as a service within our FactoryTalk portfolio to add value in the design, operate and maintenance phases of the customers' investment life cycle. The recent legal settlement gain will allow us to advance these deliverables. Recent acquisitions are playing an important role in these offerings as well, with Fiix software central to FactoryTalk maintenance hub within the Software & Control business segment. 
Fiix has already shown great momentum and just booked their first million dollar annual recurring revenue contract. Their leadership is already a part of the larger plans for accelerating our SaaS offerings. 
It all begins with great people, and I continue to be immensely proud of our employees in all parts of the organization and around the world. We continue to hire top talent, and the 2 new members of the team we announced today will add to an already great leadership team.

What's changed and why we're talking more about it is, first, the explosive growth of the end market itself, which I don't think shows much sign of slowing down. And two, we do have even improved offerings to be able to serve that market. 
Independent Cart Technology is an example where we really differentiate. We talked about that last quarter with respect to that Navy win. It differentiates us in e-Commerce as well. And some of the potential opportunities there make the Navy order look small with respect to Independent Cart Technology as a form of precision motion control. 
So it's really a combination of the market expanding as well as our readiness to serve going even higher. 
It's still a relatively small part of our total business, but we expect that to increase as a percentage of our total sales in the quarters and years to come."

As we've also talked about, we can participate in all the traditional ways  that automation is needed to build a vehicle in terms of body and paint and staffing and so on. But we also have a higher readiness to serve in the drivetrain with our capabilities in terms of battery assembly and so on. 
So there's a mix opportunity and a customer share opportunity there as well as the increased reliance on software to schedule the units in these EV plants. 
The MES offering that we have is being looked at as more market serving as opposed to a nice to have. It's being looked at as somewhat of an essential part of a modern automobile factory.

We've previously talked about doubling the number of our software specialists assisting our general account managers, that's not a onetime cost. That's an investment that we've previously talked about, and that is increasing. 
Our approach is really twofold with respect to selling more software. We have a large and growing number of software specialists as well as technical consultants to assist with those sales. And then we've got our general account managers who more and more are coming in with inherent software understanding as well. Now they've got big portfolios to sell to our customers. But I like that. I like having a single account manager that can draw on these various resources because it simplifies how our customers interact with us. And it also puts an emphasis on solutions. Because we sell our software, but it is part of a collection of offerings that provide outcomes to those customers. So it typically involves hardware. And it involves software. And it involves services. And sometimes, we're actually integrating the project ourselves. 
One of the things that Scott brings into the CRO role is a really good understanding of how all those things come together and how it is provided to the customer as a solution and how to describe that to increasingly senior levels of our customers, because it's not just selling to plant engineers, plant managers and design engineers, we're a bigger part of our customers' digital transformation with this expanded portfolio.

Thank you for joining us on the call today. Before we begin discussing our results and outlook, I'd like to make a few opening remarks. On the leadership front, we have 2 exciting announcements today. Fi",1709,"Thank you, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. 
Before we begin discussing our results and outlook, I'd like to make a few opening remarks. 
On the leadership front, we have 2 exciting announcements today. First, we've hired Scott Genereux as our new Chief Revenue Officer. Scott built strong executive-level customer relationships and spent most of his career leading global sales forces at major enterprise software and hardware companies. These include Oracle and, most recently, Veritas. And we're thrilled to bring him on board in this newly created role. Scott will be responsible for all worldwide sales and marketing efforts, leading our global go-to-market strategies and accelerating Rockwell's growth, including software sales and annual recurring revenue. 
The second important announcement is that Brian Shepherd has been hired as the new leader of our Software & Control business segment. Brian has extensive experience in the industrial software space and joins Scott in bringing proven knowledge about ways to drive faster, recurring revenue growth in our business. Prior to joining us, Brian was President of Production Software and Smart Factory Solutions for Hexagon AB and, before that, was a long-time executive at PTC, where he led strategy and operations for their Enterprise Software segments. He has strong technical expertise across the design, operate and maintain phases of the customer journey and how industrial software can maximize customer value. We're excited to have him on board. 
Both Scott and Brian begin on February 1. 
Finally, I'm happy to report we are well along in our CFO search and expect to make that announcement shortly. It's been a busy few months, but I'm very pleased with the new talent and fresh perspectives we are adding to our leadership team. 
In other news this quarter, we had a very important win on the legal front. In Q1, Radwell International was found liable for trademark infringement and false advertising relating to its resale of Rockwell products. This latest legal victory underscores our commitment to protecting our intellectual property as well as our authorized distribution network. We're using a portion of the gain that resulted from this ruling to make additional investments this year. This includes investments to pull forward software product launches that will increase recurring revenue in fiscal '22 and beyond as well as sustainability-related investments to drive our ESG goals. 
With that, let me now turn to our Q1 results on Slide 3. In Q1, total reported sales declined 7%. Organic sales were down 10% versus prior year. Total sales included a 2-point positive contribution from our ASEM and Kalypso acquisitions. Note that Sensia is now included in our organic results. 
Through the quarter, we saw a sharp acceleration in order intake, especially for our products. Total orders were back above prepandemic levels. The increased demand was broad based and well above our expectations, and the higher order rates will benefit sales for the balance of the year. More on that in a moment. 
I'll now comment on our new business segments. 
Intelligent Devices' organic sales declined 8%. In the quarter, we saw positive year-over-year growth in motion, where we believe we are gaining market share. Orders in this segment returned to positive growth a quarter ahead of our expectations. 
Software & Control organic sales declined 6%. In the quarter, we saw year-over-year growth in network and security infrastructure. 
Lifecycle Services' organic sales decline of 16% was led by continued weakness in oil and gas. We did see a 25% sequential uptick in Lifecycle Services' orders in the quarter which will drive sequential sales improvement through the balance of the year. 
In Information Solutions and Connected Services, organic sales were down slightly in the quarter, primarily due to COVID-related project delays. However, we saw double-digit organic orders growth in IS as well as strong demand in the cybersecurity portion of Connected Services. IS/CS built backlog by about 30% versus prior year, and we expect IS/CS to have a great year overall, growing double digits in fiscal '21, with organic sales exceeding $500 million. 
Total backlog grew strong double digits on an organic basis, both year-over-year and sequentially. 
Lifecycle Services book-to-bill reached a record of 1.18, reflecting a significant improvement, both sequentially and year-over-year. 
Turning to profitability. Segment operating margin performance of 20% in the quarter was roughly flat with last year on lower sales, a testament to our increasing business resilience. 
Adjusted EPS grew 11% versus prior year, including the legal settlement gain. Excluding the gain, adjusted EPS came in above our expectations for the quarter. 
Let's now turn to Slide 4, where I'll provide a few highlights of our Q1 end market performance. Figures are for organic sales. 
Our discrete market segment sales declined by approximately 5%. However, we saw strong broad order momentum in the quarter, particularly in North America that should benefit sales performance for the remainder of the year. Automotive sales declined approximately 10% versus prior year, with mid-single digits growth in EMEA offset by tough comparisons in other regions. Our EV business significantly outperformed the rest of automotive and included key wins from a major auto brand owner in Europe that is building a new line for EV battery manufacturing. We also won at a European Tier 1 OEM, who chose our Independent Cart Technology for the precision motion control necessary to build new electric vehicles. These were both hard-fought wins where our strong customer support and technology differentiation were important factors in our success. 
Semiconductor grew low single digits in the quarter and is expected to improve significantly over the balance of the year. Strong secular tailwinds in this vertical are prompting some of our largest semiconductor customers to increase their CapEx spend this year. As a result, we are raising our semiconductor outlook to high single-digit growth for the year, up from our original guidance of mid-single-digit growth. 
Another highlight within discrete was our performance in e-commerce, with sales growing approximately 40% versus prior year. This is obviously another industry with secular tailwinds, and we are well positioned to provide value that will continue to support its tremendous future growth. Our Independent Cart Technology is a long-term differentiator here, as it is in battery assembly and the packaging of consumer products. 
Turning now to our hybrid market segment. This segment grew by low single digits and accounted for 45% of revenue this quarter. Food and beverage grew low single digits. In addition, packaging OEMs delivered another quarter of double-digit growth versus the prior year. 
Life sciences grew about 10% in Q1, well above our expectation for the quarter, led by strong broad-based demand in North America. 
Thermo Fisher is an important part of the vaccine ecosystem. And we were very proud this quarter to be awarded a significant multiyear enterprise software order to supply software and professional services to enable their Pharma 4.0 initiative and drive their COVID readiness and response. That shows Rockwell's FactoryTalk innovation suite, which uniquely integrates MES, IIoT, analytics and augmented reality in a single software solution to drive productivity. FTIS, in combination with strong pharma industry expertise, full Lifecycle Services and best-in-breed digital partner ecosystem were key factors in why Thermo Fisher selected Rockwell. 
While there's a lot of focus on our role in vaccine formulation, we're also working with the broader vaccine ecosystem to support packaging and distribution requirements. For every 1 pallet of vaccines being shipped, 20 to 30 additional pallets of vaccine accessories are required. Based on the broad-based increase in life sciences demand, we're now expecting life sciences to grow mid teens in fiscal '21. 
Process markets were down approximately 25% and weaker than we expected, led by larger declines in oil and gas. Process verticals typically lag our discrete business by about half a year. 
Turning now to Slide 5 and our organic regional sales performance in the quarter. North America organic sales declined by 11% versus the prior year, primarily due to sales declines in oil and gas and automotive. Business conditions improved significantly through the quarter and were reflected in strong product orders. 
EMEA sales declined 8%, led by oil and gas. Sales from food and beverage and water customers were strong in the quarter. 
Sales in the Asia-Pacific region declined 7%, largely due to declines in process industries that were partially offset by growth in mass transit and semiconductor. Asia-Pacific backlog reached a record high in the quarter, and we do expect strong sales growth in the region for both the upcoming quarter and full year. 
In China, we saw growth in auto, with some important greenfield EV battery wins. Sequential orders growth in Q1 and double-digit year-over-year growth in backlog support our full year sales growth outlook in China to be above the company average. 
Latin America declines were led by oil and gas and mining. In the region, we saw good growth in food and beverage and tire. 
Let's now turn to Slide 6 to review highlights for the full year outlook. Orders momentum in the first quarter is expected to drive strong growth in the balance of the year. The higher top line guidance is primarily related to improvements in the outlook for life sciences and e-commerce in North America as well as in our global outlook for semiconductor growth. 
Our new reported sales outlook assumes 10% year-over-year growth at the midpoint, including 6% organic growth. We expect our new software offerings and expanded services will drive double-digit ARR growth in fiscal '21. Our new hires will be focused on this objective. 
Our new adjusted EPS target of $8.90 at the midpoint of the range represents 13% growth over the prior year. 
A more detailed view into our outlook by end market is found on Slide 7. I won't go into the details on this slide, but as you can see, we expect positive organic sales growth in all of our key end markets this year, with the exception of oil and gas. A market uptick in orders for Sensia in the latter part of Q1 sets the stage for improving sales later in the fiscal year. 
With that, let me now turn it over to Steve, who will elaborate on our first quarter performance and updated financial outlook for fiscal '21. Steve?"
300504,701060214,2181570,"Rockwell Automation, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2021",2021-01-26,"Earnings Calls","Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 8, first quarter key financial information. First quarter reported sales were down 7.1% year-over-year. Organic sales were down 9.7%.

First quarter reported sales were down 7.1% year-over-year. Organic sales were down 9.7%. Acquisitions contributed 1.8 points of growth. And currency translation increased sales by 0.8 points. 
Segment operating margin was 19.8%, slightly below Q1 of last year. This is the second quarter in a row that segment margin was about flat year-over-year despite lower sales, so a good result. 
Corporate and other expense of $28 million was down about $5 million compared to last year. Last year's amount included transaction fees related to the formation of the Sensia joint venture. Note that previously, we refer to this line item as general corporate net. 
The adjusted effective tax rate for the first quarter was 15.4% compared to 8.3% last year. The increase in the tax rate is primarily due to a large discrete tax benefit recorded in Q1 last year related to the formation of Sensia and other discrete items. 
Moving on to EPS. As a reminder, beginning with this quarter, we changed the definition of adjusted EPS to also exclude the impact of purchase accounting depreciation and amortization expense. First quarter adjusted EPS was $2.38. As Blake mentioned earlier, this result includes $0.45 related to a favorable legal settlement. Adjusted EPS, excluding the legal settlement, was $1.93, identical to last quarter and better than we expected. 
We are pleased with this result since compared to last quarter, we were able to overcome a $0.30 headwind from the reinstatement of incentive compensation and the reversal of temporary cost actions as of the end of November.
I'll cover the year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge for Q1 on a later slide. 
Free cash flow was $319 million in the quarter, including the $70 million legal settlement. Free cash flow conversion was 115% of adjusted income. 
One additional item not shown on the slide, we repurchased 356,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of about $88 million. This is in line with our full year placeholder of about $350 million. At December 31, $766 million remained available under our repurchase authorization. 
Slide 9 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our operating segments. As a reminder, this is the first quarter we're reporting under our 3-segment structure, the new 3-segment structure. 
The Intelligent Devices segment had an organic sales decline of 7.9% in the quarter. Segment margin was 19.4%, 130 basis points lower than last year, mainly due to lower sales, partially offset by temporary and structural cost savings. As Blake highlighted earlier, we had a strong order performance in the quarter, particularly in our product businesses. Intelligent Devices orders grew low single digits year-over-year and high single digits sequentially. 
Software & Control segment organic sales declined 6.2% in the quarter. Acquisitions contributed 2.7% to growth. And segment margin was 30.2%, which was 80 basis points lower than last year's strong margin performance, mainly due to lower sales, partially offset by temporary and structural cost savings. Software & Control orders also grew low single digits year-over-year and high single digits sequentially. 
Organic sales of the Lifecycle Services segment declined 16.3% year-over-year as the recovery in this segment's offerings tends to lag our products businesses. Acquisitions contributed 3.9% to growth and operating margin for this segment increased 50 basis points to 8.9% versus 8.4% a year ago despite lower sales. Contributing to the lower year-over-year margin improvement -- I'm sorry, contributing to the year-over-year margin improvement were temporary and structural cost savings and the absence of Sensia onetime items recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. 
First quarter book-to-bill performance for the Lifecycle Services segment was 1.18, a strong start to the year. 
Next Slide, 10, provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q1 fiscal 2020 to Q1 fiscal 2021. Starting on the left, core performance had a negative impact of about $0.25, driven by lower organic sales. Temporary cost actions partially offset the sales impact by $0.20. These were the salary reductions and 401-K match suspension that we implemented in Q3 of fiscal 2020, which remained in effect through the end of November 2020. Incentive compensation was a year-over-year headwind of about $0.10. Tax was a headwind of about $0.10, primarily due to the Sensia-related tax benefit recorded last year and other discrete items. Acquisitions contributed about $0.05, this represents a positive contribution from acquisitions that we completed in 2020 and so far in 2021. As a reminder, Sensia is now reported in core. Finally, as mentioned earlier, the legal settlement contributed $0.45 to adjusted EPS. 
Moving to Slide 11, monthly product order trends. This slide shows our order -- daily order trends for our Software & Control and Intelligent Devices segments, excluding the longer lead time configured to order offerings. The trends shown here account for about 2/3 of our overall sales. Order intake for products improved again this quarter as the recovery continued. 
As you can see, there was a sharp acceleration in demand in November and December. Orders for the LifeCycle Services segment also improved in the quarter, but are recovering slower than product orders. The strong order performance resulted in record total company backlog growing over 20% year-over-year and double digits sequentially. 
Our quarterly product order trends are shown on Slide 12. This is the same data as the prior slide summarized by quarter. Our order levels in the first quarter are now clearly above prepandemic levels, both for products and the total company. 
This takes us to Slide 13, updated guidance. We are increasing our organic sales growth outlook by 1 point. The new range is 4.5% to 7.5%, with a midpoint of 6%. 
Given the weaker U.S. dollar, we now expect currency translation to contribute about 2.5% to growth. We expect acquisitions to contribute about 1.5%. 
In total, the midpoint of our reported sales guidance range is 10%. 
We have also updated the adjusted EPS guidance range to $8.70 to $9.10. I'll review the bridge from the prior guidance midpoint to the new $8.90 midpoint on the next slide. 
Segment operating margin is now expected to be about 19.5%. The lower margin compared to prior guidance reflects the software investments that Blake mentioned earlier and the impact of the Fiix acquisition. These will primarily affect the software and control segment and will be weighted towards the third and fourth quarters. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be about 14%, the same as prior guidance. As mentioned last quarter, this includes a 300 basis point benefit related to discrete items which we expect to realize late in the fiscal year. 
We continue to project free cash flow conversion of about 100% of adjusted income. 
A few additional comments on the fiscal 2021 guidance. Corporate and other expense is expected to be between $105 million and $110 million. Purchase accounting amortization expense for the full year is expected to be about $50 million. Net interest expense for fiscal 2021 is still expected to be between $90 million and $95 million. Finally, we're still assuming average diluted shares outstanding of about 117 million shares. 
This takes us to Slide 14. This slide bridges the midpoint of our November adjusted EPS guidance range to the midpoint of our new guidance. Starting on the left, there is a higher contribution from core operating performance primarily due to the higher organic sales guidance. Currency is projected to add about $0.05 compared to prior guidance. Next, given the increase in guidance, there is about a $0.10 impact from higher bonus expense. Finally, there is the $0.45 contribution from the Q1 legal settlement, partially offset by about $0.35 for the incremental investments and the impact of the Fiix acquisition. The new midpoint of the guidance range is $8.90. 
Finally, a couple of quick comments regarding fiscal Q2. Given our strong order performance in Q1, we expect Q2 sales to grow sequentially and to be about flat year-over-year. We expect second half year-over-year organic sales growth in the mid to high teens. 
As a reminder, as we mentioned on the last earnings call, Q2 will have the largest year-over-year headwind from the reinstatement of the bonus, in the range of $50 million. 
With that, I'll hand it back to Blake for some additional comments."

Historically, the pace of recovering demand for our products after a recession has come faster than we predicted when we were still in the downturn. This recovery is looking similar so far, and we will see Q2 sales and earnings begin to reflect the torrent of orders we received in November and December, with significant double-digit year-over-year growth expected in the second half of the year. 
The rate of infections in each region around the world has had a direct impact on the timing and rate of their respective economic recoveries. The Americas were last in and seemed to be the last to recover, with our sales most highly correlated to this geography, given our revenue there. 
We are working overtime to meet this demand and staying close to our component suppliers around the world. We're actively hiring and additional capacity for Logix is coming online this month. The new Milwaukee manufacturing center is working 2 shifts a day to keep pace with this increased level of orders activity. 
Turning to Slide 15. We're also investing in software development to drive our future growth. Last November at our Investor Day, we talked about how we will be releasing software as a service within our FactoryTalk portfolio to add value in the design, operate and maintenance phases of the customers' investment life cycle. The recent legal settlement gain will allow us to advance these deliverables. Recent acquisitions are playing an important role in these offerings as well, with Fiix software central to FactoryTalk maintenance hub within the Software & Control business segment. 
Fiix has already shown great momentum and just booked their first million dollar annual recurring revenue contract. Their leadership is already a part of the larger plans for accelerating our SaaS offerings. 
It all begins with great people, and I continue to be immensely proud of our employees in all parts of the organization and around the world. We continue to hire top talent, and the 2 new members of the team we announced today will add to an already great leadership team.

What's changed and why we're talking more about it is, first, the explosive growth of the end market itself, which I don't think shows much sign of slowing down. And two, we do have even improved offerings to be able to serve that market. 
Independent Cart Technology is an example where we really differentiate. We talked about that last quarter with respect to that Navy win. It differentiates us in e-commerce as well. And some of the potential opportunities there make the Navy order look small with respect to Independent Cart Technology as a form of precision motion control. 
So it's really a combination of the market expanding as well as our readiness to serve going even higher.

As we've also talked about, we can participate in all the traditional ways that automation is needed to build a vehicle in terms of body and paint and staffing and so on. But we also have a higher readiness to serve in the drivetrain with our capabilities in terms of battery assembly and so on. 
So there's a mix opportunity and a customer share opportunity there as well as the increased reliance on software to schedule the units in these EV plants. 
The MES offering that we have is being looked at as more market serving as opposed to a nice to have. It's being looked at as somewhat of an essential part of a modern automobile factory. 
So those are all very positive things for us. I would also say, if the focus on made in America pertains to fleets being made in the U.S., that's obviously a good thing for us as well, given our strong position within that geography and within many of the EV brand owners."

We've previously talked about doubling the number of our software specialists assisting our general account managers, that's not a onetime cost. That's an investment that we've previously talked about, and that is increasing. 
Our approach is really twofold with respect to selling more software. We have a large and growing number of software specialists as well as technical consultants to assist with those sales. And then we've got our general account managers who more and more are coming in with inherent software understanding as well. Now they've got big portfolios to sell to our customers. But I like that. I like having a single account manager that can draw on these various resources because it simplifies how our customers interact with us. And it also puts an emphasis on solutions. Because we sell our software, but it is part of a collection of offerings that provide outcomes to those customers. So it typically involves hardware. And it involves software. And it involves services. And sometimes, we're actually integrating the project ourselves. 
One of the things that Scott brings into the CRO role is a really good understanding of how all those things come together and how it is provided to the customer as a solution and how to describe that to increasingly senior levels of our customers, because it's not just selling to plant engineers, plant managers and design engineers, we're a bigger part of our customers' digital transformation with this expanded portfolio.

Organic ord",1367,"Thanks, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. 
Slide 3. Strong orders momentum we saw last quarter accelerated and broadened across verticals in fiscal Q2 surpassed $2 billion, which is a new record. Organic orders grew double digits from last year's orders. As you may recall, COVID did not significantly impact our business until the June quarter of last year. 
Total reported sales grew 6%, including a 2-point contribution from recent acquisitions, including Awesome, Elipso and Flix. 
Organic sales grew a little over 1% versus prior year, despite significant supply chain constraints. Manufacturing supply chain continues to be stressed by sharply increased demand, along with various well public sized defense surrounding the world and have reduced output and narrowed freight lanes. 
We'll continue to navigate these challenges in the coming months, take measures to continue increasing supply chain resiliency. 
I'll now comment on our top line performance by business segment. Intelligent Devices organic sales increased 6%, led by strong broad-based demand for our automation products. Our motion control offering continues to shine up double digits, CPG companies continue to add packaging flexibility. 
Software & Control organic sales also grew 6%, led by strong demand across this segment. We saw growth in Logix control, visualization, hardware and software, network and security infrastructure across the balance of our FactoryTalk software portfolio. Net sales growth over 12% for the segment in the quarter. Orders for the Intelligent Devices and Software & Control business segments post strong double digits year-over-year and sequentially. 
Turning to life cycle services. [indiscernible] sales declined 11% versus the prior year, primarily impacted by weaker performance in oil and gas. On a sequential basis, revenue and orders grew mid-single digits, expect continued sequential sales improvement in this segment [indiscernible] balance of the year. 
Information Solutions & Connected Services had another strong quarter. Organic sales and orders from double digits contribution across a variety of end markets. 
This quarter's orders also included a number of meaningful software and infrastructure as a service, multiyear wins for some of the world's largest food and beverage manufacturers. This included craft hines, where we actively monitor our industrial network and cybersecurity environments. These wins also contribute to ARR, which grew double digits year-over-year. 
Total backlog grew strong double digits on an organic basis, both year-over-year and sequentially. 
Turning to profitability. Segment operating margin of 22% and adjusted EPS of $2.41 were above expectations and overcame headwinds from the reinstatement of the bonus and higher costs related to supply chain constraints. 
Stronger volume, favorable business mix, timing of spending, all contributed to our strong profit performance in the quarter as we continue to increase our business resiliency. 
Let's now turn to Slide 4, where I'll provide a few highlights of our Q2 end market performance. 
Figures are for organic sales. We had a very good growth from discrete industry segment, high single-digit sales growth significantly above our expectations. 
Within this industry segment, automotive sales were in line with expectations. Declining mid-single digits versus a strong prior year period when auto grew by over 20%. We continue to estimate 10% organic sales growth for the year in this vertical as MRO continues to grow and as an increasing number of capital projects are expected to launch in the second half of the year. 
Despite chip shortages impacting automotive production, we are not seeing related delays in capital or operational spending for our products. The semiconductor vertical significantly outperformed our expectations this quarter, growing about 15%. 
We believe strong secular tailwinds, increasing capital spend, broadening share of wallet with customers are all driving our growth and share gains in this vertical. As a result, we are raising our semiconductor growth outlook, approximately 15% for the year, up from our original November guidance of mid- single-digit growth. Another highlight within discrete was our performance in e-commerce with sales growing over 70% versus prior year. 
Once again, our differentiated offering, featuring our independent Cart Technology is enabling e-commerce applications at a growing number of marquee accounts. This vertical has significant secular tailwinds, of course, and has become a bigger growth driver for our overall discrete industry segment. 
Turning now to our hybrid industry segment. These verticals also had a terrific quarter. Food and beverage grew over 10% as our strong product portfolio enables these customers to efficiently add SKUs as they seek to differentiate their offering and maximize their growth. 
We saw increased capital spending by food and beverage customers in the quarter. Not surprisingly, packaging OEMs are also very busy. They contributed another quarter of double-digit growth versus the prior year. 
Life Sciences grew about 15% in Q2, led by strong demand in North America and Asia Pacific. We won an important MES project [ via ] during the quarter, opened the dawn AST pharmaceutical company, face the challenge of exporting products that need to comply with FDA regulations. Dawn AST is expecting production efficiency and quality to improve by going paperless through their choice of Rockwell's PharmaSuite MES. 
Based on the broad-based increase in life sciences demand, the share gains we are seeing in this market. We're raising our view on life sciences and expected to grow about 20% in fiscal '21. 
Process markets were down approximately 10% and were weaker than expected, led by larger declines in oil and gas. Process verticals typically lag our discrete business by about half a year. That said, we saw sequential improvement, again, in North America for oil and gas during Q2. 
Finding customers are also becoming more active. We saw low single-digit growth in the quarter. 
Turning now to Slide 5 and our Q2 organic regional sales performance. North America organic sales grew by 2% versus the prior year, primarily due to strong growth in food and beverage, e-commerce and life sciences. 
EMEA sales declined 7%, driven by oil and gas, metals and auto, partially offset by strength in food and beverage. Sales in the Asia Pacific region grew 16%, broad-based growth led by semiconductor, chemicals and life sciences. 
Asia Pacific backlog reached another record high in the quarter. We expect strong sales growth in the region, both the upcoming quarter and full year. 
In China, we saw over 30% organic growth, driven by strong growth in all 3 industry segments, including particular strength in EV and semiconductor in discrete, tire, life sciences and food and beverage and hybrid, mining and chemical and process. 
We expect growth in China will exceed the company average for the year as our longer cycle businesses kick in. 
Let's now turn to Slide 6. Highlights for the full year outlook. Orders momentum in the first half of the year expected to drive strong sales growth in the balance of the year, especially as we enter a period of easier comps. Higher top line guidance is driven by improvements during the quarter, our discrete and hybrid industry segments that more than offset incremental declines in process. 
Our new outlook for total reported sales is over 10% year-over-year growth at the midpoint, including 7% organic growth. Core automation is not the only driver of growth this year as we also expect double-digit sales growth in Information Solutions & Connected Services. We're seeing good contribution from both organic and inorganic sources. We also expect double-digit ARR growth in fiscal '21. We expect margins to stay relatively flat with last year, despite the reinstatement of our bonus and the incremental onetime investments we spoke about last quarter that will largely impact the second half. 
Our new adjusted EPS target, $9.15 at the midpoint of the range represents over 16% growth compared to the prior year. 
More detailed view into our outlook by end market is found on Slide 7. I won't go into the details on this slide. But as you can see, we continue to expect broad-based organic sales growth this year with oil and gas lagging. 
Our diversification across higher growth end markets is 1 aspect of the increasing business resilience that we talked about during the Investor Day in November. 
With that, let me now turn it over to Nick, who will elaborate on our second quarter performance and updated financial outlook fiscal '21.

Organic sales were up 1.3%, slightly better than our expectations. Acquisitions contributed 1.9 points of growth and currency translation increased sales by 2.4 points. Segment's operating margin was 22%, flat compared to Q2 of last year. This represents strong underlying improvement considering a $60 million headwind from the year-on-year change in the bonus.

Slide 9 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our 3 operating segments. Intelligent Devices segment had organic sales growth of 5.8% in the quarter. Segment margin was 23.8%, 80 basis points higher than last year, mainly due to higher sales and lower spend, partially offset by the reinstatement of incentive compensation. 
As Blake highlighted earlier, we once again had strong orders performance in the quarter, particularly in our products businesses. Intelligent Devices orders grew approximately 20%, both year-over-year and sequentially. Software & Control segment's organic sales grew 5.6% in the quarter. Acquisitions contributed 4 points to growth. Segment margin was 29%  [ 70 ] last year was strong. Margin benefit from higher sales was offset by the reinstatement of incentive compensation. Software and control orders also grew mid-teens, both year-over-year and sequentially. Organic sales of the LifeCycle Services segment declined 11% year-over-year as the recovery in this segment continues at a slower pace than our products businesses. 
Acquisitions contributed [indiscernible] 
Operating margin for this segment declined 310 basis points to 9% versus 12.1% a year ago, primarily due to lower sales and the reinstatement of incentive compensation, partially offset by favorable mix and cost savings from actions taken in the prior year. 
Second quarter book-to-bill performance for the LifeCycle Services segment was 1.19. 
In the next Slide 10 provides the adjusted EPS block from Q2 fiscal 2020 
Starting on the left. [Audio Gap]  positive impact of approximately [Audio Gap] slide shows our average daily order trends for our products. [Audio Gap] sales. Order intake for product [Audio Gap]  product order levels grew year-on-year as well as sequentially they're at an all-time high, particularly strong areas were in [indiscernible] utilization and Logix. 
Orders for the life cycle services segment also improved in the quarter sequentially, though at a slower pace than our product order growth. The overall strong order performance resulted in record company backlog, growing over 30% year-over-year, double digits sequentially. 
This takes us to Slide 12, updated guidance. We are increasing our organic sales growth outlook by 1 point across the range. The new range is 5.5% to 8.5% with a midpoint of 7%. We expect currency translation to now contribute about 2% to growth. We still expect acquisitions to contribute 1.5%. In total, the midpoint of our reported sales guidance range is 10.5% or about $7 billion. We've also updated the adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $8.95 to $9.35. 
I'll review the bridge from the prior guidance midpoint to the new $9.15 midpoint on the next slide. 
Segment operating margin is expected to be approximately 19.5%. This is unchanged from prior guidance and primarily reflects strong Q2 margin performance and the higher sales guidance offset by higher supply chain costs, bonus expense and less favorable currency. 
As a reminder, second half includes higher spend as well as the incremental onetime software development and sustainability investments that we discussed on last quarter's call. The onetime investments will primarily affect Software & Control segment. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate is still expected to be about 14%, the same as prior guidance. As previously mentioned, this includes a 300 basis point benefit related to discrete items, which we expect to realize late in the fiscal year. We continue to project free cash flow conversion to be approximately 100% of adjusted income. A few additional comments on fiscal '21 guidance. 
Corporate and other expense is expected to be about $110 million, total purchase accounting amortization expense for the full year is expected to be about $50 million. Net interest expense for fiscal '21 is still expected to be between $90 million and $95 million. And finally, we're still assuming average diluted shares outstanding of about 117 million shares. 
This takes us to Slide 13. This slide bridges the midpoint of our January adjusted EPS guidance range to the midpoint of our new guidance. 
Starting on the left. There's a higher contribution from core operating performance, primarily due to the higher organic sales guidance and favorable mix, partially offset by higher supply chain costs. 
Contribution from currency is now expected to be $0.10 lower compared to prior guidance. 
Next, given the increase in guidance, there's about a $0.15 impact from higher bonus expense, which brings the new midpoint of the guidance range to $9.15. 
Finally, a quick comment regarding the second half. We expect second half year-over-year organic sales growth of about 20%. 
And with that, I'll hand it back to Blake for some additional comments."

There's a lot of moving parts in the world and in this company and making sure that our company delivers from an execution perspective, that's a high priority. And then Rockwell has some very sound strategies about how to be continuing to increase our importance on our customers as world of automation changes and industrial automation changes. And my focus is going to be how do we best realize those strategies and make those happen. 
Now, John, part of your question, just early observations, a great company. And 1 of the things I find very refreshing and positive, this is a company full of engineers. Engineers focused on productivity. And that kind of productivity enables opportunity for investment. So I find a very healthy balance here of what are we doing to drive productivity, but also how do we invested for future growth."

Those margins are going to -- as you just said, are going to be pretty similar. And some of the things that will be improving that margin year-over-year is the growth, which you just mentioned, some added price and also we'll be benefiting from some of the action -- structural actions that we've taken over the last 18 months. What will be depressing that or bringing that margin back down to year-on-year, more or less flat, is this bonus impact, which we've talked about, some rising input costs and then the investments that was, I think, really the heart of your question. 
And the investment spending that we're doing, and I'll put it in perspective for you. For the second quarter, our investment spending was down a couple of percentage points from the second quarter last year. 
For the full year, we expect them to be up 2.5 percentage points versus full year 2020. And those are coming from the investments that we've talked about with you already. Some of it the onetime accelerated software development expenses that we're funding, and that's going to be happening fairly evenly in the last 2 quarters of the year. 
But we're also investing in added growth platforms. That's been part of the plan. Some of that involves hiring and projects. And just as a little bit of color, we did see a $5 million to $10 million shift of spending from the -- that we intended to have in the second quarter, shifting into the second half of the year, primarily due to higher -- a bit higher -- bit delay in hiring as well as some project delays, not changing our overall spending plan but shifting a little of that in the second half of the year. 
So overall, we're expecting a noticeable uptick in investments in the second half of the year. As far as the run rate into next year, some of that will be trailing off. We've been very careful about some of these incremental investments, particularly the ones we talked about last quarter, that they will -- they are temporary onetime and will not be carrying forward into '22. 
And all that into our second half EPS assumption, which more or less is unchanged from what we were saying a quarter ago."

Again, a little bit more stratified but there's the new applications, IoT, analytics, things like that. It's still a fairly diffuse, let's say, competitor landscape customers are looking for the outcomes. And you're also having to dovetail into an installed base. That's a big part of it because a lot of your challenges come in the interfaces with existing installations, and that's why we've taken that open approach to expect that these customers already have software and hardware in place and don't want to rip it all out. 
With respect to cybersecurity, even apart from the hardware, we got a cybersecurity business that's over $100 million in terms of the services. It grew double digits, very strong. We're seeing good contribution from recent acquisitions of Avnet and Oilo, and that's an area that I'm particularly proud of because it's an area that when we introduced it, it wasn't one that customers necessarily thought of Rockwell first for.

We've got some great solutions as well as the training that we provide to help with these new hires at our customers come online just as fast as possible. I also believe that the flexibility that we are adding in our own operations, and I mentioned earlier, in our own contactor facility here in Milwaukee, is giving us insight that we can impart to our customers to help them be more agile to produce a wider variety of SKUs on a single line. 
I saw an application recently with a beverage company that's able to make a very wide range of packaging formats for beverages using our independent cart technology.

Thank you for joining us on the call today. Let’s begin by reviewing our results on Slide 3. Strong orders momentum we saw last quarter accelerated and broadened across verticals in fiscal Q2. Total Orders",1405,"Thanks, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. 
Let’s begin by reviewing our results on Slide 3. Strong orders momentum we saw last quarter accelerated and broadened across verticals in fiscal Q2. Total Orders surpassed $2 billion, which is a new record. Organic orders grew double digits from last year's orders. As you may recall, COVID did not significantly impact our business until the June quarter of last year. 
Total reported sales grew 6%, including a 2-point contribution from recent acquisitions, including g ASEM, Kalypso and Fiix.
Organic sales grew a little over 1% versus prior year, despite significant supply chain constraints. The manufacturing supply chain continues to be stressed by sharply increased demand, along with various well-publicized events around the world that have reduced output and narrowed freight lanes. We will continue to navigate these challenges in the coming months and take measures to continue increasing our supply chain resiliency. 
I’ll now comment on our top line performance by business segment. Intelligent Devices organic sales increased 6%, led by strong, broad-based demand for our automation products. Our motion control offering continues to shine and was up double digits, as CPG companies continue to add packaging flexibility. Software & Control organic sales also grew 6%, led by strong demand across the segment. 
We saw growth in Logix control, visualization hardware and software, network and security infrastructure, and across the balance of our FactoryTalk software portfolio. Reported sales growth was over 12% for the segment in the quarter. Orders for the Intelligent Devices and Software & Control business segments both grew strong double digits year-over-year and sequentially. 
Turning to Lifecycle Services, organic sales declined 11% versus the prior year, primarily impacted by weaker performance in oil and gas. On a sequential basis, revenue and orders grew mid-single digits, and we expect continued sequential sales improvement in this segment through the balance of the year. 
In Information Solutions and Connected Services, we had another strong quarter, with organic sales and orders growing double digits, with contribution across a variety of end markets. This quarter’s orders also included a number of meaningful software and infrastructure-as-a-service multi-year wins with some of the world’s largest food and beverage manufacturers. This included Kraft Heinz, where we actively monitor their industrial network and cybersecurity environments. These wins also contribute to ARR, which grew double digits year-over-year. 
Total backlog grew strong double digits on an organic basis, both year-over- year and sequentially. Turning to profitability, segment operating margin of 22% and adjusted EPS of $2.41 were above expectations and overcame headwinds from the reinstatement of the bonus and higher costs related to supply chain constraints. Stronger volume, favorable business mix, and the timing of spending all contributed to our strong profit performance in the quarter as we continue to increase our business resiliency. 
Let’s now turn to slide 4, where I’ll provide a few highlights of our Q2 end-market performance. Figures are for organic sales. We had very good growth in our discrete industry segment, with high single-digit sales growth significantly above our expectations. Within this industry segment, automotive sales were in line with expectations, declining mid-single digits versus a strong prior-year period when auto grew by over 20%. We continue to estimate 10% organic sales growth for the year in this vertical, as MRO continues to grow and as an increasing number of capital projects are expected to launch in the second half of the year. 
Despite chip shortages impacting automotive production, we are not seeing related delays in capital or operational spending for our products. The semiconductor vertical significantly outperformed our expectations this quarter, growing about 15%. We believe strong secular tailwinds, increasing capital spend, and broadening share of wallet with customers are all driving our growth and share gains in this vertical. As a result, we are raising our Semiconductor growth outlook to approximately 15% for the year, up from our original November guidance of mid-single digit growth. 
Another highlight within discrete was our performance in e-commerce, with sales growing over 70% versus prior year. Once again, our differentiated offering, featuring our Independent Cart Technology, is enabling e-commerce applications at a growing number of marquee accounts. This vertical has significant secular tailwinds, of course, and has become a bigger growth driver for our overall discrete industry segment. 
Turning now to our hybrid industry segment. These verticals also had a terrific quarter. food and beverage grew over 10%, as our strong product portfolio enables these customers to efficiently add SKUs as they seek to differentiate their offering and maximize their growth. We saw increased capital spending by food and beverage customers in the quarter. 
Not surprisingly, packaging OEMs are also very busy, and they contributed another quarter of double-digit growth versus the prior year. Life sciences grew about 15% in Q2, led by strong demand in North America and Asia Pacific. 
We won an important MES project in Korea during the quarter, helping the Dong-A ST pharmaceutical company face the challenge of exporting products that need to comply with FDA regulations. Dong-A ST is expecting production efficiency and quality to improve by going paperless through their choice of Rockwell’s PharmaSuite MES. Based on the broad-based increase in life sciences demand and the share gains we are seeing in this market, we are raising our view on life sciences and expect it to grow about 20% in fiscal '21. 
Process markets were down approximately 10% and were weaker than expected, led by larger declines in oil and gas. Process verticals typically lag our discrete business by about half a year. That said, we saw sequential improvement again in North America for oil and gas during Q2. 
Mining customers are also becoming more active, and we saw low-single-digit growth in the quarter. Turning now to slide 5, and our Q2 organic regional sales performance. North America organic sales grew by 2% versus the prior year, primarily due to strong growth in food and beverage, e-commerce, and life sciences. 
EMEA sales declined 7%, driven by oil and gas, metals and auto, partially offset by strength in food and beverage. Sales in the Asia Pacific region grew 16%, with broad-based growth led by semiconductor, chemicals, and life sciences. Asia Pacific backlog reached another record high in the quarter and we expect strong sales growth in the region for both the upcoming quarter and full year. 
In China, we saw over 30% organic growth driven by strong growth in all three industry segments, including particular strength in EV and semiconductor in discrete, tire, life sciences and food and beverage in hybrid, and mining and Chemicals in Process. We expect growth in China will exceed the company average for the year, as our longer cycle businesses kick in. 
Let’s now turn to Slide 6 to review highlights for the full year outlook. Orders momentum in the first half of the year is expected to drive strong sales growth in the balance of the year, especially as we enter a period of easier comps. Higher top line guidance is driven by improvements during the quarter in our discrete and hybrid industry segments that more than offset incremental declines in Process. Our new outlook for total reported sales is over 10% year-over-year growth at the midpoint, including 7% organic growth. 
Core automation is not the only driver of growth this year, as we also expect double-digit sales growth in Information Solutions and Connected Services. We're seeing good contribution from both organic and inorganic sources, and we also expect double-digit ARR growth in fiscal '21. We expect margins to stay relatively flat with last year, despite the reinstatement of our bonus and the incremental one-time investments we spoke about last quarter that will largely impact the second half. 
Our new adjusted EPS target of $9.15 at the midpoint of the range represents over 16% growth compared to the prior year. A more detailed view into our outlook by end market is found on slide 7. I won’t go into the details on this slide, but as you can see, we continue to expect broad-based organic sales growth this year, with oil and gas lagging. 
Our diversification across higher-growth end markets is one aspect of the increasing business resilience that we talked about during Investor Day in November. With that, let me now turn it over to Nick who will elaborate on our second quarter performance and updated financial outlook for fiscal '21. Nick?"

Acquisitions cont",1085,"Thank you, Blake, and good morning everyone. 
I'll start on slide 8, second quarter key financial information. Second quarter reported sales were up 5.6% year-over-year. Organic sales were up 1.3%, slightly better than our expectations. Acquisitions contributed 1.9 points of growth, and currency translation increased sales by 2.4 points. Segment operating margin was 22%, flat compared to Q2 of last year. This represents strong underlying improvement considering a $60 million headwind from the year-on-year change in the bonus. 
Corporate and other expense of $30 million was $12 million higher than last year, primarily due to mark-to-market adjustments related to our deferred and non-qualified compensation plans. The adjusted effective tax rate for the second quarter was 16.7% compared to 12.6% last year. Last year's rate benefited from several larger discrete items. Second quarter adjusted EPS was $2.41, well above our expectations. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge for Q2 on a later slide. Free cash flow was $224 million in the quarter. Year to date, free cash flow conversion was 97%. One additional item not shown on the slide. We repurchased 363,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $92 million. 
Through the first half of the year, we are on track to our full year repurchase expectation of approximately $350 million. At March 31, $674 million remained available under our repurchase authorization. Slide 9 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our three operating segments. 
The Intelligent Devices segment had organic sales growth of 5.8% in the quarter. Segment margin was 23.8%, 80 basis points higher than last year, mainly due to higher sales and lower spend, partially offset by the reinstatement of incentive compensation. As Blake highlighted earlier, we once again had strong orders performance in the quarter, particularly in our Products businesses. Intelligent Devices orders grew approximately 20% both year-over-year, and sequentially. 
Software & Control segment organic sales grew 5.6% in the quarter. Acquisitions contributed 4 points to growth. Segment margin was 29.8%, which was 70 basis points below last year's strong margin performance. The margin benefit from higher sales was offset by the reinstatement of incentive compensation. Software & Control orders also grew mid-teens both year-over-year and sequentially. 
Organic sales of the Lifecycle Services segment declined 11% year-over-year, as the recovery in this segment continues at a slower pace than our products businesses. Acquisitions contributed 3.3% to growth. Operating margin for this segment declined 310 basis points to 9% versus 12.1% a year ago, primarily due to lower sales and the reinstatement of incentive compensation, partially offset by favorable mix and cost savings from actions taken in the prior year. Second quarter book to bill performance for the Lifecycle Services segment was 1.19. 
The next slide, 10, provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q2 fiscal 2020 to Q2 fiscal 2021. Starting on the left, core performance had a positive impact of approximately $0.45, driven by higher sales, favorable mix, and productivity. Currency contributed about $0.05. Incentive compensation was a year-over-year headwind of approximately $0.45. This reflects a $0.35 impact from the reinstatement of the bonus as well as a $0.10 impact from improved FY '21 performance. Tax was a headwind of about $0.10, primarily due to favorable discrete items last year. Although not shown on the chart, the EPS impact from acquisitions was breakeven. 
Moving to Slide 11, quarterly product order trends. This slide shows our average daily order trends for our products. The trends shown here account for two thirds of our overall sales. Order intake for products improved again this quarter, as the recovery continued. Q2 product order levels grew year-on-year as well as sequentially and are at an all-time high, particularly strong areas were in motion, visualization, and Logix. Orders for the Lifecycle Services segment also improved in the quarter sequentially, though at a slower pace than our Product order growth. The overall strong order performance resulted in record company backlog, growing over 30% year-over-year and double digits sequentially. 
This takes us to Slide 12, updated guidance. We are increasing our organic sales growth outlook by 1 point across the range. The new range is 5.5% to 8.5%, with a mid-point of 7%. We expect currency translation to now contribute about 2% to growth. We still expect acquisitions to contribute 1.5%. In total, the mid-point of our reported sales guidance range is 10.5% or about $7 billion.
We've also updated the Adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $8.95 to $9.35. I'll review the bridge from the prior guidance mid-point to the new $9.15 mid-point on the next slide. Segment operating margin is expected to be approximately 19.5%. This is unchanged from prior guidance and primarily reflects strong Q2 margin performance and the higher sales guidance offset by higher supply chain costs, bonus expense, and less favorable currency. As a reminder, the second half includes higher spend as well as the incremental one-time software development and sustainability investments that we discussed on last quarter's call. 
The one-time investments will primarily affect the Software & Control segment. Our adjusted effective tax rate is still expected to be about 14%, the same as prior guidance. As previously mentioned, this includes a 300-basis point benefit related to discrete items which we expect to realize late in the fiscal year. We continue to project free cash flow conversion to be approximately 100% of Adjusted Income. 
A few additional comments on fiscal 2021 guidance. Corporate and other expense is expected to be about $110 million. Total purchase accounting amortization expense for the full year is expected to be about $50 million. Net interest expense for fiscal 2021 is still expected to be between $90 and $95 million. Finally, we're still assuming average diluted shares outstanding of about 117 million shares. This takes us to slide 13. This slide bridges the mid-point of our January adjusted EPS guidance range to the mid-point of our new guidance. Starting on the left. There is a higher contribution from core operating performance, primarily due to the higher organic sales guidance and favorable mix, partially offset by higher supply chain costs. 
The contribution from currency is now expected to be $0.10 lower compared to prior guidance. Next, given the increase in guidance, there is about a $0.15 impact from higher bonus expense, which brings the new midpoint of the guidance range to $9.15. Finally, a quick comment regarding the second half. We do expect second half year-over-year organic sales growth of about 20%.
With that, I'll hand it back to Blake for some additional comments."

With that, let me make some final remarks about Steve Etzel, who's participating in his final earnings call. Steve stepped up during a critical period for us, as we pivoted into the early stages of this recovery and accelerated our transformation. His experience, dedication, and caring for fellow employees was exactly what we needed. Nick and I join thousands of employees in wishing Steve and Michelle all the best in a happy retirement full of adventure and time with their growing family. Let me now pass the baton back to Jessica to begin the Q&A session."

And some of the things that will be improving that margin year-over-year is the growth, which you just mentioned, some added price and also, we'll be benefiting from some of the action -- structural actions that we've taken over the last 18 months. 
What will be depressing that or bringing that margin back down to year-on-year, more or less flat, is this bonus impact, which we've talked about, some rising input costs and then the investments that was, I think, really the heart of your question. And the investment spending that we're doing, and I'll put it in perspective for you. For the first -- for the second quarter, our investment spending was down a couple of percentage points from the second quarter last year. 
For the full year, we expect them to be up 2.5 percentage points versus full year 2020. And those are coming from the investments that we've talked about with you already. Some of it the onetime accelerated software development expenses that we're funding, and that's going to be happening fairly evenly in the last 2 quarters of the year. 
But we're also investing in added growth platforms. That's been part of the plan. Some of that involves hiring and projects. And just as a little bit of color, we did see a $5 million to $10 million shift of spending from the -- that we intended to have in the second quarter, shifting into the second half of the year, primarily due to higher -- a bit higher -- a bit of delay in hiring as well as some project delays, not changing our overall spending plan but shifting a little of that in the second half of the year. 
So overall, we're expecting a noticeable uptick in investments in the second half of the year. As far as the run rate into next year, some of that will be trailing off. We've been very careful about some of these incremental investments, particularly the ones we talked about last quarter, that they will -- they are temporary onetime and will not be carrying forward into '22. And all of that into our second half EPS assumption, which more or less is unchanged from what we were saying a quarter ago."

And so we're looking at that. We have seen a little bit of an uptick in large orders in general that began in Q2, and we would expect that to continue as our life cycle services segment kicks in, and that is where a fairly good proportion, our bigger traditional projects are home grown. 
So we do expect more of that to come. Majority of our business continues to be more run rate. We used to say $3 million to $5 million was a pretty big project for us. But now we're seeing an increasing frequency of bigger ones."

So parts of the software business are still somewhat fragmented where you're largely competing against doing nothing on the part of our customer or a homegrown solution. And we still see a lot of that within, say, IoT applications. In MES, it's a little bit more, let's say, mature. And you are typically competing with a fairly well-known competitor, sometimes our traditional full scope automation competitors, sometimes niche competitors. And that visualization, I would say, is similar to that, which is a big part of our software offering. Again, a little bit more stratified. 
But there's -- the new applications, IoT, analytics, things like that. It's still a fairly diffused, let's say, competitor landscape. Customers are looking for the outcomes and you're also having to dovetail into an installed base. That's a big part of it because a lot of your challenges come in the interfaces with existing installations, and that's why we've taken that open approach to expect that these customers already have software and hardware in place and don't want to rip it all out. 
With respect to cybersecurity, even apart from the hardware, we've got a cybersecurity business that's over $100 million in terms of the services. It grew double digits, very strong. We're seeing good contribution from recent acquisitions of Avnet and Oylo, and that's an area that I'm particularly proud of because it's an area that when we introduced it, it wasn't one that customers necessarily thought of Rockwell first for. But we're having a great impact on customers, and we're working with a whole new set of decision-makers, including the CIO and his or her team. It's a really big company.

So whether it's the MES software that we've been offering, augmented reality offerings that we have with PTC we've got some great solutions as well as the training that we provide to help with these new hires as our customers come online just as fast as possible. I also believe that the flexibility that we are adding in our own operations, and I mentioned earlier, in our own contactor facility here in Milwaukee, is giving us insight that we can impart to our customers to help them be more agile to produce a wider variety of SKUs on a single line.

Plex is the leading cloud-native smart manufacturing platform operating at scale, and it will be a big part of our factory Software-as-a-Service offering. We look forward to showcasing its unique capabilities and integration into a complete production system at Investor Day during our November automation fair in Houston. 
Now let's turn to our quarterly results on Slide 3. We saw another quarter of exceptional demand across our product portfolio. Total orders surpassed $2 billion, reflecting a very strong demand pipeline. Total revenue of over $1.8 billion with a new record and grew 33%, including a 1 point contribution from recent acquisitions, including Austin, Calypso and Fix. 
Organic sales grew 26% versus prior year despite significant supply chain challenges. The manufacturing supply chain continues to remain constrained due to increased levels of demand and persistent electronic component shortages. It's a dynamic situation that we are monitoring closely. Our global supply chain organization continues to navigate these challenges and is taking a variety of measures, investing in both short- and long-term strategies to increase our supply chain resiliency. 
I'll now comment on our top line performance by business segment. Intelligent Devices organic sales increased 29%, led by strong broad-based demand for our automation products. From an orders perspective, this is the third consecutive quarter of record order intake in this segment. Once again, strong order growth in Motion was driven by our independent car technology offering, which saw over 100% orders growth in the quarter. Independent card orders growth was broad-based and included strong wins in e-commerce and warehouse automation, including intra locks, an important North American material handling OEM partner, whose machines are supporting some of the largest e-commerce applications in the world. Intralox is leveraging our independent car technology and a high bottleneck area of their process and was able to realize a 30% increase in sortation throughput. 
Software and Control organic sales grew 32%, led by strong demand across the segment. Logic sales grew over 40% versus the prior year and was our strongest major product family. Orders for the Software & Control business segment grew over 55% year-over-year, showing strong momentum. In Life cycle services, organic sales increased 17% versus the prior year and increased 8% sequentially. Book-to-bill for the segment of 1.18 is expected to drive continued sequential sales improvement in this segment through the fourth quarter. Total company backlog grew by over 50% year-over-year. 
Turning to profitability. Segment operating margin of 20% increased by 340 basis points versus the prior year. primarily due to higher sales. Adjusted EPS of $2.31 grew 75% and was above our expectations. Stronger sales and favorable mix all contributed to our strong profit performance in the quarter as we continue to increase our business resiliency and make technology and people investments that set us up for a strong future. 
Turning to Information Solutions and Connected Services, which represent many of Rockwell's newest digital revenue streams. We had another great quarter. Organic sales and orders grew strong double digits with contributions across a variety of end markets. Recent orders also include a number of meaningful software and infrastructure-as-a-service wins with some of the world's most important food and beverage and life sciences manufacturers. For example, Sinovac, one of the largest pharmaceutical manufacturers in China recently chose our pharma suite MES to help bolster production of their vaccines. We also had a great win with GE Renewable Energy on a greenfield project to develop a major power plant in Africa. Once operational, this hydro plant is expected to provide 30% of the country's energy demand while reducing annual power generation costs by $100 million. 
In addition to using our core automation products, our capabilities in industrial cybersecurity helped us win even greater share of this greenfield project. Calypso also continues to play a very important role within our connected services offerings. And last week, received PTC's Systems Integrator Partner of the Year Award. This is in addition to Rockwell receiving PTC's overall Partner of the Year Award, as we continue to see good synergies across the PTC Rockwell portfolio. 
Turning to Slide 4. At last year's Investor Day, we talked about how we are bringing our FactoryTalk software offering to the cloud with SaaS offerings in 3 key areas: FactoryTalk Design Hub, FactoryTalk operations Hub and our FactoryTalk Maintenance Hub. The organic development of our FactoryTalk Design Hub is well underway and complements our best-in-class Studio 5000 software. With the addition of Plex, we will have a world-class full-scale FactoryTalk Operations Hub. Plex' smart manufacturing platform includes one of the most advanced cloud-native MES offerings available as well as cloud-native quality and supply chain management solutions. Capabilities like inventory management, supply chain optimization and track and trace are more critical than ever and we will have unmatched on-premise and cloud-native solutions. 
Last week, we also announced our partnership with Kessler, a leading provider of cloud-based traceability software,  there will be a great complement to both our on-prem and cloud native supply chain offerings. The foundation of our FactoryTalk Maintenance Hub comes from last year's acquisition of Fiix, an AI-enabled maintenance management platform with a cloud native offering that has sold 100% on a subscription basis. 
Since the acquisition, we've seen accelerated growth at Fiix, including the addition of their first 2 customers with contributions of over $1 million of annual recurring revenue each. This quarter, Fiix' revenue grew by over 40% both year-over-year and sequentially, and they've added, on average, over 50 new logos per month since they joined Rockwell. Fiix and Plex applications are highly complementary with many opportunities for customers to further improve manufacturing productivity, product quality and asset utilization. In addition, we believe that Fiix's high-velocity go-to-market model will provide additional revenue synergies in the years ahead. 
As we mentioned on the call to announce the Plex deal, we're moving fast because manufacturers are picking up the pace of innovation, and we have the opportunity to leap ahead with new value from highly scalable, easy-to-use and well-integrated information solutions that build on a rock-solid heritage, born in the world of real-time data. 
Let's now turn to Slide 5, where I'll provide a few highlights of our Q3 end market performance. figures are for organic sales. We had great performance in our discrete industry segment with roughly 40% sales growth. Within this industry segment, automotive sales grew at about 50%, led by an increase in capital project activity. We estimate 2/3 of the capital projects we are winning are related to EV projects taking flight. For example, we had another win at the Indian automotive supplier Wipro Cary where our core automation technology will be used in EV battery pack assembly line for one of North America's largest automotive brand owners. In semiconductor, we grew about 35%. We believe strong secular tailwinds, increasing capital spend and broadening share of wallet with customers are all driving our growth. We are raising our semiconductor growth outlook once again to high teens for the year. 
Another highlight within discrete was our performance in e-commerce with sales growing approximately 65% versus prior year. This vertical has significant secular tailwinds with pure-play e-commerce players as well as traditional retailers that are transforming their warehouses through automation. 
Turning now to our hybrid industry segment. These verticals also had a terrific quarter. Food and beverage grew over 30% and had the most significant outperformance relative to our expectations as customers prioritize investing in technologies that help them differentiate their offerings and maximize their growth. We believe we are taking share in this market and that our technical and commercial strength is reaping dividends that should carry through into fiscal '22. Life Sciences grew over 40% in Q3 and was another great performer in the quarter. Life Sciences was our fourth largest industry in the quarter, not far behind automotive, and we continue to believe we are taking share in this fast-growing vertical. 
Key wins included a highly competitive win for a large greenfield project with Butantan to fast track their COVID-19 vaccine production in Brazil. Here are PlantPAx control system, FactoryTalk Batch and PharmaSuite MES, will enable a best-in-class paperless system that will fully integrate with batch control and other equipment on the factory floor. 
Our fastest-growing vertical in the hybrid segment was Tire, which was up about 60% in the quarter. Key wins included Toyo Tire Group in Japan. The Rockwell was chosen as the automation standard for their plan in Serbia. Our core automation technology, our IoT ready architecture and strong MES capability while critical factors in securing this key win. Tire has always been a strong industry vertical for Rockwell and our technologies are actively supporting our customers' increasing investments in innovation and production capacity. 
Process markets were up approximately 15% on and were better than expected. This was the first quarter where we saw all of our major process industry verticals returned to positive growth, including oil and gas, which grew low single digits versus the prior year and grew high single digits sequentially. 
Turning now to Slide 6 and our Q3 organic regional sales performance. North America organic sales grew by 29% versus the prior year with strong double-digit growth across all 3 industry segments. EMEA sales increased 21%, driven by strength in food and beverage and Tire. Sales in the Asia Pacific region grew 23% with broad-based growth led by semiconductor, life sciences and Tire. In China, we saw double-digit growth, driven by strength in Tire, life sciences and EV. We continue to expect growth in China will exceed the company average for the year as our longer-cycle businesses kick in. 
Latin America growth of 26% was led by food and beverage and automotive. Let's now turn to Slide 7 to review highlights for the full year outlook. Orders momentum and backlog are expected to drive strong sales growth in the balance of the year and into fiscal 2022. Our higher top line guidance is driven by improvements in our hybrid and process industry segments. 
Our new outlook for total reported sales growth is up 12%, including 8% organic growth versus the prior year. We're seeing strong growth in both core automation as well as information solutions and connected services. Acquisitions are contributing over 1 point of profitable growth. We are increasing our margin expectation to 20%. Our new adjusted EPS target of $9.20 at the midpoint of the range represents 17% growth compared to the prior year. This also includes $0.15 from transaction fees related to our pending acquisition of Plex. 
I should add that we expect double-digit annual recurring revenue growth in fiscal '21, with the Plex acquisition expected to add over $175 million to our ARR totals next fiscal year. A more detailed view into our outlook by end market is found on Slide 8. I won't go into the details on this slide, but as you can see, we continue to expect broad-based organic sales growth this year. With that, let me now turn it over to Nick, who will elaborate on our third quarter performance and updated financial outlook for fiscal '21. Nick?"

Third quarter reported sales were up 33% over last year. Organic sales were up 26%. Acquisitions contributed 1 point of growth, and currency translation increased sales by 5 points. Segment operating margin was 19.9%, an expansion of 340 basis points compared to Q3 of last year. Higher sales volume, a favorable mix and price all contributed to our margin expansion. These factors more than offset higher incentive compensation, our planned investment spend, last year's pay reductions and higher input costs. 
Corporate and other expense was $29 million, slightly higher than last year, mainly driven by costs related to the pending Plex acquisition. The adjusted effective tax rate for the third quarter was 14.6% compared to 14.1% last year. Third quarter adjusted EPS was $2.31 above our expectations, primarily related to higher sales. 
I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge for Q3 on a later slide. Free cash flow was $437 million or conversion of 161% in the quarter. Strong conversion in the quarter was driven by continued management of our working capital. Year-to-date, free cash flow conversion was 118% and free cash flow dollars was up 39% versus last year. One additional item not shown on the slide. We repurchased 225,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $60 million. For the full year, we have lowered our repurchase target from $350 million to $300 million in anticipation of our upcoming Plex transaction. 
At June 30, $613 million remained available under our repurchase authorization. Slide 10 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our 3 operating segments. The Intelligent Devices segment had organic sales growth of 29% in the quarter. Segment margin was 21.9%, 500 basis points higher than last year, mainly due to higher sales. This segment did see higher input costs both year-over-year and sequentially. However, these costs were largely offset by price. Once again -- we once again had strong orders performance in the quarter. Intelligent Devices orders grew approximately 65% led by North America and EMEA demand. Software & Control segment's organic sales grew 32% in the quarter. Acquisitions contributed 3 points to growth. Segment margin was 25.2%, which was 270 basis points above last year. The margin benefit from higher sales was partially offset by higher investment spend. 
These investments relate primarily to software development and additional sales resources to drive revenue growth in fiscal year '22 and beyond. Software and control orders also grew strong double digits, led by logic, which grew double digits in all regions. Organic sales of the Lifecycle Services segment grew 17% year-over-year, led by life sciences, food and beverage and semiconductor. Acquisitions contributed about 1.5% to growth. Operating margin for this segment was 10.3%, an increase of 60 basis points compared to last year. 
This increase was primarily due to higher sales partially offset by the reinstatement of incentive compensation. Third quarter book-to-bill performance for the Lifecycle Services segment was 1.18. The next slide, 11, provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q3 fiscal '20 to Q3 fiscal '21. Starting on the left. Core performance had a positive impact of approximately $1.65, primarily due to higher sales and favorable mix. We did see higher input costs this quarter compared to a year ago, which we have been offsetting with targeted price increases throughout the year. 
Approximately $0.10 was related to nonrecurring accelerated investments that we announced earlier this year. These investments are mostly in our Software & Control segment. Currency contributed about $0.05. Incentive compensation and the reversal of the temporary pay reductions was a year-over-year headwind of approximately $0.55 of which bonus was $0.40, and temporary pay actions, $0.15. As a reminder,  there was no bonus expense in Q3 of fiscal '20. Acquisitions were about $0.05 dilutive as we expected. 
Moving to Slide 12. Quarterly product order trends. This slide shows our average daily order trends for our products, which includes our software portfolio. The trends shown here account for about 2/3 of our overall sales. Order intake improved again this quarter. Q3 product order levels grew year-on-year as well as sequentially and are at an all-time high. Particularly strong areas were in Logix and Motion. Not included on this slide are orders for the Lifecycle Services segment, which were up double digits in the quarter, both sequentially and year-over-year. 
The overall strong order performance resulted in total company backlog of over $2 billion, growing over 50% year-over-year. This takes us to Slide 13, updated guidance. We are increasing our organic sales growth to 8%, which is a 1 point increase from the previous midpoint of 7%. We expect currency translation to now contribute about 2.5 points to growth, and we still expect acquisitions to contribute about 1.5%.  In total, we are forecasting reported sales to be about $7.1 billion or up 12%. We have also updated the adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $9.10 to $9.30. This new range now includes about $0.15 of transaction fees related to the pending Plex acquisition. 
I'll review the bridge from the prior guidance midpoint of 9 15 to the new midpoint of 9 20 on the next slide. Segment operating margin is now expected to be approximately 20%. This represents a 50 basis point increase from prior guidance and primarily reflects higher sales, partially offset by additional bonus expense. We continue to expect positive price/cost for the full year. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate is still expected to be about 14%, the same as prior guidance. This includes a 200 basis point annual benefit related to discrete items, which we expect to realize in Q4. We believe our normalized adjusted effective tax rate is around 18%. Given our strong generation of free cash flow through the first 3 quarters, we are now projecting free cash flow conversion to be above 105% of adjusted income. A few additional comments on fiscal '21 guidance. Corporate and other expense is expected to be about $135 million and now includes about $20 million, primarily from the transaction-related fees and expenses anticipated for the pending acquisition of Plex. 
Net interest expense for fiscal '21 is now expected to be about $95 million to $100 million and now reflects the expected incremental interest of about $5 million related to new debt for the pending acquisition of Plex. Finally, we're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 117.1 million shares. 
This takes us to Slide 14. This slide bridges the midpoint of our April adjusted EPS guidance range to the midpoint of our new guidance. Starting on the left. There is a higher contribution from core operating performance, primarily due to the higher organic sales and increasing margin. The contribution from currency is now expected to be $0.05 higher compared to prior guidance. 
Next, given the increase in guidance, there is about a $0.15 impact from higher bonus expense. Full year bonus expense is now expected to be approximately $175 million. Given our projected full year performance, this bonus is higher than the initial fiscal year '21 target of about $115 million. For comparison, this was 0 for fiscal year 2020. 
Finally, we now have about a $0.15 impact coming from the pending acquisition of Plex, which we anticipate will close in Q4. This brings the new midpoint of the guidance range to $9.20. 
Finally, a few more comments on Plex. Turning now to Page 15. Plex will be reported in our Software & Control segment and be a part of our information solutions and connected services portfolio of offerings. We are forecasting that in fiscal year '22,  it will generate $175 million of ARR, $160 million of revenue after the adjustment for deferred revenue and a neutral impact to earnings per share. About $0.35 of incremental EPS from operations is forecasted to fully offset the deferred revenue adjustments, integration expenses and incremental interest expense. 
We expect fiscal year '23 revenues to be above $200 million with a meaningful contribution to EPS in fiscal year '23.  We have included further details in the appendix on the financial impact of Plex in fiscal year '21 and '22. With that, I'll hand it back to Blake for some additional comments."

For Rockwell, there's actually upside to an EV project versus a traditional internal combustion engine. So starting with the drivetrain. A lot of our independent car technology wins for precision motion control have actually been on the battery and the drivetrain side, if you will, or EV, where traditionally in internal combustion engines, Rockwell has had a smaller content. That may not be true for some of the other suppliers who've got the traditional revenue stream for CNC or what have you, but we don't. And so we're not losing business in that transition it's a net positive for us. 
On the software side, the EV manufacturers are adopting right from the start in the software as a necessary element of their production scheduling system. And so whereas 10 years ago or so, it was seen as a nice to have but not necessarily a requirement. With these new facilities coming online, MES is seen as a necessary part of the bill of material, if you will. 
And then you combine all the other pieces of putting the vehicle together that remain the same. So you still have to staff and paint metal, you assemble the components you test at the end of the line and so on. And those are all applications that Rockwell has good offerings for it. 
In terms of the competitive landscape, as you would expect, the usual suspects are there in terms of the traditional part of the vehicle manufacturing and assembly. On the battery and in the electric vehicle drivetrain, very heavy Asian content, China, Japan, Korea. And so I'd say it's even more international with a bias towards Asia and some of those new elements. And we've put together good teams for tracking and pursuing these projects that span across multiple countries."

They felt like it made great sense and it had what we can offer to complement the core automation that they've been buying from us for years or, in some cases, where they're trying to decide who their digital transformation partner is. With this, what we have, and this is something we've talked about for a long time and approach that meets customers where they are on their journey. We're still going to sell a lot of on-premise software and customers have made investments there, and they want to see a migration path. And our MES orders of production center based in the U.S. continue to grow and those orders get larger, and we continue to see lots of runway for that software for customers who've decided they want an on-premise solution. But we have the opportunity for customers who have made a decision that they're going to start working with these applications with cloud-native software, and they're ready to start working there to build on Plex great customer base and introduce it to those customers who said they're ready to look at that as well. 
And so having that approach, it all comes back to that theme of an open approach where we're not forcing one philosophy down a customer's throat, and we're telling them we can meet them where they are on their journey.  We'd like for that data to be coming from Rockwell core automation components. But as we've talked about before, a lot of the software we fully expect is going to give us a way in into competitive strongholds where we're not currently the supplier of the core automation and we're going to be providing the value at the software and then working on the automation pieces as well. So it's going to be a both approach, and we're thrilled about the new ways to win that Plex gives us."

So in the quarter, we saw a little bit of an impact on supply chain in automotive MRO, there was a small amount, and we did not see that affecting capital projects or other industries. And we still believe that while -- this is something that our customers' operations and supply chain organizations are going to continue to be working on for the foreseeable future. it's not going to crimp the supply going forward. And in fact, it's probably lessening with respect to automotive from what we may have seen earlier in the year. 
The part of the supply chain constraints that we're thinking about are in terms of converting our own backlog. And I mentioned specifically that our supply chain organization, I think, is doing a terrific job navigating this, but it's not going to be over in the next quarter. We're going to continue to be dealing with these supply chain constraints for the foreseeable future, and we're looking at how do we deal with these on a short-term basis, but also on a longer-term basis. And I would say electronic components are a piece of that. 
Some of this is just simply brought on by the extremely sharp recovery in demand that we've seen and that we continue to see in the orders. But then there's also the labor. And we have to make sure that we're a great destination for labor in our plants, in our supply chain organization, in our development teams and so on across the organization, because as you know, it's a very hot, it's a very active labor market right now. 
And again, I think we're doing a great job with that. We had really good collaboration across all parts of the organization to make sure that we're pulling together so that when people are considering Rockwell as a destination that would come out on top. So it's those 2 areas, I would say. But again, in terms of the demand, we're really not seeing a significant dampening of demand brought on by our customer supply chain constraints."

Thank you for joining us today. Before I begin, let me first congratulate our Milwaukee Bucks for such an incredible season. Go, Bucks.

Before I begin, let me first congratulate our Milwaukee Bucks for such an incredible season. Go, Bucks.  
Let me now take a moment to talk about a couple of key highlights in the quarter. First of all, I'm pleased to welcome Cyril Perducat as our new Chief Technology Officer. He succeeds Sujeet Chand, who is retiring later this year after a long and very impactful career at Rockwell, and I'll talk more about his legacy in November. Cyril brings a wealth of automation and digital transformation experience to the role with great global experience and a passion for helping customers. His mindset and additional perspective will help drive even more value from the combination of our core automation, software and managed services offerings to provide positive outcomes for customers.  
We also announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire Plex Systems, which we expect to close in Q4 of this year. Plex is the leading cloud-native smart manufacturing platform operating at scale, and it will be a big part of our FactoryTalk Software-as-a-Service offering. We look forward to showcasing its unique capabilities and integration into a complete production system at Investor Day during our November automation fair in Houston.  
Now let's turn to our quarterly results on Slide 3. We saw another quarter of exceptional demand across our product portfolio. Total orders surpassed $2 billion, reflecting a very strong demand pipeline. Total revenue of over $1.8 billion with a new record and grew 33%, including a 1 point contribution from recent acquisitions, including ASEM, Kalypso and Fiix.  
Organic sales grew 26% versus prior year despite significant supply chain challenges. The manufacturing supply chain continues to remain constrained due to increased levels of demand and persistent electronic components shortages. It's a dynamic situation that we are monitoring closely. Our global supply chain organization continues to navigate these challenges and is taking a variety of measures, investing in both short- and long-term strategies to increase our supply chain resiliency.  
I'll now comment on our top line performance by business segment. Intelligent Devices organic sales increased 29%, led by strong broad-based demand for our automation products. From an orders perspective, this is the third consecutive quarter of record order intake in this segment. Once again, strong order growth in motion was driven by our Independent Cart Technology offering, which saw over 100% orders growth in the quarter. Independent Cart orders growth was broad-based and included strong wins in e-commerce and warehouse automation, including Intralox, an important North American material handling OEM partner, whose machines are supporting some of the largest e-commerce applications in the world. Intralox is leveraging our Independent Cart Technology and a high bottleneck area of their process and was able to realize a 30% increase in sortation throughput.  
Software & Control organic sales grew 32%, led by strong demand across the segment. Logix sales grew over 40% versus the prior year and was our strongest major product family. Orders for the Software & Control business segment grew over 55% year-over-year, showing strong momentum. 
In Lifecycle Services, organic sales increased 17% versus the prior year and increased 8% sequentially. Book-to-bill for the segment of 1.18 is expected to drive continued sequential sales improvement in this segment through the fourth quarter.  
Total company backlog grew by over 50% year-over-year.  
Turning to profitability. Segment operating margin of 20% increased by 340 basis points versus the prior year. primarily due to higher sales. Adjusted EPS of $2.31 grew 75% and was above our expectations. Stronger sales and favorable mix all contributed to our strong profit performance in the quarter as we continued to increase our business resiliency and make technology and people investments that set us up for a strong future.  
Turning to Information Solutions & Connected Services, which represent many of Rockwell's newest digital revenue streams. We had another great quarter. Organic sales and orders grew strong double digits with contributions across a variety of end markets. Recent orders also include a number of meaningful software and infrastructure-as-a-service wins with some of the world's most important food and beverage and life sciences manufacturers. For example, Sinovac, one of the largest pharmaceutical manufacturers in China, recently chose our pharma suite, MES, to help bolster production of their vaccines. We also had a great win with GE Renewable Energy on a greenfield project to develop a major power plant in Africa. Once operational, this hydro plant is expected to provide 30% of the country's energy demand while reducing annual power generation costs by $100 million. In addition to using our core automation products, our capabilities in industrial cybersecurity helped us win even greater share of this greenfield project. 
Kalypso also continues to play a very important role within our Connected Services offerings, and last week, received PTC's Systems Integrator Partner of the Year Award. This is in addition to Rockwell receiving PTC's overall Partner of the Year Award, as we continue to see good synergies across the PTC Rockwell portfolio.  
Turning to Slide 4. At last year's Investor Day, we talked about how we are bringing our FactoryTalk software offering to the cloud with SaaS offerings in 3 key areas: FactoryTalk Design Hub, FactoryTalk Operations Hub and our FactoryTalk Maintenance Hub. The organic development of our FactoryTalk Design Hub is well underway and complements our best-in-class Studio 5000 software. 
With the addition of Plex, we will have a world-class full-scale FactoryTalk Operations Hub. Plex's Smart Manufacturing Platform includes one of the most advanced cloud-native MES offerings available as well as cloud-native quality and supply chain management solutions. Capabilities like inventory management, supply chain optimization and track and trace are more critical than ever and we will have unmatched on-premise and cloud-native solutions.  
Last week, we also announced our partnership with Kezzler, a leading provider of cloud-based traceability software, that will be a great complement to both our on-prem and cloud-native supply chain offerings. 
The foundation of our FactoryTalk Maintenance Hub comes from last year's acquisition of Fiix, an AI-enabled maintenance management platform with a cloud-native offering that is sold 100% on a subscription basis. Since the acquisition, we've seen accelerated growth at Fiix, including the addition of their first 2 customers with contributions of over $1 million of annual recurring revenue each. This quarter, Fiix revenue grew by over 40% both year-over-year and sequentially, and they've added, on average, over 50 new logos per month since they've joined Rockwell. 
Fiix and Plex applications are highly complementary with many opportunities for customers to further improve manufacturing productivity, product quality and asset utilization. In addition, we believe that Fiix's high-velocity go-to-market model will provide additional revenue synergies in the years ahead.  
As we mentioned on the call to announce the Plex deal, we're moving fast because manufacturers are picking up the pace of innovation, and we have the opportunity to leap ahead with new value from highly scalable, easy-to-use and well-integrated information solutions that build on our rock-solid heritage, born in the world of real-time data.  
Let's now turn to Slide 5, where I'll provide a few highlights of our Q3 end market performance. Figures are for organic sales. We had great performance in our discrete industry segment with roughly 40% sales growth. Within this industry segment, automotive sales grew at about 50%, led by an increase in capital project activity. We estimate 2/3 of the capital projects we are winning are related to EV projects taking flight. For example, we had another win at the Indian automotive supplier, Wipro PARI, where our core automation technology will be used in EV battery pack assembly line for one of North America's largest automotive brand owners. 
In semiconductor, we grew about 35%. We believe strong secular tailwinds, increasing capital spend and broadening share of wallet with customers are all driving up growth. We are raising our semiconductor growth outlook once again to high teens for the year.  
Another highlight within discrete was our performance in e-commerce with sales growing approximately 65% versus prior year. This vertical has significant secular tailwinds with pure-play e-commerce players as well as traditional retailers that are transforming their warehouses through automation.  
Turning now to our hybrid industry segment. These verticals also had a terrific quarter. Food and beverage grew over 30% and had the most significant outperformance relative to our expectations as customers prioritize investing in technologies that help them differentiate their offerings and maximize their growth. We believe we are taking share in this market and that our technical and commercial strength is reaping dividends that should carry through into fiscal '22. 
Life sciences grew over 40% in Q3 and was another great performer in the quarter. Life sciences was our fourth largest industry in the quarter, not far behind automotive, and we continue to believe we are taking share in this fast-growing vertical.  
Key wins included a highly competitive win for a large greenfield project with Butantan to fast track their COVID-19 vaccine production in Brazil. Here, our PlantPAx control system, FactoryTalk Batch and PharmaSuite MES, will enable a best-in-class paperless system that will fully integrate with batch control and other equipment on the factory floor. 
Our fastest-growing vertical in the hybrid segment was Tire, which was up about 60% in the quarter. Key wins included Toyo Tire Group in Japan. The Rockwell was chosen as the automation standard for their plant in Serbia. Our core automation technology, our IoT-ready architecture and strong MES capability were critical factors in securing this key win. Tire has always been a strong industry vertical for Rockwell and our technologies are actively supporting our customers' increasing investments in innovation and production capacity. 
Process markets were up approximately 15% and were better than expected. This was the first quarter where we saw all of our major process industry verticals returned to positive growth, including oil and gas, which grew low single digits versus the prior year and grew high single digits sequentially. 
Turning now to Slide 6 and our Q3 organic regional sales performance. North America organic sales grew by 29% versus the prior year with strong double-digit growth across all 3 industry segments. EMEA sales increased 21%, driven by strength in food and beverage and Tire. Sales in the Asia Pacific region grew 23% with broad-based growth led by semiconductor, life sciences and Tire. In China, we saw double-digit growth driven by strength in Tire, life sciences and EV. We continue to expect growth in China will exceed the company average for the year as our longer-cycle businesses kick in. 
Latin America growth of 26% was led by food and beverage and automotive. 
Let's now turn to Slide 7 to review highlights for the full year outlook. Orders momentum and backlog are expected to drive strong sales growth in the balance of the year and into fiscal 2022. Our higher top line guidance is driven by improvements in our hybrid and process industry segments. 
Our new outlook for total reported sales growth is up 12%, including 8% organic growth versus the prior year. We're seeing strong growth in both core automation as well as Information Solutions & Connected Services. Acquisitions are contributing over 1 point of profitable growth. We are increasing our margin expectation to 20%. Our new adjusted EPS target of $9.20 at the midpoint of the range represents 17% growth compared to the prior year. This also includes $0.15 from transaction fees related to our pending acquisition of Plex. I should add that we expect double-digit annual recurring revenue growth in fiscal '21, with the Plex acquisition expected to add over $175 million to our ARR totals next fiscal year. 
A more detailed view into our outlook by end market is found on Slide 8. I won't go into the details on this slide, but as you can see, we continue to expect broad-based organic sales growth this year. 
With that, let me now turn it over to Nick, who will elaborate on our third quarter performance and updated financial outlook for fiscal '21. Nick?"

I'll start on Slide 9, third quarter key financial information. Third quarter reported sales were up 33% over last year. Organic sales were up 26%. Acquisitions contributed 1 point of growth, and currency translation increased sales by 5 points. Segment operating margin was 19.9%, an expansion of 340 basis points compared to Q3 of last year. Higher sales volume, a favorable mix and price all contributed to our margin expansion. These factors more than offset higher incentive compensation, our planned investment spend, last year's pay reductions and higher input costs. 
Corporate and other expense was $29 million, slightly higher than last year, mainly driven by costs related to the pending Plex acquisition. The adjusted effective tax rate for the third quarter was 14.6% compared to 14.1% last year. Third quarter adjusted EPS was $2.31 above our expectations, primarily related to higher sales. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge for Q3 on a later slide. 
Free cash flow was $437 million or a conversion of 161% in the quarter. Strong conversion in the quarter was driven by continued management of our working capital. Year-to-date, free cash flow conversion was 118% and free cash flow dollars was up 39% versus last year. 
One additional item not shown on the slide. We repurchased 225,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $60 million. For the full year, we have lowered our repurchase target from $350 million to $300 million in anticipation of our upcoming Plex transaction. At June 30, $613 million remained available under our repurchase authorization. 
Slide 10 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our 3 operating segments. The Intelligent Devices segment had organic sales growth of 29% in the quarter. Segment margin was 21.9%, 500 basis points higher than last year, mainly due to higher sales. This segment did see higher input costs both year-over-year and sequentially. However, these costs were largely offset by price. Once again -- we once again had strong orders performance in the quarter. Intelligent Devices orders grew approximately 65% led by North America and EMEA demand. 
Software & Control segment's organic sales grew 32% in the quarter. Acquisitions contributed 3 points to growth. Segment margin was 25.2%, which was 270 basis points above last year. The margin benefit from higher sales was partially offset by higher investment spend. These investments relate primarily to software development and additional sales resources to drive revenue growth in fiscal year '22 and beyond. Software & Control orders also grew strong double digits, led by Logix, which grew double digits in all regions. 
Organic sales of the Lifecycle Services segment grew 17% year-over-year, led by life sciences, food and beverage and semiconductor. Acquisitions contributed about 1.5% to growth. Operating margin for this segment was 10.3%, an increase of 60 basis points compared to last year. This increase was primarily due to higher sales partially offset by the reinstatement of incentive compensation. Third quarter book-to-bill performance for the Lifecycle Services segment was 1.18. 
The next slide, 11, provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q3 fiscal '20 to Q3 fiscal '21. Starting on the left. Core performance had a positive impact of approximately $1.65, primarily due to higher sales and favorable mix. We did see higher input costs this quarter compared to a year ago, which we have been offsetting with targeted price increases throughout the year. Approximately $0.10 was related to nonrecurring accelerated investments that we announced earlier this year. These investments are mostly in our Software & Control segment. Currency contributed about $0.05. Incentive compensation and the reversal of the temporary pay reductions was a year-over-year headwind of approximately $0.55, of which, bonus was $0.40, and temporary pay actions, $0.15. As a reminder, there was no bonus expense in Q3 of fiscal '20. Acquisitions were about $0.05 dilutive as we expected. 
Moving to Slide 12, quarterly product order trends. This slide shows our average daily order trends for our products, which includes our software portfolio. The trends shown here account for about 2/3 of our overall sales. Order intake improved again this quarter. Q3 product order levels grew year-on-year as well as sequentially and are at an all-time high. Particularly strong areas were in Logix and motion. Not included on this slide are orders for the Lifecycle Services segment, which were up double digits in the quarter, both sequentially and year-over-year. The overall strong order performance resulted in total company backlog of over $2 billion, growing over 50% year-over-year. 
This takes us to Slide 13, updated guidance. We are increasing our organic sales growth to 8%, which is a 1 point increase from the previous midpoint of 7%. We expect currency translation to now contribute about 2.5 points to growth, and we still expect acquisitions to contribute about 1.5%. In total, we are forecasting reported sales to be about $7.1 billion or up 12%. 
We have also updated the adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $9.10 to $9.30. This new range now includes about $0.15 of transaction fees related to the pending Plex acquisition.  I'll review the bridge from the prior guidance midpoint of $9.15 to the new midpoint of $9.20 on the next slide. 
Segment operating margin is now expected to be approximately 20%. This represents a 50 basis point increase from prior guidance and primarily reflects higher sales, partially offset by additional bonus expense. We continue to expect positive price/cost for the full year. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate is still expected to be about 14%, the same as prior guidance. This includes a 200 basis point annual benefit related to discrete items, which we expect to realize in Q4. We believe our normalized adjusted effective tax rate is around 18%. 
Given our strong generation of free cash flow through the first 3 quarters, we are now projecting free cash flow conversion to be above 105% of adjusted income. 
A few additional comments on fiscal '21 guidance. Corporate and other expense is expected to be about $135 million and now includes about $20 million, primarily from the transaction-related fees and expenses anticipated for the pending acquisition of Plex. 
Net interest expense for fiscal '21 is now expected to be about $95 million to $100 million and now reflects the expected incremental interest of about $5 million related to new debt for the pending acquisition of Plex. 
Finally, we're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 117.1 million shares. 
This takes us to Slide 14. This slide bridges the midpoint of our April adjusted EPS guidance range to the midpoint of our new guidance. Starting on the left. There is a higher contribution from core operating performance, primarily due to the higher organic sales and increase in margin. The contribution from currency is now expected to be $0.05 higher compared to prior guidance. 
Next, given the increase in guidance, there is about a $0.15 impact from higher bonus expense. Full year bonus expense is now expected to be approximately $175 million. Given our projected full year performance, this bonus is higher than the initial fiscal year '21 target of about $115 million. For comparison, this was 0 for fiscal year 2020. 
Finally, we now have about a $0.15 impact coming from the pending acquisition of Plex, which we anticipate will close in Q4. This brings the new midpoint of the guidance range to $9.20. 
Finally, a few more comments on Plex. Turning now to Page 15. Plex will be reported in our Software & Control segment and be a part of our Information Solutions & Connected Services portfolio of offerings. We are forecasting that in fiscal year '22, it will generate $175 million of ARR, $160 million of revenue after the adjustment for deferred revenue and a neutral impact to earnings per share. About $0.35 of incremental EPS from operations is forecasted to fully offset the deferred revenue adjustments, integration expenses and incremental interest expense. We expect fiscal year '23 revenues to be above $200 million with a meaningful contribution to EPS in fiscal year '23. We have included further details in the appendix on the financial impact of Plex in fiscal year '21 and '22. 
With that, I'll hand it back to Blake for some additional comments."

For Rockwell, there's actually upside to an EV project versus a traditional internal combustion engine. So starting with the drivetrain. A lot of our Independent Cart Technology wins for precision motion control have actually been on the battery and the drivetrain side, if you will, or EV, where traditionally in internal combustion engines, Rockwell has had a smaller content. That may not be true for some of the other suppliers who've got the traditional revenue stream for CNC or what have you, but we don't. And so we're not losing business in that transition. It's a net positive for us. 
On the software side, the EV manufacturers are adopting right from the start MES software as a necessary element of their production scheduling system. And so whereas 10 years ago or so, it was seen as a nice to have but not necessarily a requirement. With these new facilities coming online, MES is seen as a necessary part of the bill of material, if you will. 
And then you combine all the other pieces of putting the vehicle together that remain the same. So you still have to stamp and paint metal, you assemble the components, you test them at the end of the line and so on. And those are all applications that Rockwell has good offerings for. 
In terms of the competitive landscape, as you would expect, the usual suspects are there in terms of the traditional part of the vehicle manufacturing and assembly. On the battery and in the electric vehicle drivetrain, very heavy Asian content, China, Japan, Korea. And so I'd say it's even more international with a bias towards Asia in some of those new elements. And we've put together good teams for tracking and pursuing these projects that span across multiple countries."

Today, those pieces of their overall facility are typically being provided by multiple of our customers. So you don't see necessarily one single subsupplier to them providing all of the conveyance and sortation and so on. 
And so we're working with some of the big ones, of course, whose names you would recognize, but there's also a whole host of integrators and machinery builders with a good idea that Amazon is bringing into their ecosystem. And so we're working with a lot of these smaller suppliers. 
And I would also add, this isn't just for the big e-commerce giants. Now this is for the big box retailers who are also looking to automate their material handling. The Walmarts of the world are also looking at these solutions at their individual locations where they're bringing in tremendous amounts of material to try to get in the right place more efficiently than ever before. But we see almost limitless opportunity just in the e-commerce area for additional adoption of Independent Cart. And as we've talked about, we see Independent Cart wins in other applications outside of e-commerce. We see it in life sciences. We see it in food and beverage packaging, giving scalability and flexibility that manufacturers could never see before. And then we have some, let's say, more unusual applications like the one we talked about with the U.S. Navy a few quarters ago."

They felt like it made great sense and it added what we can offer to complement the core automation that they've been buying from us for years or, in some cases, where they're trying to decide who their digital transformation partner is. 
With this, what we have, and this is something we've talked about for a long time, an approach that meets customers where they are on their journey. We're still going to sell a lot of on-premise software, and customers have made investments there, and they want to see a migration path. And our MES orders, our production center-based MES continue to grow and those orders get larger, and we continue to see lots of runway for that software for customers who've decided they want an on-premise solution. 
But we have the opportunity for customers who have made a decision that they're going to start working with these applications with cloud-native software, and they're ready to start working there, to build on Plex's great customer base and introduce it to those customers who said they're ready to look at that as well. 
And so having that approach, it all comes back to that theme of an open approach where we're not forcing one philosophy down a customer's throat, and we're telling them we can meet them where they are on their journey. We'd like for that data to be coming from Rockwell core automation components. But as we've talked about before, a lot of this software we fully expect is going to give us a way in into competitive strongholds where we're not currently the supplier of the core automation and we're going to be providing the value at the software and then working on the automation pieces as well. So it's going to be a both approach, and we're thrilled about the new ways to win that Plex gives us."

I don't think it was addressed too much on this call, but you mentioned both in the press release and I think in the prepared remarks,some of the supply chain constraints. And I was wondering if we could get a little bit more color around where you see the supply chain pressure is really still manifesting for Rockwell internally and what that looks like over the coming couple of quarters? 
But then also, if you can just touch on what impact this is maybe still having on demand? I mean I've got to imagine for any ops or production planner, this reramp is like drinking from a fire hose every day. And so I'm just wondering to what extent you're seeing your customers demand or kind of CapEx plans somewhat being held back by just the challenges of reramping?"

There was a small amount and we did not see that affecting capital projects or other industries. And we still believe that while this is something that our customers' operations and supply chain organizations are going to continue to be working on for the foreseeable future, it's not going to crimp the supply going forward. And in fact, it's probably lessening, with respect to automotive, from what we may have seen earlier in the year. 
The part of the supply chain constraints that we're thinking about are in terms of converting our own backlog. And I'd mentioned specifically that our supply chain organization, I think, is doing a terrific job navigating this, but it's not going to be over in the next quarter. We're going to continue to be dealing with these supply chain constraints for the foreseeable future, and we're looking at how do we deal with these on a short-term basis, but also on a longer-term basis. And I would say electronic components are a piece of that. Some of this is just simply brought on by the extremely sharp recovery in demand that we've seen and that we continue to see in the orders. But then there's also the labor. And we have to make sure that we're a great destination for labor in our plants, in our supply chain organization, in our development teams and so on across the organization, because as you know, it's a very hot, it's a very active labor market right now. 
And again, I think we're doing a great job with that. We had really good collaboration across all parts of the organization to make sure that we're pulling together so that when people are considering Rockwell as a destination, that we'd come out on top. 
So it's those 2 areas, I would say. But again, in terms of the demand, we're really not seeing a significant dampening of demand brought on by our customer supply chain constraints."

We saw another quarter of exceptional demand across all 3 business segments. Total orders surpassed $2.2 billion and grew 40% over the prior year, reflecting a very strong demand pipeline across our portfolio of core automation and digital transformation solutions. Total revenue of over $1.8 billion grew 15%, with additional sales that shifted into fiscal '22 due to supply chain headwinds.
Organic sales grew 13% versus prior year. We had very strong growth in core automation and Information Solutions and Connected Services grew double digits in both orders and revenue. This performance was led by strong demand for software and cybersecurity services.
Turning to ARR. We continue to make significant progress to drive recurring revenue. Our ARR grew organically by over 18%. And including our recent acquisition of Plex, now accounts for over 8% of total sales. Segment margin of 18% came in line with our expectations with the execution of planned investments in Q4. 
I'll now comment on our top line performance by business segment. Intelligent Devices organic sales increased 15% versus prior year, even with significant headwinds from supply chain. From an orders perspective, this is the fourth consecutive quarter of record order intake in this segment with orders 30% above fiscal 2019 levels. We continue to see significant strength across the automation portfolio and share gains, particularly evident in motion, led by our independent cart technology.
Software & Control organic sales grew 14%, led by strong demand across the segment, including double-digit growth in Logix. Orders grew approximately 50% year-over-year, once again showing great momentum across the software, control, visualization and network portfolios.
In Lifecycle Services, organic sales increased 7% versus the prior year and increased 2% sequentially even with some projects delayed as a result of component availability. Lifecycle Services book-to-bill of 1.09 was well above seasonal Q4 levels. Total company backlog of $2.9 billion grew by over 80% year-over-year. Over 40% of backlog is related to our Lifecycle Services business.
Turning to Information Solutions and Connected Services, which represent many of Rockwell's newest digital revenue streams. We had another great quarter. Recent orders included a number of meaningful software and Infrastructure as a Service wins. One of the more notable wins in the quarter was with ARDA Group, one of the world's largest sustainable packaging companies. The company had placed a $1 million order for fixed software in Q3 to reduce unplanned downtime. ARDA, like a lot of manufacturers, is trying to respond to a sharp increase in demand. By Q4, as the relationship developed, we pulled through an additional $4 million purchase of core automation products showcasing the tremendous synergy resulting from our new software capabilities and intelligent devices. With their ARR growing 45% and over 470 new fixed customers added in just the last 9 months, I'm very happy with the contributions Fix has been able to make to our overall business.
We also had a great win with one of the world's largest food and beverage companies in 2 key application areas. The first win is in the area of predictive analytics, where our Kalypso Digital Consulting business will combine our FactoryTalk innovation suite with our automation technology to provide real-time monitoring and analytics for their manufacturing environment.
The second application is in the area of sustainability, where our software and automation technology will be used to help monitor water, air, gas, electricity and steam usage to develop real-time KPIs that further reduce their carbon footprint and drive quantifiable production outcomes. Kaylpso continues to play a very important role within Rockwell and is spearheading some of the most exciting digital transformation projects in all of manufacturing. Our customers are recognizing Rockwell's expanding capabilities to converge IT and OT and be a strong partner throughout the digital transformation journey. In fact, we announced yesterday that we are adding to Kalypso's capabilities with our acquisition of vada, which will strengthen and expand their supply chain solutions domain expertise.
This expertise, combined with our operations management software, and that of our partners, drives great outcomes for our customers. We are very excited to be expanding our presence in the connected supply chain since it is such a critical high-growth area.
We also accelerated our FactoryTalk SaaS offering with the acquisition of Plex in September. The integration is going well, and we look forward to showcasing the entire FactoryTalk software offering, including Plex at our upcoming Investor Day on November 10 in Houston. We hope to see you there.
I'd also like to highlight the increasing traction we are seeing with our PTC partnership. Our sales force is seeing the number and size of engagements growing. The capabilities and versatility of the combined solution is a great way to win, with both existing customers and new ones all over the world. A number of the wins we saw this quarter were in diverse industries around the world. We're happy with this partnership and think it's a great part of our software portfolio.
Let's now turn to Slide 4, where I'll provide a few highlights of our Q4 end market performance. We had great performance in our Discrete Industry segment with roughly 15% sales growth. Within this industry segment, automotive sales grew about 15%, led by an increase in EV capital project activity, including a strategic win at Magna, one of the top Tier 1 auto manufacturers delivering EV content for GM and Ford. Semiconductor was strong, growing 20% off of a very good quarter last year. E-commerce performance was also exceptional with sales growing approximately 30% versus a strong prior year.
Turning now to our hybrid Industry segment. The verticals in this segment also had a terrific quarter. Food and beverage grew about 15%, led by strong greenfield and brownfield project opportunities in North America and EMEA as well as strong double-digit OEM demand. Life sciences grew over 15% in Q4, and remains one of our top growth verticals. We see continued growth in the overall life sciences market and evidence that we are taking market share. Once again, our fastest-growing vertical in the hybrid segment was tire, which was up about 35% in the quarter. Process markets grew over 10%, with strong sequential and year-over-year growth in oil and gas, especially in our Sensia JV. In summary, we are clearly seeing very strong growth across discrete and high segments as well as improving oil and gas trends.
Turning now to Slide 5 and our Q4 organic regional sales performance. North America organic sales grew by 16% versus the prior year with strong double-digit growth across all 3 industry segments. EMEA sales increased 7%, driven by strength in food and beverage, tire and metals. Sales in the Asia Pacific region grew 12%, with broad-based growth led by EV, semiconductor and mining. In China, we saw double-digit growth, driven by strength in mining, life sciences, tire and EV. 
Let's now turn to Slide 6 to review highlights of fiscal '21. Record orders of $8.2 billion grew 26%. Reported sales grew 11%, even with supply chain constraints. Organic sales grew almost 7%. IS/CS revenue exceeded $500 million at year-end and grew double digits organically. Adjusted EPS grew 20%, and we, once again, generated significant cash flow due to our very profitable financial framework, strong focus on productivity and financial discipline.
At the same time, we made significant investments in our future to accelerate profitable growth. That included organic investments as well as inorganic investments. In fiscal '21, we accelerated funding of software development projects and deployed approximately $2.5 billion towards inorganic investments. At the same time, we returned to $800 million back to shareowners in the form of dividends and buybacks.
Turning to Slide 7. You can see how these investments and our strong order momentum and backlog are helping to accelerate our top line performance heading into fiscal '22. Our new fiscal '22 outlook expects total reported sales growth of 17.5%, including 15.5% organic growth versus the prior year. These projections take into account our latest view of supply chain constraints. We have the people, supplier commitments and plant capacity to support this growth, but we will no doubt need to continue to manage new challenges as they emerge in this highly dynamic environment.
We expect double-digit growth in both core automation as well as Information Solutions and Connected Services. Acquisitions are expected to contribute 2 points of profitable growth. We are increasing our margin expectations to 21.5%, up 150 basis points over the prior year. Our new adjusted EPS target of $10.80, at the midpoint of the range, represents about 15% growth compared to the prior year.
I should add that we expect another year of double-digit annual recurring revenue growth, including our recent Plex acquisition, which adds approximately $170 million to our ARR totals in fiscal '22.
A more detailed view into our outlook by end market is found on Slide 8. I will go into the details on this slide, but as you can see, we continue to expect broad-based organic sales growth in fiscal '22.
With that, let me now turn it over to Nick, who will elaborate on our fiscal '21 results and financial outlook for fiscal '22. Nick?"

I'll start on Slide 9, fourth quarter key financial information. Fourth quarter reported sales were up 15% over last year. Q4 organic sales were up 12.6%, and acquisitions contributed 1 point to total growth. Currency translation increased sales by 1.5 percentage points.
Segment operating margin was 17.9%, in line with our expectations. The 230 basis point decline was primarily related to higher planned investment spend, the reversal of temporary pay actions and the restoration of incentive compensation, partially offset by the impact of higher sales.
Corporate & Other expense was $33 million. The year-over-year increase was from deal costs associated with the Plex acquisition. Adjusted EPS of $2.33 was better than expected and grew 21% versus the prior year. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide.
The adjusted effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was negative 3%, much lower than expected, compared to 15% in the prior year. The lower-than-expected rate was related to the cumulative impact of several onetime discrete items recognized in the current quarter.
Free cash flow performance was in line with our expectations. We generated $160 million of free cash flow in the quarter. The free cash flow generation includes higher levels of working capital in the current year to support our increasing revenue and build inventory in anticipation of the accelerated revenue levels in fiscal year '22.
One additional item not shown on the slide, we repurchased 200,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $61 million. For the full year, our share repurchases totaled $301 million, in line with our July guidance. On September 30, $552 million remained available under our repurchase authorization.
Slide 10 provides the sales and margin performance of our 3 operating segments. Organic sales of both Intelligent Devices and Software & Control were up double digits. Lifecycle Services organic sales were up sequentially and up 7% year-over-year, led by oil and gas, life sciences and food and beverage. All segments saw strong double-digit growth in orders.
Compared to last year, Intelligent Devices margins were up 100 basis points on higher sales. This segment did see higher input costs both year-over-year and sequentially. However, these costs were largely offset by price. Segment margins for the Software & Control segment declined 330 basis points compared to last year, with higher planned investment spend, partially offset by higher organic sales. This segment benefited from positive price cost in the quarter.
Lifecycle Services segment margin was 8.1% and declined 820 basis points driven by the reversal of temporary pay actions, the reinstatement of incentive compensation as well as unfavorable mix, partially offset by higher sales.
The next slide, 11, provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q4 fiscal '20 to Q4 fiscal '21. As you can see, core performance was up about $0.70 on a 12.6% organic sales increase. Approximately $0.10 was related to nonrecurring accelerated investments that we announced earlier this year. These investments are mostly in our Software & Control segment.
The reversal of temporary pay actions and restoration of incentive compensation contributed negative $0.45. Acquisitions were a $0.15 headwind due to the deal costs associated with the Plex acquisition. As previously noted, our lower adjusted effective tax rate contributed $0.40.
Slide 12 provides a walk from our Q4 midpoint in our July guidance to our actual Q4 adjusted EPS results. We usually don't provide this information, but I wanted to show how the quarter played out relative to the midpoint of what we had guided back in July.
The unforeseen impact of the Delta variants in Southeast Asia added incremental pressure to the supply chain, but the impact of the volume miss of $0.40 was mitigated to lower incentive compensation, further productivity and a favorable mix, all which contributed $0.35. As previously noted, a more favorable tax rate benefited our EPS versus guidance by $0.25. 
Moving to Slide 13, product order trends. This slide shows our average daily order trends for our products, which includes our software portfolio. As a reminder, the trends shown here account for about 2/3 of our overall sales. Order intake was broad-based and improved sequentially for the fifth consecutive quarter. Q4 product order levels grew at about 40% versus the prior year and are well above pre-pandemic levels as customers are increasingly interested in investing in our core automation and software, both of which are essential to drive the outcomes that come from digital transformation.
Slide 14 provides key financial information for the full year fiscal '21. Reported sales grew 10.5%, including over 1 point coming from acquisitions. Organic sales were up 6.7%, led by double-digit growth in our hybrid and discrete end markets and improving process verticals. Full year segment margins remained at about 20%, including close to $30 million of onetime accelerated investments, mostly in our Software & Control segment. R&D expense was up 14% compared to fiscal '20, and R&D as a percent of sales increased further to 6% of sales in fiscal '21.
Our core automation, which excludes the impact -- excuse me, our core conversion, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, currency and our accelerated onetime investments, was 34%. Corporate & Other was up just over $20 million, mostly related to acquisition costs associated with the Plex acquisition. Adjusted EPS was up 20%. A detailed year-over-year adjusted EPS walk can be found in the appendix for your reference.
Free cash flow performance remained strong and was in line with our July expectations. Free cash flow conversion was 103% of adjusted income. Finally, ROIC remained well above our target of over 20%. 
For the year, we deployed about $3.3 billion of capital towards acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases in fiscal '21. Our capital structure and liquidity remains strong.
Let's move on to the next slide, 15, guidance for fiscal '22. As Blake mentioned, we are expecting sales of about $8.2 billion in fiscal '22, up 17.5% at the midpoint of the range. We expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 14% to 17% and about 15.5% at the midpoint of our range. This outlook includes our latest assumptions on supply chain constraints.
We expect full year segment operating margins to be about 21.5%. We expect positive price/cost for the full year from the additional price increase we implemented this month. At the midpoint of our guidance, assumes full year core earnings conversion of between 30% and 35%, we believe we are in the early stages of a cycle of sustained growth and are making investments to fuel this growth in '22 and beyond. Our fiscal '22 segment margin and core conversion outlook includes our plan to increase R&D and other growth-related investments by double digits.
We expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 17%. We do not anticipate any material discrete items to impact tax in fiscal '22. This rate is under current tax law. Should tax laws change, we would provide an updated outlook with the impacts from these changes.
Our adjusted EPS guidance is $10.50 to $11.10. This compares to fiscal '21 adjusted EPS of $9.43. At the midpoint of the range, this represents 15% adjusted EPS growth. I will cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS walk on the next page.
From a calendarization viewpoint, based on our current supply chain availability, we expect our first quarter sales to be relatively flat compared to our Q4 of fiscal '21. Following the first quarter, we expect sequential sales to improve over the balance of the year. We expect segment margins and the adjusted EPS to decline sequentially in Q1 and then improve throughout the year in line with our sales volume and the timing of price increases. We anticipate recent price increases to having more substantial benefit in subsequent quarters given the timing of when customer agreements are renewed throughout the year.
Also as a reminder, fiscal '21 Q1 included a nonrecurring $0.45 gain related to the settlement of a legal matter. Finally, we expect full year fiscal '22 free cash flow conversion of about 90% of adjusted income. This reflects a $155 million bonus payout for the fiscal '21 performance, $165 million of capital expenditures and funding higher levels of working capital to support higher sales. Our working capital is targeted to be aligned with our historic amount of about 12% of sales. 
A few comments -- additional comments on fiscal '22 guidance. Corporate & Other expense is expected to be around $125 million. Net interest expense for fiscal '22 is expected to be about $115 million. And finally, we're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of about 117.5 million shares.
The next slide, 16, provides the adjusted EPS walk from fiscal '21 to fiscal '22 guidance at the midpoint. Moving from left to right, core performance is expected to contribute $2.15. This includes the benefit of higher organic sales. We anticipate price realization will exceed input cost inflation by about $0.10. Our pricing philosophy is built on the high value that we bring our customers. In light of increasing input costs, we have taken several price adjustments this year to mitigate, and we are prepared to take additional price actions as needed.
The removal of the onetime accelerated investments made in fiscal year '21 will be about a $0.20 benefit. The onetime gain from a legal matter that was settled in the prior year is a $0.45 headwind. Plex will be a $0.15 tailwind in fiscal '22, including the impact of incremental interest. We have included further information showing the impact of Plex in both fiscal '21 and fiscal '22 in our appendix. No real significant changes to what we showed in July. We expect about a $0.05 impact coming from share dilution, and the higher tax rate is expected to be about a $0.75 headwind. 
Moving on to the next slide, 17, I'll make a few comments on our capital deployment framework. Our long-term capital deployment priorities remain the same. Our first priority is organic growth. After that, we focus capital deployment on inorganic activities. And then we focus on capital returns to shareholders, through our dividends and then share repurchases.
In addition to our organic and inorganic investments, our capital deployment plans for fiscal '22 include a focus on delevering, dividends of about $520 million and share repurchases of $100 million.
In summary, our guidance assumes a combination of order and backlog growth that drives 15.5% organic sales at the midpoint and reaches the total sales of over $8 billion. We continue to offset inflationary pressures through additional price actions yielding segment margins of 21.5%. We expect adjusted EPS growth of 15% and continued strong free cash flow.
With that, I'll turn it over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start the Q&A."

Like when you think about kind of the issue here with not just labor, materials and kind of cadencing projects, I mean it seems like every day we see some sort of multibillion-dollar announcement.

So I know your guide for fiscal 1Q is relatively conservative, but you have things snapping back right after that. What are your customers saying, at least, about their ability or what they think their ability to, at least, get projects done on time today looks like?"

And our investments, I think, are broadly indicative of what a lot of customers in different industries are doing. They're looking to make sure that they have the capacity to meet the current demand but also looking to get in place the capacity punch new lines of business and find new ways to win, and that's language that we've used, but we're hearing that from a lot of our customers as well.
So in some cases, it's just meeting the capacity demands. When we look at semiconductor, and when we look at life sciences in some of these areas, it's to meet current capacity in well-known areas. In other cases, people are looking to launch new lines of business with EV probably being the best known of that. They're very eager to take delivery of our products.
And one of the things that we have is the intimacy through our own salespeople as well as through our distribution of line of sight to these projects that are driving the demand and when they're needed. So we're not just guessing when they might need these products, we know what projects they're going into and when those projects are expected to start.
To be sure, there's certainly some delays in those projects that our customers are seeing, but they're trying to get these -- this capacity up and running just as soon as possible."

And -- so we're currently looking at an ARR of over 8% of the company's total, and we're continuing on that path.
If you think about the main elements of ARR in the company, it starts with software, software subscriptions, software delivered as a service and the associated technical support which is also delivered as a contract either bundled with the software or as a separate subscription or software that's still being sold as a perpetual license 
But we also have some interesting additional areas, cyber security infrastructure as a service. So our industrial data center that comes its hardware with the software and the services bundle to be able to monitor network traffic on-premise has been a great offering that we've had. It's a good business in its own right, and it also pulls through a lot of additional opportunities because it's a different set of decision makers.
So those are really the primary areas, and we continue to look to expand with the opening of our new software this year to be able to offer additional services that are bought as a subscription as we develop and release organically developed software that's sold as a service that's running in the cloud. I'm very happy with the robust outlook for growth of existing offerings plus new product introductions, a number of which you'll see next week at Automation Fair."

So we do believe, and we're seeing this into October. We continue to see strong demand coming from customers as some of these secular tailwinds that we've talked about, and you pick the industry, are investing, whether it's in transportation or food and beverage, life sciences. Chemical is expected to have decent growth in the coming year for building chemicals and packaging chemicals.
So you can see it from a variety of places. And so we're very optimistic about continued order growth in the year, particularly because we're talking to customers about new things, new capabilities that 24, 36 months ago, we didn't have in our portfolio. But there's a pretty significant expansion of what we can talk to customers about in all 3 of our business segments."

And we expect over multiple years EV and associated battery are going to be a strong driver of growth for us.
And that's around the world. I mean you look at the wins that we're getting in China associated with battery and EV. And it's clearly a calling card for us. We look at the wins, the opportunities that we have with Plex in the tier providers. All of these things, I think, are positive for us."

First of all, our traditional products that are controlling the motion of a more traditional motor, we have some very strong products there and they're fit in an overall integrated control and information architecture are doing very well. We had some product releases of organically developed products last year that get to the more price-sensitive markets like China, and we've seen some good uptick in our kinetics products there.
But an area that we've talked, especially about in the last few quarters, is Independent Cart Technology. And so it's linear motion control and due to its ability to save space on machinery acceleration and deceleration rates, the integration as part -- a fundamental part of the machinery really gives us a very differentiated offering in a variety of industries around the world. So it can be used in power transmission in vehicles. It can be used in tire building, in packaging, or food and beverage and life sciences. There's even some interesting applications that we're working on in mining.
And so it's very versatile set of technology. We bought 2 small companies to get into that to complement actually a technology we've had for many years, and then we'll continue to invest and build it into the overall automation architecture. So we're very happy with the growth that we're seeing there, which continues at strong double digits."

But one of the real excitement for a big company like Rockwell in a cloud-based solution is the ease of implementation for the same reasons that small- and medium-sized businesses like it because they may not have an IT department to be able to manage a big fleet of computers in their plants.
The ability to have a cloud-based approach is exciting when we make new acquisitions. When we open more agile plants around the world, the heavy lift that would come with more traditional systems may not be what's most appropriate.
On the other hand, we're going to continue to do well with our on-prem MES offering because you have a lot of companies, particularly those in regulated industries that cannot change quickly.

We saw another quarter of exceptional demand across all 3 business segments. Total orders surpassed $2.2 billion and grew 40% over the prior year, reflecting a very strong demand pipeline across our portfolio of core automation and digital transformation solutions. Total revenue of over $1.8 billion grew 15%, with additional sales that shifted into fiscal '22 due to supply chain headwinds.  
Organic sales grew 13% versus prior year. We had very strong growth in core automation and Information Solutions and Connected Services grew double digits in both orders and revenue. This performance was led by strong demand for software and cybersecurity services.  
Turning to ARR. We continue to make significant progress to drive recurring revenue. Our ARR grew organically by over 18%. And including our recent acquisition of Plex, now accounts for over 8% of total sales. Segment margin of 18% came in line with our expectations with the execution of planned investments in Q4.  
I'll now comment on our top line performance by business segment. Intelligent Devices organic sales increased 15% versus prior year, even with significant headwinds from supply chain. From the orders perspective, this is the fourth consecutive quarter of record order intake in this segment with orders 30% above fiscal 2019 levels. We continue to see significant strength across the automation portfolio and share gains, particularly evident in motion, led by our independent cart technology. 
Software & Control organic sales grew 14%, led by strong demand across the segment, including double-digit growth in Logix. Orders grew approximately 50% year-over-year, once again showing great momentum across the software control, visualization and network portfolios.  
In Lifecycle Services, organic sales increased 7% versus the prior year and increased 2% sequentially even with some projects delayed as a result of component availability. Lifecycle Services book-to-bill of 1.09 was well above seasonal Q4 levels. Total company backlog of $2.9 billion grew by over 80% year-over-year. Over 40% of backlog is related to our Lifecycle Services business. 
Turning to Information Solutions and Connected Services, which represent many of Rockwell's newest digital revenue streams. We had another great quarter. Recent orders included a number of meaningful software and infrastructure as a service wins. One of the more notable wins in the quarter was with Ardagh Group, one of the world's largest sustainable packaging companies. The company had placed a $1 million order for fixed software in Q3 to reduce unplanned downtime. Ardagh, like a lot of manufacturers, is trying to respond to a sharp increase in demand. By Q4, as the relationship developed, we pulled through an additional $4 million purchase of core automation products showcasing the tremendous synergy resulting from our new software capabilities and intelligent devices. With their ARR growing 45% and over 470 new fixed customers added in just the last 9 months, I'm very happy with the contributions Fiix has been able to make to our overall business. 
We also had a great win with one of the world's largest food and beverage companies in 2 key application areas. The first win is in the area of predictive analytics, where our Kalypso Digital Consulting business will combine our FactoryTalk innovation suite with our automation technology to provide real-time monitoring and analytics for their manufacturing environment.  
The second application is in the area of sustainability, where our software and automation technology will be used to help monitor water, air, gas, electricity and steam usage to develop real-time KPIs that further reduce their carbon footprint and drive quantifiable production outcomes. 
Kalypso continues to play a very important role within Rockwell and is spearheading some of the most exciting digital transformation projects in all of manufacturing. Our customers are recognizing Rockwell's expanding capabilities to converge IT and OT and be a strong partner throughout the digital transformation journey. In fact, we announced yesterday that we are adding to Kalypso's capabilities with our acquisition of AVATA, which will strengthen and expand their supply chain solutions domain expertise.  
This expertise, combined with our operations management software, and that of our partners, drives great outcomes for our customers. We are very excited to be expanding our presence in the connected supply chain since it is such a critical high-growth area.  
We also accelerated our FactoryTalk SaaS offering with the acquisition of Plex in September. The integration is going well, and we look forward to showcasing the entire FactoryTalk software offering, including Plex at our upcoming Investor Day on November 10 in Houston. We hope to see you there.  
I'd also like to highlight the increasing traction we are seeing with our PTC partnership. Our sales force is seeing the number and size of engagements growing. The capabilities and versatility of the combined solution is a great way to win, with both existing customers and new ones all over the world. A number of the wins we saw this quarter were in diverse industries around the world. We're happy with this partnership and think it's a great part of our software portfolio.  
Let's now turn to Slide 4, where I'll provide a few highlights of our Q4 end market performance. We had great performance in our Discrete Industry segment with roughly 15% sales growth. Within this industry segment, automotive sales grew about 15%, led by an increase in EV capital project activity, including a strategic win at Magna, one of the top Tier 1 auto manufacturers delivering EV content for GM and Ford. Semiconductor was strong, growing 20% off of a very good quarter last year. E-commerce performance was also exceptional with sales growing approximately 30% versus a strong prior year.  
Turning now to our Hybrid Industry segment. The verticals in this segment also had a terrific quarter. Food and beverage grew about 15%, led by strong greenfield and brownfield project opportunities in North America and EMEA as well as strong double-digit OEM demand. 
Life sciences grew over 15% in Q4, and remains one of our top growth verticals. We see continued growth in the overall life sciences market and evidence that we are taking market share. Once again, our fastest-growing vertical in the Hybrid segment was tire, which was up about 35% in the quarter. Process markets grew over 10%, with strong sequential and year-over-year growth in oil and gas, especially in our Sensia JV.  
In summary, we are clearly seeing very strong growth across Discrete and Hybrid segments as well as improving oil and gas trends.  
Turning now to Slide 5 and our Q4 organic regional sales performance. North America organic sales grew by 16% versus the prior year with strong double-digit growth across all 3 industry segments. EMEA sales increased 7%, driven by strength in food and beverage, tire and metals. 
Sales in the Asia Pacific region grew 12%, with broad-based growth led by EV, semiconductor and mining. In China, we saw double-digit growth, driven by strength in mining, life sciences, tire and EV.  
Let's now turn to Slide 6 to review highlights of fiscal '21. Record orders of $8.2 billion grew 26%. Reported sales grew 11%, even with supply chain constraints. Organic sales grew almost 7%. IS/CS revenue exceeded $500 million at year-end and grew double digits organically. Adjusted EPS grew 20%, and we, once again, generated significant cash flow due to our very profitable financial framework, strong focus on productivity and financial discipline.  
At the same time, we made significant investments in our future to accelerate profitable growth. That included organic investments as well as inorganic investments. In fiscal '21, we accelerated funding of software development projects and deployed approximately $2.5 billion towards inorganic investments. At the same time, we returned to $800 million back to shareowners in the form of dividends and buybacks.  
Turning to Slide 7. You can see how these investments and our strong order momentum and backlog are helping to accelerate our top line performance heading into fiscal '22. Our new fiscal '22 outlook expects total reported sales growth of 17.5%, including 15.5% organic growth versus the prior year. These projections take into account our latest view of supply chain constraints. We have the people, supplier commitments and plant capacity to support this growth, but we will no doubt need to continue to manage new challenges as they emerge in this highly dynamic environment.  
We expect double-digit growth in both core automation as well as Information Solutions and Connected Services. Acquisitions are expected to contribute 2 points of profitable growth. We are increasing our margin expectations to 21.5%, up 150 basis points over the prior year. Our new adjusted EPS target of $10.80, at the midpoint of the range, represents about 15% growth compared to the prior year.  
I should add that we expect another year of double-digit annual recurring revenue growth, including our recent Plex acquisition, which adds approximately $170 million to our ARR totals in fiscal '22.  
A more detailed view into our outlook by end market is found on Slide 8. I will go into the details on this slide, but as you can see, we continue to expect broad-based organic sales growth in fiscal '22.  
With that, let me now turn it over to Nick, who will elaborate on our fiscal '21 results and financial outlook for fiscal '22. Nick?"

I'll start on Slide 9, fourth quarter key financial information. Fourth quarter reported sales were up 15% over last year. Q4 organic sales were up 12.6%, and acquisitions contributed 1 point to total growth. Currency translation increased sales by 1.5 percentage points.  
Segment operating margin was 17.9%, in line with our expectations. The 230 basis point decline was primarily related to higher plant investment spend, the reversal of temporary pay actions and the restoration of incentive compensation partially offset by the impact of higher sales.
Corporate & Other expense was $33 million. The year-over-year increase was from deal costs associated with the Plex acquisition. Adjusted EPS of $2.33 was better than expected and grew 21% versus the prior year. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide.  
The adjusted effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was negative 3%, much lower than expected, compared to 15% in the prior year. The lower-than-expected rate was related to the cumulative impact of several onetime discrete items recognized in the current quarter.  
Free cash flow performance was in line with our expectations. We generated $160 million of free cash flow in the quarter. The free cash flow generation includes higher levels of working capital in the current year to support our increasing revenue and build inventory in anticipation of the accelerated revenue levels in fiscal year '22.  
One additional item not shown on the slide, we repurchased 200,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $61 million. For the full year, our share repurchases totaled $301 million, in line with our July guidance. On September 30, $552 million remained available under our repurchase authorization.  
Slide 10 provides the sales and margin performance of our 3 operating segments. Organic sales of both Intelligent Devices and Software & Control were up double digits. Lifecycle Services organic sales were up sequentially and up 7% year-over-year, led by oil and gas, life sciences and food and beverage. All segments saw strong double-digit growth in orders.  
Compared to last year, Intelligent Devices margins were up 100 basis points on higher sales. This segment did see higher input costs both year-over-year and sequentially. However, these costs were largely offset by price. Segment margins for the Software & Control segment declined 330 basis points compared to last year, with higher planned investment spend, partially offset by higher organic sales. This segment benefited from positive price cost in the quarter.  
Lifecycle Services segment margin was 8.1% and declined 820 basis points driven by the reversal of temporary pay actions, the reinstatement of incentive compensation as well as unfavorable mix, partially offset by higher sales.  
The next slide, 11, provides the adjusted EPS Walk from Q4 fiscal '20 to Q4 fiscal '21. As you can see, core performance was up about $0.70 on a 12.6% organic sales increase. Approximately $0.10 was related to nonrecurring accelerated investments that we announced earlier this year. These investments are mostly in our Software & Control segment.  
The reversal of temporary pay actions and restoration of incentive compensation contributed negative $0.45. Acquisitions were a $0.15 headwind due to the deal costs associated with the Plex acquisition. As previously noted, our lower adjusted effective tax rate contributed $0.40. 
Slide 12 provides a walk from our Q4 midpoint in our July guidance to our actual Q4 adjusted EPS results. We usually don't provide this information, but I wanted to show how the quarter played out relative to the midpoint of what we had guided back in July.  
The unforeseen impact of the Delta variants in Southeast Asia added incremental pressure to the supply chain, but the impact of the volume miss of $0.40 was mitigated to lower incentive compensation, further productivity and a favorable mix, all of which contributed $0.35. As previously noted, a more favorable tax rate benefited our EPS versus guidance by $0.25.  
Moving to Slide 13, product order trends. This slide shows our average daily order trends for our products, which includes our software portfolio. As a reminder, the trends shown here account for about 2/3 of our overall sales. Order intake was broad-based and improved sequentially for the fifth consecutive quarter. Q4 product order levels grew at about 40% versus the prior year and are well above pre-pandemic levels as customers are increasingly interested in investing in our core automation and software, both of which are essential to drive the outcomes that come from digital transformation.  
Slide 14 provides key financial information for the full year fiscal '21. Reported sales grew 10.5%, including over 1 point coming from acquisitions. Organic sales were up 6.7%, led by double-digit growth in our Hybrid and Discrete end markets and improving process verticals. Full year segment margins remained at about 20%, including close to $30 million of onetime accelerated investments, mostly in our Software & Control segment. R&D expense was up 14% compared to fiscal '20, and R&D as a percent of sales increased further to 6% of sales in fiscal '21.  
Our core automation, which excludes the impact -- excuse me, our core conversion, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, currency and our accelerated onetime investments, was 34%. Corporate & Other was up just over $20 million, mostly related to acquisition costs associated with the Plex acquisition. Adjusted EPS was up 20%. A detailed year-over-year adjusted EPS Walk can be found in the appendix for your reference.  
Free cash flow performance remained strong and was in line with our July expectations. Free cash flow conversion was 103% of adjusted income. Finally, ROIC remained well above our target of over 20%. 
For the year, we deployed about $3.3 billion of capital towards acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases in fiscal '21. Our capital structure and liquidity remains strong.  
Let's move on to the next slide, 15, guidance for fiscal '22. As Blake mentioned, we are expecting sales of about $8.2 billion in fiscal '22, up 17.5% at the midpoint of the range. We expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 14% to 17% and about 15.5% at the midpoint of our range. This outlook includes our latest assumptions on supply chain constraints.  
We expect full year segment operating margins to be about 21.5%. We expect positive price/cost for the full year from the additional price increase we implemented this month. At the midpoint of our guidance, assumes full year core earnings conversion of between 30% and 35%. We believe we are in the early stages of a cycle of sustained growth and are making investments to fuel this growth in '22 and beyond. Our fiscal '22 segment margin and core conversion outlook includes our plan to increase R&D and other growth-related investments by double digits.  
We expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 17%. We do not anticipate any material discrete items to impact tax in fiscal '22. This rate is under current tax law. Should tax laws change, we would provide an updated outlook with the impacts from these changes.  
Our adjusted EPS guidance is $10.50 to $11.10. This compares to fiscal '21 adjusted EPS of $9.43. At the midpoint of the range, this represents 15% adjusted EPS growth. I will cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS Walk on the next page.  
From a calendarization viewpoint, based on our current supply chain availability, we expect our first quarter sales to be relatively flat compared to our Q4 of fiscal '21. Following the first quarter, we expect sequential sales to improve over the balance of the year. We expect segment margins and the adjusted EPS to decline sequentially in Q1 and then improve throughout the year in line with our sales volume and the timing of price increases. We anticipate recent price increases to having more substantial benefit in subsequent quarters given the timing of when customer agreements are renewed throughout the year.  
Also as a reminder, fiscal '21 Q1 included a nonrecurring $0.45 gain related to the settlement of a legal matter. Finally, we expect full year fiscal '22 free cash flow conversion of about 90% of adjusted income. This reflects a $155 million bonus payout for the fiscal '21 performance, $165 million of capital expenditures and funding higher levels of working capital to support higher sales. Our working capital is targeted to be aligned with our historic amount of about 12% of sales.  
A few comments -- additional comments on fiscal '22 guidance. Corporate & Other expense is expected to be around $125 million. Net interest expense for fiscal '22 is expected to be about $115 million. And finally, we're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of about 117.5 million shares.  
The next slide, 16, provides the adjusted EPS Walk from fiscal '21 to fiscal '22 guidance at the midpoint. Moving from left to right, core performance is expected to contribute $2.15. This includes the benefit of higher organic sales. We anticipate price realization will exceed input cost inflation by about $0.10. Our pricing philosophy is built on the high value that we bring our customers. In light of increasing input costs, we have taken several price adjustments this year to mitigate, and we are prepared to take additional price actions as needed.  
The removal of the onetime accelerated investments made in fiscal year '21 will be about a $0.20 benefit. The onetime gain from a legal matter that was settled in the prior year is a $0.45 headwind. Plex will be a $0.15 tailwind in fiscal '22, including the impact of incremental interest. We have included further information showing the impact of Plex in both fiscal '21 and fiscal '22 in our appendix. No real significant changes to what we showed in July. We expect about a $0.05 impact coming from share dilution, and the higher tax rate is expected to be about a $0.75 headwind.  
Moving on to the next slide, 17, I'll make a few comments on our capital deployment framework. Our long-term capital deployment priorities remain the same. Our first priority is organic growth. After that, we focus capital deployment on inorganic activities. And then we focus on capital returns to shareholders, through our dividends and then share repurchases.  
In addition to our organic and inorganic investments, our capital deployment plans for fiscal '22 include a focus on delevering, dividends of about $520 million and share repurchases of $100 million.  
In summary, our guidance assumes a combination of order and backlog growth that drives 15.5% organic sales at the midpoint and reaches the total sales of over $8 billion. We continue to offset inflationary pressures through additional price actions yielding segment margins of 21.5%. We expect adjusted EPS growth of 15% and continued strong free cash flow.  
With that, I'll turn it over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start the Q&A."

So in some cases, it's just meeting the capacity demands. When we look at semiconductor, and when we look at life sciences in some of these areas, it's to meet current capacity in well-known areas. In other cases, people are looking to launch new lines of business with EV probably being the best known of that. They're very eager to take delivery of our products. And one of the things that we have is the intimacy through our own salespeople as well as through our distribution of line of sight to these projects that are driving the demand and when they're needed. So we're not just guessing when they might need these products, we know what projects they're going into and when those projects are expected to start.  
To be sure, there's certainly some delays in those projects that our customers are seeing, but they're trying to get these -- this capacity up and running just as soon as possible."

So pricing can be a real science with a lot of analytics. And I think we've significantly upgraded the tools and the talent so that we can get price where the market bears that, but also where we can reserve the right to be selectively aggressive to win share.

And -- so we're currently looking at an ARR of over 8% of the company's total, and we're continuing on that path.  
If you think about the main elements of ARR in the company, it starts with software, software subscriptions, software delivered as a service and the associated technical support which is also delivered as a contract either bundled with the software or as a separate subscription or software that's still being sold as a perpetual license. 
But we also have some interesting additional areas, cybersecurity infrastructure as a service. So our industrial data center that comes its hardware with the software and the services bundle to be able to monitor network traffic on-premise has been a great offering that we've had. It's a good business in its own right, and it also pulls through a lot of additional opportunities because it's a different set of decision makers.  
So those are really the primary areas, and we continue to look to expand with the opening of our new software this year to be able to offer additional services that are bought as a subscription as we develop and release organically developed software that's sold as a service that's running in the cloud. I'm very happy with the robust outlook for growth of existing offerings plus new product introductions, a number of which you'll see next week at Automation Fair."

We had some product releases of organically developed products last year that get to the more price-sensitive markets like China, and we've seen some good uptick in our kinetics products there.  
But an area that we've talked, especially about in the last few quarters, is independent cart technology. And so it's linear motion control and due to its ability to save space on machinery acceleration and deceleration rates, the integration as part -- a fundamental part of the machinery really gives us a very differentiated offering in a variety of industries around the world. So it can be used in power transmission in vehicles. It can be used in tire building, in packaging, or food and beverage and life sciences. There's even some interesting applications that we're working on in mining.  
And so it's very versatile set of technology.
