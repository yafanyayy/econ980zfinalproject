As always, we have posted our earnings release and financial supplement to investors.aflac.com. This morning, we will be hearing remarks about the quarter and the year related to our operations in Japan and the United States amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. 
Dan Amos, Chairman and CEO of Aflac Incorporated, will begin with an overview of our operations in Japan and the U.S. Fred Crawford, President and COO of Aflac Incorporated, will then touch briefly on conditions in the fourth quarter and discuss key initiatives, including how we are navigating the pandemic. Max Brod√©n, Executive Vice President and CFO of Aflac Incorporated, will conclude our prepared remarks with a summary of fourth quarter financial results and current capital and liquidity. 
Members of our U.S. executive management team joining us for the Q&A segment of the call are: Teresa White, President of Aflac U.S.; Virgil Miller, President of Individual Benefits; Rich Williams, President of Group Benefits; Eric Kirsch, Global Chief Investment Officer and President of Aflac Global Investments; Al Riggieri, Global Chief Risk Officer and Chief Actuary; June Howard, Chief Accounting Officer; and Steve Beaver, CFO of Aflac U.S.. 
We are also joined by members of our executive management team in Tokyo at Aflac Life Insurance Japan. Charles Lake, Chairman and representative Director, President of Aflac International; Masatoshi Koide, President and Representative Director; Todd Daniels, Director and CFO; and Koji Ariyoshi, Director and Head of Sales and Marketing. 
Before we begin, some statements in this teleconference are forward-looking within the meaning of federal securities laws. Although we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate because they are prospective in nature. Actual results could differ materially from those we discuss today. We encourage you to look at our annual report on Form 10-K for some of the various risk factors that could materially impact our results. 
As I mentioned earlier, the earnings release is available on investors.aflac.com and includes reconciliations of certain non-U.S. GAAP measures. 
I'll now hand the call over to Dan. Dan?"

At this time last year, it would have been very difficult to foresee the gravity of what was soon to unfold for society and for the company due to COVID-19. I am proud of our employees, our sales distribution and Board of Directors for their decisive people-first initiatives we spearheaded early on in both the United States and Japan to protect our workforce and to be here for our policyholders throughout this trying time. We were able to reinforce our financial strength in operations as well as our distribution franchise with digital and virtual investments to the position of our company for the future growth. 
Adjusted earnings per diluted share, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, increased 10.8% in 2020, while benefiting from a lower effective tax rate. We were pleased with the results when you consider the pandemic pressure on revenues, accelerated investment in our core technological platforms and the initiatives to drive future earned premium growth and efficiency. Investing in growth and innovation will continue to be critical strategic focus this year. 
There is one central message that I've been emphasizing with our management team. It is imperative that we control the factors we have the ability to control. And what we don't have control over, we must monitor continually to be ready to adapt. Despite the fact that sales in both U.S. and Japan had been suppressed considerably due to the constraints of face-to-face opportunities, we did not sit still. We maintained forward motion as we absorbed accelerated investment in our platform while continuing strong earning performance. 
In 2020, Aflac Japan generated solid overall financial results with a stable profit margin of 21.2% and extremely strong premium persistency of 95.1%. The relaunch of our new cancer rider drove a sequential improvement in both cancer insurance and total sales in the fourth quarter. As a result, total sales were down 22.2% for the quarter and 36.2% for the year. 
In Japan, we introduced our new medical product in January, and even up against difficult comparisons of last January, pre -- that were pre-COVID sales, it is a positive launch, exceeding our expectations. We are encouraged by the reception of both the consumers and our sales force. While these sales results represent sequential improvements relative to last quarter, the effective reduced face-to-face activity are evident, and we continue to promote virtual sales. Our goal in Japan is to be the leading company for living in your own way. This is a declaration of how we tailor our products to fit the needs of customers during the different stages of their lives and reach them where they want to buy, through agencies, strategic alliance and banks. 
Now turning to Aflac U.S., we saw a stable profit margin of 19.3% amid a year of intense investments in the future of our business and the global pandemic conditions. However, this backdrop continues to noticeably impact our sales results in this segment as well, largely due to reduced face-to-face activity. As expected, we saw modest sequential sales improvement in the quarter, with a decrease of 27.2% for the quarter and 30.3% for the year. 
In the U.S., we continue to feel the impact of limited access at the work site, especially among our career agents who have historically relied upon face-to-face meetings to engage small business owners and their employees. However, we remain cautiously optimistic for continued modest sequential sales improvement, contingent upon the pace of the economic recovery, and as a result, expect to see a brighter second half of 2021. 
Fred is responsible for acquisitions, and he will cover that shortly. But while these acquisitions may not have an immediate effect on the top line, they better position Aflac for future long-term sales in the United States. 
As part of the VISION 2025 in the U.S., we seek to further develop a world where people are better prepared for unexpected health expenses. The need for the products we offer is a strong -- or stronger than ever has been. And at the same time, we know consumer habits and buying preferences have been evolving, and we are looking to reach them in ways other than the traditional media and outside the work site. This is part of the strategy to increase access, penetration and retention. 
Even while working remotely for the greater part of the year, we remained true to our culture and identity as a socially responsible company. We stepped up our engagement with our employees through virtual town meetings and weekly touch-base letters. Additionally, diversity continues to play an important role at Aflac, as it has for decades. I have always believed that in order to accomplish our goals and serve the community where we have a presence, we must surround ourselves with a group of people who bring different perspectives to the table. We have done that for years. 
At the end of 2020, nearly 50% of Aflac's U.S. employees were minorities. 66% were women. 23% of our U.S. senior officers were minorities and 30% were women. And then when you think of Aflac's Board of Directors, 36% were minorities and 36% were women. Diversity has always played an important role within ESG, and I've tasked Fred with executive oversight of our ESG efforts. He will provide greater detail on our 2021 key objectives. 
I've always said that the true test of strength is how one handles adversity. While pandemic conditions are ongoing, I'm pleased that 2020 confirms what we knew all along, and that is that Aflac is strong, adaptable and resilient. We strive to be where people want to purchase insurance, that applies to both Japan and the United States. In the past, this has meant meeting face-to-face with individuals to understand their situation, propose a solution and close the sale. However, the pandemic clearly demonstrates the need for virtual means. In other words, non face-to-face sales to reach potential customers and provide them with the protection that they need. Therefore, we have accelerated investments to enhance the tools available for our distribution in both countries. 
Related to capital deployment, we placed significant importance on continuing to achieve strong capital ratios in the United States and Japan on behalf of our policyholders and shareholders. When it comes to capital deployment, we pursue value creation through a balance of actions, including growth investments, stable dividend growth and disciplined tactical stock repurchase. 
It goes without saying that we treasure our record of dividend growth. The fourth quarter's declaration marked the 38th consecutive year of dividend increases. Additionally, the Board approved a first quarter dividend increase of 17.9%. Our dividend track record is supported by the strength of our capital and cash flows. At the same time, we remain tactical in our approach to share repurchase, buying back $1.5 billion of our shares in 2020. We have also focused on integrating the growth investments we have made in our platform. 
As always, we are working to achieve our earnings per share objectives while also ensuring we deliver on our promise to our policyholders. By doing so, we look to emerge from this period in a continued position of strength and leadership. 
I don't think it's coincidental that we've achieved our success while focusing on doing the right things for our policyholders, shareholders, employees, distribution channel, business partners and communities. In fact, I believe they go hand-in-hand. I'm proud of what we have accomplished in terms of both our social purpose and financial results, which have ultimately translated into strong, long-term shareholder return. 
Now let me turn the program over to Fred. Fred?"
250178,701104301,2191966,"Aflac Incorporated, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2021",2021-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Aflac Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Dan. I'm going to touch briefly on conditions in the fourth quarter with respect to the pandemic. I'll then provide an update on key initiatives in Japan and the U.S. Japan has experienced approximately 400,000 COVID-19 cases and 6,000 confir",1807,"Thank you, Dan. I'm going to touch briefly on conditions in the fourth quarter with respect to the pandemic. I'll then provide an update on key initiatives in Japan and the U.S. 
Japan has experienced approximately 400,000 COVID-19 cases and 6,000 confirmed deaths since inception of the virus. While quite low as compared to other developed countries and the U.S., these statistics have more than doubled since the end of the third quarter. Earlier this week, the government of Japan extended their state of emergency for Tokyo and 9 other prefectures through March 7. This action includes the suspension of domestic tourism campaign and entry of foreigners into Japan. We have responded with, again, moving more of our workforce to working from home. Unlike the state of emergency declared last year in the initial stages of the virus, government restrictions are more balanced with economic recovery considerations, and we have not prohibited face-to-face consultations and/or closed our sales shops. Meanwhile, prime Minister Suga has announced a goal of beginning vaccinations mid-February. 
Through the fourth quarter, Aflac Japan's COVID-19 impact totaled approximately 3,400 unique claimants with incurred claims totaling JPY 1 billion. We continue to experience a significant reduction in paid claims for medical conditions other than COVID-19 as Japan manages hospital capacity and discourages more routine visits. 
Despite the recent rise in infection rates in Japan, we continue to track well below our stress assumptions. As Dan outlined, sales have clearly been impacted. But when looking at policies in force, the impact of reduced sales on earned premium has largely been offset by improved persistency with the reduction in reported revenue driven primarily by paid-up policies. 
Finally, pandemic-related expenses in the quarter totaled JPY 1.8 billion. Which includes the rollout of virtual distribution tools, employee teleworking equipment and distribution support. 
Turning to the U.S. There are nearly 27 million COVID-19 cases and over 450,000 deaths, as reported by the CDC. For Aflac U.S., in 2020, COVID-19 claimants totaled 23,000 with incurred claims of approximately $71 million in the quarter and $128 million for all of 2020. 
We are now in a better position to back-test the correlation of U.S. rates of infection to paid claims in order to build an estimate for incurred claim reserves. It's fair to say this is still very difficult to estimate as IBNR often works from years of reliable data to establish trends. While our reserves assume elevated claims, we continue to see the length of stay in hospital and transition to ICU traveling below our expectations. 
We have seen limited impact to our reported persistency numbers. However, we believe this is in part attributed to the combination of reduced sales, where lapse rates tend to be much higher in the first year and the state of -- state executive orders requiring premium grace periods. Executive orders are still in place in 11 states as of the end of the quarter, with 5 states having open-ended expiration dates. We have reduced pressure on lapse rates through proactive work with our policyholders, including converting from payroll deduction to direct bill and encouraging a review of wellness benefits. 
Turning to key operating initiatives. 2020 was an important year in setting the stage for growth once we move clear of pandemic conditions. Beginning with Japan, after launching and promoting a simplified cancer writer in the fourth quarter, we successfully launched our refreshed medical product called EVER Prime in January. As Dan noted in his comments, it's early, and our associate channel is having to navigate pandemic conditions, but January medical sales are promising. 
Introduced in October of 2020, we have technology in place to allow agents to pivot from face-to-face to virtual sales and an entirely digital customer experience. True virtual sales in Japan is relatively limited. In addition, the majority of applications are still filed in paper form, although digital applications have been adopted in face-to-face consultations. Excluding traditional non face-to-face means of distributing products, like work site, direct mail and call center sales, we estimate only 2% to 3% of our sales are currently digital end-to-end. However, we understand some of our agencies has significantly adopted virtual tools to supplement face-to-face consultations. 
We have discussed our paperless initiative across all operations in Japan. This is a JPY 10 billion investment with approximately JPY 2.8 billion spent in the fourth quarter and JPY 4.8 billion spent in 2020. We are projecting another JPY 4.3 billion in spend planned for 2021. This investment has a 3-year payback and will reduce the production and circulation of over 80 million pieces of paper per year. 
In summary, we expect the combination of product development, improved pandemic conditions and the return of Japan Post to distributing Aflac cancer insurance will drive growth as we look towards the second half of 2021.
Turning to the U.S., we focused our efforts in 2020 on setting the table for 2021, including a national launch of Network Dental and Vision, completing our Group Benefit acquisition and standing up our new direct-to-consumer digital platform. 
On the operations side, we rolled out a new and upgraded enrollment platform called Everwell 2.0 in September, which requires time for full adoption and stabilizing the platform. 2020 was an important year to introduce digital tools, increase adoption rates and take on any corrective action before 2021. 
In addition, under Teresa White's leadership, we have reorganized the U.S., forming a group benefits and individual division. Rich Williams will now lead our group benefits division, which includes Aflac Voluntary Group, Aflac Network Dental and Vision, Argus, our Dental TPA, and our new Aflac Premier Life, Absence Management and Disability business. Virgil Miller will lead our Individual Benefits division, which includes Aflac's individually issued and small business-focused work site products and our new consumer markets business, targeting workers not at the traditional work site. Both divisions pull from shared service U.S. operating platforms. 
This new alignment provides focus for each division within the U.S. business segment and allows Aflac to offer tailored products and services for our career agency teams and broker partners based on the unique markets they serve. 
Like Japan, we have all the tools in place for agents to conduct business without a face-to-face meeting. However, most sales are being driven on a continuum of face-to-face and digital interaction. We estimate about 15% of our traditional individual sales are completed without some form of face-to-face interaction. This excludes digital direct-to-consumer, which is naturally non face-to-face. 
Turning to more specifics on our key growth initiatives. On January 12, we announced the national rollout of Aflac Dental and Vision. Our dental and vision products are now available in 40 states with more coming online throughout the year. This is a broad launch that is available to large and small companies and distributed through agents and brokers. 
In November, we closed on our Zurich Group Benefits acquisition. The new platform managed to contribute to sales in the quarter with $5 million in production. This is more of a turnkey launch, meaning products are filed, and we are open for business in 2021 under the Aflac brand. 
Finally, we officially launched our new digital direct-to-consumer platform in the first week of January. We offer critical illness, accident and cancer and are approved to sell all 3 products in approximately 30 states with more states and products coming online throughout the year. 
As highlighted during our investor conference, we are addressing expenses over 2 horizons. In 2020, we took actions to realize approximately $100 million of annualized run rate expense saves on a go-forward basis. Actions included restricting hiring, rationalizing distribution expenses and a voluntary separation plan that resulted in a 9% reduction to our U.S. workforce. Longer-term expense initiatives center on our Group division and the migration onto a new Administrative platform as well as integration of the Zurich Group Benefits business. 
As you are all aware, we have adopted a conservative buy-to-build acquisition strategy. The build efforts taken together impacted our expense ratio in the fourth quarter by 160 basis points and is expected to impact the 2021 ratio by approximately 180 basis points. 
Our global investments team remains focused on asset quality, monitoring economic conditions and sourcing new investment opportunities. Portfolio actions prior to and in the early days of the pandemic lowered our exposure to prolonged economic weakness, and we ended 2020 with a modest amount of asset losses. We continue to watch closely our middle-market loan and traditional real estate -- transitional real estate portfolios. While we have seen ratings downgrades, our portfolios are resilient, consisting of diversified first lien loans, conservatively underwritten to high-quality borrowers.
We have further refined our approach to managing the unhedged dollars in Japan, both lowering our hedge ratio and maintaining our out of the money protection for extreme moves in foreign exchange. These unhedged dollars provide diversification and income benefits as well as lowering our enterprise exposure to the yen.
As has been our practice, for 2021, we have locked in lower hedge costs with floating rate loan yields benefiting from LIBOR floors. 
Finally, we are pleased with the performance of our strategic investment and alliance with Varagon Capital Partners during 2020, contributing to corporate investment income. We are working to establish even more strategic alliances that leverages the capabilities of our asset management subsidiary and further the performance of our insurance segments.
As commented on by Dan, we have refocused our efforts in key areas to drive tangible ESG incitatives in 2021. We are focused on the following. 
Building off our published ESG investment policy, Aflac Global Investments is advancing a responsible investing framework that includes the establishment of a core ESG team and formal governance process. We initiated work with third-party experts to measure, draft and eventually disclose a formal plan to be carbon-neutral on or before 2040 and carbon net 0 emissions on or before 2050. 
We pledged to continue hitting key milestones on our important women in leadership initiative as part of the diversity and inclusion in Japan and targeting 30% of leadership positions in Japan filled by women by 2025. In the U.S., we seek to advance our already strong diversity statistics by broadening our influence through identifying and providing capital to organizations that advance diversity and inclusion as well as social justice and economic mobility. 
Finally, we pledged to advance reporting and disclosure framework in compliance with SASB and TCFD reporting standards. We'll provide further disclosures on ESG initiatives in our proxy material and on our ESG hub, esg.aflac.com. 
Wrapping up my comments, we believe the investments made in the past 2 years and accelerated during the pandemic position us for future growth and efficiency in the face of what we believe to be temporary weakness in sales and earned premium. 
I'll now pass on to Max to discuss financial performance in more detail. Max?"
250178,701104301,2191966,"Aflac Incorporated, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2021",2021-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Aflac Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Fred. We finished the year with stable fourth quarter earnings in a year marked by significant mortality and morbidity events as well as continued low interest rates. For the quarter, adjusted earnings per share increased 3.9% to $1.07. And the",1220,"Thank you, Fred. We finished the year with stable fourth quarter earnings in a year marked by significant mortality and morbidity events as well as continued low interest rates. For the quarter, adjusted earnings per share increased 3.9% to $1.07. And the full year EPS was a record $4.96, up 11.7% year-over-year. Adjusted book value per share, including foreign currency translation gains and losses, grew 19.1%, both for the quarter and full year. The adjusted ROE, excluding the foreign currency impact, was 12.1% in the fourth quarter and a respectable 15.1% for the full year, a material spread to our cost of capital. 
This quarter benefited from favorable marks on our alternative investment portfolio to the amount of $47 million pretax, above our long-term return expectations. A very good outcome on our building alternatives portfolio. We also booked a severance charge associated with our previously announced voluntary separation program, or VSP, in our U.S. and corporate segments, totaling pretax, $43 million, included in adjusted earnings. 
Turning to our Japan segment. Total earned premium for the quarter declined 3.5%, reflecting mainly first sector policies paid-up impacts, while earned premium for our third sector products was down 1.9%. For the full year, total earned premium was down 2.8%, while total policies in force declined by a lesser rate at 1.2%. As policies in force are not impacted by the paid-up status, it tends to serve as a better indicator of the growth of the underlying business. Persistency has been on a positive trajectory, inched up slightly sequentially to 95.1%, up 70 basis points year-over-year. 
Japan's total benefit ratio came in at 68.9% for the quarter, down 110 basis points year-over-year. And the third sector benefit ratio was 58.6%, down 150 basis points year-over-year. The main driver for the lower benefit ratio was a higher-than-normal IBNR release due to a sustained lower paid claims environment in 2020. We estimate that this lowered the benefit ratio by roughly 130 basis points compared to what we would deem a normal IBNR release to be. 
For the full year, the reported total benefit ratio was 69.9%, up 40 basis points year-over-year. And our benefit ratio was 59.7%, also up 40 basis points year-over-year, mostly due to improved persistency.
The expense ratio in Japan was 23%, up 130 basis points year-over-year. The main driver was our paperless initiative, which kicked in at a higher gear as we digitized our operations and drove efficiencies throughout the value chain to a future state with significantly reduced paper usage. This investment increased our quarterly expense ratio by 85 basis points. 
For the quarter, adjusted net investment income increased 11.9% in yen terms, led by strong returns in our alternatives portfolio, but also strong results from the loan book, like transitional real estate and middle market loans. For the full year, adjusted net investment income rose 4.4%. 
The pretax margin in the quarter was 20.9%, up 110 basis points year-over-year, as the combined effect from the lower benefit ratio and higher expense ratio was still positive. For the full year, the pretax margin was a respectable 21.2%. 
Turning to U.S. results. Earned premium was down 2.3% for the quarter due to weaker sales results. Persistency improved 160 basis points to 79.3%. This was driven by emergency orders in various states and by lower sales in 2020 as new policies lapsed at a higher rate than in-force policies older than 1 year. Removing these factors would result in a stable year-over-year persistency rate, and we view that as a good outcome to date, given the pandemic environment impact on our policyholders and reflecting our efforts to retain accounts and keep premium in-force. For the full year, earned premium was down 0.9%. Our total benefit ratio came in at 51.6%, which was 250 basis points higher than Q4 2019. 
Pandemic conditions continue to be relevant when analyzing our benefit ration. Due to the recent increase in infection rate, we estimate incurred claims impact of $72 million, of which $58 million was an increase to IBNR, resulting in an impact to the benefit ratio of 5.1 percentage points from COVID-related claims. This is somewhat offset by favorable non-COVID-related claims activity generating an underlying benefit ratio of 46.5%. COVID and non-COVID related claims tend to have a negative correlation, which clearly can be seen in our quarterly results throughout 2020. We would expect this pattern to continue in early 2021. Going forward, we still expect the guided range of 48% to 51% to be a reasonable future benefit ratio. 
Our expense ratio in the U.S. was 43.5%, up 360 basis points year-over-year. The severance charge for our VSP explains 220 basis points of the rise, while the residual is primarily driven by digital investments and the reduction in revenues. The full year expense ratio landed at 38.6%. 
Adjusted net investment income in the U.S. was up 1.1% due to strong alternative investment income, while the portfolio book yield contracted 22 basis points year-over-year. Full year adjusted net investment income declined 2.1%. 
As both the benefit and expense ratio rose, profitability did come under pressure, with a pretax margin of 11.6% in the quarter. For the full year, we still reported a solid pretax margin of 19.3%, in line with recent historical average. 
In our corporate segment, the pretax loss widened to $47 million in the quarter compared to $9 million from a year ago. Lower net investment income on our short-duration holdco cash position, increased retirement expenses and $8 million of VSP severance expense were the main components of the delta. For the full year, the corporate segment pretax loss was $115 million. 
Our capital position remains strong and stable. We ended the quarter with an SMR of north of 900% in Japan and an RBC of approximately 525% in Aflac Columbus. Holding company liquidity stood at $4 billion, $2 billion above our minimum balance. With a leverage of 23%, we continue to travel in the middle of our stated leverage range of 20% to 25%, offering ample debt capacity. 
The continued spread of COVID-19 leads us to remain cautious in how we manage our capital base, make investments and deploy capital to the benefit of the shareholder. In the quarter, we repurchased $500 million of our own stock and paid dividends of $196 million, offering good relative IRR on these capital deployments. For the full year, we paid $798 million of dividends and returned an additional $1.5 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. 
We will continue to be flexible and tactical in how we manage the balance sheet and deploy capital in order to drive strong risk-adjusted ROE with meaningful spread to our cost of capital. A recent example is the Board's decision to increase the quarterly dividend by 17.9% to $0.33 per share. 
Before going into Q&A, I would characterize our 2020 financial performance as solid despite significant external challenges. As we look forward into 2021, we do not see any fundamental drivers causing us to change the outlook provided at our financial analyst briefing in November. In order to achieve these objectives, we remain laser-focused on executing on our growth initiatives, expense efficiency and continue to drive ROE at a significant spread to our cost of capital. 
With that, let me turn it over to David to begin Q&A."

And this product also is designed to be able to be sold through the [ enormous ] group of agencies and be competitive in that market as well. So what we are expecting is that the sale of this product will increase in the nonexclusive market as we have taken a product strategy with a more competitive advantage with this product. So we do believe that this product will last for a long time as this product will be very popular among younger generation as well. 
And although it only has been 2 weeks since the launch of the product, the actual number of new business policies coming in are increasing. And at the same time, AP per policy is also on the increase. I think we have been able to get a much better start this time under the current environment compared with the medical product that we launched in 2019 as a rider. And we are expecting to see improvement in sales this quarter, much more. And we have seen some improvements since the fourth quarter last year as well.

It is still in play in the sense that there's sort of, I'll call it, a tail to it, if you will. In other words, we did the mailings. We saw, as you recall from last quarter, a spike in some of the wellness claims, which we want and anticipate, because we believe the payoff of that is not only persistency but also being able to come back into companies. Let me explain that for a second. 
A lot of what our agents will do with their business clients is they will phone them up and say, ""Based on our analysis, you've got a certain number of employees that have wellness benefits, and we can help with understanding whether they are fully utilizing those wellness benefits to get money back in their pockets."" As you can imagine, particularly as a small employer, that's an attractive proposition these days, to get money in the pockets of your employees. And so that ends up lead or leading us into the account to talk about future enrollments and cross-selling and upselling, et cetera. And so that has been fairly successful. So it's a very important piece of our product features and one that we would continue. 
If what you're asking is, what are we looking at in terms of ongoing, perhaps elevated, claims related to wellness. That's factored into some of our IBNR estimates, for example, where we'll set up those types of reserves in anticipation of a trend line of wellness claims. And so at the moment, I'll ask Max to give color, but I don't anticipate that being a mover for our benefit ratio."

As you then look at the impact on the fourth quarter, you did not really see any impact follow through into the fourth quarter because of the IBNR that we established in the third quarter. 
Going forward, we would expect this to be more normal activity for us. There may be instances with any significant campaigns that could trigger an increase in claims temporarily, but generally be relatively small. But if you refer specifically to the campaign, the big campaign we had in the third quarter, that hit the benefit ratio in the third quarter, and we didn't really have much of a follow-through into the fourth quarter."

Specifically, for the fourth quarter, we had a reserve release of about JPY 7 billion. That is higher than we would normally incur in a quarter.

And this is because of the paid -- claims pattern that we're seeing primarily to the non-COVID-related claims activity that Fred referred to in his prepared remarks. 
Going forward, you could obviously see an impact on the benefit ratio temporarily from an element of the sort of pent-up demand for hospitalizations, like elective surgery, physicals, et cetera. I think that's much more the case in the U.S. than in Japan, where the Japan hospital system have been running at a more normal level than what we've seen here in the U.S. So you could see a little bit of a higher benefit ratio from that. But this has been taken into consideration when we gave you the benefit ratio range at [ fair ] of 68.5% to 71% in our outlook.

Especially if you think about our hospitalizations, as it relates to accident hospitalizations, they won't come back, accidents that have happened and you've recovered. However, there could be a level of sickness hospitalizations that would increase in the future. 
One other aspect of our benefit ratio that I'll mention. If we get our sales back to a more normal level and we start with introducing product and people refreshed product, that has a slight impact on the benefit ratio as well in the form of reserve releases on own policy. So last year, as you saw in our results, persistency increased, which led to a slightly higher net benefit reserve with those policyholders hanging on to those policies."

So it makes it somewhat challenging to continue to sort of operate in the strong ROE levels that we have been in the mid-teens.

That being said, I do think that long term, one way to sort of think about our business is it's a fairly capital-light products that we sell, both in Japan and in the U.S. And over time, I would expect that we should sort of run in the sort of 600 basis points above our cost of capital, is a reasonable way to sort of think about where our ROE should be over time because we don't have a whole lot of interest rate sensitivity, but it does play a factor in terms of what's sort of driving the ROE as well."

And the cash flow dynamics of the company remain extremely strong. Even further advanced than that, I think, particularly soon when it comes to Aflac, you're going to want to focus in on economic value. And what I mean by that is, if you think about our goal with the new businesses we've brought on, which is Network Dental and Vision; Absentee Management; Disability and Life, true group, if you will; and then the direct-to-consumer. These are businesses that we expect to combine, contribute upwards of $1 billion of earned premium over the next 5 to 7 years. And that earned premium will have a different GAAP profit dynamic associated with it because it's in building mode. And as you know, direct-to-consumer, you don't back expenses. And so by definition, you have a lower reported profit. At the same time, that business, if actuarially appraised, absolutely has value, and some would argue great value, as you can imagine. 
So I think as we communicate going forward, it's not just communicating on EPS and ROE, but it's also communicating on cash flow and the economic value that we're driving in the company for the long run."

Here, you have pandemic conditions, but you also have not a linear dynamic but a convex dynamic of infections. And as you said, you've got these new wrinkles as in vaccination, the amount of vaccination that rolls out, the acceptance and absorption of the vaccination among the public, et cetera. 
And so it is a tricky environment. But these are incurred but not yet reported claims, meaning it's our best estimate right now of what we believe to be claims coming in and in hand.

Before we begin, some statements in this teleconference are forward-looking within the meaning of federal securities laws. Although we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate because they are prospective in nature. Actual results could differ materially from those we discuss today. We encourage you to look at our annual report on Form 10-K for some of the various risk factors that could materially impact our results. 
As I mentioned earlier, the earnings release is available on investors.aflac.com and includes reconciliations of certain non-U.S. GAAP measures. 
I'll now hand the call over to Dan. Dan?"

At this time last year, it would have been very difficult to foresee the gravity of what was soon to unfold for society and for the company due to COVID-19. I am proud of our employees, our sales distribution and Board of Directors for their decisive people-first initiatives we spearheaded early on in both the United States and Japan to protect our workforce and to be here for our policyholders throughout this trying time. We were able to reinforce our financial strength in operations as well as our distribution franchise with digital and virtual investments to the position of our company for the future growth. 
Adjusted earnings per diluted share, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, increased 10.8% in 2020, while benefiting from a lower effective tax rate. We were pleased with the results when you consider the pandemic pressure on revenues, accelerated investment in our core technological platforms and the initiatives to drive future earned premium growth and efficiency. Investing in growth and innovation will continue to be critical strategic focus this year. 
There is one central message that I've been emphasizing with our management team. It is imperative that we control the factors we have the ability to control. And what we don't have control over, we must monitor continually to be ready to adapt. Despite the fact that sales in both U.S. and Japan had been suppressed considerably due to the constraints of face-to-face opportunities, we did not sit still. We maintained forward motion as we absorbed accelerated investment in our platform while continuing strong earning performance. 
In 2020, Aflac Japan generated solid overall financial results with a stable profit margin of 21.2% and extremely strong premium persistency of 95.1%. The relaunch of our new cancer rider drove a sequential improvement in both cancer insurance and total sales in the fourth quarter. As a result, total sales were down 22.2% for the quarter and 36.2% for the year. 
In Japan, we introduced our new medical product in January, and even up against difficult comparisons of last January, pre -- that were pre-COVID sales, it is a positive launch, exceeding our expectations. We are encouraged by the reception of both the consumers and our sales force. While these sales results represent sequential improvements relative to last quarter, the effective reduced face-to-face activity are evident, and we continue to promote virtual sales. Our goal in Japan is to be the leading company for living in your own way. This is a declaration of how we tailor our products to fit the needs of customers during the different stages of their lives and reach them where they want to buy, through agencies, strategic alliance and banks. 
Now turning to Aflac U.S., we saw a stable profit margin of 19.3% amid a year of intense investments in the future of our business and the global pandemic conditions. However, this backdrop continues to noticeably impact our sales results in this segment as well, largely due to reduced face-to-face activity. As expected, we saw modest sequential sales improvement in the quarter, with a decrease of 27.2% for the quarter and 30.3% for the year. 
In the U.S., we continue to feel the impact of limited access at the work site, especially among our career agents who have historically relied upon face-to-face meetings to engage small business owners and their employees. However, we remain cautiously optimistic for continued modest sequential sales improvement, contingent upon the pace of the economic recovery, and as a result, expect to see a brighter second half of 2021. 
Fred is responsible for acquisitions, and he will cover that shortly. But while these acquisitions may not have an immediate effect on the top line, they better position Aflac for future long-term sales in the United States. 
As part of the VISION 2025 in the U.S., we seek to further develop a world where people are better prepared for unexpected health expenses. The need for the products we offer is a strong -- or stronger than ever has been. And at the same time, we know consumer habits and buying preferences have been evolving, and we are looking to reach them in ways other than the traditional media and outside the work site. This is part of the strategy to increase access, penetration and retention. 
Even while working remotely for the greater part of the year, we remained true to our culture and identity as a socially responsible company. We stepped up our engagement with our employees through virtual town meetings and weekly touch-base letters. Additionally, diversity continues to play an important role at Aflac, as it has for decades. I have always believed that in order to accomplish our goals and serve the community where we have a presence, we must surround ourselves with a group of people who bring different perspectives to the table. We have done that for years. 
At the end of 2020, nearly 50% of Aflac's U.S. employees were minorities. 66% were women. 23% of our U.S. senior officers were minorities and 30% were women. And then when you think of Aflac's Board of Directors, 36% were minorities and 36% were women. Diversity has always played an important role within ESG, and I've tasked Fred with executive oversight of our ESG efforts. He will provide greater detail on our 2021 key objectives. 
I've always said that the true test of strength is how one handles adversity. While pandemic conditions are ongoing, I'm pleased that 2020 confirms what we knew all along, and that is that Aflac is strong, adaptable and resilient. We strive to be where people want to purchase insurance, that applies to both Japan and the United States. In the past, this has meant meeting face-to-face with individuals to understand their situation, propose a solution and close the sale. However, the pandemic clearly demonstrates the need for virtual means. In other words, non face-to-face sales to reach potential customers and provide them with the protection that they need. Therefore, we have accelerated investments to enhance the tools available for our distribution in both countries. 
Related to capital deployment, we placed significant importance on continuing to achieve strong capital ratios in the United States and Japan on behalf of our policyholders and shareholders. When it comes to capital deployment, we pursue value creation through a balance of actions, including growth investments, stable dividend growth and disciplined tactical stock repurchase. 
It goes without saying that we treasure our record of dividend growth. The fourth quarter's declaration marked the 38th consecutive year of dividend increases. Additionally, the Board approved a first quarter dividend increase of 17.9%. Our dividend track record is supported by the strength of our capital and cash flows. At the same time, we remain tactical in our approach to share repurchase, buying back $1.5 billion of our shares in 2020. We have also focused on integrating the growth investments we have made in our platform. 
As always, we are working to achieve our earnings per share objectives while also ensuring we deliver on our promise to our policyholders. By doing so, we look to emerge from this period in a continued position of strength and leadership. 
I don't think it's coincidental that we've achieved our success while focusing on doing the right things for our policyholders, shareholders, employees, distribution channel, business partners and communities. In fact, I believe they go hand-in-hand. I'm proud of what we have accomplished in terms of both our social purpose and financial results, which have ultimately translated into strong, long-term shareholder return. 
Now let me turn the program over to Fred. Fred?"
250178,701104301,2192073,"Aflac Incorporated, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2021",2021-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Aflac Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Dan. I'm going to touch briefly on conditions in the fourth quarter with respect to the pandemic. I'll then provide an update on key initiatives in Japan and the U.S. Japan has experienced approximately 400,000 COVID-19 cases and 6,000 confir",1807,"Thank you, Dan. I'm going to touch briefly on conditions in the fourth quarter with respect to the pandemic. I'll then provide an update on key initiatives in Japan and the U.S. 
Japan has experienced approximately 400,000 COVID-19 cases and 6,000 confirmed deaths since inception of the virus. While quite low as compared to other developed countries and the U.S., these statistics have more than doubled since the end of the third quarter. Earlier this week, the government of Japan extended their state of emergency for Tokyo and 9 other prefectures through March 7. This action includes the suspension of domestic tourism campaign and entry of foreigners into Japan. We have responded with, again, moving more of our workforce to working from home. Unlike the state of emergency declared last year in the initial stages of the virus, government restrictions are more balanced with economic recovery considerations, and we have not prohibited face-to-face consultations and/or closed our sales shops. Meanwhile, prime Minister Suga has announced a goal of beginning vaccinations mid-February. 
Through the fourth quarter, Aflac Japan's COVID-19 impact totaled approximately 3,400 unique claimants with incurred claims totaling JPY 1 billion. We continue to experience a significant reduction in paid claims for medical conditions other than COVID-19 as Japan manages hospital capacity and discourages more routine visits. 
Despite the recent rise in infection rates in Japan, we continue to track well below our stress assumptions. As Dan outlined, sales have clearly been impacted. But when looking at policies in force, the impact of reduced sales on earned premium has largely been offset by improved persistency with the reduction in reported revenue driven primarily by paid-up policies. 
Finally, pandemic-related expenses in the quarter totaled JPY 1.8 billion. Which includes the rollout of virtual distribution tools, employee teleworking equipment and distribution support. 
Turning to the U.S. There are nearly 27 million COVID-19 cases and over 450,000 deaths, as reported by the CDC. For Aflac U.S., in 2020, COVID-19 claimants totaled 23,000 with incurred claims of approximately $71 million in the quarter and $128 million for all of 2020. 
We are now in a better position to back-test the correlation of U.S. rates of infection to paid claims in order to build an estimate for incurred claim reserves. It's fair to say this is still very difficult to estimate as IBNR often works from years of reliable data to establish trends. While our reserves assume elevated claims, we continue to see the length of stay in hospital and transition to ICU traveling below our expectations. 
We have seen limited impact to our reported persistency numbers. However, we believe this is in part attributed to the combination of reduced sales, where lapse rates tend to be much higher in the first year and the state of -- state executive orders requiring premium grace periods. Executive orders are still in place in 11 states as of the end of the quarter, with 5 states having open-ended expiration dates. We have reduced pressure on lapse rates through proactive work with our policyholders, including converting from payroll deduction to direct bill and encouraging a review of wellness benefits. 
Turning to key operating initiatives. 2020 was an important year in setting the stage for growth once we move clear of pandemic conditions. Beginning with Japan, after launching and promoting a simplified cancer writer in the fourth quarter, we successfully launched our refreshed medical product called EVER Prime in January. As Dan noted in his comments, it's early, and our associate channel is having to navigate pandemic conditions, but January medical sales are promising. 
Introduced in October of 2020, we have technology in place to allow agents to pivot from face-to-face to virtual sales and an entirely digital customer experience. True virtual sales in Japan is relatively limited. In addition, the majority of applications are still filed in paper form, although digital applications have been adopted in face-to-face consultations. Excluding traditional non face-to-face means of distributing products, like work site, direct mail and call center sales, we estimate only 2% to 3% of our sales are currently digital end-to-end. However, we understand some of our agencies has significantly adopted virtual tools to supplement face-to-face consultations. 
We have discussed our paperless initiative across all operations in Japan. This is a JPY 10 billion investment with approximately JPY 2.8 billion spent in the fourth quarter and JPY 4.8 billion spent in 2020. We are projecting another JPY 4.3 billion in spend planned for 2021. This investment has a 3-year payback and will reduce the production and circulation of over 80 million pieces of paper per year. 
In summary, we expect the combination of product development, improved pandemic conditions and the return of Japan Post to distributing Aflac cancer insurance will drive growth as we look towards the second half of 2021.
Turning to the U.S., we focused our efforts in 2020 on setting the table for 2021, including a national launch of Network Dental and Vision, completing our Group Benefit acquisition and standing up our new direct-to-consumer digital platform. 
On the operations side, we rolled out a new and upgraded enrollment platform called Everwell 2.0 in September, which requires time for full adoption and stabilizing the platform. 2020 was an important year to introduce digital tools, increase adoption rates and take on any corrective action before 2021. 
In addition, under Teresa White's leadership, we have reorganized the U.S., forming a group benefits and individual division. Rich Williams will now lead our group benefits division, which includes Aflac Voluntary Group, Aflac Network Dental and Vision, Argus, our Dental TPA, and our new Aflac Premier Life, Absence Management and Disability business. Virgil Miller will lead our Individual Benefits division, which includes Aflac's individually issued and small business-focused work site products and our new consumer markets business, targeting workers not at the traditional work site. Both divisions pull from shared service U.S. operating platforms. 
This new alignment provides focus for each division within the U.S. business segment and allows Aflac to offer tailored products and services for our career agency teams and broker partners based on the unique markets they serve. 
Like Japan, we have all the tools in place for agents to conduct business without a face-to-face meeting. However, most sales are being driven on a continuum of face-to-face and digital interaction. We estimate about 15% of our traditional individual sales are completed without some form of face-to-face interaction. This excludes digital direct-to-consumer, which is naturally non face-to-face. 
Turning to more specifics on our key growth initiatives. On January 12, we announced the national rollout of Aflac Dental and Vision. Our dental and vision products are now available in 40 states with more coming online throughout the year. This is a broad launch that is available to large and small companies and distributed through agents and brokers. 
In November, we closed on our Zurich Group Benefits acquisition. The new platform managed to contribute to sales in the quarter with $5 million in production. This is more of a turnkey launch, meaning products are filed, and we are open for business in 2021 under the Aflac brand. 
Finally, we officially launched our new digital direct-to-consumer platform in the first week of January. We offer critical illness, accident and cancer and are approved to sell all 3 products in approximately 30 states with more states and products coming online throughout the year. 
As highlighted during our investor conference, we are addressing expenses over 2 horizons. In 2020, we took actions to realize approximately $100 million of annualized run rate expense saves on a go-forward basis. Actions included restricting hiring, rationalizing distribution expenses and a voluntary separation plan that resulted in a 9% reduction to our U.S. workforce. Longer-term expense initiatives center on our Group division and the migration onto a new Administrative platform as well as integration of the Zurich Group Benefits business. 
As you are all aware, we have adopted a conservative buy-to-build acquisition strategy. The build efforts taken together impacted our expense ratio in the fourth quarter by 160 basis points and is expected to impact the 2021 ratio by approximately 180 basis points. 
Our global investments team remains focused on asset quality, monitoring economic conditions and sourcing new investment opportunities. Portfolio actions prior to and in the early days of the pandemic lowered our exposure to prolonged economic weakness, and we ended 2020 with a modest amount of asset losses. We continue to watch closely our middle-market loan and traditional real estate -- transitional real estate portfolios. While we have seen ratings downgrades, our portfolios are resilient, consisting of diversified first lien loans, conservatively underwritten to high-quality borrowers.
We have further refined our approach to managing the unhedged dollars in Japan, both lowering our hedge ratio and maintaining our out of the money protection for extreme moves in foreign exchange. These unhedged dollars provide diversification and income benefits as well as lowering our enterprise exposure to the yen.
As has been our practice, for 2021, we have locked in lower hedge costs with floating rate loan yields benefiting from LIBOR floors. 
Finally, we are pleased with the performance of our strategic investment and alliance with Varagon Capital Partners during 2020, contributing to corporate investment income. We are working to establish even more strategic alliances that leverages the capabilities of our asset management subsidiary and further the performance of our insurance segments.
As commented on by Dan, we have refocused our efforts in key areas to drive tangible ESG incitatives in 2021. We are focused on the following. 
Building off our published ESG investment policy, Aflac Global Investments is advancing a responsible investing framework that includes the establishment of a core ESG team and formal governance process. We initiated work with third-party experts to measure, draft and eventually disclose a formal plan to be carbon-neutral on or before 2040 and carbon net 0 emissions on or before 2050. 
We pledged to continue hitting key milestones on our important women in leadership initiative as part of the diversity and inclusion in Japan and targeting 30% of leadership positions in Japan filled by women by 2025. In the U.S., we seek to advance our already strong diversity statistics by broadening our influence through identifying and providing capital to organizations that advance diversity and inclusion as well as social justice and economic mobility. 
Finally, we pledged to advance reporting and disclosure framework in compliance with SASB and TCFD reporting standards. We'll provide further disclosures on ESG initiatives in our proxy material and on our ESG hub, esg.aflac.com. 
Wrapping up my comments, we believe the investments made in the past 2 years and accelerated during the pandemic position us for future growth and efficiency in the face of what we believe to be temporary weakness in sales and earned premium. 
I'll now pass on to Max to discuss financial performance in more detail. Max?"

We finished the year with stable fourth quarter earnings in a year marked by significant mortality and morbidity events as well as continued low interest rates. For the quarter, adjusted earnings per share increased 3.9% to $1.07. And the",1220,"Thank you, Fred. We finished the year with stable fourth quarter earnings in a year marked by significant mortality and morbidity events as well as continued low interest rates. For the quarter, adjusted earnings per share increased 3.9% to $1.07. And the full year EPS was a record $4.96, up 11.7% year-over-year. Adjusted book value per share, including foreign currency translation gains and losses, grew 19.1%, both for the quarter and full year. The adjusted ROE, excluding the foreign currency impact, was 12.1% in the fourth quarter and a respectable 15.1% for the full year, a material spread to our cost of capital. 
This quarter benefited from favorable marks on our alternative investment portfolio to the amount of $47 million pretax, above our long-term return expectations. A very good outcome on our building alternatives portfolio. We also booked a severance charge associated with our previously announced voluntary separation program, or VSP, in our U.S. and corporate segments, totaling pretax, $43 million, included in adjusted earnings. 
Turning to our Japan segment. Total earned premium for the quarter declined 3.5%, reflecting mainly first sector policies paid-up impacts, while earned premium for our third sector products was down 1.9%. For the full year, total earned premium was down 2.8%, while total policies in force declined by a lesser rate at 1.2%. As policies in force are not impacted by the paid-up status, it tends to serve as a better indicator of the growth of the underlying business. Persistency has been on a positive trajectory, inched up slightly sequentially to 95.1%, up 70 basis points year-over-year. 
Japan's total benefit ratio came in at 68.9% for the quarter, down 110 basis points year-over-year. And the third sector benefit ratio was 58.6%, down 150 basis points year-over-year. The main driver for the lower benefit ratio was a higher-than-normal IBNR release due to a sustained lower paid claims environment in 2020. We estimate that this lowered the benefit ratio by roughly 130 basis points compared to what we would deem a normal IBNR release to be. 
For the full year, the reported total benefit ratio was 69.9%, up 40 basis points year-over-year. And our benefit ratio was 59.7%, also up 40 basis points year-over-year, mostly due to improved persistency.
The expense ratio in Japan was 23%, up 130 basis points year-over-year. The main driver was our paperless initiative, which kicked in at a higher gear as we digitized our operations and drove efficiencies throughout the value chain to a future state with significantly reduced paper usage. This investment increased our quarterly expense ratio by 85 basis points. 
For the quarter, adjusted net investment income increased 11.9% in yen terms, led by strong returns in our alternatives portfolio, but also strong results from the loan book, like transitional real estate and middle market loans. For the full year, adjusted net investment income rose 4.4%. 
The pretax margin in the quarter was 20.9%, up 110 basis points year-over-year, as the combined effect from the lower benefit ratio and higher expense ratio was still positive. For the full year, the pretax margin was a respectable 21.2%. 
Turning to U.S. results. Earned premium was down 2.3% for the quarter due to weaker sales results. Persistency improved 160 basis points to 79.3%. This was driven by emergency orders in various states and by lower sales in 2020 as new policies lapsed at a higher rate than in-force policies older than 1 year. Removing these factors would result in a stable year-over-year persistency rate, and we view that as a good outcome to date, given the pandemic environment impact on our policyholders and reflecting our efforts to retain accounts and keep premium in-force. For the full year, earned premium was down 0.9%. Our total benefit ratio came in at 51.6%, which was 250 basis points higher than Q4 2019. 
Pandemic conditions continue to be relevant when analyzing our benefit ration. Due to the recent increase in infection rate, we estimate incurred claims impact of $72 million, of which $58 million was an increase to IBNR, resulting in an impact to the benefit ratio of 5.1 percentage points from COVID-related claims. This is somewhat offset by favorable non-COVID-related claims activity generating an underlying benefit ratio of 46.5%. COVID and non-COVID related claims tend to have a negative correlation, which clearly can be seen in our quarterly results throughout 2020. We would expect this pattern to continue in early 2021. Going forward, we still expect the guided range of 48% to 51% to be a reasonable future benefit ratio. 
Our expense ratio in the U.S. was 43.5%, up 360 basis points year-over-year. The severance charge for our VSP explains 220 basis points of the rise, while the residual is primarily driven by digital investments and the reduction in revenues. The full year expense ratio landed at 38.6%. 
Adjusted net investment income in the U.S. was up 1.1% due to strong alternative investment income, while the portfolio book yield contracted 22 basis points year-over-year. Full year adjusted net investment income declined 2.1%. 
As both the benefit and expense ratio rose, profitability did come under pressure, with a pretax margin of 11.6% in the quarter. For the full year, we still reported a solid pretax margin of 19.3%, in line with recent historical average. 
In our corporate segment, the pretax loss widened to $47 million in the quarter compared to $9 million from a year ago. Lower net investment income on our short-duration holdco cash position, increased retirement expenses and $8 million of VSP severance expense were the main components of the delta. For the full year, the corporate segment pretax loss was $115 million. 
Our capital position remains strong and stable. We ended the quarter with an SMR of north of 900% in Japan and an RBC of approximately 525% in Aflac Columbus. Holding company liquidity stood at $4 billion, $2 billion above our minimum balance. With a leverage of 23%, we continue to travel in the middle of our stated leverage range of 20% to 25%, offering ample debt capacity. 
The continued spread of COVID-19 leads us to remain cautious in how we manage our capital base, make investments and deploy capital to the benefit of the shareholder. In the quarter, we repurchased $500 million of our own stock and paid dividends of $196 million, offering good relative IRR on these capital deployments. For the full year, we paid $798 million of dividends and returned an additional $1.5 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. 
We will continue to be flexible and tactical in how we manage the balance sheet and deploy capital in order to drive strong risk-adjusted ROE with meaningful spread to our cost of capital. A recent example is the Board's decision to increase the quarterly dividend by 17.9% to $0.33 per share. 
Before going into Q&A, I would characterize our 2020 financial performance as solid despite significant external challenges. As we look forward into 2021, we do not see any fundamental drivers causing us to change the outlook provided at our financial analyst briefing in November. In order to achieve these objectives, we remain laser-focused on executing on our growth initiatives, expense efficiency and continue to drive ROE at a significant spread to our cost of capital. 
With that, let me turn it over to David to begin Q&A."

We saw, as you recall from last quarter, a spike in some of the wellness claims, which we want and anticipate, because we believe the payoff of that is not only persistency but also being able to come back into companies. Let me explain that for a second. 
A lot of what our agents will do with their business clients is they will phone them up and say, ""Based on our analysis, you've got a certain number of employees that have wellness benefits, and we can help with understanding whether they are fully utilizing those wellness benefits to get money back in their pockets."" As you can imagine, particularly as a small employer, that's an attractive proposition these days, to get money in the pockets of your employees. And so that ends up lead or leading us into the account to talk about future enrollments and cross-selling and upselling, et cetera. And so that has been fairly successful. So it's a very important piece of our product features and one that we would continue. 
If what you're asking is, what are we looking at in terms of ongoing, perhaps elevated, claims related to wellness. That's factored into some of our IBNR estimates, for example, where we'll set up those types of reserves in anticipation of a trend line of wellness claims. And so at the moment, I'll ask Max to give color, but I don't anticipate that being a mover for our benefit ratio."

As you then look at the impact on the fourth quarter, you did not really see any impact follow through into the fourth quarter because of the IBNR that we established in the third quarter. 
Going forward, we would expect this to be more normal activity for us. There may be instances with any significant campaigns that could trigger an increase in claims temporarily, but generally be relatively small. But if you refer specifically to the campaign, the big campaign we had in the third quarter, that hit the benefit ratio in the third quarter, and we didn't really have much of a follow-through into the fourth quarter."

And this is because of the paid -- claims pattern that we're seeing primarily to the non-COVID-related claims activity that Fred referred to in his prepared remarks. 
Going forward, you could obviously see an impact on the benefit ratio temporarily from an element of the sort of pent-up demand for hospitalizations, like elective surgery, physicals, et cetera. I think that's much more the case in the U.S. than in Japan, where the Japan hospital system have been running at a more normal level than what we've seen here in the U.S. So you could see a little bit of a higher benefit ratio from that.

One other aspect of our benefit ratio that I'll mention. If we get our sales back to a more normal level and we start with introducing product and people refreshed product, that has a slight impact on the benefit ratio as well in the form of reserve releases on own policy. So last year, as you saw in our results, persistency increased, which led to a slightly higher net benefit reserve with those policyholders hanging on to those policies."

And what I mean by that is, if you think about our goal with the new businesses we've brought on, which is Network Dental and Vision; Absentee Management; Disability and Life, true group, if you will; and then the direct-to-consumer. These are businesses that we expect to combine, contribute upwards of $1 billion of earned premium over the next 5 to 7 years. And that earned premium will have a different GAAP profit dynamic associated with it because it's in building mode. And as you know, direct-to-consumer, you don't back expenses. And so by definition, you have a lower reported profit. At the same time, that business, if actuarially appraised, absolutely has value, and some would argue great value, as you can imagine.

growth, retention and penetration or seeing more employees at a given employer. This month, we are completing the national training programs, making select product refinements and reinforcing incentives to drive new dental accounts. In addition, we are busy upgrading our administrative platforms to ready for increased volumes. 2021 is the year of launch, learn and adjust, and we expect to see our pipeline, close rate and new accounts gradually increasing throughout the year. Our Premier life and disability platform acquired from Zurich is now operating under the Aflac brand. We have started to see our quoted pipeline build in the last 45 days. However, many employee employers are reluctant to move critical benefit plans while sorting through returning to work site and changing workforce dynamics. 
In addition, consultants often proceed with caution in a year or so after an acquisition. We need to remain patient over the next few years as we settle into this new line of business. Our competitive calling card is the proven premier service and technology capabilities of the acquired platform, coupled with Aflac Group's core leadership in supplemental work site benefits. We will not resort to winning business via relaxed underwriting and pricing standards in this highly competitive market. 
Finally, earlier this year, we launched our new e-commerce direct-to-consumer platform, Aflac Direct. We offer critical illness, accident and cancer and are approved in approximately 30 states with more states and product coming online throughout the year. This platform targets individuals, the self employed, gig workers and part-time employees. In short, those who are not offered traditional benefit packages at the work site. We are actively building out a licensed agent call center to better manage conversion rates and control overall economics. With a modest amount of committed marketing dollars, we are attracting about 500,000 visitors per month to aflac.com. Which has resulted in 120,000 leads for call center conversion this year. We are currently experiencing a 15% conversion rate once in the call center. This is a data analytics-driven business and core metrics will improve as this model matures. 
In terms of the contribution of these businesses to overall sales in 2021, we expect these 3 growth initiatives will make up roughly 10% of sales in 2021 after having contributed less than 5% to 2020 sales. We remain committed to the revenue growth targets discussed at our November investor conference. We expect these initiatives to drive incremental revenue in excess of $1 billion over the next 5 to 7 years. As these separate initiatives mature, they leverage off each other. Network dental and vision drives agent recruitment and conversion to average weekly producers, employer paid benefits drives supplemental work site sales, and direct-to-consumer expands our addressable market while being leveraged to funnel work site leads to our agents in the field. 
In the future, as employees leave the work site, a digital relationship directly with Aflac helps with persistency and customer satisfaction. To close out my comments this morning, we continue to advance ESG initiatives in 2021. As Dan noted, we issued our inaugural sustainability bond, raising $400 million to be invested towards our path to net 0 emissions by 2050 and investments that support climate as well as diversity and inclusion efforts. The bond offering itself is an important step in that it requires formal processes around reporting, tracking and auditing of qualified sustainable investments. This rigor serves to benefit the control environment surrounding our enterprise-wide ESG reporting and accountability. 
In addition, Aflac Global Investments announced late February, a partnership with Sound Point Capital Management to create a new asset management business focused on the transitional real estate loan market. As part of that alliance, we have made an initial $1.5 billion general account allocation to the newly created Sound Point commercial Real Estate Finance, LLC, with $500 million of that amount dedicated to providing transitional and other debt financing to support economically distressed communities designated as qualified opportunity zones. Aflac will hold a 9.9% minority interest in this newly created investment LLC, with the ability to grow our stake over time in line with future growth of the new venture.

Variable investment income $24.5 million above our long-term return expectations. Adjusted book value per share, including foreign currency translation gains and losses, grew 20.6%, and the adjusted ROE, excluding the foreign currency impact, was a strong 16.7%, a significant spread to our cost of capital. 
Starting with our Japan segment. Total earned premium for the quarter declined 3.6%, reflecting per policies paid up impact while earned premium for our third sector product was down 2.2% as sales were under pressure in 2020. Japan's total benefit ratio came in at 68.4% for the quarter, down 100 basis points year-over-year, and the third sector benefit ratio was down -- was 58%, also down 100 basis points year-over-year. We experienced slightly higher than normal IBNR release in our third sector block as experience continues to come in favorable relative to initial. This quarter, it was primarily due to pandemic conditions constraining utilization. Persistency remains strong, with a rate of 95%, up 50 basis points year-over-year. Our expense ratio in Japan was 21.3%, up 130 basis points year-over-year. With improved sales activity, expenses naturally pick up in our technology-related investments into converting Aflac Japan to a paperless company continues, which also includes higher system maintenance expenses. 
Adjusted net investment income increased 6.9% in yen terms, primarily driven by favorable returns on our growing private equity portfolio and lower hedge costs, partially offset by lower reinvestment yield on our fixed and floating rate portfolio. The pretax margin for Japan in the quarter was 23.1%, up 60 basis points year-over-year. A very good start to the year. 
Turning to the U.S. Net earned premium was down 4.1% due to weaker sales results. Persistency improved 240 basis points to 80%, as our efforts to retain accounts and reduce lapsation show early positive results. As Fred noted, there are still 9 states with premium grace periods in place. So we are monitoring these developments closely. Breaking down the 240 basis points persistency rate improvement further. 70 basis points can be explained by the emergency orders in place, 90 basis points by lower sales as first year lapse rates are roughly twice total in-force lapse rates. And the residual of 80 basis points includes conservation efforts executed on last year. Our total benefit ratio came in much lower than expected. At 39.1%, a full 900 basis points lower than Q1 2020. 
In the quarter, we experienced lower paid claims, especially in the month of January. As pandemic conditions impacted behavior of our policyholders. This is in line with disclosures in 2020, indicating a negative correlation between infection levels and claims generating activities like accidents, elective surgeries and physical exams. This low activity level related to nonCOVID claims accounted for most of the year-over-year drop in the benefit ratio. Our total incurred COVID-related claims also came in lower than expected due to an IBNR release. We estimated new COVID claims at approximately $42 million, and this was offset by an IBNR release of $41 million. As our experience accumulates, we have refined our assumptions, and this led to this IBNR reserve release. We expect the benefit ratio to increase gradually throughout the remainder of the year, with the resumption of normal activity in our communities and by our policyholders.. 
For the full year, we now expect our benefit ratio to be towards the lower end or slightly below our guided range of 48% to 51%. Our expense ratio in the U.S. was 38.5%, up 10 basis points year-over-year, but with a lot of moving parts. Weaker sales performance negatively impacts revenue, however, the impact to our expense ratio is largely offset by lower DAC expense. Higher advertising spend increased the expense ratio by 70 basis points along with our continued build-out of growth initiatives, group life and disability, network and direct-to-consumer. These contributed to a 110 basis point increase to the ratio. The strategic growth initiative investments are largely offset by our efforts to lower core operating expenses as we strive towards being the low-cost producer in the voluntary benefit space. Net-net, despite a lot of moving parts, Q1 expenses are tracking according to plan. 
In the quarter, we also incurred $6 million of integration expenses not included in adjusted earnings associated with recent acquisitions. Adjusted net investment income in the U.S. was down 0.6% due to a 22 basis points contraction in the portfolio yield year-over-year, partially offset by favorable variable investment income. Profitability in the U.S. segment was very strong, with a pretax margin of 27.3%, with a low benefit ratio as the core driver. With Q1 now in the books, we are increasing our pretax margin expectation for the full year. Initial expectations were for us to be towards the low end of 16% to 19%. We now expect to end up for the full year towards the high end of this range indicated at. In our corporate segment, we recorded a pretax loss of $26 million as adjusted net investment income was $20 million lower than last year, due to lower interest rates at the short end of the yield curve. Other adjusted expenses were $7 million lower as our cost reduction activities are coming through. Our capital position remains strong, and we ended the quarter with an SMR north of 900% in Japan and an RBC of approximately 563% in Aflac Columbus. Unencumbered holding company liquidity stood at $3.9 billion, $1.5 billion above our minimum balance, excluding the $400 million proceeds from the sustainability bond that we issued in March that reinforced our ESG initiatives and believe that sustainable investments are also good long-term investments. 
Leverage, which includes the sustainability bond, increased but remains at a comfortable 23% in the middle of our leverage corridor of 20% to 25%. In the quarter, we repurchased $650 million of our own stock and paid dividends of $227 million, offering good relative IRR on these capital deployments. We will continue to be flexible and tactical in how we manage the balance sheet and deploy capital in order to drive strong risk-adjusted ROE with a meaningful spread to our cost of capital. 
And with that, I'll hand it over to David to begin Q&A."

[Foreign Language] First of all, let me start out with the current situation in Japan, followed by the sales and our business in Japan as well. [Foreign Language] Well, first of all, as Fred mentioned earlier, the number of infect",548,"Yes. This is from Japan. [Foreign Language] First of all, let me start out with the current situation in Japan, followed by the sales and our business in Japan as well. [Foreign Language] Well, first of all, as Fred mentioned earlier, the number of infections in Japan is 575,000, and the number of deaths in total is about 10,000. So compared to other countries, this number is much smaller. [Foreign Language] And this is -- the reason why we have been able to control much of the infection is because of the nature of our citizens that we normally wear masks, and we care very much about our hygiene. And on top of that, instead of taking the risk, people are really worrying about eating and dining outside, and the restaurants are reducing their business hours, and these things have been very effective. 
[Foreign Language] However, even still then, there has been a number of increase of the new infections in Osaka and Tokyo. And as a result, there is a third declaration of emergency, which was issued on April 25. 
[Foreign Language] However, the third emergency declaration in Japan is not a lockdown. 
[Foreign Language] It is much more focused measure. [Foreign Language] And for example, the state of emergency declaration that was issued this time only covers 4 prefectures, and the period that it covers is up to May 11. So compared with the past state of emergency declarations, it's very much limited in terms of time and location. 
[Foreign Language] However, the government is imposing much stronger restrictions on restaurants and shopping -- large shopping centers that they are asked to shut down their response and shops for the time being. 
[Foreign Language] And the vaccination started in April, starting from the elderly population. And since older population accounts for about 30% of the overall population, we are expecting that this will have a positive effect. 
[Foreign Language] However, the situation of the pandemic is very fluid. Therefore, we really need to watch out for the variance and the vaccination status going forward as well. 
[Foreign Language] And because of the situation and since the COVID-19 infection is still rising it is very difficult to mention how it is going to be going forward in terms of our projection. 
[Foreign Language] But as you can see, as a result of -- in our results of the first quarter, even under the state of emergency declaration, we have been able to promote our medical insurance, and it's been and also because of the extent of the use of online proposals and applications, we haven't been able to mark the same level of performance as this last year. 
[Foreign Language] And even from the second quarter and on, we would like to maintain this positive benefit or positive effect from the medical insurance, and we will also be further expanding the use of online proposals and applications. And on top of that, we would also like to be expanding the enrollment through online for group as well. 
[Foreign Language] And furthermore, we would also like to be using direct mails, which will enhance the non face-to-face solicitation. And by doing so, we should be we should be minimizing the impact from COVID-19. And that's all for me."

I think it's too early for us to tell. But what I would, Fred mentioned this, but I want to reinforce it, is we've got as good a relationship with the new management team as we had, if not better, with the old management team and being large shareholders that they are. They're also very interested and their stock and what they've invested in. And so it's a win-win opportunity. And I think it will be coming back but when you -- we're in uncharted waters with all of this COVID stuff. And so it's hard for us to go out when we don't know about it as well. But look, this is not in any projections, but my gut just tells me, and it's just mind. So for what it's worth, but that it's going to do very well, and it's going to be a little slow in the second quarter. And then they're going to ramp it up. 
The one thing I've seen with the Japanese over the years is they tend to analyze, reanalyze, reanalyze again and then all of a sudden move at once. So you don't -- in the U.S., we kind of ease into it, add a little more, add a little more and then it builds. If you take both groups at the starting line, the U.S. will always take off first. But at some point, halfway through that, Japan will all of a sudden decide, we're ready to go. And they will boil out and then all of a sudden go to that point. I believe we're in that stage right now. I believe that will go through the first quarter. But I think by the end of the year, you're going to see them coming back and pulling out. Aflac Japan is a little bit more reluctant than to say all of that. So I am not speaking on their behalf, but I've been doing this for 31 years. And I just have a real good feeling that also Japan post wants to make money, and they need to do those things. And Aflac's products with cancer insurance are something that consumer wants and needs. So when you add that to it, I would say there's a good chance. 
Now the downside is, something goes wrong with the -- with COVID or something like that. But that's not limited to us. That happens every business out there today. So I'm sure you take that into account. But if you exclude that, I feel pretty good about what's going to be taking place."

As you might recall, it's a JPY 10 billion, roughly 2.5-year investment. And I would say we're probably in the range of JPY 3 billion, perhaps approaching JPY 4 billion of investment to date. It's designed to take about 80 million pieces of paper out of the system. And it's largely oriented around our policyholder services platform, where when the application starts in a paper form, it remains in a paper form through the processing environment. And so we're looking to get that out of the system, and that benefits cost structure. It benefits business recovery because you can move information around the country of Japan, which can be prone to natural disaster, as you know, and so -- and then also finally has environmental benefits, of course. And so that's a big initiative. We expect to save about JPY 3 billion a year in the way of expenses, and it remains on track, and it is closely tied to the digitization of the platform. It's essentially one and the same. It's one of the major efforts, if you will, that's involved in overall digitization of the platform. 
In terms of the $400 million sustainability bond, yes, we have very well-articulated and dedicated plans for the investment of those funds. They largely surround classic sustainability investments, meaning climate, climate-related renewable energy investments. They also include, among other things, investments in opportunity zones in areas that suffer from a lack of income equality. And so those are largely the areas that we're targeting. And as you may know, in the sustainability bond, so-called green bond, et cetera, marketplace. There's very strict and well-defined requirements around what you invest in, the qualification of those investments, the tracking of those investments and the yielding of benefits from those investments. And so while it's a $400 million bond, my point in my comments was it's a much bigger effort for the company because it serves to set the entire structure up for broader-based investment, far greater than $400 million over time, particularly the utilization of our general account on ESG efforts."

At our first quarter conference call 1 year ago, we were facing the early days of the pandemic. At that time, I shared with you actions that we had taken to ensure that we protect the employees the distribution partners, the policyholders and the communities. I am proud of our response and our ability to handle these challenging times for everyone. Our people-first embodies the spirit of corporate culture, which we refer to as The Aflac Way. Within the pandemic environment, We are encouraged by the production of the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines. But we also recognize that vaccination efforts are still in the early stages around the world. Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone affected, and we are cautiously optimistic while also remaining diligent. .
There is one essential message that I continue to emphasize with our management team. It is imperative that we control the factors we have the ability to control. And what we don't have the ability to control, we must monitor continually to be ready to adapt. This approach allows us to respond in the most effective way possible. 
In the first quarter, adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 26.4%. While earnings are off to a strong start for the year, It's important to bear in mind that they are largely supported by a low benefit ratio associated with the pandemic condition. Before covering our segments, I'll make a few comments about the overall perspective. Pandemic conditions in the first quarter continued to impact our sales results as well as earned premium and revenues, both in the United States and Japan. We continue to expect these pandemic conditions to remain with us through the first half of 2021, but look for improvement in the second half of the year as communities and businesses further open up, allowing more face to face interactions. Despite the fact that sales in both the United States and Japan had been suppressed considerably due to the constrained face-to-face opportunities, we did not sit still. We continued to make progress in integration of our accelerated investment in our platform while continuing strong earnings performance. 
Looking at the operations in Japan in the first quarter, Aflac Japan generated solid overall financial results with a profit margin of 23.1%, which was above the outlook range that we provided at the financial analyst briefing. Aflac Japan also reported strong premium persistency of 95%. Sales were essentially flat for the first quarter, with the January launch of our new medical product, offset by continued impact of the pandemic conditions. We are encouraged by the reception of the new medical product by both consumers and the sales force. In addition, Japan Post Group's announcement to resume proactive sales in April paves the way for gradual improvement in Aflac's cancer insurance sales in the second half of the year. We are actively working with Japan Post to ready the platform, recognizing that it will take time to return to the full strength. We continued to navigate evolving pandemic conditions in Japan, including the recent reestablished state of an emergency for Tokyo, Osaka and 2 other prefectures effected from April 25 through May 11. Restrictions will be tightened to curve the movement of people and group activities during the major holiday known as Golden Week. 
Turning to the U.S., we saw a strong profit margin of 27.3%. Aflac U.S. also reported very strong premium persistency of 80%. Max will cover the persistency later. Current pandemic conditions continue to notably impact our sales results, largely due to reduced face-to-face activity. As expected, we saw modest sequential sales improvement in the quarter, with an overall decrease of 22.1%. In the U.S., small businesses are still in the recovery mode, and we expect that they will be that way for most of 2021. At the same time, larger businesses remain focused on returning employees to the work site rather than modifying the benefits for their employees. 
We strive to be where the people want to purchase insurance. That applies to both Japan and the United States. In the past, this has meant meeting face-to-face with individuals to understand their situation, propose a solution and close the sale. Face-to-face sales are still the most effective way for us to convey the financial protection only Aflac products provide. However, the pandemic has clearly demonstrated the need for virtual means. In other words, non-face-to-face sales that help us reach potential customers and provide them with the protection that they need. 
Even prior to the pandemic, we've been working on building our virtual capacities. Given the current backdrop, we have accelerated investments to enhance the tools available to our distribution in both countries and continue to integrate these investments into our operations. In addition, we continue to build out the U.S. product portfolio with previously acquired businesses that serve as a base for Aflac network dental and vision and group life, absent management and disability. While these acquisitions have a modest near-term impact on the top line, they better position Aflac for future long-term success in the United States. 
Our core earnings drivers, which are persistency, underwriting profits, investment income and expense ratios, continue to drive strong pretax margins, both in the United States and in Japan. 
Both Japan and the U.S., we experienced sequential sales growth in the months of January, February and March. In addition, provided we don't experience the setback in terms of pandemic conditions, we're forecasting a sequential increase in absolute sales in the second quarter over the first quarter in both the U.S. and in Japan. As always, we place significant importance on continuing to achieve strong capital ratios in the U.S. and in Japan on behalf of our policyholders and shareholders. We remain committed to prudent liquidity and capital management. We issued our first sustainability bond in March as we seek to allocate proceeds from the issuance to reinforce our commitment to social and environmental initiatives as we balance purpose for profit. We treasure our 38-year track record of dividend growth and remain committed to extending it, supported by the strength of our capital and cash flows. At the same time, we will continue to tactically repurchase shares, focus on integrating the growth investments we've made in our platform. By doing so, we look to emerge from this period in a continued position of strength and leadership. 
I've always said that the true test of strength is how one handles adversity. This past year confirms what I knew all along, and that is that Aflac is strong, adaptable and resilient. We will continue to work to achieve long-term growth, while also ensuring we deliver on our promise to our policyholders. By doing so, we look to emerge from this period in a continued position of strength and leadership. I don't think it's a coincidence that we've achieved success while focusing on doing the right things for the policyholders, the shareholders, the employees, the sales distribution, the business partners and the communities. In fact, I believe success and doing the right thing go hand-in-hand. I'm proud of what we've accomplished by balancing purpose with financial results.

I'm going to touch briefly on current pandemic conditions in Japan and the U.S., then focus my comments on efforts to restore our production platform in 2021. Japan has experienced approximately 575,000 COVID cases and 10,000 confirmed dea",1541,"Thank you, Dan. I'm going to touch briefly on current pandemic conditions in Japan and the U.S., then focus my comments on efforts to restore our production platform in 2021. Japan has experienced approximately 575,000 COVID cases and 10,000 confirmed deaths since inception of the virus. Through the first quarter of 2021 and since the inception of the virus, Aflac Japan's COVID impact has totaled approximately 10,500 claimants, with incurred claims of JPY 1.9 billion. We continue to experience a low level of paid claims for medical conditions other than COVID, as policyholders refrain from routine hospital visits. .
There are essentially 3 areas of focus in building back to prepandemic levels of production in Japan: Our traditional product refreshment activities, online sales driving productivity in the face of pandemic conditions, and active engagement with Japan Post to begin the recovery process in cancer insurance sales. As Dan noted, there has been a positive reception to our revised medical product. This product was designed to better compete in the independent agent channel, where we had seen a decline in market share heading into 2020. Sales of medical insurance are up 34% over the first quarter of 2020 and up 8% over the 2019 quarter. The new product, called Ever Prime, has enhanced benefits that, on average, result in 5% to 10% more premium per policy versus our old medical product. The product also includes a low claims bonus structure that has contributed to growth among younger demographics. We have technology in place to allow agents to pivot from face-to-face to virtual sales and an entirely digital customer experience. The agent is not removed from the process. The agent can make the sale and process the policy from point of solicitation to point of issuance, entirely online without face-to-face contact. 
We introduced this capability in October 2020, and  for the month of November, we processed 1,600 applications utilizing this digital experience. In the month of March, that number doubled to approximately 3,200 applications. Not surprisingly, we are seeing higher adoption rates among younger demographics. On March 26, we launched a national advertising campaign promoting the capability and expect to see increased utilization. We see this capability contributing to productivity even after pandemic conditions subside. 
On Japan Post, as Dan noted, we anticipate sales volume will recover gradually in the second half of 2021. Separate from Japan Post activities to revive sales, Aflac Japan is actively supporting recovery in the sale of cancer insurance. This includes reinforcing communication on Japan Post sales policy down to the postal branch level, training and education on our latest cancer products and sales proposal strategies, and identifying existing cancer policyholders in the Japan Post system to both explain the benefits of their current products and create an opportunity for potential upgrade. It's important to remember that the Japan Post sales force has been inactive for 18 months. Therefore, product training and sales coaching are critical efforts in the coming months. 
Turning to the U.S., there is approximately 32 million COVID-19 cases and 575,000 deaths as reported by the CDC. As of the end of the first quarter, COVID claimants, since inception of the virus, has totaled approximately 38,000, with incurred claims of $130 million. Along with infection rates declining from peak levels in 2020, our data suggests hospitalization rates and days in the hospital have trended lower. However, infection hotspots in areas of the U.S. remain, and as is the case in Japan, there is concern over a potential fourth wave of infection. Executive orders requiring premium grace periods are still in place in 9 states, with 6 states having open-ended expiration dates. Persistency has improved. However, most of that improvement is attributed to the combination of state orders and lower overall sales as we typically experience higher lapse rates in the first year after the sale. 
Turning to recovery and restore efforts, we have seen our agent channel and small business benefit franchise hurt by the pandemic. It's important to note that roughly 390,000 of our 420,000 U.S. business clients have less than 100 employees. Critical areas of investment include recruiting, training, technology advancement and product development. Key indicators of recovery include agent and broker recruiting, a build in average weekly producers and traction in the rollout of our dental and vision products. 
For the first quarter, we are running at approximately 70% of the average weekly producers during the same period in pre-pandemic 2019. Trends are positive, and we expect to narrow this gap throughout the year, assuming pandemic conditions improve. We are experiencing favorable recruiting numbers, have reopened training centers closed during the pandemic and veteran agents are reengaging after a difficult year. 
We are in the early days of our national rollout of Aflac Network Dental and Vision. Our dental product is approved in 43 states, and vision in 41 states, with more states coming online throughout the year. Network Dental and Vision is critical in the small business marketplace and a key component to agent productivity along with new account growth retention and penetration or seeing more employees at a given employer. This month, we are completing the national training programs, making select product refinements and reinforcing incentives to drive new dental accounts. In addition, we are busy upgrading our administrative platforms to ready for increased volumes. 2021 is the year of launch, learn and adjust, and we expect to see our pipeline, close rate and new accounts gradually increasing throughout the year. Our Premier life and disability platform acquired from Zurich is now operating under the Aflac brand. We have started to see our quoted pipeline build in the last 45 days. However, many employee employers are reluctant to move critical benefit plans while sorting through returning to work site and changing workforce dynamics. 
In addition, consultants often proceed with caution in a year or so after an acquisition. We need to remain patient over the next few years as we settle into this new line of business. Our competitive calling card is the proven premier service and technology capabilities of the acquired platform, coupled with Aflac Group's core leadership in supplemental work site benefits. We will not resort to winning business via relaxed underwriting and pricing standards in this highly competitive market. 
Finally, earlier this year, we launched our new e-commerce direct-to-consumer platform, Aflac Direct. We offer critical illness, accident and cancer and are approved in approximately 30 states with more states and product coming online throughout the year. This platform targets individuals, the self employed, gig workers and part-time employees. In short, those who are not offered traditional benefit packages at the work site. We are actively building out a licensed agent call center to better manage conversion rates and control overall economics. With a modest amount of committed marketing dollars, we are attracting about 500,000 visitors per month to aflac.com. Which has resulted in 120,000 leads for call center conversion this year. We are currently experiencing a 15% conversion rate once in the call center. This is a data analytics-driven business and core metrics will improve as this model matures. 
In terms of the contribution of these businesses to overall sales in 2021, we expect these 3 growth initiatives will make up roughly 10% of sales in 2021 after having contributed less than 5% to 2020 sales. We remain committed to the revenue growth targets discussed at our November investor conference. We expect these initiatives to drive incremental revenue in excess of $1 billion over the next 5 to 7 years. As these separate initiatives mature, they leverage off each other. Network dental and vision drives agent recruitment and conversion to average weekly producers, employer paid benefits drives supplemental work site sales, and direct-to-consumer expands our addressable market while being leveraged to funnel work site leads to our agents in the field. 
In the future, as employees leave the work site, a digital relationship directly with Aflac helps with persistency and customer satisfaction. To close out my comments this morning, we continue to advance ESG initiatives in 2021. As Dan noted, we issued our inaugural sustainability bond, raising $400 million to be invested towards our path to net 0 emissions by 2050 and investments that support climate as well as diversity and inclusion efforts. The bond offering itself is an important step in that it requires formal processes around reporting, tracking and auditing of qualified sustainable investments. This rigor serves to benefit the control environment surrounding our enterprise-wide ESG reporting and accountability. 
In addition, Aflac Global Investments announced late February, a partnership with Sound Point Capital Management to create a new asset management business focused on the transitional real estate loan market. As part of that alliance, we have made an initial $1.5 billion general account allocation to the newly created Sound Point commercial Real Estate Finance, LLC, with $500 million of that amount dedicated to providing transitional and other debt financing to support economically distressed communities designated as qualified opportunity zones. Aflac will hold a 9.9% minority interest in this newly created investment LLC, with the ability to grow our stake over time in line with future growth of the new venture. 
I'll now pass on to Max to discuss our financial performance in more detail. Max?"

Let me follow my comments with a review of our Q1 performance with a focus on how our core capital and earnings drivers have developed.

Let me follow my comments with a review of our Q1 performance with a focus on how our core capital and earnings drivers have developed. For the first quarter, adjusted earnings per share increased 26.4% to $1.53, with a $0.02 positive impact from FX in the quarter. This strong performance for the quarter was largely driven by lower utilization during the pandemic, especially in the U.S. and a lower tax rate compared to last year. Variable investment income $24.5 million above our long-term return expectations. Adjusted book value per share, including foreign currency translation gains and losses, grew 20.6%, and the adjusted ROE, excluding the foreign currency impact, was a strong 16.7%, a significant spread to our cost of capital. 
Starting with our Japan segment. Total earned premium for the quarter declined 3.6%, reflecting per policies paid up impact while earned premium for our third sector product was down 2.2% as sales were under pressure in 2020. Japan's total benefit ratio came in at 68.4% for the quarter, down 100 basis points year-over-year, and the third sector benefit ratio was down -- was 58%, also down 100 basis points year-over-year. We experienced slightly higher than normal IBNR release in our third sector block as experience continues to come in favorable relative to initial. This quarter, it was primarily due to pandemic conditions constraining utilization. Persistency remains strong, with a rate of 95%, up 50 basis points year-over-year. Our expense ratio in Japan was 21.3%, up 130 basis points year-over-year. With improved sales activity, expenses naturally pick up in our technology-related investments into converting Aflac Japan to a paperless company continues, which also includes higher system maintenance expenses. 
Adjusted net investment income increased 6.9% in yen terms, primarily driven by favorable returns on our growing private equity portfolio and lower hedge costs, partially offset by lower reinvestment yield on our fixed and floating rate portfolio. The pretax margin for Japan in the quarter was 23.1%, up 60 basis points year-over-year. A very good start to the year. 
Turning to the U.S. Net earned premium was down 4.1% due to weaker sales results. Persistency improved 240 basis points to 80%, as our efforts to retain accounts and reduce lapsation show early positive results. As Fred noted, there are still 9 states with premium grace periods in place. So we are monitoring these developments closely. Breaking down the 240 basis points persistency rate improvement further. 70 basis points can be explained by the emergency orders in place, 90 basis points by lower sales as first year lapse rates are roughly twice total in-force lapse rates. And the residual of 80 basis points includes conservation efforts executed on last year. Our total benefit ratio came in much lower than expected. At 39.1%, a full 900 basis points lower than Q1 2020. 
In the quarter, we experienced lower paid claims, especially in the month of January. As pandemic conditions impacted behavior of our policyholders. This is in line with disclosures in 2020, indicating a negative correlation between infection levels and claims generating activities like accidents, elective surgeries and physical exams. This low activity level related to nonCOVID claims accounted for most of the year-over-year drop in the benefit ratio. Our total incurred COVID-related claims also came in lower than expected due to an IBNR release. We estimated new COVID claims at approximately $42 million, and this was offset by an IBNR release of $41 million. As our experience accumulates, we have refined our assumptions, and this led to this IBNR reserve release. We expect the benefit ratio to increase gradually throughout the remainder of the year, with the resumption of normal activity in our communities and by our policyholders.. 
For the full year, we now expect our benefit ratio to be towards the lower end or slightly below our guided range of 48% to 51%. Our expense ratio in the U.S. was 38.5%, up 10 basis points year-over-year, but with a lot of moving parts. Weaker sales performance negatively impacts revenue, however, the impact to our expense ratio is largely offset by lower DAC expense. Higher advertising spend increased the expense ratio by 70 basis points along with our continued build-out of growth initiatives, group life and disability, network and direct-to-consumer. These contributed to a 110 basis point increase to the ratio. The strategic growth initiative investments are largely offset by our efforts to lower core operating expenses as we strive towards being the low-cost producer in the voluntary benefit space. Net-net, despite a lot of moving parts, Q1 expenses are tracking according to plan. 
In the quarter, we also incurred $6 million of integration expenses not included in adjusted earnings associated with recent acquisitions. Adjusted net investment income in the U.S. was down 0.6% due to a 22 basis points contraction in the portfolio yield year-over-year, partially offset by favorable variable investment income. Profitability in the U.S. segment was very strong, with a pretax margin of 27.3%, with a low benefit ratio as the core driver. With Q1 now in the books, we are increasing our pretax margin expectation for the full year. Initial expectations were for us to be towards the low end of 16% to 19%. We now expect to end up for the full year towards the high end of this range indicated at. In our corporate segment, we recorded a pretax loss of $26 million as adjusted net investment income was $20 million lower than last year, due to lower interest rates at the short end of the yield curve. Other adjusted expenses were $7 million lower as our cost reduction activities are coming through. Our capital position remains strong, and we ended the quarter with an SMR north of 900% in Japan and an RBC of approximately 563% in Aflac Columbus. Unencumbered holding company liquidity stood at $3.9 billion, $1.5 billion above our minimum balance, excluding the $400 million proceeds from the sustainability bond that we issued in March that reinforced our ESG initiatives and believe that sustainable investments are also good long-term investments. 
Leverage, which includes the sustainability bond, increased but remains at a comfortable 23% in the middle of our leverage corridor of 20% to 25%. In the quarter, we repurchased $650 million of our own stock and paid dividends of $227 million, offering good relative IRR on these capital deployments. We will continue to be flexible and tactical in how we manage the balance sheet and deploy capital in order to drive strong risk-adjusted ROE with a meaningful spread to our cost of capital. 
And with that, I'll hand it over to David to begin Q&A."

So compared to other countries, this number is much smaller. [Foreign Language] And this is -- the reason why we have been able to control much of the infection is because of the nature of our citizens that we normally wear masks, and we care very much about our hygiene. And on top of that, instead of taking the risk, people are really worrying about eating and dining outside, and the restaurants are reducing their business hours, and these things have been very effective. 
[Foreign Language] However, even still then, there has been a number of increase of the new infections in Osaka and Tokyo. And as a result, there is a third declaration of emergency, which was issued on April 25. 
[Foreign Language] However, the third emergency declaration in Japan is not a lockdown. 
[Foreign Language] It is much more focused measure. [Foreign Language] And for example, the state of emergency declaration that was issued this time only covers 4 prefectures, and the period that it covers is up to May 11. So compared with the past state of emergency declarations, it's very much limited in terms of time and location. 
[Foreign Language] However, the government is imposing much stronger restrictions on restaurants and shopping -- large shopping centers that they are asked to shut down their response and shops for the time being. 
[Foreign Language] And the vaccination started in April, starting from the elderly population. And since older population accounts for about 30% of the overall population, we are expecting that this will have a positive effect. 
[Foreign Language] However, the situation of the pandemic is very fluid. Therefore, we really need to watch out for the variance and the vaccination status going forward as well. 
[Foreign Language] And because of the situation and since the COVID-19 infection is still rising it is very difficult to mention how it is going to be going forward in terms of our projection. 
[Foreign Language] But as you can see, as a result of -- in our results of the first quarter, even under the state of emergency declaration, we have been able to promote our medical insurance, and it's been and also because of the extent of the use of online proposals and applications, we haven't been able to mark the same level of performance as this last year. 
[Foreign Language] And even from the second quarter and on, we would like to maintain this positive benefit or positive effect from the medical insurance, and we will also be further expanding the use of online proposals and applications. And on top of that, we would also like to be expanding the enrollment through online for group as well. 
[Foreign Language] And furthermore, we would also like to be using direct mails, which will enhance the non face-to-face solicitation. And by doing so, we should be we should be minimizing the impact from COVID-19. And that's all for me."

We sell product through what we would call retail shops, about a little over 20 of those shops are actually owned by Aflac and about 380 of those shops are through affiliate ownership, and we'll do about JPY 6 billion a year in a normal year of production through those shops. During the peak of the emergency orders in the pandemic in April of 2020, essentially all 400 of those locations were shut. Today, under the state of emergency issued around the Tokyo and Osaka and Kobe area, 13 of those shops are closed. And so it gives you a little bit of a perspective on the difference between the early days of the pandemic and more severe approach to emergency orders and the current period that's trying to balance productivity and businesses remaining open, while at the same time, exercising caution."

But what I would, Fred mentioned this, but I want to reinforce it, is we've got as good a relationship with the new management team as we had, if not better, with the old management team and being large shareholders that they are. They're also very interested and their stock and what they've invested in. And so it's a win-win opportunity. And I think it will be coming back but when you -- we're in uncharted waters with all of this COVID stuff. And so it's hard for us to go out when we don't know about it as well. But look, this is not in any projections, but my gut just tells me, and it's just mind. So for what it's worth, but that it's going to do very well, and it's going to be a little slow in the second quarter. And then they're going to ramp it up. 
The one thing I've seen with the Japanese over the years is they tend to analyze, reanalyze, reanalyze again and then all of a sudden move at once. So you don't -- in the U.S., we kind of ease into it, add a little more, add a little more and then it builds. If you take both groups at the starting line, the U.S. will always take off first. But at some point, halfway through that, Japan will all of a sudden decide, we're ready to go. And they will boil out and then all of a sudden go to that point. I believe we're in that stage right now. I believe that will go through the first quarter. But I think by the end of the year, you're going to see them coming back and pulling out. Aflac Japan is a little bit more reluctant than to say all of that. So I am not speaking on their behalf, but I've been doing this for 31 years. And I just have a real good feeling that also Japan post wants to make money, and they need to do those things. And Aflac's products with cancer insurance are something that consumer wants and needs. So when you add that to it, I would say there's a good chance. 
Now the downside is, something goes wrong with the -- with COVID or something like that. But that's not limited to us. That happens every business out there today. So I'm sure you take that into account. But if you exclude that, I feel pretty good about what's going to be taking place."

As you might recall, it's a JPY 10 billion, roughly 2.5-year investment. And I would say we're probably in the range of JPY 3 billion, perhaps approaching JPY 4 billion of investment to date. It's designed to take about 80 million pieces of paper out of the system. And it's largely oriented around our policyholder services platform, where when the application starts in a paper form, it remains in a paper form through the processing environment. And so we're looking to get that out of the system, and that benefits cost structure. It benefits business recovery because you can move information around the country of Japan, which can be prone to natural disaster, as you know, and so -- and then also finally has environmental benefits, of course. And so that's a big initiative. We expect to save about JPY 3 billion a year in the way of expenses, and it remains on track, and it is closely tied to the digitization of the platform. It's essentially one and the same. It's one of the major efforts, if you will, that's involved in overall digitization of the platform. 
In terms of the $400 million sustainability bond, yes, we have very well-articulated and dedicated plans for the investment of those funds. They largely surround classic sustainability investments, meaning climate, climate-related renewable energy investments. They also include, among other things, investments in opportunity zones in areas that suffer from a lack of income equality. And so those are largely the areas that we're targeting. And as you may know, in the sustainability bond, so-called green bond, et cetera, marketplace. There's very strict and well-defined requirements around what you invest in, the qualification of those investments, the tracking of those investments and the yielding of benefits from those investments. And so while it's a $400 million bond, my point in my comments was it's a much bigger effort for the company because it serves to set the entire structure up for broader-based investment, far greater than $400 million over time, particularly the utilization of our general account on ESG efforts."

At our first quarter conference call 1 year ago, we were facing the early days of the pandemic. At that time, I shared with you actions that we had taken to ensure that we protect the employees, the distribution partners, the policyholders and the communities. I am proud of our response and our ability to handle these challenging times for everyone. Our people first embodies the spirit of corporate culture, which we refer to as The Aflac Way.
Within the pandemic environment, we are encouraged by the production and the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines. But we also recognize that vaccination efforts are still in the early stages around the world. Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone affected. And we are cautiously optimistic, while also remaining diligent.
There is one essential message that I continue to emphasize with our management team. It is imperative that we control the factors we have the ability to control. And what we don't have the ability to control, we must monitor continually to be ready to adapt. This approach allows us to respond in the most effective way possible.
In the first quarter, adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 26.4%. While earnings are off to a strong start for the year, it's important to bear in mind that they are largely supported by a low benefit ratio associated with the pandemic condition.
Before covering our segments, I'll make a few comments about the overall perspective. Pandemic conditions in the first quarter continued to impact our sales results as well as earned premium and revenues, both in the United States and Japan. We continue to expect these pandemic conditions to remain with us through the first half of 2021, but look for improvement in the second half of the year as communities and businesses further open up, allowing more face-to-face interactions.
Despite the effect that sales in both the United States and Japan have been suppressed considerably due to the constrained face-to-face opportunities, we did not sit still. We continued to make progress in integration of our accelerated investment in our platform while continuing strong earnings performance.
Looking at the operations in Japan in the first quarter, Aflac Japan generated solid overall financial results with a profit margin of 23.1%, which was above the outlook range that we provided at the financial analyst briefing. Aflac Japan also reported strong premium persistency of 95%. Sales were essentially flat for the first quarter with the January launch of our new medical product offset by continued impact of the pandemic conditions. We are encouraged by the reception of the new medical product by both consumers and the sales force.
In addition, Japan Post Group's announcement to resume proactive sales in April paves the way for gradual improvement in Aflac's cancer insurance sales in the second half of the year. We are actively working with Japan Post to ready the platform, recognizing that it will take time to return to the full strength.
We continued to navigate evolving pandemic conditions in Japan, including the recent reestablished state of an emergency for Tokyo, Osaka and 2 other prefectures affected from April 25 through May 11. Restrictions will be tightened to curb the movement of people and group activities during the major holiday known as Golden Week.
Turning to the U.S., we saw a strong profit margin of 27.3%. Aflac U.S. also reported very strong premium persistency of 80%. Max will cover the persistency later. Current pandemic conditions continue to notably impact our sales results, largely due to reduced face-to-face activity. As expected, we saw modest sequential sales improvement in the quarter, with an overall decrease of 22.1%.
In the U.S., small businesses are still in the recovery mode, and we expect that they will be that way for most of 2021. At the same time, larger businesses remain focused on returning employees to the work site rather than modifying the benefits for their employees.
We strive to be where the people want to purchase insurance. That applies to both Japan and the United States. In the past, this has meant meeting face-to-face with individuals to understand their situation, propose a solution and close the sale. Face-to-face sales are still the most effective way for us to convey the financial protection only Aflac products provide. However, the pandemic has clearly demonstrated the need for virtual means. In other words, non-face-to-face sales that help us reach potential customers and provide them with the protection that they need.
Even prior to the pandemic, we've been working on building our virtual capacities. Given the current backdrop, we have accelerated investments to enhance the tools available to our distribution in both countries and continue to integrate these investments into our operations.
In addition, we continue to build out the U.S. product portfolio with previously acquired businesses that serve as a base for Aflac network dental and vision and group life, absence management and disability. While these acquisitions have a modest near-term impact on the top line, they better position Aflac for future long-term success in the United States.
Our core earnings drivers which are persistency, underwriting profits, investment income and expense ratios continue to drive strong pretax margins, both in the United States and in Japan. Both Japan and the U.S., we experienced sequential sales growth in the months of January, February and March. In addition, provided we don't experience a setback in terms of pandemic conditions, we're forecasting a sequential increase in absolute sales in the second quarter over the first quarter in both the U.S. and in Japan.
As always, we place significant importance on continuing to achieve strong capital ratios in the U.S. and in Japan on behalf of our policyholders and shareholders. We remain committed to prudent liquidity and capital management. We issued our first sustainability bond in March as we seek to allocate proceeds from the issuance to reinforce our commitment to social and environmental initiatives as we balance purpose for profit.
We treasure our 38-year track record of dividend growth and remain committed to extending it, supported by the strength of our capital and cash flows. At the same time, we will continue to tactically repurchase shares, focus on integrating the growth investments we've made in our platform. By doing so, we look to emerge from this period in a continued position of strength and leadership.
I've always said that the true test of strength is how one handles adversity. This past year confirms what I knew all along, and that is that Aflac is strong, adaptable and resilient. We will continue to work to achieve long-term growth, while also ensuring we deliver on our promise to our policyholders. By doing so, we look to emerge from this period in a continued position of strength and leadership.
I don't think it's a coincidence that we've achieved success while focusing on doing the right things for the policyholders, the shareholders, the employees, the sales distribution, the business partners and the communities. In fact, I believe success and doing the right thing go hand in hand. I'm proud of what we've accomplished by balancing purpose with financial results. This has ultimately translated into a strong, long-term shareholder value.
Now I'll turn the program over to Fred. Fred?"
250178,711188984,2263689,"Aflac Incorporated, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2021",2021-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Aflac Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Dan. I'm going to touch briefly on current pandemic conditions in Japan and the U.S., then focus my comments on efforts to restore our production platform in 2021.Japan has experienced approximately 575,000 COVID cases and 10,000 confirmed de",1542,"Thank you, Dan. I'm going to touch briefly on current pandemic conditions in Japan and the U.S., then focus my comments on efforts to restore our production platform in 2021.
Japan has experienced approximately 575,000 COVID cases and 10,000 confirmed deaths since inception of the virus. Through the first quarter of 2021 and since the inception of the virus, Aflac Japan's COVID impact has totaled approximately 10,500 claimants with incurred claims of JPY 1.9 billion. We continued to experience a low level of paid claims for medical conditions other than COVID as policyholders refrained from routine hospital visits.
There are essentially 3 areas of focus in building back to pre-pandemic levels of production in Japan: our traditional product refreshment activities, online sales driving productivity in the face of pandemic conditions and active engagement with Japan Post to begin the recovery process in cancer insurance sales.
As Dan noted, there has been a positive reception to our revised medical product. This product was designed to better compete in the independent agent channel, where we had seen a decline in market share heading into 2020. Sales of medical insurance are up 34% over the first quarter of 2020 and up 8% over the 2019 quarter. The new product called EVER Prime has enhanced benefits that, on average, result in 5% to 10% more premium per policy versus our old medical product. The product also includes a low claims bonus structure that has contributed to growth among younger demographics.
We have technology in place to allow agents to pivot from face-to-face to virtual sales and an entirely digital customer experience. The agent is not removed from the process. The agent can make the sale and process the policy from point of solicitation to point of issuance entirely online without face-to-face contact. We introduced this capability in October of 2020. And for the month of November, we processed 1,600 applications utilizing this digital experience. In the month of March, that number doubled to approximately 3,200 applications.
Not surprisingly, we are seeing higher adoption rates among younger demographics. On March 26, we launched a national advertising campaign promoting the capability and expect to see increased utilization. We see this capability contributing to productivity even after pandemic conditions subside.
On Japan Post, as Dan noted, we anticipate sales volume will recover gradually in the second half of 2021. Separate from Japan Post activities to revive sales, Aflac Japan is actively supporting recovery in the sale of cancer insurance. This includes reinforcing communication on Japan Post sales policy down to the postal branch level, training and education on our latest cancer products and sales proposal strategies and identifying existing cancer policyholders in the Japan Post system to both explain the benefits of their current products and create an opportunity for potential upgrade. It's important to remember that the Japan Post sales force has been inactive for 18 months. Therefore, product training and sales coaching are critical efforts in the coming months.
Turning to the U.S., there is approximately 32 million COVID-19 cases and 575,000 deaths, as reported by the CDC. As of the end of the first quarter, COVID claimants since inception of the virus has totaled approximately 38,000 with incurred claims of $130 million. Along with infection rates declining from peak levels in 2020, our data suggests hospitalization rates and days in the hospital have trended lower. However, infection hotspots in areas of the U.S. remain. And as is the case in Japan, there is concern over a potential fourth wave of infection.
Executive orders requiring premium grace periods are still in place in 9 states, with 6 states having open-ended expiration dates. Persistency has improved. However, most of that improvement is attributed to the combination of state orders and lower overall sales as we typically experience higher lapse rates in the first year after the sale.
Turning to recovery and restore efforts. We have seen our agent channel and small business benefit franchise hurt by the pandemic. It's important to note that roughly 390,000 of our 420,000 U.S. business clients have less than 100 employees. Critical areas of investment include recruiting, training, technology advancement and product development. Key indicators of recovery include agent and broker recruiting, a build in average weekly producers and traction in the rollout of our dental and vision products.
For the first quarter, we are running at approximately 70% of the average weekly producers during the same period in pre-pandemic 2019. Trends are positive, and we expect to narrow this gap throughout the year, assuming pandemic conditions improve. We are experiencing favorable recruiting numbers, have reopened training centers closed during the pandemic, and veteran agents are reengaging after a difficult year.
We are in the early days of our national rollout of Aflac network dental and vision. Our dental product is approved in 43 states and vision in 41 states, with more states coming online throughout the year. Network dental and vision is critical in the small business marketplace and a key component to agent productivity, along with new account growth, retention and penetration or seeing more employees at a given employer.
This month, we are completing the national training programs, making select product refinements and reinforcing incentives to drive new dental accounts. In addition, we are busy upgrading our administrative platforms to ready for increased volumes. 2021 is the year of launch, learn and adjust, and we expect to see our pipeline, close rate and new accounts gradually increasing throughout the year.
Our premier life and disability platform acquired from Zurich is now operating under the Aflac brand. We have started to see our quoted pipeline build in the last 45 days. However, many employees -- employers are reluctant to move critical benefit plans while sorting through returning to work site and changing workforce dynamics.
In addition, benefit consultants often proceed with caution in a year or so after an acquisition. We need to remain patient over the next few years as we settle into this new line of business. Our competitive calling card is the proven premier service and technology capabilities of the acquired platform, coupled with Aflac Group's core leadership in supplemental work site benefits. We will not resort to winning business via relaxed underwriting and pricing standards in this highly competitive market.
Finally, earlier this year, we launched our new e-commerce direct-to-consumer platform, Aflac Direct. We offer critical illness, accident and cancer and are approved in approximately 30 states with more states and product coming online throughout the year. This platform targets individuals, the self-employed, gig workers and part-time employees. In short, those who are not offered traditional benefit packages at the work site.
We are actively building out a licensed agent call center to better manage conversion rates and control overall economics. With a modest amount of committed marketing dollars, we are attracting about 500,000 visitors per month to aflac.com, which has resulted in 120,000 leads for call center conversion this year. We are currently experiencing a 15% conversion rate once in the call center. This is a data analytics-driven business and core metrics will improve as this model matures.
In terms of the contribution of these businesses to overall sales in 2021, we expect these 3 growth initiatives will make up roughly 10% of sales in 2021 after having contributed less than 5% to 2020 sales. We remain committed to the revenue growth targets discussed at our November investor conference. We expect these initiatives to drive incremental revenue in excess of $1 billion over the next 5 to 7 years.
As these separate initiatives mature, they leverage off each other. Network dental and vision drives agent recruitment and conversion to average weekly producers. Employer paid benefits drives supplemental work site sales, and direct-to-consumer expands our addressable market while being leveraged to funnel work site leads to our agents in the field. In the future, as employees leave the work site, a digital relationship directly with Aflac helps with persistency and customer satisfaction.
To close out my comments this morning, we continue to advance ESG initiatives in 2021. As Dan noted, we issued our inaugural sustainability bond, raising $400 million to be invested towards our path to net zero emissions by 2050 and investments that support climate as well as diversity and inclusion efforts. The bond offering itself is an important step, in that it requires formal processes around reporting, tracking and auditing of qualified sustainable investments. This rigor serves to benefit the control environment surrounding our enterprise-wide ESG reporting and accountability.
In addition, Aflac Global Investments announced late February, a partnership with Sound Point Capital Management to create a new asset management business focused on the transitional real estate loan market. As part of that alliance, we have made an initial $1.5 billion general account allocation to the newly created Sound Point Commercial Real Estate Finance, LLC, with $500 million of that amount dedicated to providing transitional and other debt financing to support economically distressed communities designated as qualified opportunity zones. Aflac will hold a 9.9% minority interest in this newly created investment LLC, with the ability to grow our stake over time in line with future growth of the new venture.
I'll now pass on to Max to discuss our financial performance in more detail. Max?"

Let me start my comments with a review of our Q1 performance with a focus on how our core capital and earnings drivers have developed.
For the first quarter, adjusted earnings per share increased 26.4% to $1.53, with a $0.02 positive impact from FX in the quarter. This strong performance for the quarter was largely driven by lower utilization during the pandemic, especially in the U.S., and a lower tax rate compared to last year.
Variable investment income went $24.5 million above our long-term return expectations. Adjusted book value per share, including foreign currency translation gains and losses, grew 20.6%, and the adjusted ROE, excluding the foreign currency impact, was a strong 16.7%, a significant spread to our cost of capital.
Starting with our Japan segment. Total earned premium for the quarter declined 3.6%, reflecting first sector policies paid-up impact while earned premium for our third sector product was down 2.2%, as sales were under pressure in 2020. Japan's total benefit ratio came in at 68.4% for the quarter, down 100 basis points year-over-year, and the third sector benefit ratio was down -- was 58%, also down 100 basis points year-over-year.
We experienced slightly higher than normal IBNR release in our third sector block as experience continues to come in favorable relative to initial reserving. This quarter, it was primarily due to pandemic conditions constraining utilization. Persistency remains strong, with a rate of 95%, up 50 basis points year-over-year.
Our expense ratio in Japan was 21.3%, up 130 basis points year-over-year. With improved sales activity, expenses naturally pick up and our technology-related investments into converting Aflac Japan to a paperless company continues, which also includes higher system maintenance expenses.
Adjusted net investment income increased 6.9% in yen terms, primarily driven by favorable returns on our growing private equity portfolio and lower hedge costs, partially offset by lower reinvestment yield on our fixed and floating rate portfolio. The pretax margin for Japan in the quarter was 23.1%, up 60 basis points year-over-year. A very good start to the year.
Turning to the U.S. Net earned premium was down 4.1% due to weaker sales results. Persistency improved 240 basis points to 80%, as our efforts to retain accounts and reduce lapsation show early positive results. As Fred noted, there are still 9 states with premium grace periods in place. So we are monitoring these developments closely.
Breaking down the 240 basis points persistency rate improvement further. 70 basis points can be explained by the emergency orders in place; 90 basis points by lower sales as first year lapse rates are roughly twice total in-force lapse rates; and the residual of 80 basis points includes conservation efforts executed on last year.
Our total benefit ratio came in much lower than expected at 39.1%, a full 900 basis points lower than Q1 2020. In the quarter, we experienced lower paid claims, especially in the month of January, as pandemic conditions impacted behavior of our policyholders. This is in line with disclosures in 2020, indicating a negative correlation between infection levels and claims generating activities like accidents, elective surgeries and physical exams.
This low activity level related to non-COVID claims accounted for most of the year-over-year drop in the benefit ratio. Our total incurred COVID-related claims also came in lower than expected due to an IBNR release. We estimated new COVID claims at approximately $42 million, and this was offset by an IBNR release of $41 million. As our experience accumulates, we have refined our assumptions, and this led to this IBNR reserve release.
We expect the benefit ratio to increase gradually throughout the remainder of the year, with the resumption of normal activity in our communities and by our policyholders. For the full year, we now expect our benefit ratio to be towards the lower end or slightly below our guided range of 48% to 51%.
Our expense ratio in the U.S. was 38.5%, up 10 basis points year-over-year, but with a lot of moving parts. Weaker sales performance negatively impacts revenue. However, the impact to our expense ratio is largely offset by lower DAC expense. Higher advertising spend increased the expense ratio by 70 basis points along with our continued build-out of growth initiatives, group life and disability, network dental and vision and direct-to-consumer. These contributed to a 110 basis point increase to the ratio.
The strategic growth initiative investments are largely offset by our efforts to lower core operating expenses as we strive towards being the low-cost producer in the voluntary benefit space. Net-net, despite a lot of moving parts, Q1 expenses are tracking according to plan.
In the quarter, we also incurred $6 million of integration expenses not included in adjusted earnings associated with recent acquisitions. Adjusted net investment income in the U.S. was down 0.6% due to a 22 basis point contraction in the portfolio yield year-over-year, partially offset by favorable variable investment income.
Profitability in the U.S. segment was very strong, with a pretax margin of 27.3%, with a low benefit ratio as the core driver. With Q1 now in the books, we are increasing our pretax margin expectation for the full year. Initial expectations were for us to be towards the low end of 16% to 19%. We now expect to end up for the full year towards the high end of this range indicated at FAB.
In our corporate segment, we recorded a pretax loss of $26 million, as adjusted net investment income was $20 million lower than last year due to lower interest rates at the short end of the yield curve. Other adjusted expenses were $7 million lower as our cost reduction activities are coming through.
Our capital position remained strong, and we ended the quarter with an SMR north of 900% in Japan and an RBC of approximately 563% in Aflac Columbus. Unencumbered holding company liquidity stood at $3.9 billion, $1.5 billion above our minimum balance, excluding the $400 million proceeds from the sustainability bond that we issued in March that reinforced our ESG initiatives and belief that sustainable investments are also good long-term investments.
Leverage, which includes the sustainability bond, increased but remains at a comfortable 23%, in the middle of our leverage corridor of 20% to 25%. In the quarter, we repurchased $650 million of our own stock and paid dividends of $227 million, offering good relative IRR on these capital deployments. We will continue to be flexible and tactical in how we manage the balance sheet and deploy capital in order to drive strong risk-adjusted ROE with a meaningful spread to our cost of capital.
And with that, I'll hand it over to David to begin Q&A."

This is Koide from Japan.[Interpreted] First of all, let me start out with the current situation in Japan, followed by the sales and our business in Japan as well.Well, first of all, as Fred mentioned earlier, the number of infections in Japan is",521,"Yes. This is Koide from Japan.
[Interpreted] First of all, let me start out with the current situation in Japan, followed by the sales and our business in Japan as well.
Well, first of all, as Fred mentioned earlier, the number of infections in Japan is 575,000, and the number of deaths in total is about 10,000. So compared to other countries, this number is much smaller.
And this is -- the reason why we have been able to control much of the infection is because of the nature of our citizens that we normally wear masks and we care very much about our hygiene. And on top of that, instead of taking the risk, people are really worrying about eating and dining outside, and the restaurants are reducing their business hours, and these things have been very effective.
However, even still then, there has been a number of increase of the new infections in Osaka and Tokyo. And as a result, there is a third declaration of emergency, which was issued on April 25.
However, the third emergency declaration in Japan is not a lockdown. It is much more focused measure. And for example, the state of emergency declaration that was issued this time only covers 4 prefectures, and the period that it covers is up to May 11. So compared with the past state of emergency declarations, it's very much limited in terms of time and location.
However, the government is imposing much stronger restrictions on restaurants and shopping -- large shopping centers that they are asked to shut down their restaurants and shops for the time being.
And the vaccination started in April, starting from the elderly population. And since older population accounts for about 30% of the overall population, we are expecting that this will have a positive effect.
However, the situation of the pandemic is very fluid. Therefore, we really need to watch out for the variance and the vaccination status going forward as well.
And because of the situation and since the COVID-19 infection is still rising, it is very difficult to mention how it is going to be going forward in terms of our projection.
But as you can see, as a result of -- in our results of the first quarter, even under the state of emergency declaration, we have been able to promote our medical insurance, and it's been very effective. And also because of the extent of the use of online proposals and applications, we haven't been able to mark the same level of performance as this last year.
And even from the second quarter and on, we would like to maintain this positive benefit or positive effect from the medical insurance, and we will also be further expanding the use of online proposals and applications. And on top of that, we would also like to be expanding the enrollment through online for group solicitation as well.
And furthermore, we would also like to be using direct mails, which will enhance the non-face-to-face solicitation. And by doing so, we should be minimizing the impact from COVID-19. And that's all for me."

During the peak of the emergency orders in the pandemic in April of 2020, essentially all 400 of those locations were shut. Today, under the state of emergency issued around the Tokyo and Osaka and Kobe area, 13 of those shops are closed. And so it gives you a little bit of a perspective on the difference between the early days of the pandemic and more severe approach to emergency orders and the current period that's trying to balance productivity and businesses remaining open, while at the same time, exercising caution."

But what I would -- Fred mentioned this, but I want to reinforce it, is we've got as good a relationship with the new management team as we had, if not better, with the old management team. And being large shareholders that they are, they're also very interested in their stock and what they've invested in. And so it's a win-win opportunity.
And I think it will be coming back but when you -- we're in uncharted waters with all of this COVID stuff. And so it's hard for us to go out when we don't know about it as well. But look, this is not in any projections, but my gut just tells me and it's just mine, so for what it's worth, but that it's going to do very well, and it's going to be a little slow in the second quarter. And then they're going to ramp it up.
The one thing I've seen with the Japanese over the years is they tend to analyze, reanalyze, reanalyze again and then all of a sudden move at once. So you don't -- in the U.S., we kind of ease into it, add a little more, add a little more and then it builds. If you take both groups at the starting line, the U.S. will always take off first. But at some point, halfway through that, Japan will, all of a sudden, decide, we're ready to go. And they will boil out and then all of a sudden go to that point.
I believe we're in that stage right now. I believe that will go through the first quarter. But I think by the end of the year, you're going to see them coming back and pulling out. Aflac Japan is a little bit more reluctant then to say all of that. So I am not speaking on their behalf, but I've been doing this for 31 years. And I just have a real good feeling that also Japan Post wants to make money, and they need to do those things. And Aflac's products with cancer insurance are something that consumer wants and needs. So when you add that to it, I would say there's a good chance.
Now the downside is, something goes wrong with the -- with COVID or something like that. But that's not limited to us. If that happens, that happens to every business out there today. So I'm sure you take that into account. But if you exclude that, I feel pretty good about what's going to be taking place."

It's moving well. As you might recall, it's a JPY 10 billion, roughly 2.5-year investment.

As you might recall, it's a JPY 10 billion, roughly 2.5-year investment. And I would say we're probably in the range of JPY 3 billion, perhaps approaching JPY 4 billion of investment to date. It's designed to take about 80 million pieces of paper out of the system. And it's largely oriented around our policyholder services platform, where when the application starts in a paper form, it remains in a paper form through the processing environment.
And so we're looking to get that out of the system, and that benefits cost structure. It benefits business recovery because you can move information around the country of Japan, which can be prone to natural disaster, as you know, and so -- and then also finally has environmental benefits, of course. And so that's a big initiative. We expect to save about JPY 3 billion a year in the way of expenses, and it remains on track. And it is closely tied to the digitization of the platform. It's essentially one and the same. It's one of the major efforts, if you will, that's involved in overall digitization of the platform.
In terms of the $400 million sustainability bond, yes, we have very well-articulated and dedicated plans for the investment of those funds. They largely surround classic sustainability investments, meaning climate, climate-related renewable energy investments. They also include, among other things, investments in opportunity zones in areas that suffer from a lack of income equality. And so those are largely the areas that we're targeting.
And as you may know, in the sustainability bond, so-called green bond, et cetera, marketplace, there's very strict and well-defined requirements around what you invest in, the qualification of those investments, the tracking of those investments and the yielding of benefits from those investments. And so while it's a $400 million bond, my point in my comments was it's a much bigger effort for the company because it serves to set the entire structure up for broader-based investment, far greater than $400 million over time, particularly the utilization of our general account on ESG efforts."

250178,1674481519,2354167,"Aflac Incorporated, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Aflac Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, David, and good morning, and thank you for joining us. With the pandemic conditions to evolve, we remain cautiously optimistic and vigilant as the vaccination efforts continue in the face of uncertainty associated with the emerging variants. I",1013,"Thank you, David, and good morning, and thank you for joining us. With the pandemic conditions to evolve, we remain cautiously optimistic and vigilant as the vaccination efforts continue in the face of uncertainty associated with the emerging variants. I am proud of our response over the last year and our ability to adapt to what has been a very challenging time for everyone, and I continue to pray each day for everyone affected. 
Adjusted earnings per diluted share, excluding foreign currency impact, increased 24.2% for the quarter and 24.5% for the year. While earnings are off to a very strong start for the first half of the year, it's important to bear in mind that they are largely supported by a low benefit ratio associated with the pandemic conditions as well as a better-than-expected return on alternative investments. At the same time, sales improved year-over-year for the first time during the pandemic in the second quarter in both the United States and Japan. 
As part of our strategy, we strive to be where people want to purchase insurance. That applies to both Japan and the United States. Face-to-face sales are still the most effective way for us to convey the financial protection only Aflac products provide. However, the pandemic has clearly demonstrated the need for virtual means. In other words, non-face-to-face sales that help us reach potential customers and provide them with the protection that they need. We have continued to invest in tools from a distribution in both countries and to integrate these investments into our operation. Recognizing the uncertain nature of recovery from the pandemic, we expect a stronger second half of the year in both countries, especially if the communities and businesses continue to open up, which would allow more face-to-face interactions. 
Keeping vaccinations in mind, right now, I'm addressing our employees in a way that is similar to how I talk to my family, keeping them informed with the medical community by bringing doctors in but also by encouraging them to get COVID-19 vaccinations, as I want people to avoid being sick or even worse, becoming a casualty of the virus or variant. 
Looking at our operations in Japan, in the second quarter, Aflac Japan generated solid financial growth results as reflected in its profit margin of 26.5%. This was above the outlook range provided at the 2020 Financial Analyst Briefing. Aflac Japan also reported strong premium persistency of 94.7%. Sales improved year-over-year, generating an increase of 38.4% for the quarter and 15.7% for the first 6 months. These results reflect easier comps, improved pandemic conditions and a boost from the first quarter launch of our new medical product. 
While sales in the first half of 2021 are at approximately 65% of 2019 levels, we continue to navigate evolving pandemic conditions in Japan. The state of emergency have been in the targeted areas, especially Tokyo and Okinawa. However, cases have begun increasing in Tokyo and Osaka metropolitan area, and we expect the Japanese government to make a determination soon to expand the declaration of the state of emergency to 3 other prefectures surrounding Tokyo and Osaka. But most importantly, these states of emergencies are less restricted and limited in scope, and do not represent lockdowns as experienced in other countries. 
Japan, post-resumption of proactive sales starting in April, is contributing toward a gradual improvement in Aflac's cancer insurance sales, and we continue to work to strengthen the strategic alliance to create a sustained cycle of growth for both companies. In June, for example, Aflac and Japan Post Holding, Japan Post Company and Japan Post Insurance, reached agreements to further the strategic alliance in a matter consistent with Japan Post Group's 5-year medium-term management plan, which was announced in May. While we do not expect this to have an immediate impact on sales recovery, it will further position our company for long-term growth as we respond to customers' needs, provide customer-centric services and create shared value of resolving societal and local community issues. 
Turning to Aflac U.S., we saw a strong profit margin of 24.4 -- 25.4% and very strong premium persistency of 80.1%. As expected, we also saw sequential sales improvement and more opportunities for face-to-face activities. As a result of softer sales a year earlier and more face-to-face opportunities, sales increased 64.1% for the quarter and are at a 73% of the first half of the 2019 levels. 
In the U.S., small businesses are still in a recovery mode, which we expect to continue through 2021. At the same time, larger businesses remain primarily focused on returning employees to the work site. As I stated earlier, we will focus on being able to sell and service customers, whether in-person or virtually. In addition, we continue to build out the U.S. product portfolio with previously acquired businesses, Aflac Network Dental and Vision and Premier Life and Disability. While these acquisitions have a modest near-term impact on the top line, they better position Aflac for future long-term success in the U.S. 
Meanwhile, strong persistency, underwriting profits and investment income continue to drive strong pretax margins in the United States as they do in Japan. As always, we place significant importance on continuing to achieve strong capital ratios in the U.S. and in Japan on behalf of our policyholders and investors. We remain committed to prudent liquidity and capital management. We treasure our 38-year track record of dividend growth and remain committed to extending it, supported by the strength of the capital and the cash flows. At the same time, we will continue to tactically repurchase shares, focus on integrating the growth investments that we've made in our platform. 
We are well positioned as we work toward achieving long-term growth, while also ensuring we deliver on our promise to our policyholders. By doing so, we look to emerge from this period in a continued position of strength and leadership, and look forward to sharing more about the strategic and financial priorities at our financial analyst briefing on November 16, 2021. 
So now I turn the program over to Fred. Fred?"

I'm going to focus my comments on activities to restore our production platform and progress on growth strategies. Beginning with Aflac Japan, we are focused on 3 areas in building back to pre-pandemic levels of production: product development, online or digital assisted sales and specific sales efforts within the Japan Post platform. 
With respect to product development, we continue to see positive reception to our revised medical product, EVER Prime. Medical product sales for the first half of the year are up roughly 48% over the same period in 2020 and have approached pre-pandemic levels down only 4% from the 2019 period. We are gaining back market share in this highly competitive medical market. Earlier this year, we launched our first short-term insurance product under a newly-formed subsidiary called SUDACHI. The product is a small amount, substandard medical product targeting customers who do not qualify for traditional medical coverage. In the second quarter, we have registered close to 600 agencies with SUDACHI and issued about 230 policies. We are in the very early stages of this initiative, but over time, we anticipate adding additional short-term health and income support products. 
We are in the process of developing a new care product aimed at supplemental elderly care coverage provided by the Government of Japan. We will provide strategic context and timing around this product in the coming months, but we believe this product line will mature into a meaningful driver of future third sector sales, with an aging population and in anticipation of a continued shift in financial burden from the government to individuals. 
Turning to distribution, we have technology in place to allow agents to pivot from face-to-face to virtual sales. On March 26, we launched a national advertising campaign promoting this capability. In the second quarter, we have processed over 14,000 online applications as compared to nearly 8,000 in the first quarter. On Japan Post, proposal activity has increased month-to-month as sales training and promotion permeates the 20,000 branches that sell our insurance. Through the month of June, Aflac Japan has conducted over 35,000 training sessions with Japan Post sales agents nationwide, along with providing contact information on nearly 700,000 existing cancer policyholders to inform on the latest coverage advantages. Activities in the third quarter include visits with regional office managers in the JP system and post office visits to reinforce the sales process. 
Turning to the U.S., our group voluntary platform continues to respond well with sales exceeding 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Overall, sales recovery is focused on restoring our agent-driven small business franchise hurt by the pandemic. Critical areas of investment include recruiting, converting recruits to weekly producers and product development. In terms of recruiting, we have refocused our efforts in the past year on broker recruiting, with new appointments exceeding pre-pandemic levels. Appointing small business brokers takes time to convert into production, but is critical to expanding our reach and gaining traction in the dental and vision markets. Individual agent recruiting remains under pressure, and we are running at 70% of weekly producers we enjoyed pre-pandemic. Agent recruiting is impacted by onboarding and training under COVID restrictions, tight labor markets and employment subsidy programs, all of which we expect to subside later in the year. 
Our Network Dental product is approved in 43 states and Vision in 42 states, with more states coming online later in the year. We are completing national training programs and have about 50% of trained agents who have quoted on our new dental and vision product offerings. It's early, however, we continue to see our volume building each month, and over 50% of our dental and vision cases include voluntary benefit sales. We believe this supports our strategic intent to increase access in new accounts and deepen relationships in our existing accounts. As I said last quarter, our 2021 dental and vision strategy can be summed up as a year of launch, learn and adjust. 
Our Premier Life and Disability platform continues to support their key client relationships and are building a pipeline of quoted business. Our service model remains exceptional and since closing, we have not lost any notable accounts and have seen early interest among some of our larger voluntary benefit clients. In fact, this morning, Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont announced the selection of Aflac as administrator for the Connecticut Paid Leave Authority, administering benefits for their statewide paid leave program. This awarded business would not have been possible without our recently-acquired group capabilities. 
With respect to our e-commerce initiative, Aflac Direct, we offer critical illness, accident and cancer and are now approved in 45 states, including California. As a reminder, this platform is focused on reaching customers outside the traditional work site. Like most digital sales platforms, we enjoy higher conversion rates when a digital lead is handed to a licensed call center agent. Currently, most of our leads are funneled to third-party call center platforms and we are actively building out an Aflac licensed call center. Our digital platform overall is experiencing a 16% conversion rate on qualified leads and generally consistent with many digital D2C insurance platforms. Our consumer market strategy also includes digital distribution and product partnerships, and while early in development, are designed to expand access to protection products and increase traffic to our site. Through 6 months in 2021, these 3 platforms, new platforms, have combined for 5% of sales as they are in the early building and development stages. We continue to forecast a strong second half based on increased activity and expect these 3 growth initiatives will contribute upwards of 15% to sales in the second half of 2021. 
Aflac Global Investments announced last week, an investment partnership with Denham Capital. Aflac has made a $2 billion multiyear general account commitment to launch a new debt platform focused on investing in the senior secured debt of sustainable infrastructure projects. Aflac will hold a 24.9% minority interest in a newly-created entity Denham Sustainable Infrastructure. We are also making a $100 million commitment to Denham Equity Fund, focused on sustainable infrastructure investments. We are pleased to partner with Denham, a recognized and leading investment firm, in the sustainable infrastructure markets. Under Eric's leadership, this transaction furthers our strategy of partnering with external managers. We seek alliances with firms that maintain strong track records in specialized asset classes that play an important role in our portfolio. We then leverage our capital to take a minority stake to further maximize the potential benefits. When combined with our recent Sound Point capital investment, we advance our ESG efforts by investing in sustainable infrastructure and distressed communities across the U.S.

Let me begin my comments with a review of our Q2 performance, with a focus on our core capital and earnings drivers have developed. For the second quarter, adjusted earnings per share increased 24.2% to $1.59. The slightly weaker yen-dollar exchange rate did not have a significant impact on adjusted earnings per diluted share. This strong performance for the quarter was largely driven by lower claims utilization due to the pandemic, especially in the U.S. 
In addition, variable investment income [ landed ] $112 million above our long-term return expectations. Adjusted book value per share, including foreign currency translation gains and losses, grew 20.5%. And the adjusted ROE, excluding foreign currency impact, was a strong 17%, which is a significant spread to our cost of capital. 
Starting with our Japan segment, total earned premium for the quarter declined 3.8%, reflecting the impact of first sector policies reaching paid-up status, while earned premium for our third sector products was down 2.3% due to recent low sales volumes. Japan's total benefit ratio came in at 66.9% for the quarter, down 290 basis points year-over-year and the third sector benefit ratio was 56.5%, down 305 basis points year-over-year. We experienced a slightly higher-than-normal IBNR release in our third sector block as experience continues to come in favorable relative to initial reserving. This quarter, the IBNR release was primarily due to pandemic conditions, constraining utilization since second quarter of 2020 and year-to-date. Although claims activity have begun to rebound, it remains below longer-term normalized levels. Auto claim reporting lags require up to a year to mature the data. And now with more than a year's worth of pandemic data, our estimates are more refined, which has led to increased IBNR releases. Persistency was down 10 basis points, yet remained strong at 94.7%. 
Our adjusted expense ratio in Japan was 20.8%, up 80 basis points year-over-year. We continue our technology-related investments to convert Aflac Japan to a paperless company, which also includes higher system maintenance expenses. Additional telework expenses also added to the higher expense ratio in the quarter. Adjusted net investment income increased 27.4% in yen terms, primarily driven by favorable returns on our growing alternatives portfolio and lower hedge costs, partially offset by lower reinvestment yields on our fixed rate portfolio. The pretax margin for Japan in the quarter was 26.5%, up 450 basis points year-over-year, which was a very favorable result for the quarter. This quarter's strong financial results leads us to expect the full year benefit ratio for Japan to be at the lower end of the 3-year guidance range of 68.5% to 71% [ given at Fab ]. And the pretax margin to be at the higher end of the 20.5% to 22.5% range. 
Turning to U.S. results, net earned premium was down 3.4% due to weaker sales results. Persistency improved 180 basis points to [ 80.1% ]. 63 basis points of the elevated persistency in both the second quarter of this year and the prior year can be explained by emergency orders. So there was no net impact for the quarter year-over-year. 80 basis points of improved persistence in the quarter is attributed to lower sales, as first year lapse rates are roughly twice total in-force lapse rates. Another 30 basis points of improved persistency is due to conservation efforts and the remainder largely comes from improved experience. Our total benefit ratio came in lower than expected at 43.5% or 80 basis points lower than Q2 2020, which itself was heavily impacted by the initial pandemic. 
Lower claims utilization impact our estimates for incurred claims as data matures over the course of the year. As our data matures, we increased our reliance on raw data and with a year of pandemic data behind us, we reduced our IBNR to reflect the lower utilization. This quarter, IBNR releases amounted to 5.6 percentage points impact on the benefit ratio, which leads to an underlying benefit ratio, excluding IBNR releases, of 49.1%. We expect the benefit ratio to increase gradually throughout the remainder of the year, with the resumption of normal activity in our communities and by our policyholders. For the full year, we now expect our benefit ratio to be in the range of 45% to 48% versus our original guidance of 48% to 51%. 
Our expense ratio in the U.S. was 36.9%, up 160 basis points year-over-year, but with a lot of moving parts. Weaker sales performance negatively impacts revenue, however, the impact to our expense ratio is offset by lower DAC and commission expense. Higher advertising spend increased the expense ratio by 60 basis points. Our continued buildout of growth initiatives, group life and disability, network dental and vision and direct consumer contributed to a 170 basis point increase to the ratio. These strategic growth investments are largely offset by our efforts to lower core operating expenses as we strive towards being the low-cost producer in the voluntary benefits space. 
Net-net, despite a lot of moving parts, Q2 expenses are tracking according to plan. In the quarter, we also incurred $5.5 million of integration and transition expenses not included in adjusted earnings associated with recent acquisitions. Adjusted net investment income in the U.S. was up 9.9%, mainly driven by favorable variable investment income in the quarter. Profitability in the U.S. segment was very strong with a pretax margin of 25.4%, with a low benefit ratio as the core driver. With the first half now in the books, we are increasing our pretax margin expectation for the full year. Initial expectations were for us to be towards the low end of 16% to 19%. We now expect to end up slightly above the range indicated at fab. 
In our Corporate segment, we recorded a pretax loss of $76 million, as adjusted net investment income was $45 million lower than last year due to low interest rates at the short end of the yield curve and amortization of certain tax credit investments, which amounted to $30 million this quarter held at the corporate level. Under U.S. GAAP, we recognized a negative impact to corporate NII but this is offset by a lower effective tax rate for the enterprise. This results in a level of reported volatility to our Corporate segment, but the economic returns on these investments are above our cost of equity capital. To date, these investments are performing well and in line with expectations. 
Our capital position remains strong, and we ended the quarter with an SMR above 900% in Japan and an RBC of approximately 600% in Aflac Columbus. Unencumbered holding company liquidity stood at $4.4 billion, which was $2 billion above our minimum balance, excluding the $400 million proceeds from the sustainability bond that we issued in March that reinforced our ESG initiatives and believe that sustainable investments are also good long-term investments. 
Leverage, which includes our sustainability bond, remains at a comfortable 22.8%, in the middle of our leverage corridor of 20% to 25%. In the quarter, we repurchased $500 million of our own stock and paid dividends of $223 million, offering good relative IRR on these capital deployments. We will continue to be flexible and practical in how we manage the balance sheet and deploy capital to drive strong risk-adjusted ROE, with a meaningful spread to our cost of capital. 
With that, I'll hand it over to David to begin the Q&A."

So now let me start to talk about Aflac Japan's sales results in the first and the second quarter. And under the current COVID situation, let me first of all, touch upon the new medical product that we launched, which was also discussed earlier, as was discussed past, we have achieved 48.1% increase year-on-year. And also under this COVID situation, the online acquisition has become very popular and become a common means for application.
As a result, we have been able to have very active moves and active activities under the current environment. And that's what is -- what was covered by Dan, as he said, we are at about 65% of where we were in 2019. And that's it for me."

Now this is from Japan. So let me answer your question regarding Japan. 
In Japan, although we have been limiting the number of people, our employees to come on site under the state of emergency, sales activities are continuing. And the state of emergency declaration in Japan is different from the lockdown situation in the U.S. And the purpose of the state of emergency declaration in Japan is to really control the people's movement from one place to another. As a result, there is really not that much impact to our sales activity during day time. 
And the current state of emergency declaration is imposed to just Tokyo and Okinawa. And so as we do try to prevent being affected, those activities are being done with full prevention nationwide. And the areas outside of the state of emergency declaration are able to do the normal course of sales. And on top of that, we have online consultation and applications that have spread nationwide. And that those -- these measures have taken root under this kind of an environment, we do believe that we can be quite successful in our sales activities."

So the product under development of all things that are very important, one is the product risk involved in the -- is not be confused with what you may be familiar with relative to U.S. long-term care. And there's some very fundamental reasons for that. This is a supplemental product and it supplements the actual elderly care government support mechanism. And so it's a very specific supplement to that government platform as opposed to broader universal care medical coverage. And it also is being designed to where payments are more on a lump sum basis for some of the lower levels of assisted care. And then when you move into the more significant levels of assisted care, it's more of a defined annuity-type benefit. 
The reason I describe it that way is realize you do not have the escalating benefit structures such as health care inflation, you don't have the tail risk that's assumed with more of a lifetime coverage, if you will, once moving into assisted living. Therefore, you're not building nearly the reserves and therefore, don't have nearly the interest rate risk well. So there's several different reasons why this should not be confused, for example, with other types of riskier elderly care support. It really is a supplemental defined mechanism. 
The other is it plays directly off the qualifications of the government program, so it has a more narrow definition of what is covered and what is not covered than you might be used to in the U.S. because it plays off those definitions. Now one thing to keep in mind is that this is the third largest third sector platform in Japan. This is not a new area that's newly developed. It's been in existence. But it's a smaller area of sales. To give you an idea, it's probably roughly 1/4 of the size of the medical supplemental industry in Japan. The key, however, is that we expect it to grow, that with an aging population and what we believe or at least suspect, will be a gradual shifting of burden on to individuals or their families related to elderly care, that this will be a building platform over time. And so we want to get in there now. We want to get in there with a competitive product, and we want to leverage off of our third sector prominence. 
So that is the strategy. We will tell you more about this and build out more around this strategy when we get to our investor conference, because it will be more developed at that time. But it's clearly something we think could be a difference maker in the future as we move forward."

It's a narrower group of players than you will find with traditional first sector and some of the larger categories of third sector, notably medical, but they are largely domestic players. 
One other aspect of this business that's important to understand is that many of the players that build successful market share in this industry don't just sell the care insurance. They also surround the insurance with other noninsurance services that supplement elderly care. A good example would be things like smart home technology that helps prevent frankly, elderly individuals of going on claim or better managing concierge-type service to help the elderly manage the many different moving parts necessary to settle into an assisted living atmosphere. 
So alongside this product, we're also building within an incubated business, other care-like noninsurance services because that is one of the keys to building market share. So it's a larger and more expansive platform if you intend to be a leader in this business, which we do. And again, we'll build more color around that as we go forward."

In fact, Connecticut was the tenth to put together this medical -- family leave programs in their state. And we do believe that there's the opportunity for this to expand into further states in the future. These require typically fairly expensive legislative activities within each of the states. And because these are programs that cover effectively the employees of all the qualified or opted-in employers in the state. 
To give you an idea, in Connecticut, we are projecting when you add up the qualified employers who are likely to opt into this program, that the coverage may include as much as a bit in excess of 1.5 million potential participants in the state of Connecticut. So this is a substantial platform, but the nature of it and the nature of the program, and the fact that it is a state-organized benefit program offered up to opted-in employees means legislative activity typically needs to take place. That takes time and obviously, it can depend on the political atmosphere and the prioritization dynamics within the state legislators. 
So right now, 10 states, but we believe it will expand. I think a lot of that expansion, frankly, is going to be based on the success and receptivity of the programs that are already in place. The good news is that Connecticut is a very important client for us. We were very pleased to be awarded that. It's the capabilities of our acquired business from Zurich that allowed us to bid and be qualified to run that program, and we expect to use this as a foothold to entertain additional states."

And so some states do it in-house, some states outsource it. So there's a mix of providers. 
One thing that's important is you're not taking a risk on this. And so some would consider this an extensive PPA platform or administrative-only platform. So you're not really competing on what you would call traditional insurance parameters. You're competing on ability to administer the technology and service level that you drive to the consumer. So one of the reasons why we like this contract is it really sends a strong statement to the marketplace that if you're an employer, you don't get this kind of contract unless you have premier service capabilities, strong technology and great customer service, without that, you'd never qualify for these programs.

With the pandemic conditions to evolve, we remain cautiously optimistic and vigilant as the vaccination efforts continue in the face of uncertainty associated with the emerging variants. I",1012,"Thank you, David, and good morning, and thank you for joining us. With the pandemic conditions to evolve, we remain cautiously optimistic and vigilant as the vaccination efforts continue in the face of uncertainty associated with the emerging variants. I am proud of our response over the last year and our ability to adapt to what has been a very challenging time for everyone, and I continue to pray each day for everyone affected.  
Adjusted earnings per diluted share, excluding foreign currency impact, increased 24.2% for the quarter and 24.5% for the year. While earnings are off to a very strong start for the first half of the year, it's important to bear in mind that they are largely supported by a low benefit ratio associated with the pandemic conditions as well as a better-than-expected return on alternative investments. At the same time, sales improved year-over-year for the first time during the pandemic in the second quarter in both the United States and Japan.  
As part of our strategy, we strive to be where people want to purchase insurance. That applies to both Japan and the United States. Face-to-face sales are still the most effective way for us to convey the financial protection only Aflac products provide. However, the pandemic has clearly demonstrated the need for virtual means. In other words, non-face-to-face sales that help us reach potential customers and provide them with the protection that they need.  
We have continued to invest in tools from a distribution in both countries and to integrate these investments into our operation. Recognizing the uncertain nature of recovery from the pandemic, we expect a stronger second half of the year in both countries, especially if the communities and businesses continue to open up, which would allow more face-to-face interactions.  
Keeping vaccinations in mind, right now, I'm addressing our employees in a way that is similar to how I talk to my family, keeping them informed with the medical community by bringing doctors in but also by encouraging them to get COVID-19 vaccinations as I want people to avoid being sick or even worse, becoming a casualty of the virus or variant.  
Looking at our operations in Japan, in the second quarter, Aflac Japan generated solid financial growth results as reflected in its profit margin of 26.5%. This was above the outlook range provided at the 2020 Financial Analyst Briefing. Aflac Japan also reported strong premium persistency of 94.7%. Sales improved year-over-year, generating an increase of 38.4% for the quarter and 15.7% for the first 6 months. These results reflect easier comps, improved pandemic conditions and a boost from the first quarter launch of our new medical product.  
While sales in the first half of 2021 are at approximately 65% of 2019 levels, we continue to navigate evolving pandemic conditions in Japan. The states of emergency have been in the targeted areas, especially Tokyo and Okinawa. However, cases have begun increasing in Tokyo and Osaka metropolitan area, and we expect the Japanese government to make a determination soon to expand the declaration of the state of emergency to 3 other prefectures surrounding Tokyo and Osaka. But most importantly, these states of emergencies are less restricted and limited in scope and do not represent lockdowns as experienced in other countries.  
Japan, post-resumption of proactive sales starting in April, is contributing toward a gradual improvement in Aflac's cancer insurance sales, and we continue to work to strengthen the strategic alliance to create a sustained cycle of growth for both companies. In June, for example, Aflac and Japan Post Holding, Japan Post Company and Japan Post Insurance, reached agreements to further the strategic alliance in a matter consistent with Japan Post Group's 5-year medium-term management plan, which was announced in May. While we do not expect this to have an immediate impact on sales recovery, it will further position our company for long-term growth as we respond to customers' needs, provide customer-centric services and create shared value of resolving societal and local community issues.  
Turning to Aflac U.S., we saw a strong profit margin of 24.4 -- 25.4% and very strong premium persistency of 80.1%. As expected, we also saw sequential sales improvement and more opportunities for face-to-face activities. As a result of softer sales a year earlier and more face-to-face opportunities, sales increased 64.1% for the quarter and are at a 73% of the first half of the 2019 levels.  
In the U.S., small businesses are still in a recovery mode, which we expect to continue through 2021. At the same time, larger businesses remain primarily focused on returning employees to the worksite. As I stated earlier, we will focus on being able to sell and service customers, whether in-person or virtually. In addition, we continue to build out the U.S. product portfolio with previously acquired businesses, Aflac Network Dental and Vision and Premier Life and Disability. While these acquisitions have a modest near-term impact on the top line, they better position Aflac for future long-term success in the U.S.  
Meanwhile, strong persistency, underwriting profits and investment income continue to drive strong pretax margins in the United States as they do in Japan. As always, we place significant importance on continuing to achieve strong capital ratios in the U.S. and in Japan on behalf of our policyholders and investors. We remain committed to prudent liquidity and capital management. We treasure our 38-year track record of dividend growth and remain committed to extending it, supported by the strength of the capital and the cash flows. At the same time, we will continue to tactically repurchase shares, focus on integrating the growth investments that we've made in our platform.  
We are well positioned as we work toward achieving long-term growth, while also ensuring we deliver on our promise to our policyholders. By doing so, we look to emerge from this period in a continued position of strength and leadership and look forward to sharing more about the strategic and financial priorities at our financial analyst briefing on November 16, 2021.  
So now I turn the program over to Fred. Fred?"
250178,1674481519,2354558,"Aflac Incorporated, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Aflac Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Dan. I'm going to focus my comments on activities to restore our production platform and progress on growth strategies.

I'm going to focus my comments on activities to restore our production platform and progress on growth strategies. Beginning with Aflac Japan, we are focused on 3 areas in building back to pre-pandemic levels of production: product development, online or digital assisted sales and specific sales efforts within the Japan Post platform. 
With respect to product development, we continue to see positive reception to our revised medical product, EVER Prime. Medical product sales for the first half of the year are up roughly 48% over the same period in 2020 and have approached pre-pandemic levels down only 4% from the 2019 period. We are gaining back market share in this highly competitive medical market. Earlier this year, we launched our first short-term insurance product under a newly-formed subsidiary called SUDACHI. The product is a small amount, substandard medical product targeting customers who do not qualify for traditional medical coverage. In the second quarter, we have registered close to 600 agencies with SUDACHI and issued about 230 policies. We are in the very early stages of this initiative, but over time, we anticipate adding additional short-term health and income support products. 
We are in the process of developing a new care product aimed at supplemental elderly care coverage provided by the Government of Japan. We will provide strategic context and timing around this product in the coming months, but we believe this product line will mature into a meaningful driver of future third sector sales, with an aging population and in anticipation of a continued shift in financial burden from the government to individuals. 
Turning to distribution, we have technology in place to allow agents to pivot from face-to-face to virtual sales. On March 26, we launched a national advertising campaign promoting this capability. In the second quarter, we have processed over 14,000 online applications as compared to nearly 8,000 in the first quarter. On Japan Post, proposal activity has increased month-to-month as sales training and promotion permeates the 20,000 branches that sell our insurance. Through the month of June, Aflac Japan has conducted over 35,000 training sessions with Japan Post sales agents nationwide, along with providing contact information on nearly 700,000 existing cancer policyholders to inform on the latest coverage advantages. Activities in the third quarter include visits with regional office managers in the JP system and post office visits to reinforce the sales process. 
Turning to the U.S., our group voluntary platform continues to respond well with sales exceeding 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Overall, sales recovery is focused on restoring our agent-driven small business franchise hurt by the pandemic. Critical areas of investment include recruiting, converting recruits to weekly producers and product development. In terms of recruiting, we have refocused our efforts in the past year on broker recruiting, with new appointments exceeding pre-pandemic levels. Appointing small business brokers takes time to convert into production but is critical to expanding our reach and gaining traction in the dental and vision markets. Individual agent recruiting remains under pressure, and we are running at 70% of weekly producers we enjoyed pre-pandemic. Agent recruiting is impacted by onboarding and training under COVID restrictions, tight labor markets and employment subsidy programs, all of which we expect to subside later in the year. 
Our Network Dental product is approved in 43 states and Vision in 42 states, with more states coming online later in the year. We are completing national training programs and have about 50% of trained agents who have quoted on our new dental and vision product offerings. It's early, however, we continue to see our volume building each month, and over 50% of our dental and vision cases include voluntary benefit sales. We believe this supports our strategic intent to increase access in new accounts and deepen relationships in our existing accounts. As I said last quarter, our 2021 dental and vision strategy can be summed up as a year of launch, learn and adjust. 
Our Premier Life and Disability platform continues to support their key client relationships and are building a pipeline of quoted business. Our service model remains exceptional. And since closing, we have not lost any notable accounts and have seen early interest among some of our larger voluntary benefit clients. In fact, this morning, Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont announced the selection of Aflac as administrator for the Connecticut Paid Leave Authority, administering benefits for their statewide paid leave program. This awarded business would not have been possible without our recently-acquired group capabilities. 
With respect to our e-commerce initiative, Aflac Direct, we offer critical illness, accident and cancer and are now approved in 45 states, including California. As a reminder, this platform is focused on reaching customers outside the traditional work site. Like most digital sales platforms, we enjoy higher conversion rates when a digital lead is handed to a licensed call center agent. Currently, most of our leads are funneled to third-party call center platforms, and we are actively building out an Aflac licensed call center. Our digital platform overall is experiencing a 16% conversion rate on qualified leads and generally consistent with many digital D2C insurance platforms. Our consumer market strategy also includes digital distribution and product partnerships, and while early in development, are designed to expand access to protection products and increase traffic to our site. Through 6 months in 2021, these 3 platforms, new platforms, have combined for 5% of sales as they are in the early building and development stages. We continue to forecast a strong second half based on increased activity and expect these 3 growth initiatives will contribute upwards of 15% to sales in the second half of 2021. 
Aflac Global Investments announced last week, an investment partnership with Denham Capital. Aflac has made a $2 billion multiyear general account commitment to launch a new debt platform focused on investing in the senior secured debt of sustainable infrastructure projects. Aflac will hold a 24.9% minority interest in a newly-created entity Denham Sustainable Infrastructure. We are also making a $100 million commitment to Denham Equity Fund, focused on sustainable infrastructure investments. We are pleased to partner with Denham, a recognized and leading investment firm, in the sustainable infrastructure markets. Under Eric's leadership, this transaction furthers our strategy of partnering with external managers. We seek alliances with firms that maintain strong track records in specialized asset classes that play an important role in our portfolio. We then leverage our capital to take a minority stake to further maximize the potential benefits. When combined with our recent Sound Point capital investment, we advance our ESG efforts by investing in sustainable infrastructure and distressed communities across the U.S.

Let me begin my comments with a review of our Q2 performance, with a focus on our core capital and earnings drivers have developed.

Let me begin my comments with a review of our Q2 performance, with a focus on our core capital and earnings drivers have developed. For the second quarter, adjusted earnings per share increased 24.2% to $1.59. The slightly weaker yen-dollar exchange rate did not have a significant impact on adjusted earnings per diluted share. This strong performance for the quarter was largely driven by lower claims utilization due to the pandemic, especially in the U.S. 
In addition, variable investment income [ ran ] $112 million above our long-term return expectations. Adjusted book value per share, including foreign currency translation gains and losses, grew 20.5%. And the adjusted ROE, excluding foreign currency impact, was a strong 17%, which is a significant spread to our cost of capital. 
Starting with our Japan segment, total earned premium for the quarter declined 3.8%, reflecting the impact of first sector policies reaching paid-up status, while earned premium for our third sector products was down 2.3% due to recent low sales volumes. Japan's total benefit ratio came in at 66.9% for the quarter, down 290 basis points year-over-year. And the third sector benefit ratio was 56.5%, down 305 basis points year-over-year. We experienced a slightly higher-than-normal IBNR release in our third sector block as experience continues to come in favorable relative to initial reserving. This quarter, the IBNR release was primarily due to pandemic conditions, constraining utilization since second quarter of 2020 and year-to-date. Although claims activity have begun to rebound, it remains below longer-term normalized levels. Auto claim reporting lags require up to a year to mature the data. And now with more than a year's worth of pandemic data, our estimates are more refined, which has led to increased IBNR releases. Persistency was down 10 basis points, yet remained strong at 94.7%. 
Our adjusted expense ratio in Japan was 20.8%, up 80 basis points year-over-year. We continue our technology-related investments to convert Aflac Japan to a paperless company, which also includes higher system maintenance expenses. Additional telework expenses also added to the higher expense ratio in the quarter. Adjusted net investment income increased 27.4% in yen terms, primarily driven by favorable returns on our growing alternatives portfolio and lower hedge costs, partially offset by lower reinvestment yield on our fixed rate portfolio. The pretax margin for Japan in the quarter was 26.5%, up 450 basis points year-over-year, which was a very favorable result for the quarter. This quarter's strong financial results leads us to expect the full year benefit ratio for Japan to be at the lower end of the 3-year guidance range of 68.5% to 71% given at Fab. And the pretax margin to be at the higher end of the 20.5% to 22.5% range. 
Turning to U.S. results, net earned premium was down 3.4% due to weaker sales results. Persistency improved 180 basis points to [ 80.1% ]. 63 basis points of the elevated persistency in both the second quarter of this year and the prior year can be explained by emergency orders. So there was no net impact for the quarter year-over-year. 80 basis points of improved persistency in the quarter is attributed to lower sales, as first year lapse rates are roughly twice total in-force lapse rates. Another 30 basis points of improved persistency is due to conservation efforts, and the remainder largely comes from improved experience. Our total benefit ratio came in lower than expected at 43.5% or 80 basis points lower than Q2 2020, which, itself, was heavily impacted by the initial pandemic. 
Lower claims utilization impact our estimates for incurred claims as data matures over the course of the year. As our data matures, we increased our reliance on raw data, and with a year of pandemic data behind us, we reduced our IBNR to reflect the lower utilization. This quarter, IBNR releases amounted to 5.6 percentage points impact on the benefit ratio, which leads to an underlying benefit ratio, excluding IBNR releases, of 49.1%. We expect the benefit ratio to increase gradually throughout the remainder of the year, with the resumption of normal activity in our communities and by our policyholders. For the full year, we now expect our benefit ratio to be in the range of 45% to 48% versus our original guidance of 48% to 51%. 
Our expense ratio in the U.S. was 36.9%, up 160 basis points year-over-year but with a lot of moving parts. Weaker sales performance negatively impacts revenue, however, the impact to our expense ratio is offset by lower DAC and commission expense. Higher advertising spend increased the expense ratio by 60 basis points. Our continued buildout of growth initiatives, group life and disability, network dental and vision and direct to consumer contributed to a 170 basis point increase to the ratio. These strategic growth investments are largely offset by our efforts to lower core operating expenses as we strive towards being the low-cost producer in the voluntary benefits space. 
Net-net, despite a lot of moving parts, Q2 expenses are tracking according to plan. In the quarter, we also incurred $5.5 million of integration and transition expenses not included in adjusted earnings associated with recent acquisitions. Adjusted net investment income in the U.S. was up 9.9%, mainly driven by favorable variable investment income in the quarter. Profitability in the U.S. segment was very strong with a pretax margin of 25.4%, with a low benefit ratio as the core driver. With the first half now in the books, we are increasing our pretax margin expectation for the full year. Initial expectations were for us to be towards the low end of 16% to 19%. We now expect to end up slightly above the range indicated at fab. 
In our Corporate segment, we recorded a pretax loss of $76 million, as adjusted net investment income was $45 million lower than last year due to low interest rates at the short end of the yield curve and amortization of certain tax credit investments, which amounted to $30 million this quarter held at the corporate level. Under U.S. GAAP, we recognized a negative impact to corporate NII, but this is offset by a lower effective tax rate for the enterprise. This results in a level of reported volatility to our Corporate segment, but the economic returns on these investments are above our cost of equity capital. To date, these investments are performing well and in line with expectations. 
Our capital position remains strong, and we ended the quarter with an SMR above 900% in Japan and an RBC of approximately 600% in Aflac Columbus. Unencumbered holding company liquidity stood at $4.4 billion, which was $2 billion above our minimum balance, excluding the $400 million proceeds from the sustainability bond that we issued in March that reinforced our ESG initiatives and believe that sustainable investments are also good long-term investments. 
Leverage, which includes our sustainability bond, remains at a comfortable 22.8%, in the middle of our leverage corridor of 20% to 25%. In the quarter, we repurchased $500 million of our own stock and paid dividends of $223 million, offering good relative IRR on these capital deployments. We will continue to be flexible and tactical in how we manage the balance sheet and deploy capital to drive the strong risk-adjusted ROE, with a meaningful spread to our cost of capital. 
With that, I'll hand it over to David to begin the Q&A."

First, you heard from Fred say that we are very pleased to install in our group side of the business, we trended positive and favorably once again. We're trending right now about 117% of 2019. Looking strong. We're looking good with our buy-to-build platforms. We expected to hit our goals for the end of the year. And then I'll turn to our individual block of the business was really driven by our career channel. We ran into some headwinds, as you can see, with career recruits. 
Overall, recruiting looks strong though. We surpassed our Q1 numbers with our Q2. We're looking strong with our veteran recruits. One of the things I look at daily is our veterans getting back to business. In Q1, 73%, we were in 2019 level with our veteran average week of producers. In the second quarter, we were at 78%, so showing a favorable increase there, and we're looking for that to increase throughout the second half of the year and have a strong third and fourth quarter. So overall, I would say we're performing just right at plan when it comes to what we're expecting, a little bit behind with the credit channel but exceeding with the group channel."

So now let me start to talk about Aflac Japan's sales results in the first and the second quarter. And under the current COVID situation, let me first of all, touch upon the new medical product that we launched, which was also discussed earlier. As was discussed, we have achieved 48.1% increase year-on-year. And also under this COVID situation, the online acquisition has become very popular and become a common means for application.
As a result, we have been able to have very active moves and active activities under the current environment. And that's what is -- what was covered by Dan, as he said, we are at about 65% of where we were in 2019. And that's it for me."

Now this is from Japan. So let me answer your question regarding Japan. 
In Japan, although we have been limiting the number of people, our employees to come on site under the state of emergency, sales activities are continuing. And the state of emergency declaration in Japan is different from the lockdown situation in the U.S. And the purpose of the state of emergency declaration in Japan is to really control the people's movement from one place to another. As a result, there is really not that much impact to our sales activity during day time. 
And the current state of emergency declaration is imposed to just Tokyo and Okinawa. And so as we do try to prevent being infected, those activities are being done with full prevention nationwide. And the areas outside of the state of emergency declaration are able to do the normal course of sales. And on top of that, we have online consultation and applications that have spread nationwide. And that -- those -- these measures have taken root. Under this kind of an environment, we do believe that we can be quite successful in our sales activities."

Now the new recruits, as Virgil mentioned, is harder simply because the labor market, as you can imagine, if you're having trouble with people coming to work based on salary, it's even more difficult with commissions. But all in all, we've got a lot of licensed people out there that we just need to get back.

So the care product under development, a couple things that are very important. One is the product risk involved in the -- is not to be confused with what you may be familiar with relative to U.S. long-term care. And there's some very fundamental reasons for that. This is a supplemental product, and it supplements the actual elderly care government support mechanism. And so it's a very specific supplement to that government platform as opposed to broader universal care medical coverage. And it also is being designed to where payments are more on a lump sum basis for some of the lower levels of assisted care. And then when you move into the more significant levels of assisted care, it's more of a defined annuity-type benefit. 
The reason I describe it that way is realize you do not have the escalating benefit structures such as health care inflation. You don't have the tail risk that's assumed with more of a lifetime coverage, if you will, once moving into assisted living. Therefore, you're not building nearly the reserves and therefore, don't have nearly the interest rate risk well. So there's several different reasons why this should not be confused, for example, with other types of riskier elderly care support. It really is a supplemental defined mechanism. 
The other is it plays directly off the qualifications of the government program, and so it has a more narrow definition of what is covered and what is not covered than you might be used to in the U.S. because it plays off those definitions. Now one thing to keep in mind is that this is the third largest third sector platform in Japan. This is not a new area that's newly developed. It's been in existence. But it's a smaller area of product sales. To give you an idea, it's probably roughly 1/4 of the size of the medical supplemental industry in Japan. The key, however, is that we expect it to grow, that with an aging population and what we believe or at least suspect, will be a gradual shifting of burden on to individuals or their families related to elderly care, that this will be a building platform over time. And so we want to get in there now. We want to get in there with a competitive product, and we want to leverage off of our third sector prominence. 
So that is the strategy. We will tell you more about this and build out more around this strategy when we get to our investor conference, because it will be more developed at that time. But it's clearly something we think could be a difference maker in the future as we move forward."

It's a narrower group of players than you will find with traditional first sector and some of the larger categories of third sector, notably medical, but they are largely domestic players. 
One other aspect of this business that's important to understand is that many of the players that build successful market share in this industry don't just sell the care insurance. They also surround the insurance with other noninsurance services that supplement elderly care. A good example would be things like smart home technology that helps prevent frankly, elderly individuals of going on claim or better managing concierge-type service to help the elderly manage the many different moving parts necessary to settle into an assisted living atmosphere. 
So alongside this product, we're also building within an incubated business, other care-like noninsurance services because that is one of the keys to building market share. So it's a larger and more expansive platform if you intend to be a leader in this business, which we do. And again, we'll build more color around that as we go forward."

In fact, Connecticut was the tenth to put together this medical -- family leave programs in their state. And we do believe that there's the opportunity for this to expand into further states in the future. These require typically fairly expensive legislative activities within each of the states. And because these are programs that cover effectively the employees of all the qualified or opted-in employers in the state. 
To give you an idea, in Connecticut, we are projecting when you add up the qualified employers who are likely to opt into this program, that the coverage may include as much as a bit in excess of 1.5 million potential participants in the state of Connecticut. So this is a substantial platform, but the nature of it and the nature of the program, and the fact that it is a state-organized benefit program offered up to opted-in employees means legislative activity typically needs to take place. That takes time. And obviously, it can depend on the political atmosphere and the prioritization dynamics within the state legislators. 
So right now, 10 states, but we believe it will expand. I think a lot of that expansion, frankly, is going to be based on the success and receptivity of the programs that are already in place. The good news is that Connecticut is a very important client for us. We were very pleased to be awarded that. It's the capabilities of our acquired business from Zurich that allowed us to bid and be qualified to run that program, and we expect to use this as a foothold to entertain additional states."

And so some states do it in-house. Some states outsource it. So there's a mix of providers. 
One thing that's important is you're not taking a risk on this. And so some would consider this an extensive PPA platform or administrative-only platform. So you're not really competing on what you would call traditional insurance parameters. You're competing on your ability to administer the technology and service level that you drive to the consumer. So one of the reasons why we like this contract is it really sends a strong statement to the marketplace that if you're an employer, you don't get this kind of contract unless you have premier service capabilities, strong technology and great customer service. Without that, you'd never qualify for these programs. And so that's what we're pleased about."

With the pandemic conditions to evolve, we remain cautiously optimistic and vigilant as the vaccination efforts continue in the face of uncertainty associated with the emerging variants. I",1012,"Thank you, David, and good morning, and thank you for joining us. With the pandemic conditions to evolve, we remain cautiously optimistic and vigilant as the vaccination efforts continue in the face of uncertainty associated with the emerging variants. I am proud of our response over the last year and our ability to adapt to what has been a very challenging time for everyone, and I continue to pray each day for everyone affected.  
Adjusted earnings per diluted share, excluding foreign currency impact, increased 24.2% for the quarter and 24.5% for the year. While earnings are off to a very strong start for the first half of the year, it's important to bear in mind that they are largely supported by a low benefit ratio associated with the pandemic conditions as well as a better-than-expected return on alternative investments. At the same time, sales improved year-over-year for the first time during the pandemic in the second quarter in both the United States and Japan.  
As part of our strategy, we strive to be where people want to purchase insurance. That applies to both Japan and the United States. Face-to-face sales are still the most effective way for us to convey the financial protection only Aflac products provide. However, the pandemic has clearly demonstrated the need for virtual means. In other words, non-face-to-face sales that help us reach potential customers and provide them with the protection that they need.  
We have continued to invest in tools from a distribution in both countries and to integrate these investments into our operation. Recognizing the uncertain nature of recovery from the pandemic, we expect a stronger second half of the year in both countries, especially if the communities and businesses continue to open up, which would allow more face-to-face interactions.  
Keeping vaccinations in mind, right now, I'm addressing our employees in a way that is similar to how I talk to my family, keeping them informed with the medical community by bringing doctors in but also by encouraging them to get COVID-19 vaccinations as I want people to avoid being sick or even worse, becoming a casualty of the virus or variant.  
Looking at our operations in Japan, in the second quarter, Aflac Japan generated solid financial growth results as reflected in its profit margin of 26.5%. This was above the outlook range provided at the 2020 Financial Analyst Briefing. Aflac Japan also reported strong premium persistency of 94.7%. Sales improved year-over-year, generating an increase of 38.4% for the quarter and 15.7% for the first 6 months. These results reflect easier comps, improved pandemic conditions and a boost from the first quarter launch of our new medical product.  
While sales in the first half of 2021 are at approximately 65% of 2019 levels, we continue to navigate evolving pandemic conditions in Japan. The states of emergency have been in the targeted areas, especially Tokyo and Okinawa. However, cases have begun increasing in Tokyo and Osaka metropolitan area, and we expect the Japanese government to make a determination soon to expand the declaration of the state of emergency to 3 other prefectures surrounding Tokyo and Osaka. But most importantly, these states of emergencies are less restricted and limited in scope and do not represent lockdowns as experienced in other countries.  
Japan, post-resumption of proactive sales starting in April, is contributing toward a gradual improvement in Aflac's cancer insurance sales, and we continue to work to strengthen the strategic alliance to create a sustained cycle of growth for both companies. In June, for example, Aflac and Japan Post Holding, Japan Post Company and Japan Post Insurance, reached agreements to further the strategic alliance in a matter consistent with Japan Post Group's 5-year medium-term management plan, which was announced in May. While we do not expect this to have an immediate impact on sales recovery, it will further position our company for long-term growth as we respond to customers' needs, provide customer-centric services and create shared value of resolving societal and local community issues.  
Turning to Aflac U.S., we saw a strong profit margin of 24.4 -- 25.4% and very strong premium persistency of 80.1%. As expected, we also saw sequential sales improvement and more opportunities for face-to-face activities. As a result of softer sales a year earlier and more face-to-face opportunities, sales increased 64.1% for the quarter and are at a 73% of the first half of the 2019 levels.  
In the U.S., small businesses are still in a recovery mode, which we expect to continue through 2021. At the same time, larger businesses remain primarily focused on returning employees to the worksite. As I stated earlier, we will focus on being able to sell and service customers, whether in-person or virtually. In addition, we continue to build out the U.S. product portfolio with previously acquired businesses, Aflac Network Dental and Vision and Premier Life and Disability. While these acquisitions have a modest near-term impact on the top line, they better position Aflac for future long-term success in the U.S.  
Meanwhile, strong persistency, underwriting profits and investment income continue to drive strong pretax margins in the United States as they do in Japan. As always, we place significant importance on continuing to achieve strong capital ratios in the U.S. and in Japan on behalf of our policyholders and investors. We remain committed to prudent liquidity and capital management. We treasure our 38-year track record of dividend growth and remain committed to extending it, supported by the strength of the capital and the cash flows. At the same time, we will continue to tactically repurchase shares, focus on integrating the growth investments that we've made in our platform.  
We are well positioned as we work toward achieving long-term growth, while also ensuring we deliver on our promise to our policyholders. By doing so, we look to emerge from this period in a continued position of strength and leadership and look forward to sharing more about the strategic and financial priorities at our financial analyst briefing on November 16, 2021.  
So now I turn the program over to Fred. Fred?"
250178,1674481519,2360999,"Aflac Incorporated, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Aflac Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Dan. I'm going to focus my comments on activities to restore our production platform and progress on growth strategies.

I'm going to focus my comments on activities to restore our production platform and progress on growth strategies. Beginning with Aflac Japan, we are focused on 3 areas in building back to pre-pandemic levels of production: product development, online or digital assisted sales and specific sales efforts within the Japan Post platform. 
With respect to product development, we continue to see positive reception to our revised medical product, EVER Prime. Medical product sales for the first half of the year are up roughly 48% over the same period in 2020 and have approached pre-pandemic levels down only 4% from the 2019 period. We are gaining back market share in this highly competitive medical market. Earlier this year, we launched our first short-term insurance product under a newly-formed subsidiary called SUDACHI. The product is a small amount, substandard medical product targeting customers who do not qualify for traditional medical coverage. In the second quarter, we have registered close to 600 agencies with SUDACHI and issued about 230 policies. We are in the very early stages of this initiative, but over time, we anticipate adding additional short-term health and income support products. 
We are in the process of developing a new care product aimed at supplemental elderly care coverage provided by the Government of Japan. We will provide strategic context and timing around this product in the coming months, but we believe this product line will mature into a meaningful driver of future third sector sales, with an aging population and in anticipation of a continued shift in financial burden from the government to individuals. 
Turning to distribution, we have technology in place to allow agents to pivot from face-to-face to virtual sales. On March 26, we launched a national advertising campaign promoting this capability. In the second quarter, we have processed over 14,000 online applications as compared to nearly 8,000 in the first quarter. On Japan Post, proposal activity has increased month-to-month as sales training and promotion permeates the 20,000 branches that sell our insurance. Through the month of June, Aflac Japan has conducted over 35,000 training sessions with Japan Post sales agents nationwide, along with providing contact information on nearly 700,000 existing cancer policyholders to inform on the latest coverage advantages. Activities in the third quarter include visits with regional office managers in the JP system and post office visits to reinforce the sales process. 
Turning to the U.S., our group voluntary platform continues to respond well with sales exceeding 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Overall, sales recovery is focused on restoring our agent-driven small business franchise hurt by the pandemic. Critical areas of investment include recruiting, converting recruits to weekly producers and product development. In terms of recruiting, we have refocused our efforts in the past year on broker recruiting, with new appointments exceeding pre-pandemic levels. Appointing small business brokers takes time to convert into production but is critical to expanding our reach and gaining traction in the dental and vision markets. Individual agent recruiting remains under pressure, and we are running at 70% of weekly producers we enjoyed pre-pandemic. Agent recruiting is impacted by onboarding and training under COVID restrictions, tight labor markets and employment subsidy programs, all of which we expect to subside later in the year. 
Our Network Dental product is approved in 43 states and Vision in 42 states, with more states coming online later in the year. We are completing national training programs and have about 50% of trained agents who have quoted on our new dental and vision product offerings. It's early, however, we continue to see our volume building each month, and over 50% of our dental and vision cases include voluntary benefit sales. We believe this supports our strategic intent to increase access in new accounts and deepen relationships in our existing accounts. As I said last quarter, our 2021 dental and vision strategy can be summed up as a year of launch, learn and adjust. 
Our Premier Life and Disability platform continues to support their key client relationships and are building a pipeline of quoted business. Our service model remains exceptional. And since closing, we have not lost any notable accounts and have seen early interest among some of our larger voluntary benefit clients. In fact, this morning, Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont announced the selection of Aflac as administrator for the Connecticut Paid Leave Authority, administering benefits for their statewide paid leave program. This awarded business would not have been possible without our recently-acquired group capabilities. 
With respect to our e-commerce initiative, Aflac Direct, we offer critical illness, accident and cancer and are now approved in 45 states, including California. As a reminder, this platform is focused on reaching customers outside the traditional work site. Like most digital sales platforms, we enjoy higher conversion rates when a digital lead is handed to a licensed call center agent. Currently, most of our leads are funneled to third-party call center platforms, and we are actively building out an Aflac licensed call center. Our digital platform overall is experiencing a 16% conversion rate on qualified leads and generally consistent with many digital D2C insurance platforms. Our consumer market strategy also includes digital distribution and product partnerships, and while early in development, are designed to expand access to protection products and increase traffic to our site. Through 6 months in 2021, these 3 platforms, new platforms, have combined for 5% of sales as they are in the early building and development stages. We continue to forecast a strong second half based on increased activity and expect these 3 growth initiatives will contribute upwards of 15% to sales in the second half of 2021. 
Aflac Global Investments announced last week, an investment partnership with Denham Capital. Aflac has made a $2 billion multiyear general account commitment to launch a new debt platform focused on investing in the senior secured debt of sustainable infrastructure projects. Aflac will hold a 24.9% minority interest in a newly-created entity Denham Sustainable Infrastructure. We are also making a $100 million commitment to Denham Equity Fund, focused on sustainable infrastructure investments. We are pleased to partner with Denham, a recognized and leading investment firm, in the sustainable infrastructure markets. Under Eric's leadership, this transaction furthers our strategy of partnering with external managers. We seek alliances with firms that maintain strong track records in specialized asset classes that play an important role in our portfolio. We then leverage our capital to take a minority stake to further maximize the potential benefits. When combined with our recent Sound Point capital investment, we advance our ESG efforts by investing in sustainable infrastructure and distressed communities across the U.S.

Let me begin my comments with a review of our Q2 performance, with a focus on our core capital and earnings drivers have developed. For the second quarter, adjusted earnings per share increased 24.2% to $1.59. The slightly weaker yen-dollar exchange rate did not have a significant impact on adjusted earnings per diluted share. This strong performance for the quarter was largely driven by lower claims utilization due to the pandemic, especially in the U.S. 
In addition, variable investment income [ ran ] $112 million above our long-term return expectations. Adjusted book value per share, including foreign currency translation gains and losses, grew 20.5%. And the adjusted ROE, excluding foreign currency impact, was a strong 17%, which is a significant spread to our cost of capital. 
Starting with our Japan segment, total earned premium for the quarter declined 3.8%, reflecting the impact of first sector policies reaching paid-up status, while earned premium for our third sector products was down 2.3% due to recent low sales volumes. Japan's total benefit ratio came in at 66.9% for the quarter, down 290 basis points year-over-year. And the third sector benefit ratio was 56.5%, down 305 basis points year-over-year. We experienced a slightly higher-than-normal IBNR release in our third sector block as experience continues to come in favorable relative to initial reserving. This quarter, the IBNR release was primarily due to pandemic conditions, constraining utilization since second quarter of 2020 and year-to-date. Although claims activity have begun to rebound, it remains below longer-term normalized levels. Auto claim reporting lags require up to a year to mature the data. And now with more than a year's worth of pandemic data, our estimates are more refined, which has led to increased IBNR releases. Persistency was down 10 basis points, yet remained strong at 94.7%. 
Our adjusted expense ratio in Japan was 20.8%, up 80 basis points year-over-year. We continue our technology-related investments to convert Aflac Japan to a paperless company, which also includes higher system maintenance expenses. Additional telework expenses also added to the higher expense ratio in the quarter. Adjusted net investment income increased 27.4% in yen terms, primarily driven by favorable returns on our growing alternatives portfolio and lower hedge costs, partially offset by lower reinvestment yield on our fixed rate portfolio. The pretax margin for Japan in the quarter was 26.5%, up 450 basis points year-over-year, which was a very favorable result for the quarter. This quarter's strong financial results leads us to expect the full year benefit ratio for Japan to be at the lower end of the 3-year guidance range of 68.5% to 71% given at Fab. And the pretax margin to be at the higher end of the 20.5% to 22.5% range. 
Turning to U.S. results, net earned premium was down 3.4% due to weaker sales results. Persistency improved 180 basis points to [ 80.1% ]. 63 basis points of the elevated persistency in both the second quarter of this year and the prior year can be explained by emergency orders. So there was no net impact for the quarter year-over-year. 80 basis points of improved persistency in the quarter is attributed to lower sales, as first year lapse rates are roughly twice total in-force lapse rates. Another 30 basis points of improved persistency is due to conservation efforts, and the remainder largely comes from improved experience. Our total benefit ratio came in lower than expected at 43.5% or 80 basis points lower than Q2 2020, which, itself, was heavily impacted by the initial pandemic. 
Lower claims utilization impact our estimates for incurred claims as data matures over the course of the year. As our data matures, we increased our reliance on raw data, and with a year of pandemic data behind us, we reduced our IBNR to reflect the lower utilization. This quarter, IBNR releases amounted to 5.6 percentage points impact on the benefit ratio, which leads to an underlying benefit ratio, excluding IBNR releases, of 49.1%. We expect the benefit ratio to increase gradually throughout the remainder of the year, with the resumption of normal activity in our communities and by our policyholders. For the full year, we now expect our benefit ratio to be in the range of 45% to 48% versus our original guidance of 48% to 51%. 
Our expense ratio in the U.S. was 36.9%, up 160 basis points year-over-year but with a lot of moving parts. Weaker sales performance negatively impacts revenue, however, the impact to our expense ratio is offset by lower DAC and commission expense. Higher advertising spend increased the expense ratio by 60 basis points. Our continued buildout of growth initiatives, group life and disability, network dental and vision and direct to consumer contributed to a 170 basis point increase to the ratio. These strategic growth investments are largely offset by our efforts to lower core operating expenses as we strive towards being the low-cost producer in the voluntary benefits space. 
Net-net, despite a lot of moving parts, Q2 expenses are tracking according to plan. In the quarter, we also incurred $5.5 million of integration and transition expenses not included in adjusted earnings associated with recent acquisitions. Adjusted net investment income in the U.S. was up 9.9%, mainly driven by favorable variable investment income in the quarter. Profitability in the U.S. segment was very strong with a pretax margin of 25.4%, with a low benefit ratio as the core driver. With the first half now in the books, we are increasing our pretax margin expectation for the full year. Initial expectations were for us to be towards the low end of 16% to 19%. We now expect to end up slightly above the range indicated at fab. 
In our Corporate segment, we recorded a pretax loss of $76 million, as adjusted net investment income was $45 million lower than last year due to low interest rates at the short end of the yield curve and amortization of certain tax credit investments, which amounted to $30 million this quarter held at the corporate level. Under U.S. GAAP, we recognized a negative impact to corporate NII, but this is offset by a lower effective tax rate for the enterprise. This results in a level of reported volatility to our Corporate segment, but the economic returns on these investments are above our cost of equity capital. To date, these investments are performing well and in line with expectations. 
Our capital position remains strong, and we ended the quarter with an SMR above 900% in Japan and an RBC of approximately 600% in Aflac Columbus. Unencumbered holding company liquidity stood at $4.4 billion, which was $2 billion above our minimum balance, excluding the $400 million proceeds from the sustainability bond that we issued in March that reinforced our ESG initiatives and believe that sustainable investments are also good long-term investments. 
Leverage, which includes our sustainability bond, remains at a comfortable 22.8%, in the middle of our leverage corridor of 20% to 25%. In the quarter, we repurchased $500 million of our own stock and paid dividends of $223 million, offering good relative IRR on these capital deployments. We will continue to be flexible and tactical in how we manage the balance sheet and deploy capital to drive the strong risk-adjusted ROE, with a meaningful spread to our cost of capital. 
With that, I'll hand it over to David to begin the Q&A."

First, you heard from Fred say that we are very pleased to install in our group side of the business, we trended positive and favorably once again. We're trending right now about 117% of 2019. Looking strong. We're looking good with our buy-to-build platforms. We expected to hit our goals for the end of the year. And then I'll turn to our individual block of the business was really driven by our career channel. We ran into some headwinds, as you can see, with career recruits. 
Overall, recruiting looks strong though. We surpassed our Q1 numbers with our Q2. We're looking strong with our veteran recruits. One of the things I look at daily is our veterans getting back to business. In Q1, 73%, we were in 2019 level with our veteran average week of producers. In the second quarter, we were at 78%, so showing a favorable increase there, and we're looking for that to increase throughout the second half of the year and have a strong third and fourth quarter. So overall, I would say we're performing just right at plan when it comes to what we're expecting, a little bit behind with the credit channel but exceeding with the group channel."

So now let me start to talk about Aflac Japan's sales results in the first and the second quarter. And under the current COVID situation, let me first of all, touch upon the new medical product that we launched, which was also discussed earlier. As was discussed, we have achieved 48.1% increase year-on-year. And also under this COVID situation, the online acquisition has become very popular and become a common means for application.
As a result, we have been able to have very active moves and active activities under the current environment. And that's what is -- what was covered by Dan, as he said, we are at about 65% of where we were in 2019. And that's it for me."

In Japan, although we have been limiting the number of people, our employees to come on site under the state of emergency, sales activities are continuing. And the state of emergency declaration in Japan is different from the lockdown situation in the U.S. And the purpose of the state of emergency declaration in Japan is to really control the people's movement from one place to another. As a result, there is really not that much impact to our sales activity during day time. 
And the current state of emergency declaration is imposed to just Tokyo and Okinawa. And so as we do try to prevent being infected, those activities are being done with full prevention nationwide. And the areas outside of the state of emergency declaration are able to do the normal course of sales. And on top of that, we have online consultation and applications that have spread nationwide. And that -- those -- these measures have taken root. Under this kind of an environment, we do believe that we can be quite successful in our sales activities."

Now the new recruits, as Virgil mentioned, is harder simply because the labor market, as you can imagine, if you're having trouble with people coming to work based on salary, it's even more difficult with commissions. But all in all, we've got a lot of licensed people out there that we just need to get back.

So the care product under development, a couple things that are very important. One is the product risk involved in the -- is not to be confused with what you may be familiar with relative to U.S. long-term care. And there's some very fundamental reasons for that. This is a supplemental product, and it supplements the actual elderly care government support mechanism. And so it's a very specific supplement to that government platform as opposed to broader universal care medical coverage. And it also is being designed to where payments are more on a lump sum basis for some of the lower levels of assisted care. And then when you move into the more significant levels of assisted care, it's more of a defined annuity-type benefit. 
The reason I describe it that way is realize you do not have the escalating benefit structures such as health care inflation. You don't have the tail risk that's assumed with more of a lifetime coverage, if you will, once moving into assisted living. Therefore, you're not building nearly the reserves and therefore, don't have nearly the interest rate risk well. So there's several different reasons why this should not be confused, for example, with other types of riskier elderly care support. It really is a supplemental defined mechanism. 
The other is it plays directly off the qualifications of the government program, and so it has a more narrow definition of what is covered and what is not covered than you might be used to in the U.S. because it plays off those definitions. Now one thing to keep in mind is that this is the third largest third sector platform in Japan. This is not a new area that's newly developed. It's been in existence. But it's a smaller area of product sales. To give you an idea, it's probably roughly 1/4 of the size of the medical supplemental industry in Japan. The key, however, is that we expect it to grow, that with an aging population and what we believe or at least suspect, will be a gradual shifting of burden on to individuals or their families related to elderly care, that this will be a building platform over time. And so we want to get in there now. We want to get in there with a competitive product, and we want to leverage off of our third sector prominence. 
So that is the strategy. We will tell you more about this and build out more around this strategy when we get to our investor conference, because it will be more developed at that time. But it's clearly something we think could be a difference maker in the future as we move forward."

It's a narrower group of players than you will find with traditional first sector and some of the larger categories of third sector, notably medical, but they are largely domestic players. 
One other aspect of this business that's important to understand is that many of the players that build successful market share in this industry don't just sell the care insurance. They also surround the insurance with other noninsurance services that supplement elderly care. A good example would be things like smart home technology that helps prevent frankly, elderly individuals of going on claim or better managing concierge-type service to help the elderly manage the many different moving parts necessary to settle into an assisted living atmosphere. 
So alongside this product, we're also building within an incubated business, other care-like noninsurance services because that is one of the keys to building market share. So it's a larger and more expansive platform if you intend to be a leader in this business, which we do. And again, we'll build more color around that as we go forward."

In fact, Connecticut was the tenth to put together this medical -- family leave programs in their state. And we do believe that there's the opportunity for this to expand into further states in the future. These require typically fairly expensive legislative activities within each of the states. And because these are programs that cover effectively the employees of all the qualified or opted-in employers in the state. 
To give you an idea, in Connecticut, we are projecting when you add up the qualified employers who are likely to opt into this program, that the coverage may include as much as a bit in excess of 1.5 million potential participants in the state of Connecticut. So this is a substantial platform, but the nature of it and the nature of the program, and the fact that it is a state-organized benefit program offered up to opted-in employees means legislative activity typically needs to take place. That takes time. And obviously, it can depend on the political atmosphere and the prioritization dynamics within the state legislators. 
So right now, 10 states, but we believe it will expand. I think a lot of that expansion, frankly, is going to be based on the success and receptivity of the programs that are already in place. The good news is that Connecticut is a very important client for us. We were very pleased to be awarded that. It's the capabilities of our acquired business from Zurich that allowed us to bid and be qualified to run that program, and we expect to use this as a foothold to entertain additional states."

And so some states do it in-house. Some states outsource it. So there's a mix of providers. 
One thing that's important is you're not taking a risk on this. And so some would consider this an extensive PPA platform or administrative-only platform. So you're not really competing on what you would call traditional insurance parameters. You're competing on your ability to administer the technology and service level that you drive to the consumer. So one of the reasons why we like this contract is it really sends a strong statement to the marketplace that if you're an employer, you don't get this kind of contract unless you have premier service capabilities, strong technology and great customer service. Without that, you'd never qualify for these programs. And so that's what we're pleased about."

With the pandemic conditions to evolve, we remain cautiously optimistic and vigilant as the vaccination efforts continue in the face of uncertainty associated with the emerging variants. I",1012,"Thank you, David, and good morning, and thank you for joining us. With the pandemic conditions to evolve, we remain cautiously optimistic and vigilant as the vaccination efforts continue in the face of uncertainty associated with the emerging variants. I am proud of our response over the last year and our ability to adapt to what has been a very challenging time for everyone, and I continue to pray each day for everyone affected.  
Adjusted earnings per diluted share, excluding foreign currency impact, increased 24.2% for the quarter and 24.5% for the year. While earnings are off to a very strong start for the first half of the year, it's important to bear in mind that they are largely supported by a low benefit ratio associated with the pandemic conditions as well as a better-than-expected return on alternative investments. At the same time, sales improved year-over-year for the first time during the pandemic in the second quarter in both the United States and Japan.  
As part of our strategy, we strive to be where people want to purchase insurance. That applies to both Japan and the United States. Face-to-face sales are still the most effective way for us to convey the financial protection only Aflac products provide. However, the pandemic has clearly demonstrated the need for virtual means. In other words, non-face-to-face sales that help us reach potential customers and provide them with the protection that they need.  
We have continued to invest in tools from a distribution in both countries and to integrate these investments into our operation. Recognizing the uncertain nature of recovery from the pandemic, we expect a stronger second half of the year in both countries, especially if the communities and businesses continue to open up, which would allow more face-to-face interactions.  
Keeping vaccinations in mind, right now, I'm addressing our employees in a way that is similar to how I talk to my family, keeping them informed with the medical community by bringing doctors in but also by encouraging them to get COVID-19 vaccinations as I want people to avoid being sick or even worse, becoming a casualty of the virus or variant.  
Looking at our operations in Japan, in the second quarter, Aflac Japan generated solid financial growth results as reflected in its profit margin of 26.5%. This was above the outlook range provided at the 2020 Financial Analyst Briefing. Aflac Japan also reported strong premium persistency of 94.7%. Sales improved year-over-year, generating an increase of 38.4% for the quarter and 15.7% for the first 6 months. These results reflect easier comps, improved pandemic conditions and a boost from the first quarter launch of our new medical product.  
While sales in the first half of 2021 are at approximately 65% of 2019 levels, we continue to navigate evolving pandemic conditions in Japan. The states of emergency have been in the targeted areas, especially Tokyo and Okinawa. However, cases have begun increasing in Tokyo and Osaka metropolitan area, and we expect the Japanese government to make a determination soon to expand the declaration of the state of emergency to 3 other prefectures surrounding Tokyo and Osaka. But most importantly, these states of emergencies are less restricted and limited in scope and do not represent lockdowns as experienced in other countries.  
Japan, post-resumption of proactive sales starting in April, is contributing toward a gradual improvement in Aflac's cancer insurance sales, and we continue to work to strengthen the strategic alliance to create a sustained cycle of growth for both companies. In June, for example, Aflac and Japan Post Holding, Japan Post Company and Japan Post Insurance, reached agreements to further the strategic alliance in a matter consistent with Japan Post Group's 5-year medium-term management plan, which was announced in May. While we do not expect this to have an immediate impact on sales recovery, it will further position our company for long-term growth as we respond to customers' needs, provide customer-centric services and create shared value of resolving societal and local community issues.  
Turning to Aflac U.S., we saw a strong profit margin of 24.4 -- 25.4% and very strong premium persistency of 80.1%. As expected, we also saw sequential sales improvement and more opportunities for face-to-face activities. As a result of softer sales a year earlier and more face-to-face opportunities, sales increased 64.1% for the quarter and are at a 73% of the first half of the 2019 levels.  
In the U.S., small businesses are still in a recovery mode, which we expect to continue through 2021. At the same time, larger businesses remain primarily focused on returning employees to the worksite. As I stated earlier, we will focus on being able to sell and service customers, whether in-person or virtually. In addition, we continue to build out the U.S. product portfolio with previously acquired businesses, Aflac Network Dental and Vision and Premier Life and Disability. While these acquisitions have a modest near-term impact on the top line, they better position Aflac for future long-term success in the U.S.  
Meanwhile, strong persistency, underwriting profits and investment income continue to drive strong pretax margins in the United States as they do in Japan. As always, we place significant importance on continuing to achieve strong capital ratios in the U.S. and in Japan on behalf of our policyholders and investors. We remain committed to prudent liquidity and capital management. We treasure our 38-year track record of dividend growth and remain committed to extending it, supported by the strength of the capital and the cash flows. At the same time, we will continue to tactically repurchase shares, focus on integrating the growth investments that we've made in our platform.  
We are well positioned as we work toward achieving long-term growth, while also ensuring we deliver on our promise to our policyholders. By doing so, we look to emerge from this period in a continued position of strength and leadership and look forward to sharing more about the strategic and financial priorities at our financial analyst briefing on November 16, 2021.  
So now I turn the program over to Fred. Fred?"
250178,1674481519,2390277,"Aflac Incorporated, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Aflac Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Dan.

I'm going to focus my comments on activities to restore our production platform and progress on growth strategies. Beginning with Aflac Japan, we are focused on 3 areas in building back to pre-pandemic levels of production: product development, online or digital assisted sales and specific sales efforts within the Japan Post platform. 
With respect to product development, we continue to see positive reception to our revised medical product, EVER Prime. Medical product sales for the first half of the year are up roughly 48% over the same period in 2020 and have approached pre-pandemic levels down only 4% from the 2019 period. We are gaining back market share in this highly competitive medical market. Earlier this year, we launched our first short-term insurance product under a newly-formed subsidiary called SUDACHI. The product is a small amount, substandard medical product targeting customers who do not qualify for traditional medical coverage. In the second quarter, we have registered close to 600 agencies with SUDACHI and issued about 230 policies. We are in the very early stages of this initiative, but over time, we anticipate adding additional short-term health and income support products. 
We are in the process of developing a new care product aimed at supplemental elderly care coverage provided by the Government of Japan. We will provide strategic context and timing around this product in the coming months, but we believe this product line will mature into a meaningful driver of future third sector sales, with an aging population and in anticipation of a continued shift in financial burden from the government to individuals. 
Turning to distribution, we have technology in place to allow agents to pivot from face-to-face to virtual sales. On March 26, we launched a national advertising campaign promoting this capability. In the second quarter, we have processed over 14,000 online applications as compared to nearly 8,000 in the first quarter. On Japan Post, proposal activity has increased month-to-month as sales training and promotion permeates the 20,000 branches that sell our insurance. Through the month of June, Aflac Japan has conducted over 35,000 training sessions with Japan Post sales agents nationwide, along with providing contact information on nearly 700,000 existing cancer policyholders to inform on the latest coverage advantages. Activities in the third quarter include visits with regional office managers in the JP system and post office visits to reinforce the sales process. 
Turning to the U.S., our group voluntary platform continues to respond well with sales exceeding 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Overall, sales recovery is focused on restoring our agent-driven small business franchise hurt by the pandemic. Critical areas of investment include recruiting, converting recruits to weekly producers and product development. In terms of recruiting, we have refocused our efforts in the past year on broker recruiting, with new appointments exceeding pre-pandemic levels. Appointing small business brokers takes time to convert into production but is critical to expanding our reach and gaining traction in the dental and vision markets. Individual agent recruiting remains under pressure, and we are running at 70% of weekly producers we enjoyed pre-pandemic. Agent recruiting is impacted by onboarding and training under COVID restrictions, tight labor markets and employment subsidy programs, all of which we expect to subside later in the year. 
Our Network Dental product is approved in 43 states and Vision in 42 states, with more states coming online later in the year. We are completing national training programs and have about 50% of trained agents who have quoted on our new dental and vision product offerings. It's early, however, we continue to see our volume building each month, and over 50% of our dental and vision cases include voluntary benefit sales. We believe this supports our strategic intent to increase access in new accounts and deepen relationships in our existing accounts. As I said last quarter, our 2021 dental and vision strategy can be summed up as a year of launch, learn and adjust. 
Our Premier Life and Disability platform continues to support their key client relationships and are building a pipeline of quoted business. Our service model remains exceptional. And since closing, we have not lost any notable accounts and have seen early interest among some of our larger voluntary benefit clients. In fact, this morning, Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont announced the selection of Aflac as administrator for the Connecticut Paid Leave Authority, administering benefits for their statewide paid leave program. This awarded business would not have been possible without our recently-acquired group capabilities. 
With respect to our e-commerce initiative, Aflac Direct, we offer critical illness, accident and cancer and are now approved in 45 states, including California. As a reminder, this platform is focused on reaching customers outside the traditional work site. Like most digital sales platforms, we enjoy higher conversion rates when a digital lead is handed to a licensed call center agent. Currently, most of our leads are funneled to third-party call center platforms, and we are actively building out an Aflac-licensed call center. Our digital platform overall is experiencing a 16% conversion rate on qualified leads and generally consistent with many digital D2C insurance platforms. Our consumer market strategy also includes digital distribution and product partnerships, and while early in development, are designed to expand access to protection products and increase traffic to our site. Through 6 months in 2021, these 3 platforms, new platforms, have combined for 5% of sales as they are in the early building and development stages. We continue to forecast a strong second half based on increased activity and expect these 3 growth initiatives will contribute upwards of 15% to sales in the second half of 2021. 
Aflac Global Investments announced last week, an investment partnership with Denham Capital. Aflac has made a $2 billion multiyear general account commitment to launch a new debt platform focused on investing in the senior secured debt of sustainable infrastructure projects. Aflac will hold a 24.9% minority interest in a newly-created entity Denham Sustainable Infrastructure. We are also making a $100 million commitment to Denham Equity Fund, focused on sustainable infrastructure investments. We are pleased to partner with Denham, a recognized and leading investment firm, in the sustainable infrastructure markets. Under Eric's leadership, this transaction furthers our strategy of partnering with external managers. We seek alliances with firms that maintain strong track records in specialized asset classes that play an important role in our portfolio. We then leverage our capital to take a minority stake to further maximize the potential benefits. When combined with our recent Sound Point Capital investment, we advance our ESG efforts by investing in sustainable infrastructure and distressed communities across the U.S.

Let me begin my comments with a review of our Q2 performance, with a focus on our core capital and earnings drivers have developed. For the second quarter, adjusted earnings per share increased 24.2% to $1.59. The slightly weaker yen-dollar exchange rate did not have a significant impact on adjusted earnings per diluted share. This strong performance for the quarter was largely driven by lower claims utilization due to the pandemic, especially in the U.S. 
In addition, variable investment income ran $112 million above our long-term return expectations. Adjusted book value per share, including foreign currency translation gains and losses, grew 20.5%. And the adjusted ROE, excluding foreign currency impact, was a strong 17%, which is a significant spread to our cost of capital. 
Starting with our Japan segment, total earned premium for the quarter declined 3.8%, reflecting the impact of first sector policies reaching paid-up status, while earned premium for our third sector products was down 2.3% due to recent low sales volumes. Japan's total benefit ratio came in at 66.9% for the quarter, down 290 basis points year-over-year. And the third sector benefit ratio was 56.5%, down 305 basis points year-over-year. We experienced a slightly higher-than-normal IBNR release in our third sector block as experience continues to come in favorable relative to initial reserving. This quarter, the IBNR release was primarily due to pandemic conditions, constraining utilization since second quarter of 2020 and year-to-date. Although claims activity have begun to rebound, it remains below longer-term normalized levels. Auto claim reporting lags require up to a year to mature the data. And now with more than a year's worth of pandemic data, our estimates are more refined, which has led to increased IBNR releases. Persistency was down 10 basis points, yet remained strong at 94.7%. 
Our adjusted expense ratio in Japan was 20.8%, up 80 basis points year-over-year. We continue our technology-related investments to convert Aflac Japan to a paperless company, which also includes higher system maintenance expenses. Additional telework expenses also added to the higher expense ratio in the quarter. Adjusted net investment income increased 27.4% in yen terms, primarily driven by favorable returns on our growing alternatives portfolio and lower hedge costs, partially offset by lower reinvestment yield on our fixed rate portfolio. The pretax margin for Japan in the quarter was 26.5%, up 450 basis points year-over-year, which was a very favorable result for the quarter. This quarter's strong financial results leads us to expect the full year benefit ratio for Japan to be at the lower end of the 3-year guidance range of 68.5% to 71% given at FAB, and the pretax margin to be at the higher end of the 20.5% to 22.5% range. 
Turning to U.S. results, net earned premium was down 3.4% due to weaker sales results. Persistency improved 180 basis points to 80.1%. 63 basis points of the elevated persistency in both the second quarter of this year and the prior year can be explained by emergency orders. So there was no net impact for the quarter year-over-year. 80 basis points of improved persistency in the quarter is attributed to lower sales, as first year lapse rates are roughly twice total in-force lapse rates. Another 30 basis points of improved persistency is due to conservation efforts, and the remainder largely comes from improved experience. Our total benefit ratio came in lower than expected at 43.5% or 80 basis points lower than Q2 2020, which, itself, was heavily impacted by the initial pandemic. 
Lower claims utilization impact our estimates for incurred claims as data matures over the course of the year. As our data matures, we increased our reliance on raw data, and with a year of pandemic data behind us, we reduced our IBNR to reflect the lower utilization. This quarter, IBNR releases amounted to 5.6 percentage points impact on the benefit ratio, which leads to an underlying benefit ratio, excluding IBNR releases, of 49.1%. We expect the benefit ratio to increase gradually throughout the remainder of the year, with the resumption of normal activity in our communities and by our policyholders. For the full year, we now expect our benefit ratio to be in the range of 45% to 48% versus our original guidance of 48% to 51%. 
Our expense ratio in the U.S. was 36.9%, up 160 basis points year-over-year but with a lot of moving parts. Weaker sales performance negatively impacts revenue, however, the impact to our expense ratio is offset by lower DAC and commission expense. Higher advertising spend increased the expense ratio by 60 basis points. Our continued buildout of growth initiatives, Group Life and Disability, Network Dental and Vision and Direct to Consumer contributed to a 170 basis point increase to the ratio. These strategic growth investments are largely offset by our efforts to lower core operating expenses as we strive towards being the low-cost producer in the voluntary benefits space. 
Net-net, despite a lot of moving parts, Q2 expenses are tracking according to plan. In the quarter, we also incurred $5.5 million of integration and transition expenses not included in adjusted earnings associated with recent acquisitions. Adjusted net investment income in the U.S. was up 9.9%, mainly driven by favorable variable investment income in the quarter. Profitability in the U.S. segment was very strong with a pretax margin of 25.4%, with a low benefit ratio as the core driver. With the first half now in the books, we are increasing our pretax margin expectation for the full year. Initial expectations were for us to be towards the low end of 16% to 19%. We now expect to end up slightly above the range indicated at FAB. 
In our Corporate segment, we recorded a pretax loss of $76 million, as adjusted net investment income was $45 million lower than last year due to low interest rates at the short end of the yield curve and amortization of certain tax credit investments, which amounted to $30 million this quarter held at the corporate level. Under U.S. GAAP, we recognized a negative impact to corporate NII, but this is offset by a lower effective tax rate for the enterprise. This results in a level of reported volatility to our Corporate segment, but the economic returns on these investments are above our cost of equity capital. To date, these investments are performing well and in line with expectations. 
Our capital position remains strong, and we ended the quarter with an SMR above 900% in Japan and an RBC of approximately 600% in Aflac Columbus. Unencumbered holding company liquidity stood at $4.4 billion, which was $2 billion above our minimum balance, excluding the $400 million proceeds from the sustainability bond that we issued in March that reinforced our ESG initiatives and believe that sustainable investments are also good long-term investments. 
Leverage, which includes our sustainability bond, remains at a comfortable 22.8%, in the middle of our leverage corridor of 20% to 25%. In the quarter, we repurchased $500 million of our own stock and paid dividends of $223 million, offering good relative IRR on these capital deployments. We will continue to be flexible and tactical in how we manage the balance sheet and deploy capital to drive the strong risk-adjusted ROE, with a meaningful spread to our cost of capital. 
With that, I'll hand it over to David to begin the Q&A."

Let me share with you about our sales trends we've seen in the second quarter. First, you heard from Fred say that we are very pleased to install in our group side of the business, we trended positive and favorably once again. We're trending right now about 117% of 2019. Looking strong. We're looking good with our buy-to-build platforms. We expected to hit our goals for the end of the year. And then turning to our individual block of the business, it was really driven by our career channel. We ran into some headwinds, as you can see, with career recruits. 
Overall, recruiting looks strong though. We surpassed our Q1 numbers with our Q2. We're looking strong with our veteran recruits. One of the things I look at daily is our veterans getting back to business. In Q1, 73%, we were in 2019 level with our veteran average week of producers. In the second quarter, we were at 78%, so showing a favorable increase there, and we're looking for that to increase throughout the second half of the year and have a strong third and fourth quarter. So overall, I would say we're performing just right at plan when it comes to what we're expecting, a little bit behind with the credit channel but exceeding with the group channel."

So now let me start to talk about Aflac Japan's sales results in the first and the second quarter. And under the current COVID situation, let me first of all, touch upon the new medical product that we launched, which was also discussed earlier. As was discussed, we have achieved 48.1% increase year-on-year. And also under this COVID situation, the online acquisition has become very popular and become a common means for application.
As a result, we have been able to have very active moves and active activities under the current environment. And that's what is -- what was covered by Dan, as he said, we are at about 65% of where we were in 2019. And that's it for me."

Now this is from Japan. So let me answer your question regarding Japan. 
In Japan, although we have been limiting the number of people, our employees to come on site under the state of emergency, sales activities are continuing. And the state of emergency declaration in Japan is different from the lockdown situation in the U.S. And the purpose of the state of emergency declaration in Japan is to really control the people's movement from one place to another. As a result, there is really not that much impact to our sales activity during day time. 
And the current state of emergency declaration is imposed to just Tokyo and Okinawa. And so as we do try to prevent being infected, that those activities are being done with full prevention nationwide. And the areas outside of the state of emergency declaration are able to do the normal course of sales. And on top of that, we have online consultation and applications that have spread nationwide. And that -- those -- these measures have taken root. Under this kind of an environment, we do believe that we can be quite successful in our sales activities."

Now the new recruits, as Virgil mentioned, is harder simply because the labor market, as you can imagine, if you're having trouble with people coming to work based on salary, it's even more difficult with commissions. But all in all, we've got a lot of licensed people out there that we just need to get back.

So the care product under development, a couple things that are very important. One is the product risk involved in the -- is not to be confused with what you may be familiar with relative to U.S. long-term care. And there's some very fundamental reasons for that. This is a supplemental product, and it supplements the actual elderly care government support mechanism. And so it's a very specific supplement to that government platform as opposed to broader universal care medical coverage. And it also is being designed to where payments are more on a lump sum basis for some of the lower levels of assisted care. And then when you move into the more significant levels of assisted care, it's more of a defined annuity-type benefit. 
The reason I describe it that way is realize you do not have the escalating benefit structures such as health care inflation. You don't have the tail risk that's assumed with more of a lifetime coverage, if you will, once moving into assisted living. Therefore, you're not building nearly the reserves and therefore, don't have nearly the interest rate risk well. So there's several different reasons why this should not be confused, for example, with other types of riskier elderly care support. It really is a supplemental defined mechanism. 
The other is it plays directly off the qualifications of the government program, and so it has a more narrow definition of what is covered and what is not covered than you might be used to in the U.S. because it plays off those definitions. Now one thing to keep in mind is that this is the third largest third sector platform in Japan. This is not a new area that's newly developed. It's been in existence. But it's a smaller area of product sales. To give you an idea, it's probably roughly 1/4 of the size of the medical supplemental industry in Japan. The key, however, is that we expect it to grow, that with an aging population and what we believe or at least suspect, will be a gradual shifting of burden on to individuals or their families related to elderly care, that this will be a building platform over time. And so we want to get in there now. We want to get in there with a competitive product, and we want to leverage off of our third sector prominence. 
So that is the strategy. We will tell you more about this and build out more around this strategy when we get to our investor conference, because it will be more developed at that time. But it's clearly something we think could be a difference maker in the future as we move forward."

It's a narrower group of players than you will find with traditional first sector and some of the larger categories of third sector, notably medical, but they are largely domestic players. 
One other aspect of this business that's important to understand is that many of the players that build successful market share in this industry don't just sell the care insurance. They also surround the insurance with other noninsurance services that supplement elderly care. A good example would be things like smart home technology that helps prevent frankly, elderly individuals of going on claim or better managing concierge-type service to help the elderly manage the many different moving parts necessary to settle into an assisted living atmosphere. 
So alongside this product, we're also building within an incubated business, other care-like noninsurance services because that is one of the keys to building market share. So it's a larger and more expansive platform if you intend to be a leader in this business, which we do. And again, we'll build more color around that as we go forward."

In fact, Connecticut was the tenth to put together this medical -- family leave programs in their state. And we do believe that there's the opportunity for this to expand into further states in the future. These require typically fairly expensive legislative activities within each of the states and because these are programs that cover effectively the employees of all the qualified or opted-in employers in the state. 
To give you an idea, in Connecticut, we are projecting when you add up the qualified employers who are likely to opt into this program, that the coverage may include as much as a bit in excess of 1.5 million potential participants in the state of Connecticut. So this is a substantial platform, but the nature of it and the nature of the program, and the fact that it is a state-organized benefit program offered up to opted-in employees means legislative activity typically needs to take place. That takes time. And obviously, it can depend on the political atmosphere and the prioritization dynamics within the state legislators. 
So right now, 10 states, but we believe it will expand. I think a lot of that expansion, frankly, is going to be based on the success and receptivity of the programs that are already in place. The good news is that Connecticut is a very important client for us. We were very pleased to be awarded that. It's the capabilities of our acquired business from Zurich that allowed us to bid and be qualified to run that program, and we expect to use this as a foothold to entertain additional states."

And so some states do it in-house. Some states outsource it. So there's a mix of providers. 
One thing that's important is you're not taking a risk on this. And so some would consider this an extensive PPA platform or administrative-only platform. So you're not really competing on what you would call traditional insurance parameters. You're competing on your ability to administer the technology and service level that you drive to the consumer. So one of the reasons why we like this contract is it really sends a strong statement to the marketplace that if you're an employer, you don't get this kind of contract unless you have premier service capabilities, strong technology and great customer service. Without that, you'd never qualify for these programs. And so that's what we're pleased about."

With the pandemic conditions to evolve, we remain cautiously optimistic and vigilant as the vaccination efforts continue in the face of uncertainty associated with the emerging variants. I",1012,"Thank you, David, and good morning, and thank you for joining us. With the pandemic conditions to evolve, we remain cautiously optimistic and vigilant as the vaccination efforts continue in the face of uncertainty associated with the emerging variants. I am proud of our response over the last year and our ability to adapt to what has been a very challenging time for everyone, and I continue to pray each day for everyone affected.  
Adjusted earnings per diluted share, excluding foreign currency impact, increased 24.2% for the quarter and 24.5% for the year. While earnings are off to a very strong start for the first half of the year, it's important to bear in mind that they are largely supported by a low benefit ratio associated with the pandemic conditions as well as a better-than-expected return on alternative investments. At the same time, sales improved year-over-year for the first time during the pandemic in the second quarter in both the United States and Japan.  
As part of our strategy, we strive to be where people want to purchase insurance. That applies to both Japan and the United States. Face-to-face sales are still the most effective way for us to convey the financial protection only Aflac products provide. However, the pandemic has clearly demonstrated the need for virtual means. In other words, non-face-to-face sales that help us reach potential customers and provide them with the protection that they need.  
We have continued to invest in tools from a distribution in both countries and to integrate these investments into our operation. Recognizing the uncertain nature of recovery from the pandemic, we expect a stronger second half of the year in both countries, especially if the communities and businesses continue to open up, which would allow more face-to-face interactions.  
Keeping vaccinations in mind, right now, I'm addressing our employees in a way that is similar to how I talk to my family, keeping them informed with the medical community by bringing doctors in but also by encouraging them to get COVID-19 vaccinations as I want people to avoid being sick or even worse, becoming a casualty of the virus or variant.  
Looking at our operations in Japan, in the second quarter, Aflac Japan generated solid financial growth results as reflected in its profit margin of 26.5%. This was above the outlook range provided at the 2020 Financial Analyst Briefing. Aflac Japan also reported strong premium persistency of 94.7%. Sales improved year-over-year, generating an increase of 38.4% for the quarter and 15.7% for the first 6 months. These results reflect easier comps, improved pandemic conditions and a boost from the first quarter launch of our new medical product.  
While sales in the first half of 2021 are at approximately 65% of 2019 levels, we continue to navigate evolving pandemic conditions in Japan. The states of emergency have been in the targeted areas, especially Tokyo and Okinawa. However, cases have begun increasing in Tokyo and Osaka metropolitan area, and we expect the Japanese government to make a determination soon to expand the declaration of the state of emergency to 3 other prefectures surrounding Tokyo and Osaka. But most importantly, these states of emergencies are less restricted and limited in scope and do not represent lockdowns as experienced in other countries.  
Japan, post-resumption of proactive sales starting in April, is contributing toward a gradual improvement in Aflac's cancer insurance sales, and we continue to work to strengthen the strategic alliance to create a sustained cycle of growth for both companies. In June, for example, Aflac and Japan Post Holding, Japan Post Company and Japan Post Insurance, reached agreements to further the strategic alliance in a matter consistent with Japan Post Group's 5-year medium-term management plan, which was announced in May. While we do not expect this to have an immediate impact on sales recovery, it will further position our company for long-term growth as we respond to customers' needs, provide customer-centric services and create shared value of resolving societal and local community issues.  
Turning to Aflac U.S., we saw a strong profit margin of 24.4 -- 25.4% and very strong premium persistency of 80.1%. As expected, we also saw sequential sales improvement and more opportunities for face-to-face activities. As a result of softer sales a year earlier and more face-to-face opportunities, sales increased 64.1% for the quarter and are at a 73% of the first half of the 2019 levels.  
In the U.S., small businesses are still in a recovery mode, which we expect to continue through 2021. At the same time, larger businesses remain primarily focused on returning employees to the worksite. As I stated earlier, we will focus on being able to sell and service customers, whether in-person or virtually. In addition, we continue to build out the U.S. product portfolio with previously acquired businesses, Aflac Network Dental and Vision and Premier Life and Disability. While these acquisitions have a modest near-term impact on the top line, they better position Aflac for future long-term success in the U.S.  
Meanwhile, strong persistency, underwriting profits and investment income continue to drive strong pretax margins in the United States as they do in Japan. As always, we place significant importance on continuing to achieve strong capital ratios in the U.S. and in Japan on behalf of our policyholders and investors. We remain committed to prudent liquidity and capital management. We treasure our 38-year track record of dividend growth and remain committed to extending it, supported by the strength of the capital and the cash flows. At the same time, we will continue to tactically repurchase shares, focus on integrating the growth investments that we've made in our platform.  
We are well positioned as we work toward achieving long-term growth, while also ensuring we deliver on our promise to our policyholders. By doing so, we look to emerge from this period in a continued position of strength and leadership and look forward to sharing more about the strategic and financial priorities at our financial analyst briefing on November 16, 2021.  
So now I turn the program over to Fred. Fred?"

I'm going to focus my comments on activities to restore our production platform and progress on growth strategies. Beginning with Aflac Japan, we are focused on 3 areas in building back to pre-pandemic levels of production: product development, online or digital assisted sales and specific sales efforts within the Japan Post platform. 
With respect to product development, we continue to see positive reception to our revised medical product, EVER Prime. Medical product sales for the first half of the year are up roughly 48% over the same period in 2020 and have approached pre-pandemic levels down only 4% from the 2019 period. We are gaining back market share in this highly competitive medical market. Earlier this year, we launched our first short-term insurance product under a newly-formed subsidiary called SUDACHI. The product is a small amount, substandard medical product targeting customers who do not qualify for traditional medical coverage. In the second quarter, we have registered close to 600 agencies with SUDACHI and issued about 230 policies. We are in the very early stages of this initiative, but over time, we anticipate adding additional short-term health and income support products. 
We are in the process of developing a new care product aimed at supplemental elderly care coverage provided by the Government of Japan. We will provide strategic context and timing around this product in the coming months, but we believe this product line will mature into a meaningful driver of future third sector sales, with an aging population and in anticipation of a continued shift in financial burden from the government to individuals. 
Turning to distribution, we have technology in place to allow agents to pivot from face-to-face to virtual sales. On March 26, we launched a national advertising campaign promoting this capability. In the second quarter, we have processed over 14,000 online applications as compared to nearly 8,000 in the first quarter. On Japan Post, proposal activity has increased month-to-month as sales training and promotion permeates the 20,000 branches that sell our insurance. Through the month of June, Aflac Japan has conducted over 35,000 training sessions with Japan Post sales agents nationwide, along with providing contact information on nearly 700,000 existing cancer policyholders to inform on the latest coverage advantages. Activities in the third quarter include visits with regional office managers in the JP system and post office visits to reinforce the sales process. 
Turning to the U.S., our group voluntary platform continues to respond well with sales exceeding 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Overall, sales recovery is focused on restoring our agent-driven small business franchise hurt by the pandemic. Critical areas of investment include recruiting, converting recruits to weekly producers and product development. In terms of recruiting, we have refocused our efforts in the past year on broker recruiting, with new appointments exceeding pre-pandemic levels. Appointing small business brokers takes time to convert into production but is critical to expanding our reach and gaining traction in the dental and vision markets. Individual agent recruiting remains under pressure, and we are running at 70% of weekly producers we enjoyed pre-pandemic. Agent recruiting is impacted by onboarding and training under COVID restrictions, tight labor markets and employment subsidy programs, all of which we expect to subside later in the year. 
Our Network Dental product is approved in 43 states and Vision in 42 states, with more states coming online later in the year. We are completing national training programs and have about 50% of trained agents who have quoted on our new dental and vision product offerings. It's early, however, we continue to see our volume building each month, and over 50% of our dental and vision cases include voluntary benefit sales. We believe this supports our strategic intent to increase access in new accounts and deepen relationships in our existing accounts. As I said last quarter, our 2021 dental and vision strategy can be summed up as a year of launch, learn and adjust. 
Our Premier Life and Disability platform continues to support their key client relationships and are building a pipeline of quoted business. Our service model remains exceptional. And since closing, we have not lost any notable accounts and have seen early interest among some of our larger voluntary benefit clients. In fact, this morning, Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont announced the selection of Aflac as administrator for the Connecticut Paid Leave Authority, administering benefits for their statewide paid leave program. This awarded business would not have been possible without our recently-acquired group capabilities. 
With respect to our e-commerce initiative, Aflac Direct, we offer critical illness, accident and cancer and are now approved in 45 states, including California. As a reminder, this platform is focused on reaching customers outside the traditional work site. Like most digital sales platforms, we enjoy higher conversion rates when a digital lead is handed to a licensed call center agent. Currently, most of our leads are funneled to third-party call center platforms, and we are actively building out an Aflac-licensed call center. Our digital platform overall is experiencing a 16% conversion rate on qualified leads and generally consistent with many digital D2C insurance platforms. Our consumer market strategy also includes digital distribution and product partnerships, and while early in development, are designed to expand access to protection products and increase traffic to our site. Through 6 months in 2021, these 3 platforms, new platforms, have combined for 5% of sales as they are in the early building and development stages. We continue to forecast a strong second half based on increased activity and expect these 3 growth initiatives will contribute upwards of 15% to sales in the second half of 2021. 
Aflac Global Investments announced last week, an investment partnership with Denham Capital. Aflac has made a $2 billion multiyear general account commitment to launch a new debt platform focused on investing in the senior secured debt of sustainable infrastructure projects. Aflac will hold a 24.9% minority interest in a newly-created entity Denham Sustainable Infrastructure. We are also making a $100 million commitment to Denham Equity Fund, focused on sustainable infrastructure investments. We are pleased to partner with Denham, a recognized and leading investment firm, in the sustainable infrastructure markets. Under Eric's leadership, this transaction furthers our strategy of partnering with external managers. We seek alliances with firms that maintain strong track records in specialized asset classes that play an important role in our portfolio. We then leverage our capital to take a minority stake to further maximize the potential benefits. When combined with our recent Sound Point Capital investment, we advance our ESG efforts by investing in sustainable infrastructure and distressed communities across the U.S.

Let me begin my comments with a review of our Q2 performance, with a focus on our core capital and earnings drivers have developed. For the second quarter, adjusted earnings per share increased 24.2% to $1.59. The slightly weaker yen-dollar exchange rate did not have a significant impact on adjusted earnings per diluted share. This strong performance for the quarter was largely driven by lower claims utilization due to the pandemic, especially in the U.S. 
In addition, variable investment income ran $112 million above our long-term return expectations. Adjusted book value per share, including foreign currency translation gains and losses, grew 20.5%. And the adjusted ROE, excluding foreign currency impact, was a strong 17%, which is a significant spread to our cost of capital. 
Starting with our Japan segment, total earned premium for the quarter declined 3.8%, reflecting the impact of first sector policies reaching paid-up status, while earned premium for our third sector products was down 2.3% due to recent low sales volumes. Japan's total benefit ratio came in at 66.9% for the quarter, down 290 basis points year-over-year. And the third sector benefit ratio was 56.5%, down 305 basis points year-over-year. We experienced a slightly higher-than-normal IBNR release in our third sector block as experience continues to come in favorable relative to initial reserving. This quarter, the IBNR release was primarily due to pandemic conditions, constraining utilization since second quarter of 2020 and year-to-date. Although claims activity have begun to rebound, it remains below longer-term normalized levels. Auto claim reporting lags require up to a year to mature the data. And now with more than a year's worth of pandemic data, our estimates are more refined, which has led to increased IBNR releases. Persistency was down 10 basis points, yet remained strong at 94.7%. 
Our adjusted expense ratio in Japan was 20.8%, up 80 basis points year-over-year. We continue our technology-related investments to convert Aflac Japan to a paperless company, which also includes higher system maintenance expenses. Additional telework expenses also added to the higher expense ratio in the quarter. Adjusted net investment income increased 27.4% in yen terms, primarily driven by favorable returns on our growing alternatives portfolio and lower hedge costs, partially offset by lower reinvestment yield on our fixed rate portfolio. The pretax margin for Japan in the quarter was 26.5%, up 450 basis points year-over-year, which was a very favorable result for the quarter. This quarter's strong financial results leads us to expect the full year benefit ratio for Japan to be at the lower end of the 3-year guidance range of 68.5% to 71% given at FAB, and the pretax margin to be at the higher end of the 20.5% to 22.5% range. 
Turning to U.S. results, net earned premium was down 3.4% due to weaker sales results. Persistency improved 180 basis points to 80.1%. 63 basis points of the elevated persistency in both the second quarter of this year and the prior year can be explained by emergency orders. So there was no net impact for the quarter year-over-year. 80 basis points of improved persistency in the quarter is attributed to lower sales, as first year lapse rates are roughly twice total in-force lapse rates. Another 30 basis points of improved persistency is due to conservation efforts, and the remainder largely comes from improved experience. Our total benefit ratio came in lower than expected at 43.5% or 80 basis points lower than Q2 2020, which, itself, was heavily impacted by the initial pandemic. 
Lower claims utilization impact our estimates for incurred claims as data matures over the course of the year. As our data matures, we increased our reliance on raw data, and with a year of pandemic data behind us, we reduced our IBNR to reflect the lower utilization. This quarter, IBNR releases amounted to 5.6 percentage points impact on the benefit ratio, which leads to an underlying benefit ratio, excluding IBNR releases, of 49.1%. We expect the benefit ratio to increase gradually throughout the remainder of the year, with the resumption of normal activity in our communities and by our policyholders. For the full year, we now expect our benefit ratio to be in the range of 45% to 48% versus our original guidance of 48% to 51%. 
Our expense ratio in the U.S. was 36.9%, up 160 basis points year-over-year but with a lot of moving parts. Weaker sales performance negatively impacts revenue, however, the impact to our expense ratio is offset by lower DAC and commission expense. Higher advertising spend increased the expense ratio by 60 basis points. Our continued buildout of growth initiatives, Group Life and Disability, Network Dental and Vision and Direct to Consumer contributed to a 170 basis point increase to the ratio. These strategic growth investments are largely offset by our efforts to lower core operating expenses as we strive towards being the low-cost producer in the voluntary benefits space. 
Net-net, despite a lot of moving parts, Q2 expenses are tracking according to plan. In the quarter, we also incurred $5.5 million of integration and transition expenses not included in adjusted earnings associated with recent acquisitions. Adjusted net investment income in the U.S. was up 9.9%, mainly driven by favorable variable investment income in the quarter. Profitability in the U.S. segment was very strong with a pretax margin of 25.4%, with a low benefit ratio as the core driver. With the first half now in the books, we are increasing our pretax margin expectation for the full year. Initial expectations were for us to be towards the low end of 16% to 19%. We now expect to end up slightly above the range indicated at FAB. 
In our Corporate segment, we recorded a pretax loss of $76 million, as adjusted net investment income was $45 million lower than last year due to low interest rates at the short end of the yield curve and amortization of certain tax credit investments, which amounted to $30 million this quarter held at the corporate level. Under U.S. GAAP, we recognized a negative impact to corporate NII, but this is offset by a lower effective tax rate for the enterprise. This results in a level of reported volatility to our Corporate segment, but the economic returns on these investments are above our cost of equity capital. To date, these investments are performing well and in line with expectations. 
Our capital position remains strong, and we ended the quarter with an SMR above 900% in Japan and an RBC of approximately 600% in Aflac Columbus. Unencumbered holding company liquidity stood at $4.4 billion, which was $2 billion above our minimum balance, excluding the $400 million proceeds from the sustainability bond that we issued in March that reinforced our ESG initiatives and believe that sustainable investments are also good long-term investments. 
Leverage, which includes our sustainability bond, remains at a comfortable 22.8%, in the middle of our leverage corridor of 20% to 25%. In the quarter, we repurchased $500 million of our own stock and paid dividends of $223 million, offering good relative IRR on these capital deployments. We will continue to be flexible and tactical in how we manage the balance sheet and deploy capital to drive the strong risk-adjusted ROE, with a meaningful spread to our cost of capital. 
With that, I'll hand it over to David to begin the Q&A."

Let me share with you about our sales trends we've seen in the second quarter. First, you heard from Fred say that we are very pleased to install in our group side of the business, we trended positive and favorably once again. We're trending right now about 117% of 2019. Looking strong. We're looking good with our buy-to-build platforms. We expected to hit our goals for the end of the year. And then turning to our individual block of the business, it was really driven by our career channel. We ran into some headwinds, as you can see, with career recruits. 
Overall, recruiting looks strong though. We surpassed our Q1 numbers with our Q2. We're looking strong with our veteran recruits. One of the things I look at daily is our veterans getting back to business. In Q1, 73%, we were in 2019 level with our veteran average week of producers. In the second quarter, we were at 78%, so showing a favorable increase there, and we're looking for that to increase throughout the second half of the year and have a strong third and fourth quarter. So overall, I would say we're performing just right at plan when it comes to what we're expecting, a little bit behind with the credit channel but exceeding with the group channel."

So now let me start to talk about Aflac Japan's sales results in the first and the second quarter. And under the current COVID situation, let me first of all, touch upon the new medical product that we launched, which was also discussed earlier. As was discussed, we have achieved 48.1% increase year-on-year. And also under this COVID situation, the online acquisition has become very popular and become a common means for application.
As a result, we have been able to have very active moves and active activities under the current environment. And that's what is -- what was covered by Dan, as he said, we are at about 65% of where we were in 2019. And that's it for me."

Now this is from Japan. So let me answer your question regarding Japan. 
In Japan, although we have been limiting the number of people, our employees to come on site under the state of emergency, sales activities are continuing. And the state of emergency declaration in Japan is different from the lockdown situation in the U.S. And the purpose of the state of emergency declaration in Japan is to really control the people's movement from one place to another. As a result, there is really not that much impact to our sales activity during day time. 
And the current state of emergency declaration is imposed to just Tokyo and Okinawa. And so as we do try to prevent being infected, that those activities are being done with full prevention nationwide. And the areas outside of the state of emergency declaration are able to do the normal course of sales. And on top of that, we have online consultation and applications that have spread nationwide. And that -- those -- these measures have taken root. Under this kind of an environment, we do believe that we can be quite successful in our sales activities."

Now the new recruits, as Virgil mentioned, is harder simply because the labor market, as you can imagine, if you're having trouble with people coming to work based on salary, it's even more difficult with commissions. But all in all, we've got a lot of licensed people out there that we just need to get back.

So the care product under development, a couple things that are very important. One is the product risk involved in the -- is not to be confused with what you may be familiar with relative to U.S. long-term care. And there's some very fundamental reasons for that. This is a supplemental product, and it supplements the actual elderly care government support mechanism. And so it's a very specific supplement to that government platform as opposed to broader universal care medical coverage. And it also is being designed to where payments are more on a lump sum basis for some of the lower levels of assisted care. And then when you move into the more significant levels of assisted care, it's more of a defined annuity-type benefit. 
The reason I describe it that way is realize you do not have the escalating benefit structures such as health care inflation. You don't have the tail risk that's assumed with more of a lifetime coverage, if you will, once moving into assisted living. Therefore, you're not building nearly the reserves and therefore, don't have nearly the interest rate risk well. So there's several different reasons why this should not be confused, for example, with other types of riskier elderly care support. It really is a supplemental defined mechanism. 
The other is it plays directly off the qualifications of the government program, and so it has a more narrow definition of what is covered and what is not covered than you might be used to in the U.S. because it plays off those definitions. Now one thing to keep in mind is that this is the third largest third sector platform in Japan. This is not a new area that's newly developed. It's been in existence. But it's a smaller area of product sales. To give you an idea, it's probably roughly 1/4 of the size of the medical supplemental industry in Japan. The key, however, is that we expect it to grow, that with an aging population and what we believe or at least suspect, will be a gradual shifting of burden on to individuals or their families related to elderly care, that this will be a building platform over time. And so we want to get in there now. We want to get in there with a competitive product, and we want to leverage off of our third sector prominence. 
So that is the strategy. We will tell you more about this and build out more around this strategy when we get to our investor conference, because it will be more developed at that time. But it's clearly something we think could be a difference maker in the future as we move forward."

It's a narrower group of players than you will find with traditional first sector and some of the larger categories of third sector, notably medical, but they are largely domestic players. 
One other aspect of this business that's important to understand is that many of the players that build successful market share in this industry don't just sell the care insurance. They also surround the insurance with other noninsurance services that supplement elderly care. A good example would be things like smart home technology that helps prevent frankly, elderly individuals of going on claim or better managing concierge-type service to help the elderly manage the many different moving parts necessary to settle into an assisted living atmosphere. 
So alongside this product, we're also building within an incubated business, other care-like noninsurance services because that is one of the keys to building market share. So it's a larger and more expansive platform if you intend to be a leader in this business, which we do. And again, we'll build more color around that as we go forward."

In fact, Connecticut was the tenth to put together this medical -- family leave programs in their state. And we do believe that there's the opportunity for this to expand into further states in the future. These require typically fairly expensive legislative activities within each of the states and because these are programs that cover effectively the employees of all the qualified or opted-in employers in the state. 
To give you an idea, in Connecticut, we are projecting when you add up the qualified employers who are likely to opt into this program, that the coverage may include as much as a bit in excess of 1.5 million potential participants in the state of Connecticut. So this is a substantial platform, but the nature of it and the nature of the program, and the fact that it is a state-organized benefit program offered up to opted-in employees means legislative activity typically needs to take place. That takes time. And obviously, it can depend on the political atmosphere and the prioritization dynamics within the state legislators. 
So right now, 10 states, but we believe it will expand. I think a lot of that expansion, frankly, is going to be based on the success and receptivity of the programs that are already in place. The good news is that Connecticut is a very important client for us. We were very pleased to be awarded that. It's the capabilities of our acquired business from Zurich that allowed us to bid and be qualified to run that program, and we expect to use this as a foothold to entertain additional states."

One thing that's important is you're not taking a risk on this. And so some would consider this an extensive PPA platform or administrative-only platform. So you're not really competing on what you would call traditional insurance parameters. You're competing on your ability to administer the technology and service level that you drive to the consumer.

With the pandemic conditions continuing to evolve, I'm proud of our response over the last year. I am also grateful to our team of employees and sales representatives who have empowered Aflac to adapt to what has been a very challenging time for everyone. 
During the third quarter, we saw a rise and then a decline in COVID cases and hospitalizations in both the United States and in Japan, but to varying degrees. With that in mind, I continue to address our employees in a way that's similar to how with my own family. I'm keeping them informed in updates from the medical community and encourage them to get the COVID vaccine because I want people to avoid being sick or even worse being a casualty due to this pandemic. 
As we entered the fourth quarter, when the weather gets colder and indoor gatherings increase, the recovery from the pandemic remains uncertain, and we must remain diligent. 
For the third quarter, adjusted earnings per diluted share, excluding foreign currency, impact increased 10.1% for the quarter and 20.1% for the year. These results are largely driven by lower-than-expected benefit ratios and higher net investment income, primarily in Japan. 
Looking at the operations in Japan in the third quarter, Aflac Japan generated solid overall financial results as reflected in the profit margin of 26.3%, which was above the outlook range provided at our financial analyst briefing for 2020. As Max will explain in a few moments, Aflac Japan has reported very strong premium persistency of 94.5%. And Aflac Japan sales were essentially flat for the quarter. Sales for the first 9 months of this year were approximately 66% of 2019 level. We continue to navigate evolving pandemic conditions in Japan, which include widespread state of emergencies that extended to multiple prefectures and persisted through the third quarter. These states of emergency in Japan are much less restrictive and more limited in scope than lockdowns in other countries, but they have impacted face-to-face sales opportunities. As we entered the fourth quarter, the ability to meet face-to-face with customers appears to be improving somewhat gradually and the degree to which our ability to meet face-to-face continues to improve with a very key driver in the recovery of our sales. 
We were encouraged by the September launch of our new nursing care insurance in Japan, which we view as another opportunity to meet the needs of certain consumers. However, it's still very early in the launch of this new product to determine the potential of the nursing care insurance. In addition, Aflac Japan continues to work to strengthen the alliance with Japan Post, which resumed proactive sales of the cancer insurance on April 1. We expect continued collaboration to further position both companies for the long-term growth and a gradual improvement of Japan Post cancer insurance sales in the intermediate term. 
Now turning to Aflac U.S. We saw a strong profit margin of 22.2%. This result was driven by lower incurred benefits and higher adjusted net investment income, particularly offset by the higher adjusted expenses. Aflac U.S. also continued to have strong premium persistency of nearly 80%. Sales increased 35% for the quarter and are at approximately 78% of sales for the first 9 months of 2019. These sales results reflect what we believe are improving pandemic conditions in the United States, allowing us more face-to-face meetings and enrollments than prior periods. In the U.S., small businesses have gained some incremental ground toward recovery, which we expect to continue gradually. 
Within the challenging small business and labor markets, we continue to make investments in developments of traditional independent sales agents that make up about 53% of our sales as of the third quarter of 2021. At the same time, larger businesses appear to be more resilient given their traditional reliance on online self-enrollment tools, and we continue to invest in the group platform. Group business, which is being driven by broker performance is performing very well. excluding our acquired platforms, group sales have generated a year-to-date sales increase of 14% over the same period for 2019. 
As we enter historically higher enrollment periods in the United States, we remain focused on being able to sell and service customers, whether in person or virtually. With an eye toward responding to the needs of consumers, businesses and our distribution, we continue to build out the U.S. portfolio with Aflac network dental and vision premier life and disability. These new lines modestly impact the top line in the short term. These new products in combination with our core products, better position Aflac U.S. for future long-term success. Pandemic conditions have served to fuel our long-standing strategy of being where people want to purchase insurance in both the United States and in Japan. And while face-to-face sales remains the most effective way for us to convey the financial protection only Aflac products provide, the pandemic has clearly demonstrated the need for virtual avenues to help us reach potential customers. We have continued to invest in tools for our distribution in both countries and to integrate these investments into our operations. 
As always, we place significant importance on continuing to achieve strong capital ratios in the U.S. and Japan on behalf of our policyholders and investors. We remain committed to prudent liquidity and capital management. With the fourth quarter declaration, 2021 will mark the 39th consecutive year of dividend increases. Our dividend track record is supported by the strength of our capital and cash flows. At the same time, we will continue to be tactical in our share repurchase and focus on integrating the growth investments we've made in our platform. 
We are well positioned as we work toward achieving long-term growth while also ensuring we deliver on our promise to our policyholders. By doing so, we look to emerge from this period in continued position of strength and leadership and look forward to sharing more about our strategic and financial priorities that the financial analyst briefing on November 16, 2021. 
Now let me turn the program over to Fred. Fred?"
250178,1680247498,2415604,"Aflac Incorporated, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Aflac Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Dan.

I'll keep my comments brief before handing off to Max on the quarter's financial results. Beginning with Aflac Japan, as Dan noted, it was an unusual quarter with the states of emergency declarations across most of the country. declarations are triggered in Japan by, among other things, a combination of rates of infection and hospital utilization by prefecture. The precise impact is difficult to calculate, but the practical implications include reduced face-to-face consultations, limited access to on-site workers and payroll solicitation, reduced foot traffic to the roughly 400 owned and affiliated retail shops that we sell through and restricted travel between prefectures, which further constrains sales professionals. 
When looking at claims experience through the third quarter and since inception of the virus, Aflac Japan's COVID impact has totaled approximately 31,000 claimants with incurred claims of JPY 5.6 billion. We expect conditions to improve and remain focused on what we can control, including product development and advancing our business model. Our medical product ever Prime continues to do well with medical sales up roughly 14% in the quarter and 36% year-to-date over the same period in 2020. Our market share has improved, but we're still at roughly 85% of the medical sales enjoyed in 2019, which was also a medical product refresh year. So pandemic conditions in the quarter are having an impact. 
Regarding our nursing care product. Since our late September launch, we have sold nearly 10,000 policies. This is a strong start, but within our expectations given the marketing support put behind the product. From a risk perspective, this is a supplemental product aligned with coverage provided by the Japanese government and targeting the mass market. Benefits are, therefore, less rich and capped both in an amount and duration. The product is designed for protection versus savings with modest interest rate sensitivity. 
In summary, the product has a similar risk profile to our existing third sector products. We continue the development of noninsurance services that wrap our cancer and now nursing care product offerings. This has become more common among the large domestic insurers and we see these services as important for both defending and building our market share. 
Turning to the U.S., pandemic conditions remain at elevated levels with the spread of the delta strain of the virus. As of the end of the third quarter, Aflac U.S. COVID claimants since inception of the virus, has totaled approximately 79,000 with incurred claims of $135 million. Dan covered overall U.S. sales conditions. I'll focus my comments specifically on our buy-to-build growth platforms. Our 2021 dental and vision strategy can be summed up as a year of launch, learn and adjust. 
This quarter, we processed over 1,600 cases, up 30% over the second quarter as we roll out training and development to agents and launch in additional states. We are focused on small- and medium-sized businesses with sold cases averaging around 95 employees. Looking forward into 2022, we continue building out our dental network and readying the platform for increased volumes as we move upmarket and introduce a direct-to-consumer individual product. 
Our premier life and disability team successfully renewed 100% of their current accounts, a testimony to their high-quality service model. We are preparing to launch with Connecticut administering benefits for their statewide paid family and medical leave program in 2022. This is an administrative-only contract leveraging our acquired leave management platform. With respect to our e-commerce initiative, Aflac Direct, we currently offer products in 46 states. We are actively building out a licensed call center and currently have 14 licensed agents. The call center platform is in the early days of building and augments our digital-only conversion rates as well as reduces operational dependency on call center vendors. 
In the third quarter, these 3 platforms accounted for roughly 13% of sales and are expected to build as a percentage of sales and earned premium in the coming years. Before handing off to Max, a few comments on operations. In Japan, we continue to drive volume through our online sales solution. Year-to-date, we have processed over 38,000 online applications with September being our largest month since launching the capability. We are pushing forward on technology and digital modernization and are sizing the investment required to streamline our policyholder services platform. This is the largest operating platform in Japan and a key to driving down our long-term expense ratio. In the U.S., our premier life and disability platform completed a successful transition this month from Zurich on time, on budget and without client or customer disruption. We are focused on migrating our voluntary business to a new group administration platform and building out critical data connections with leading benefit administration and HR systems. The goal is to ensure ease of doing business, smooth onboarding and renewals and quality service and analytics. 
When looking at our Japan and U.S. expense ratios going forward, we continue with critical platform development despite a period of weaker revenue. We expect to stay within previously guided ranges for expense ratios recognizing prolonged pandemic conditions require recalibrating the precise trajectory and time line for reaching our ultimate targets. 
Finally, at Aflac Global Investments, performance remains strong. We continue to advance our sustainable investing platform and recently refreshed our strategic asset allocation work. Our team will dive deeper into operations and strategic execution at next month's Analyst and Investor Briefing. 
Let me now turn things over to Max to cover financial performance. Max?"

For the third quarter, adjusted earnings per share increased 10.1% to $1.53, with a $0.02 negative impact from foreign exchange in the quarter. This strong performance for the quarter was largely driven by lower claims utilization due to pandemic conditions, especially in Japan. Variable investment income ran $0.11 above our long-term return expectations. Adjusted book value per share, including foreign currency translation gains and losses, grew 10.1%. And the adjusted ROE, excluding the foreign currency impact, was a strong 16.2%, a significant spread to our cost of capital. 
Starting with our Japan segment. Total earned premium for the quarter declined 4%, reflecting first sector policies paid up impacts while earned premium for our third sector products was down 2.6% due to recent low sales volumes. Policy count in force, which we view as a better measure of our overall business growth declined 1.8%. 
Japan's total benefit ratio came in at 66.1% for the quarter, down 520 basis points year-over-year, and the third sector benefit ratio was 55%, down 670 basis points year-over-year. We experienced a greater-than-normal IBNR release in our third sector block as experience continues to come in favorable relative to initial reserving. Utilization continues to be constrained by pandemic conditions, and we now have more than a year's worth of pandemic data. And with that, our model output is more refined, leading to increased releases. Adjusting for greater than normal IBNR releases and in-period experience, we estimate that our normalized benefit ratio for the third quarter to be 68.7%. Persistency remained strong with a rate of 94.5%, down 50 basis points year-over-year. Consistent with past refreshed product launches, we have experienced a slight uptick in lapse rates on our medical product as policyholders look to update their coverage. 
Our expense ratio in Japan was 21.4%, down 30 basis points year-over-year. Constrained business activity lowered our expenses in Q3, which we view to be a temporary phenomenon. We generally expect increased spending on key initiatives to continue and especially in Q4 as we tend to see some seasonality in spending and booking of projects. 
Adjusted net investment income increased 19.7% in yen terms, primarily driven by favorable returns on our growing private equity portfolio and lower hedge costs, partially offset by lower reinvestment yields on our fixed rate portfolio. The pretax margin for Japan in the quarter was 26.3%, up 690 basis points year-over-year, a very good result for the quarter. This quarter's strong financial results lead us to expect a full year benefit ratio for Japan to be below the 3-year guidance range of 68.5% to 71% given at fab. And the pretax margin to be above the 20.5% to 22.5% range given at -- for the full year 2021. 
Turning to U.S. results. Net earned premium was down 1% as lower sales results during the anemic continued to have an impact on our earned premium. Persistency improved 110 basis points to 79.9%. 70 basis points of which are from lower sales, as first year lapse rates are roughly twice the level of in-force lapse rates. In addition, there still remains about 40 basis points of positive impact from emergency orders. Our total benefit ratio in the U.S. came in lower than expected at 45.1% or 320 basis points lower than Q3 2020 and which itself was heavily impacted by the initial pandemic. 
Lower and deferred claims utilization impacts our IBNR held for incurred claims within a year. And as we get more data, our long-term models increased reliance on raw data leading to IBNR releases. This quarter, they amounted to a 3.5 percentage point impact on the benefit ratio, which leads to an underlying benefit ratio, excluding IBNR releases of 48.6%. 
We expect the benefit ratio to increase gradually throughout the remainder of the year with the resumption of normal activity in our communities and by our policyholders. For the full year, we now expect our benefit ratio to be in the range of 43% to 46% versus original guidance of 48% to 51%. Our expense ratio in the U.S. was 38.9%, up 170 basis points year-over-year, but with a lot of moving parts. Weaker sales performance negatively impacts revenue, however, the impact to our expense ratio is largely offset by lower DAC expense. Higher advertising spend increased the expense ratio by 40 basis points. 
Our continued build-out of growth initiatives, group life and disability, network dental ambition and direct-to-consumer contributed to a 260 basis points increase to the ratio when isolating these investments. These important strategic growth investments are somewhat offset by our efforts to lower our core operating expenses as we strive towards being the low-cost producer in the voluntary benefits space. Net-net, despite a lot of moving parts, Q3 expenses are tracking according to plan. In the quarter, we also incurred $7.8 million of integration expenses not included in adjusted earnings associated with recent acquisitions. 
Adjusted net investment income in the U.S. was up 9.1%, mainly driven by favorable variable investment income in the quarter. Profitability in the U.S. segment remained strong with a pretax margin of 22.2%, with a low benefit ratio as the core driver. With 9 months now in the books, we are increasing our pretax expectation for the full year. Initial expectations were for us to be towards the low end of 16% to 19%. We now expect to end up above the range indicated at February 2020. 
In our corporate segment, we recorded a pretax loss of $41 million, as adjusted net investment income was down $12 million versus last year due to low interest rates at the short end of the yield curve and change in value of certain tax credit investments. These tax credit investments run through the corporate net investment income line for U.S. GAAP purposes with an associated credit to the tax line. The net impact to our bottom line was a positive $5 million in the quarter. To date, these investments are performing well and in line with expectations. 
In the fourth quarter, we do expect a significant tax credit investment to fund, which will bring some volatility to the corporate NII line as well as an offsetting credit to the tax line. Our capital position remains strong, and we ended the quarter with an SMR in Japan of north of 900% and an RBC north of 600% in Aflac Columbus. Unencumbered holding company liquidity stood at $4.2 billion, $1.8 billion above our minimum balance. Leverage, which includes the sustainability bond issued earlier this year, remains at a comfortable 22.6% in the middle of our leverage corridor of 20% to 25%. In the quarter, we repurchased $525 million of our own stock and paid dividends of $220 million, offering good relative IRR on these capital deployments. We will continue to be flexible and tactical in how we manage the balance sheet and deploy capital in order to drive strong risk-adjusted return on equity with a meaningful spread to our cost of capital. 
Finally, I would like to mention that we will begin to expand our disclosures around the adoption of LDTI in our Form 10-Q and at fab. At a high level, we do not see this accounting adoption as an economic event with no impact to our regulatory financials or capital base. There will be no change to how we manage the company, cash flows or capital. 
With that, I'll hand it over to David to begin Q&A."

And as a result of that, the state of emergency declaration, which only covered 20 prefectures in the second quarter increased to 33 prefectures in the third quarter. [Foreign Language].
In other words, the state of emergency declaration area covered 90% of population in Japan. [Foreign Language].
And so there were impact to our sales performance and results due to a decrease in face-to-face both station and meetings with customers and also delaying some of the worksite sales station as well as the number of traffic -- customer traffic coming into our walk-in shops. And on top of that, there were some restrictions in traveling across prefectural borders, which prevented us from visiting customers. [Foreign Language]. However, under this environment, we have been able to arrive at a point the same level of sales as for the third quarter last year. That is because of the online solicitation that we have conducted. And also the new product that we launched at the end of September, which is the nursing care product. So as a result, we have been able to reach the same level of sales as in the third quarter last year. 
[Foreign Language] 
Right now, in the fourth quarter, there is no area in Japan that is covered under the state of emergency declaration.
[Foreign Language].
And the economic activities are becoming much more active in Japan, although it's gradual.

While new policy sales increased over the second quarter. However, the pace of recovery has been moderate. 
[Foreign Language].
Well, this was driven by several factors, including that it has been approximately 2 years since Japan post refrain from conducting proactive sales states of emergency limited the ability of sales representatives in many areas to meet customers and preparations are underway for the upcoming transfer of sales employees from Japan Post Company to Japan Post Insurance.
[Foreign Language].
We have been conducting a range of activities to help promote sales through the Japan Post channel. For example, in the third quarter, we conducted training aimed at improving Japan post agent mindset and skills. We did so through activities to inform policyholders about the latest coverage and engaged in proposal activities for those not yet covered by cancer insurance. 
[Foreign Language].
We are currently promoting cancer insurance sales by managing the sales process, which includes approaching customers, getting to know their needs informed them of the latest coverage, making proposals based on the proposal form and closing the deal, we are emphasizing with Japan Post to increasing the number of proposals. 
[Foreign Language]
As the Japan Post Group announced in September, approximately 10,000 sales employees to be transferred from postal network to Japan Post Insurance will offer only Japan Post insurance and Aflac cancer insurance product. 
[Foreign Language] 
We believe that preparations for the transfer and transition of these employees also affected third quarter sales activities.

The answer is no. We are aligned. They are large shareholders. They know that so goes their production will play a big impact on the company, Aflac specifically and what will take place. Is it slower than we thought -- it's slower than I thought. I was hoping it would kick back up. But with the emergency, it did slow it down. do I think they will recapture where they were. I absolutely do. Do I know the time on it? I do not. Do I think that top management is pushing it Yes, I do think they're pushing it. Do I think the lower management levels are on board yet. I think they're very tentative because not about our products, but any products. because they've been pushed by the FSA, not to make any mistakes to be -- so it's just a little bit slower getting them comfortable back to normal where they can begin to go. So I still think we have a winner with Japan Post. I think it's nice that not only are they selling for us, but that they are a large shareholder because that ties us so closely together. 
So I know you've heard a lot about this, so I'll stop there."

And you can essentially break it down as the upside is primarily driven by the lower-than-expected benefit ratios. They pretty much immediately flow through into higher statutory earnings and also higher FSA earnings as well, which then drives our capital formation and generation and ultimately, dividends up to the holding company. So you can use the difference between our reported benefit ratios and our normalized benefit ratios as a guidance for what that sort of increased capital generation this year would be. Now when we then think about capital deployment, we have significant capital around the company and all the operating subsidiaries. We operate with very strong capital ratios. And also at the holding company, we hold a very high level. Therefore, if our capital generation in a single year or a single period deviates from our initial expectations, it's not necessarily driving or changing our tactical view of how we deploy capital. So I wouldn't necessarily immediately lead it into that from a -- on a short-term basis. Obviously, long term, it's more capital that we have available to us to deploy into our different deployment strategies."

It's becoming a very developed approach by not many, but a few of the leading insurance companies in Japan. And it's largely developed around care products historically, and that is offering certain concierge services for the elderly that are attached to elderly care insurance policy support, everything from nursing care support to in-home modernization to reduce the risk of injury, et cetera. You're seeing some of that, of course, go on in the U.S., and it's going on in Japan, too. Our approach has been to, a, make sure that we're building out those types of services around the care product. But also, we think there's an opportunity for particularly Aflac to do that in the cancer space. And the way to think about it, we have formed an entity in Japan called Hatch health care. And that entity has been building out these noninsurance services surrounding cancer and now care insurance. And effectively, the way it works is you as a policyholder, have an ability to call in to effectively a concierge desk that then helps direct you to either internal or third-party contractual agreements to support both diagnosis and early screening type services on cancer as well as post-cancer diagnosis care, everything from nutrition to mental health to other dynamics. And so this is in the early stages of being built. We've been working on it for about 2 years now. It's now starting to become in a spot to be put into action. 
But we think this is really the next horizon, if you will, of securing our market share and building our capabilities on the cancer side. And then also, it's really a necessary entity in supporting care insurance and competing with the other big care providers in the country."

So it's more around customer service, persistency, sales opportunity and market share I should note that these types of services would also be offered on cancer policies sold through Japan Post. So it's really both a defensive and offensive play -- But ultimately, this Hatch Healthcare entity would drive its own independent revenue through contractual relationships and margins with third-party providers. By the way, these are the types of things we would develop more at the financial analyst briefing because it's probably better done there. But just to provide you some color."

When we move up to the holding company, we clearly have significant readily deployable capital at $1.8 billion as of today. This will continue to support the deployment strategies that we have through dividends. We increased the dividend earlier this year by 17.9%. We have a very long-standing track record, as Dan mentioned, in terms of continuing to increase the dividend. We have done a number of smaller acquisitions as well, where we have allocated capital to -- And we've been in very active acquirer of our own stock as well.

With the pandemic conditions continuing to evolve, I'm proud of our response over the last year. I am also grateful to our team of employees and sales representatives who have empowered Aflac to adapt to what has been a very challenging time for everyone.
During the third quarter, we saw a rise and then a decline in COVID cases and hospitalizations in both the United States and in Japan, but to varying degrees. With that in mind, I continue to address our employees in a way that's similar to how with my own family. I'm keeping them informed in updates from the medical community and encourage them to get the COVID-19 vaccine because I want people to avoid being sick or even worse being a casualty due to this pandemic.
As we entered the fourth quarter, when the weather gets colder and indoor gatherings increase, the recovery from the pandemic remains uncertain, and we must remain diligent.
For the third quarter, adjusted earnings per diluted share, excluding foreign currency impact increased 10.1% for the quarter and 20.1% for the year. These results are largely driven by lower-than-expected benefit ratios and higher net investment income, primarily in Japan.
Looking at the operations in Japan in the third quarter, Aflac Japan generated solid overall financial results as reflected in the profit margin of 26.3%, which was above the outlook range provided at our financial analyst briefing for 2020.
As Max will explain in a few moments, Aflac Japan has reported very strong premium persistency of 94.5%. Aflac Japan sales were essentially flat for the quarter. Sales for the first 9 months of this year were approximately 66% of 2019 level. We continue to navigate evolving pandemic conditions in Japan, which include widespread state of emergencies that extended to multiple prefectures and persisted through the third quarter.
These states of emergency in Japan are much less restrictive and more limited in scope than lockdowns in other countries, but they have impacted face-to-face sales opportunities. As we entered the fourth quarter, the ability to meet face-to-face with customers appears to be improving somewhat gradually. And the degree to which our ability to meet face-to-face continues to improve with a very key driver in the recovery of our sales.
We were encouraged by the September launch of our new nursing care insurance in Japan, which we view as another opportunity to meet the needs of certain consumers. However, it's still very early in the launch of this new product to determine the potential of the nursing care insurance. In addition, Aflac Japan continues to work to strengthen the alliance with Japan Post, which resumed proactive sales of the cancer insurance on April 1.
We expect continued collaboration to further position both companies for the long-term growth and a gradual improvement of Japan Post cancer insurance sales in the intermediate term.
Now turning to Aflac U.S. We saw a strong profit margin of 22.2%. This result was driven by lower incurred benefits and higher adjusted net investment income, particularly offset by the higher adjusted expenses. Aflac U.S. also continued to have strong premium persistency of nearly 80%. Sales increased 35% for the quarter and are at approximately 78% of sales for the first 9 months of 2019. These sales results reflect what we believe are improving pandemic conditions in the United States, allowing us more face-to-face meetings and enrollments than prior periods. In the U.S., small businesses have gained some incremental ground toward recovery, which we expect to continue gradually.
Within the challenging small business and labor markets, we continue to make investments in developments of traditional independent sales agents that make up about 53% of our sales as of the third quarter of 2021. At the same time, larger businesses appear to be more resilient, given their traditional reliance on online self-enrollment tools, and we continue to invest in the group platform.
Group business, which is being driven by broker performance is performing very well. Excluding our acquired platforms, group sales have generated a year-to-date sales increase of 14% over the same period for 2019.
As we enter historically higher enrollment periods in the United States, we remain focused on being able to sell and service customers, whether in person or virtually. With an eye toward responding to the needs of consumers, businesses and our distribution, we continue to build out the U.S. portfolio with Aflac network Dental and Vision premier life and disability. These new lines modestly impact the topline in the short term.
These new products in combination with our core products, better position Aflac U.S. for future long-term success. Pandemic conditions have served to fuel our long-standing strategy of being where people want to purchase insurance in both the United States and in Japan. And while face-to-face sales remains the most effective way for us to convey the financial protection only Aflac products provide, the pandemic has clearly demonstrated the need for virtual avenues to help us reach potential customers.
We have continued to invest in tools for our distribution in both countries and to integrate these investments into our operations.
As always, we place significant importance on continuing to achieve strong capital ratios in the U.S. and Japan on behalf of our policyholders and investors. We remain committed to prudent liquidity and capital management. With the fourth quarter declaration, 2021 will mark the 39th consecutive year of dividend increases. Our dividend track record is supported by the strength of our capital and cash flows. At the same time, we will continue to be tactical in our share repurchase and focus on integrating the growth investments we've made in our platform.
We are well positioned as we work toward achieving long-term growth, while also ensuring we deliver on our promise to our policyholders. By doing so, we look to emerge from this period in continued position of strength and leadership and look forward to sharing more about our strategic and financial priorities at the financial analyst briefing on November 16, 2021.
Now let me turn the program over to Fred. Fred?"
250178,1680247498,2415813,"Aflac Incorporated, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Aflac Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Dan. Recognizing we have our analyst and investor briefing scheduled in the next few weeks. I'll keep my comments brief before handing off to Max on the quarter's financial results.

I'll keep my comments brief before handing off to Max on the quarter's financial results. Beginning with Aflac Japan, as Dan noted, it was an unusual quarter with the states of emergency declarations across most of the country. Declarations are triggered in Japan by, among other things, a combination of rates of infection and hospital utilization by prefecture.
The precise impact is difficult to calculate, but the practical implications include reduced face-to-face consultations, limited access to on-site workers and payroll solicitation, reduced foot traffic to the roughly 400 owned and affiliated retail shops that we sell through and restricted travel between prefectures, which further constrains sales professionals.
When looking at claims experience through the third quarter and since inception of the virus, Aflac Japan's COVID impact has totaled approximately 31,000 claimants with incurred claims of JPY 5.6 billion. We expect conditions to improve and remain focused on what we can control, including product development and advancing our business model. Our medical product EVER Prime continues to do well with medical sales up roughly 14% in the quarter and 36% year-to-date over the same period in 2020. Our market share has improved, but we're still at roughly 85% of the medical sales enjoyed in 2019, which was also a medical product refresh year. So pandemic conditions in the quarter are having an impact.
Regarding our nursing care product. Since our late September launch, we have sold nearly 10,000 policies. This is a strong start, but within our expectations, given the marketing support put behind the product. From a risk perspective, this is a supplemental product aligned with coverage provided by the Japanese government and targeting the mass market. Benefits are, therefore, less rich and capped, both in amount and duration. The product is designed for protection versus savings with modest interest rate sensitivity.
In summary, the product has a similar risk profile to our existing third sector products. We continue the development of noninsurance services that wrap our cancer and now nursing care product offerings. This has become more common among the large domestic insurers and we see these services as important for both defending and building our market share.
Turning to the U.S., pandemic conditions remain at elevated levels with the spread of the Delta strain of the virus. As of the end of the third quarter, Aflac U.S. COVID claimants since inception of the virus, has totaled approximately 79,000 with incurred claims of $135 million. Dan covered overall U.S. sales conditions. I'll focus my comments specifically on our buy-to-build growth platforms. Our 2021 Dental and Vision strategy can be summed up as a year of launch, learn and adjust.
This quarter, we processed over 1,600 cases, up 30% over the second quarter, as we roll out training and development to agents and launch in additional states. We are focused on small- and medium-sized businesses with sold cases averaging around 95 employees. Looking forward into 2022, we continue building out our dental network and readying the platform for increased volumes as we move upmarket and introduce a direct-to-consumer individual product.
Our premier life and disability team successfully renewed 100% of their current accounts, a testimony to their high-quality service model. We are preparing to launch with Connecticut administering benefits for their statewide paid family and medical leave program in 2022. This is an administrative-only contract leveraging our acquired leave management platform.
With respect to our e-commerce initiative, Aflac Direct, we currently offer products in 46 states. We are actively building out a licensed call center and currently have 14 licensed agents. The call center platform is in the early days of building and augments our digital-only conversion rates as well as reduces operational dependency on call center vendors.
In the third quarter, these 3 platforms accounted for roughly 13% of sales and are expected to build as a percentage of sales and earned premium in the coming years.
Before handing off to Max, a few comments on operations. In Japan, we continue to drive volume through our online sales solution. Year-to-date, we have processed over 38,000 online applications with September being our largest month since launching the capability. We are pushing forward on technology and digital modernization and are sizing the investment required to streamline our policyholder services platform.
This is the largest operating platform in Japan and a key to driving down our long-term expense ratio. In the U.S., our premier life and disability platform completed a successful transition this month from Zurich on time, on budget and without client or customer disruption. We are focused on migrating our voluntary business to a new group administration platform and building out critical data connections with leading benefit administration and HR systems. The goal is to ensure ease of doing business, smooth onboarding and renewals and quality service and analytics.
When looking at our Japan and U.S. expense ratios going forward, we continue with critical platform development despite a period of weaker revenue. We expect to stay within previously guided ranges for expense ratios recognizing prolonged pandemic conditions require recalibrating the precise trajectory and timeline for reaching our ultimate targets.
Finally, at Aflac Global Investments, performance remains strong. We continue to advance our sustainable investing platform and recently refreshed our strategic asset allocation work. Our team will dive deeper into operations and strategic execution at next month's Analyst and Investor Briefing.

For the third quarter, adjusted earnings per share increased 10.1% to $1.53, with a $0.02 negative impact from foreign exchange in the quarter.

For the third quarter, adjusted earnings per share increased 10.1% to $1.53, with a $0.02 negative impact from foreign exchange in the quarter. This strong performance for the quarter was largely driven by lower claims utilization due to pandemic conditions, especially in Japan. Variable investment income ran $0.11 above our long-term return expectations. Adjusted book value per share, including foreign currency translation gains and losses, grew 10.1%. And the adjusted ROE, excluding the foreign currency impact, was a strong 16.2%, a significant spread to our cost of capital.
Starting with our Japan segment. Total earned premium for the quarter declined 4%, reflecting first sector policies paid-up impacts, while earned premium for our third sector products was down 2.6% due to recent low sales volumes. Policy count in-force, which we view as a better measure of our overall business growth declined 1.8%.
Japan's total benefit ratio came in at 66.1% for the quarter, down 520 basis points year-over-year, and the third sector benefit ratio was 55%, down 670 basis points year-over-year. We experienced a greater-than-normal IBNR release in our third sector block, as experience continues to come in favorable relative to initial reserving. Utilization continues to be constrained by pandemic conditions, and we now have more than a year's worth of pandemic data. And with that, our model output is more refined, leading to increased releases.
Adjusting for greater than normal IBNR releases and in-period experience, we estimate that our normalized benefit ratio for the third quarter to be 68.7%. Persistency remained strong with a rate of 94.5%, down 50 basis points year-over-year. Consistent with past refreshed product launches, we have experienced a slight uptick in lapse rates on our medical product, as policyholders look to update their coverage.
Our expense ratio in Japan was 21.4%, down 30 basis points year-over-year. Constrained business activity lowered our expenses in Q3, which we view to be a temporary phenomenon. We generally expect increased spending on key initiatives to continue and especially in Q4, as we tend to see some seasonality in spending and booking of projects.
Adjusted net investment income increased 19.7% in yen terms, primarily driven by favorable returns on our growing private equity portfolio and lower hedge costs, partially offset by lower reinvestment yield on our fixed rate portfolio. The pretax margin for Japan in the quarter was 26.3%, up 690 basis points year-over-year, a very good result for the quarter. This quarter's strong financial results lead us to expect the full year benefit ratio for Japan to be below the 3-year guidance range of 68.5% to 71% given at FAB. And the pretax margin to be above the 20.5% to 22.5% range given at -- for the full year 2021.
Turning to U.S. results. Net earned premium was down 1%, as lower sales results during the pandemic continue to have an impact on our earned premium. Persistency improved 110 basis points to 79.9%, 70 basis points of which are from lower sales, as first year lapse rates are roughly twice the level of in-force lapse rates. 
In addition, there still remains about 40 basis points of positive impact from emergency orders. Our total benefit ratio in the U.S. came in lower than expected at 45.1% or 320 basis points lower than Q3 2020, which itself was heavily impacted by the initial pandemic.
Lower and deferred claims utilization impacts our IBNR held for incurred claims within a year. And as we get more data, our long-term models increased reliance on raw data leading to IBNR releases. This quarter, they amounted to a 3.5 percentage points impact on the benefit ratio, which leads to an underlying benefit ratio, excluding IBNR releases of 48.6%.
We expect the benefit ratio to increase gradually throughout the remainder of the year with the resumption of normal activity in our communities and by our policyholders. For the full year, we now expect our benefit ratio to be in the range of 43% to 46% versus original guidance of 48% to 51%.
Our expense ratio in the U.S. was 38.9%, up 170 basis points year-over-year, but with a lot of moving parts. Weaker sales performance negatively impacts revenue, however, the impact to our expense ratio is largely offset by lower DAC expense. Higher advertising spend increased the expense ratio by 40 basis points.
Our continued build-out of growth initiatives, group life and disability, network dental and vision and direct-to-consumer contributed to a 260 basis points increase to the ratio when isolating these investments. These important strategic growth investments are somewhat offset by our efforts to lower our core operating expenses, as we strive towards being the low-cost producer in the voluntary benefits space.
Net-net, despite a lot of moving parts, Q3 expenses are tracking according to plan. In the quarter, we also incurred $7.8 million of integration expenses, not included in adjusted earnings associated with recent acquisitions.
Adjusted net investment income in the U.S. was up 9.1%, mainly driven by favorable variable investment income in the quarter. Profitability in the U.S. segment remained strong with a pretax margin of 22.2%, with a low benefit ratio as the core driver.
With 9 months now in the books, we are increasing our pretax expectation for the full year. Initial expectations were for us to be towards the low end of 16% to 19%. We now expect to end up above the range indicated at FAB 2020.
In our Corporate segment, we recorded a pretax loss of $41 million, as adjusted net investment income was down $12 million versus last year due to low interest rates at the short end of the yield curve and change in value of certain tax credit investments. These tax credit investments run through the corporate net investment income line for U.S. GAAP purposes with an associated credit to the tax line. The net impact to our bottom line was a positive $5 million in the quarter. To date, these investments are performing well and in line with expectations.
In the fourth quarter, we do expect a significant tax credit investment to fund, which will bring some volatility to the corporate NII line as well as an offsetting credit to the tax line. Our capital position remains strong, and we ended the quarter with an SMR in Japan of north of 900% and an RBC north of 600% in Aflac Columbus. Unencumbered holding company liquidity stood at $4.2 billion, $1.8 billion above our minimum balance. Leverage, which includes the sustainability bond issued earlier this year, remains at a comfortable 22.6% in the middle of our leverage corridor of 20% to 25%. 
In the quarter, we repurchased $525 million of our own stock and paid dividends of $220 million, offering good relative IRR on these capital deployments. We will continue to be flexible and tactical in how we manage the balance sheet and deploy capital in order to drive strong risk-adjusted return on equity with a meaningful spread to our cost of capital.
Finally, I would like to mention that we will begin to expand our disclosures around the adoption of LDTI in our Form 10-Q and at FAB. At a high level, we do not see this accounting adoption as an economic event with no impact to our regulatory financials or capital base. There will be no change to how we manage the company, cash flows or capital.
With that, I'll hand it over to David to begin Q&A."

This is Yoshizumi of Aflac Japan. Thank you for the question. Let me start from our situation in the third quarter. And in the third quarter, since we had the largest spread of COVID-19 due to Delta strain. And as a result of that, the state of emergency declaration, which only covered 20 prefectures in the second quarter increased to 33 prefectures in the third quarter.
In other words, the state of emergency declaration area covered 90% of population in Japan.
And so there were impact to our sales performance and results due to decrease in face-to-face both station and meetings with customers and also delaying some of the worksite for station as well as the number of traffic -- customer traffic coming into our walk-in shops. 
And on top of that, there were some restrictions in traveling across prefectural borders, which prevented us from visiting customers. However, under this environment, we have been able to arrive at a point the same level of sales as with the third quarter last year. That is because of the online solicitation that we have conducted. And also the new product that we launched at the end of September, which was a new nursing care product. So as a result, we have been able to reach the same level of sales as in the third quarter last year.
Right now, in the fourth quarter, there is no area in Japan that is covered under the state of emergency declaration. And the economic activities are becoming much more active in Japan, although it's gradual. And we are expecting that our site sales will grow in the fourth quarter with -- by focusing on the sales of the nursing care product."

Okay, once again, this is Yoshizumi. While the new policy sales increased over the second quarter. However, the pace of recovery has been moderate.
Well, this was driven by several factors, including that it has been approximately 2 years since Japan Post refrained from conducting proactive sales. States of emergency limited the ability of sales representatives in many areas to meet customers and preparations are underway for the upcoming transfer of sales employees from Japan Post Company to Japan Post Insurance.
We have been conducting a range of activities to help promote sales through the Japan Post channel. For example, in the third quarter, we conducted training aimed at improving Japan Post agent mindset and skills. We did so through activities to inform policyholders about the latest coverage and engaged in proposal activities for those not yet covered by cancer insurance.
We are currently promoting cancer insurance sales by managing the sales process, which includes approaching customers, getting to know their needs, informed them of the latest coverage, making proposals based on the proposal form and closing the deal. We are emphasizing with Japan Post to increasing the number of proposals.
As the Japan Post Group announced in September, approximately 10,000 sales employees to be transferred from postal network to Japan Post Insurance will offer only Japan Post Insurance and Aflac cancer insurance product.
We believe that preparations for the transfer and transition of these employees also affected third quarter sales activities. And against that backdrop, sales will continue to strengthen, but we expect that a full recovery will take time.
Okay. That's it for me. So I will give it back to Mr. Koide. Koide-san, please."

In October, Aflac and Japan Post Group senior executives held our quarterly strategic alliance committee meeting. At that meeting, the Japan Post Group President, Charles Lake, I and others met. We had a very constructive discussion about the current situation, including the pace of sales recovery and discussed specific measures to improve cancer insurance sales.
We walked away pleased by the strong commitment expressed to strengthen the alliance to achieve growth. Against that backdrop, we expect that cancer insurance sales through the Japan Post channel will steadily recover over the medium term."

You heard a lot because there's been a lot going on because we consider this to be one of the most important issues that we are looking at. Let me just sum it up by saying that the third quarter definitely hurt our production everywhere because of people being required to stay at home under those emergency orders to some degree. And not like Europe, but strong enough that hurt sales. Has the attitude of the management team at Japan Post changed in any way from what it was earlier in the year? The answer is no. 
We are aligned. They are large shareholders. They know that so goes their production will play a big impact on the company, Aflac specifically. And what will take place. Is it slower than we thought -- it's slower than I thought. I was hoping it would pick back up. But with the emergency, it did slow it down. Do I think they will recapture where they were? I absolutely do. Do I know the time on it? I do not. Do I think that top management is pushing it? Yes, I do think they're pushing it. Do I think the lower management levels are on board yet? I think they're very tentative because not about our products, but any products because they've been pushed by the FSA, not to make any mistakes to be -- so it's just a little bit slower getting them comfortable back to normal where they can begin to go.
So I still think we have a winner with Japan Post. I think it's nice that not only are they selling for us, but that they are a large shareholder because that ties us so closely together. So I know you've heard a lot about this, so I'll stop there. Thanks."

Really, that relates to the fact that the large case space is already really used to more virtual and online experience sales.
A little bit more, let's say, headwinds in smaller case. Small case that we continue to dominate with our career channel. Again, I iterated earlier that we saw a return of our veterans. We have veterans come back to produce in that third quarter that had not produced all year, so we're looking well. Add that 2 together, really, one of the things we've been doing, though, is ensuring that we go to market as a unified sales distribution channel. 
Distribution continues to be a core competency of Aflac as it has always been. And you will see that for broker-driven sales in the lower case space, our agents participate in many cases, that's fulfillment. So that's a key aspect is there's overlap when the 2 work together also."

And when you think about the 3 to 99 space, which is where our agents sell, that's a particular part of the economy that obviously was hit harder and it's taking longer to recover from the pandemic. They're now facing a different kind of issue, and that is can they get the help to actually keep the businesses open and running properly.
So labor market conditions are very difficult to navigate right now for many small businesses. That same dynamic goes to our recruiting. So recruiting dynamics are more challenging in this type of a labor market. There's a lot of speculation about those conditions also starting to improve more so as we get out of the fourth quarter into early part of next year. But I just want to remind folks that you tend to think about the pandemic and that's, of course, affected small businesses, but labor market dynamics are also uniquely impactful to that franchise."

And you can essentially break it down as the upside is primarily driven by the lower-than-expected benefit ratios. They pretty much immediately flow through into higher statutory earnings and also higher FSA earnings as well, which then drives our capital formation and generation and ultimately, dividends up to the holding company.
So you can use the difference between our reported benefit ratios and our normalized benefit ratios as a guidance for what that sort of increased capital generation this year would be. Now when we then think about capital deployment, we have significant capital around the company and all the operating subsidiaries. We operate with very strong capital ratios.
And also at the holding company, we hold a very high level. Therefore, if our capital generation in a single year or a single period deviates from our initial expectations, it's not necessarily driving or changing our tactical view of how we deploy capital.
So I wouldn't necessarily immediately lead it into that from a -- on a short-term basis. Obviously, long term, it's more capital that we have available to us to deploy into our different deployment strategies."

It's becoming a very developed approach by not many, but a few of the leading insurance companies in Japan. And it's largely developed around care products historically, and that is offering certain concierge services for the elderly that are attached to elderly care insurance policy support, everything from nursing care support to in-home modernization to reduce the risk of injury, et cetera.
You're seeing some of that, of course, go on in the U.S., and it's going on in Japan, too. Our approach has been to, a, make sure that we're building out those types of services around the care product. But also, we think there's an opportunity for particularly Aflac to do that in the cancer space. And the way to think about it, we have formed an entity in Japan called Hatch health care. And that entity has been building out these noninsurance services surrounding cancer and now care insurance.
And effectively, the way it works is you as a policyholder, have an ability to call in to effectively a concierge desk that then helps direct you to either internal or third-party contractual agreements to support both diagnosis and early screening type services on cancer as well as post-cancer diagnosis care, everything from nutrition to mental health to other dynamics.
And so this is in the early stages of being built. We've been working on it for about 2 years now. It's now starting to become in a spot to be put into action.
But we think this is really the next horizon, if you will, of securing our market share and building our capabilities on the cancer side. And then also, it's really a necessary entity in supporting care insurance and competing with the other big care providers in the country."

It depends on what services you request and then there are charges that are applied through third-party contractual arrangements predominantly. That is the vision at the moment. So it's more around customer service, persistency, sales opportunity and market share. I should note that these types of services would also be offered on cancer policies sold through Japan Post. So it's really both a defensive and offensive play. But ultimately, this Hatch health care entity would drive its own independent revenue through contractual relationships and margins with third-party providers.
By the way, these are the types of things we would develop more at the financial analyst briefing because it's probably better done there. But just to provide you some color."

But we also have a number of growing businesses that are building. And we would expect over time that, that will drive through growth, that will drive quite some new business strain. And if we are successful in really executing on our plans, that will gradually drive down the capital level towards a long-term RBC ratio of 400%.
When we move up to the holding company, we clearly have significant readily deployable capital at $1.8 billion as of today. This will continue to support the deployment strategies that we have through dividends. We increased the dividend earlier this year by 17.9%. We have a very long-standing track record, as Dan mentioned, in terms of continuing to increase the dividend.
We have done a number of smaller acquisitions as well, where we have allocated capital to. And we've been an very active acquirer of our own stock as well. So I would expect that all of these to continue. I see the same headlines as all of you in terms of tax surcharge on buybacks. And obviously, we will study the details very, very closely. And that may mean that we will change our strategy somewhat. But long term, I don't see that as a significant change to how we generally funnel the capital back to shareholders."
