Well, 2020, we will bid you farewell and good riddance. All kidding aside, we are thankful to enter 2021 to start a new chapter and to continue our intended journey. 2020 taught us many lessons, not the least of which is that we have a community of employees, drivers and providers that are more than capable of dealing with change in crisis. 
The past year also revealed the essential nature of the services we provide as we experienced challenging and dynamic but ever-present demand through 2020. We affirmed again that all of the businesses we have committed to and invest again complement each other and create a very differentiated model for our customers. We look ahead to 2021 and beyond with confidence. 
During the fourth quarter, we experienced some very traditional demand cycles from customers across all services consistent with holiday activities. These needs were coupled with unusual inventory restocking and import challenges, particularly on the West Coast. Our fleet in the highway and contract businesses presented reliable capacity, held up well, and we discovered new ways to integrate our assets across customers and accounts. 
In Intermodal, we did substantially meet all coverage commitments during the quarter and the year. However, we struggled to achieve meaningful search report as we have been able to do in the past. Most of the inability to provide incremental capacity in particular off the West Coast was driven by Intermodal network imbalance, no real increase in our container fleet and a lack of timely empty equipment repositioning. We are working with our network managers, pricing teams, customers and our rail providers to improve on all of these challenges as we go forward. 
Our growth in Final Mile reveals the positive attributes and market demand for this channel. The growth presented in Highway Services, ITS at 56% and JBT at 50% for the fourth quarter of 2020, is encouraging. Also, the progress made with our 360 platforms continues to reveal good placement and benefit for our customers and carriers. Additionally, we found new ways to cross utilize these systems internally during the year, which we expect to continue. 
Anticipating questions about our margin targets in general, let me submit our plans. It has been a while since we have given meaningful updates to our stated goals, and the reality is that some key inputs related to achieving those results have changed over time. For Intermodal, we acknowledge that we have not met our margin goal for several years now. We will monitor this year's bid season to inform our expectations on how well we can expect to recover increases in our overall cost structure. Clearly, we see that certain fundamental conditions have evolved in the business model, primarily relating to rail purchase transportation expense, overall rail velocity, customer behavior, container fleet utilization and driver wage costs. One way or another, we will either confirm our target range shall remain [ 11% to 13% ] for EBIT margins in Intermodal or we will reset these expectations based on our customers' reaction. 
These margin target comments do not apply to -- only to Intermodal. As you are also aware, we have outperformed the high end of our stated target range in DCS for the seventh consecutive quarter. These targets are under review and, if deemed appropriate, we will announce any changes for the segment along the same time frame as the update for JBI. 
Finally, our stated margin rate for JBT has been 8% to 12%, which doesn't fully take into account the continued movement of that segment to a more asset-light model. Accordingly, this range is also under review for customer reaction. All this being said, we'll be monitoring the market very closely over the coming months and plan on updating our targets on a comprehensive basis at a later date. As a reminder, our margin goals are established purely to support requirements for returns on needed capital investments for our shareholders and so that we can continue to reinvest in the business to grow to meet the needs of our customers. 
As previously announced, we made several leadership changes during the fourth quarter, which we believe allow the company's needs going forward in several key areas. Let me just say that we are excited about all the changes we were able to make. Our bench is very strong. We have also made recent announcements about investments supporting inclusion, diversity and sustainability with the University of Arkansas. We're excited to head into 2021 and beyond with the momentum and opportunities we see and have confidence that our experience will take us in the right direction. 
I'll now turn the call over to John Kuhlow, our newly appointed Chief Financial Officer, for his conference. John?"

Comments on the fourth -- sorry, David. Can you hear me now? Okay. Sorry about that. 
Thank you, John. And good morning -- or excuse me, good afternoon to those of us -- of you joining us on the call today. I had a little technical difficulty there. I'll provide a couple of comments on the fourth quarter from a consolidated perspective and then let the business units cover their segments. 
Overall, we are pleased with the revenue growth this quarter with notable achievements in the Highway division as well as dedicated. Cost pressures in the fourth quarter were primarily related to higher costs across network and operations due to congestion and labor tightness from increased freight demand, higher driver costs to attract and train drivers in a capacity-constrained environment. And we also incurred a higher group medical costs in the quarter. 
A quick update on COVID costs. We continue to offer paid time off to our employees that are quarantined due to COVID concerns, and we incurred approximately $5 million of costs in the quarter designated as specific to COVID for a total of approximately $34 million year-to-date. While I believe our facility work is complete, we expect COVID PTO costs to continue given the current level of case counts and will likely be a headwind for us over the near term. 
We continue to closely monitor our working capital metrics and changing credit landscape as we enter the new year but are encouraged as we experienced what I would consider to be somewhat of a normal fourth quarter with respect to customer collections. 
We resumed stock buybacks early in the fourth quarter but found less opportunity in the back half of the quarter and then fell into our blackout period. We anticipate continuing our normal buyback approach in 2021. 
We ended the quarter with approximately $320 million in cash, with a resulting net debt of just under $1 billion. We still target our leverage ratio at 1x EBITDA and anticipate staying close within that range in '21. 
We ended the quarter with $150 million of net CapEx to finish the year with approximately $600 million, which was split roughly 1/3 growth CapEx and 2/3 replacement. As of today, we're forecasting our full year 2021 net capital expenditures to be approximately $850 million to $900 million, which includes revenue equipment as well as approximately $75 million of technology investment in our core transportation management system. We continued development of this technology in 2020 with more systems going live and thus becoming depreciable in 2021. For perspective, we expect approximately $20 million of incremental depreciation as we bring these systems into operations. 
Finally, we had some discrete items in the fourth quarter, which lowered our effective tax rate, ending the full year 2020 with a rate of 24%. As of today, we're expecting our 2021 effective rate to be in the range of 24% to 25%, but we'll continue to watch for new administration changes. 
That's all I have prepared today, and I'll now turn it over to Shelly."

My commercial update this afternoon will focus on general market trends, our expectations on how this will impact our organization and our customers in 2021 and how J.B. Hunt's investment in innovative culture continue",721,"Thank you, John, and good afternoon. My commercial update this afternoon will focus on general market trends, our expectations on how this will impact our organization and our customers in 2021 and how J.B. Hunt's investment in innovative culture continue to drive our ability to help us solve for our customers' supply chain needs. 
It is with little doubt that 2020 was one of the most challenging and dynamic freight markets in my career. The pandemic created a tremendous amount of uncertainty that was felt across the global supply chain. The massive shift from a services to a good economy and the inability for supply chains to keep up with demand have put inventory levels in a precarious position that will take time to rebuild. 
Import levels have and continued to surge, and congestion and dwell time ports, rail terminals and customer warehouses is also contributing to the inefficient use of available capacity. Combined with the challenges that this pandemic has had directly on our industry heroes are drivers. 
The supply of qualified and trained driving professionals have been impacted by capacity limitations at driving schools, quarantine protocols, retirements, in addition to pressure as a result of escalating insurance costs in the recent drug and alcohol clearing house. Unfortunately, these challenges have put inflationary cost pressures on our and many businesses and, as the market is anticipating, will put further inflationary pressure on transportation rates in 2021.
 These rates, however, are necessary to support our investment. We have already made a commitment to increase our capacity in both Intermodal and 360box. These investments are earmarked for areas in our network where we have confidence in the demand for our service at appropriate rates and our ability to turn our equipment effectively. We view both of these as requirements to support this investment and our desire to generate appropriate returns on this investment. We also have built in optionality to expand our capacity if the results that we experienced through bid season support further investment in other areas of our network, but in particular, the Intermodal Western network. 
While challenges always exist in our business, what I really want to highlight is the amazing job our organization has done at being able to solve some of our customers' toughest challenges in what was an extremely tight capacity environment in the fourth quarter. As I think you are aware by now, our organization is not constrained by the number of physical assets we own or operate, but by our ability to source capacity through our digital platform, the marketplace for J.B. Hunt 360. You see the blending of our physical assets and our digital assets enable us to accelerate our ability to solve for our customers' problems, to solve for yes when they need a capacity. The fourth quarter serves as a perfect demonstration of this dynamic as we and many other asset-based providers had physical constraints in our own capacity. But by leveraging the platform, ICS and JBT were able to deliver record-setting capacity performance for our customers. As an example, JBT delivered its highest revenue since 3Q of 2008 and with almost 1,900 fewer or 70% less company-owned trucks versus that period. 
In closing, I am proud of the team's ability to solve for yes for our customers. It's the power of our scroll, it's the power by diversified offering and it's the power of our platform. Our customers lean into us during this challenging time, which we think continues to support our strategy to honor commitments and maintain a long-term focus on serving our customers' needs. Our organization's mission to create the most efficient transportation network in North America is what drives us to be better and to do more. It is what has and what will continue to drive innovation in our company and for our industry. 
And speaking of innovation, in my expanded role in the organization, I will be spending more time focusing on how we can leverage the platform to deliver more value across the enterprise to our customers. I believe the opportunities to deliver value around predicting both price and visibility by leveraging data will be critical elements of our strategy moving forward, and I'll just say more to come on that in the near term. 
I'd now like to turn it over to Nick."

I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the performance of both Dedicated and Final Mile and also shed some light on our pipeline and some high-level views on our outlook. First, on Dedicated results. Dedicated",607,"Thank you, Shelley, and good afternoon. I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the performance of both Dedicated and Final Mile and also shed some light on our pipeline and some high-level views on our outlook. 
First, on Dedicated results. Dedicated had another solid quarter that delivered the highest fourth quarter revenue  and operating income for our segment in our history. And we have previously discussed the benefits of our diversified customer base and the flexibility of our operations have allowed us to serve with customers who needed while scaling back with customers who have been negatively impacted by the current state of the economy. 
Demand for our professional outsourced private fleet solution continues to build as customers and potential customers are faced with rising insurance costs, greater challenges recruiting and retaining a professional driving workforce, and the realization of the capital tied up in their own fleet does not provide them the flexibility that we have been able to deliver for our customers. 
We ended 2020 selling 1,331 trucks in DCS, which compares to 890 trucks sold year-to-date through the end of September quarter. As you can see in our fourth quarter stats, we added 192 trucks sequentially, which did impact the quarter in terms of start-up costs, and we would expect some pages of fleet growth and start-up costs returning to the business for the near to midterm. Also, we expect the industry has and will continue to face driver wage, pressure and we will be keeping a close eye on it. We monitor the performance of our fleet and believe we have some of the best wages and professional drivers in the industry who enjoy the consistency of working in a dedicated environment. Finally, we do expect to return to the previously stated range of selling 800 to 1,000 trucks a year. 
On Final Mile Services. Final Mile was able to deliver an all-time record revenue of $223 -- or $213 million or 17% greater than the previous record set last quarter. This growth was driven primarily by new contracted business throughout 2020 and supplemented by acquisitions. In fact, we track our contracted sales progress very similar to DCS, and I was proud of the team's performance in selling $84 million of new business and Final Mile throughout 2020. We are continuing to see strength and robust opportunities for growth across our portfolio and are excited about further building out our exercise equipment channel with the most recent acquisition of mass movement. Going forward, we will continue to make investments in our service and product offering to ensure the highest standards of service, safety and satisfaction are met in this critical and rapidly growing part of the supply chain. We believe these investments are critical as we deliver goods inside the home of our customers' customers. As a result of these investments and our desire to provide a differentiated service product, we'll be focusing on appropriate returns in our business to support these investments. 
Also, while still early in the new role as COO, I thought I would share some high-level thoughts on how I think we can leverage our platform to manage our assets more efficiently across  the enterprise. If I learned one thing in DCS over the years, it's the benefit of having density in markets and what flexibility that provides our customers and our own operations. I see tremendous opportunity for us to leverage the platform, to drive greater efficiencies across all assets across the enterprise and look forward to providing future updates in the near future. 
That concludes my remarks, and so I'll turn it over to Darren now."

Happy New Year, everyone. The quarter presented similar challenges for our Intermodal network fluidity and balance that were presented in the third quarter, similar to what we communicated that we expected would occur on our last call. Th",708,"Thank you, Nick. Happy New Year, everyone. The quarter presented similar challenges for our Intermodal network fluidity and balance that were presented in the third quarter, similar to what we communicated that we expected would occur on our last call. This afternoon, my comments will focus on network fluidity in balance, the demand pricing environment, and then I want to talk about 2021 and our focus for this year. 
First, our volumes were minus 2% in October, flat in November and plus 6% in December. Rail provider velocity challenges and terminal congestion weighed heavy on our container fleet productivity during the quarter. While we weren't able to move all the volume available to us, we were able to accomplish one of our top priorities that we have communicated since the start of the pandemic, and that is honoring our capacity commitments to our customers. Throughout the quarter, we utilized a much higher percentage of the outsourced dredge capacity in an effort to drive productivity through the network. This included efforts to pull containers from the rail terminals to assist in the congestion challenges. We also rerouted significant volume over Phoenix, Arizona and Stockton, California that would have normally moved from a Southern California origin rail terminal. These higher costs of the drayage operation are reflected in the results of the quarter. Our customers participated with incremental revenue to help cover those costs, but that revenue fell short of providing the same margin as what we would have seen without that activity. 
We have commented on the labor challenges we are all facing during the pandemic on the previous earnings calls. California was particularly difficult during the quarter. We certainly believe the rail network faced some labor challenges at terminals and at locations where we believe our rail providers expect and will deliver better productivity in the future, certainly better than what we experienced in the quarter. I make these comments primarily to highlight that we faced conditions in the fourth quarter that we can address and improve as we move out of the pandemic. 
So far in January, volume demand remains extremely strong, and the cost to serve our customers remains elevated. Rail velocity and congestion has improved for now, but labor challenges and increased demand will continue to impact rail velocity as the year goes on. We fully expect pricing in this bid cycle will cover the cost increases that we are experiencing that are more structural in nature in our network. 
We believe 2021 will present opportunities for us to make progress on the margin front. Costs on all fronts, dray, rail and productivity have all come at us at a fast pace in 2020, and this new year presents our opportunity to price those costs into our business. We must find growth opportunities that complement our network and provide balanced benefits while also increasing core pricing that reflects the current cost to serve our market. The very early and small percentage of pricing results achieved thus far are encouraging. We are confident that our customers want to grow with us at prices that support investment in capacity expansion. 
We have ordered over 6,000 containers that will be manufactured in 2021, and we have flexibility on how and when those containers will be rolled out. We have strong confidence in the ability of our network to consume growth, particularly in the East. We also recognize that we still have significant cost and velocity challenges in Southern California, and simply adding containers is not the only solution required to grow capacity in that key market. BNSF and J.B. Hunt are working together to find better capacity solutions for our customers, and our prices will reflect those efforts. Importantly, as we progress through bid season, we do have opportunities to increase our container order if market dynamics support the need for additional capacity. 
Throughout 2020, our employees have been the backbone of our conviction to honor the commitments we made to our customers. I am so thankful to our employee base for that conviction, and I believe we will translate that culture into benefits for our financial performance and our returns in 2021.

I'd like to share how honored I am to be in this new role and just how much excitement there is in the organization for our Highway Services businesses, which includes both Integrated Capacity Solutions, or IPS, and trucks. My comments this afternoon will focus on the performance of both segments and, as Shelly alluded, how we were able to solve for yes in a very dynamic environment for our customers and deliver the capacity of it in the quarter. 
ICS was able to deliver revenue of $587 million or 56% growth over the prior year, which was also 36% growth sequentially from the third quarter. As previous calls have referenced, our investments in technology and people have been around enabling us to scale the business, and we were able to see a lens of this dynamic play out in the quarter. 
As we talked about scaling the business, our focus has been on being able to grow revenue and gross profit at a disproportionate rate to operating costs. We were able to deliver $31 million of sequential gross profit improvement and a corresponding $24 million increase in operating income, which translates into a 77% incremental margin on every dollar of gross profit. 
Speaking of which, ICS did deliver positive $5.6 million of operating income in the quarter. And while we have shared our expectations for returning to profitability by second half of '21, we are going to stand by that view as there were just a lot of unique dynamics in play in the fourth quarter, and we expect some seasonal effects plus continued investment to keep us on track for delivering on that expectation. 
In JBT or truck, the segment was able to deliver 50% growth in fourth quarter revenue year-over-year to $140 million. This is the highest achieved -- excuse me, this is the highest revenue achieved in the segment since the third quarter of '08, as Shelley had mentioned in her opening remarks, and we have approximately 70% fewer company-owned trucks versus that time period. As you're beginning to see, the power of the platform allows both ICS and JBT to scale with and for our customers to solve for their needs. And in the fourth quarter, that need was capacity. As JBT has shifted to more of an asset-light model, we have an ability to provide trailing capacity to customers that may be hauled by the J.B. Hunt owned equipment, our independent contractors or power-only capacity sourced through the platform. This is our 360 offering. This gives us greater options to choose what is best for the customer who is looking for a drop and hook capacity solution. And by best, I mean the most efficient option that eliminates waste in the system. 
To close out my comments, I would just like to reiterate how Highway Services powered by the platform was able to meet the needs of our customers in the quarter by delivering flexible capacity options. We continue to see strong activity between customers and capacity in our platform, which will continue to support investments into our Highway Services solutions. whether it's in the marketplace or within the 360 program. 
I'd like to turn it back over to Brad now."

I do think that, obviously, there may be a little reprieve in the parcel demand and some other impacts on the rail network. And the full truckload Intermodal seems to have some momentum in terms of our ability to drive capacity out West. So I think we'll have a better position going forward in the first quarter than we felt in the early part of the fourth quarter around moving empties out West. That doesn't mean that we'll be moving as many as the customers would like for us to move. So congestion and velocity slowdown has been a challenge, but I think the fourth -- the first quarter of '21 does present the potential for better velocity than what we experienced in Q4."

As we go through the first quarter, we have already experienced growth in the East Coast and feel confident that, that will continue to be available to us. 
That growth is not tied to customers rerouting to different imports That's highway conversion of business that has been available for us for some time now through the back half of last year. We are aware of some customers that are talking about altering their import strategy. We'll continue to look at what their plans are, and we'll provide solutions as those opportunities present themselves.

And so think more of what do our customers need, and then we applied what was the best answer based on the capacity that we could source at their price and service that the customer really could work with. 
We still think there is a huge opportunity in intermodal. I go back to what we see in the platform. It is a significant number of shipments that are moving on the highway that really should convert into Intermodal with more fluidity and our ability to really get the network more in motion. But our objective, Brian, is really to own that business. If you look across our entire organization, whether it's 1 pallet to everything a customer moves, we now can handle that in North America.

As Shelly just mentioned, our ability to say yes and find that answer for our customers. But each and every one of them are now reevaluating what their network and what their makeup of carrier mix is going to be for 2021. So we still have work to do on our tech investments that will be somewhat of a drag for us in the first half as we close out the investment component And so as we think about that, there's just a little bit of unusual in this in Q4 that makes it very hard to predict as we move into 2021. What I would say is that we are incredibly satisfied with how the platform performs with that rapid growth and that rapid pressure of customer needs.

And we still feel strongly. And Shelley mentioned it, we're bringing on customers with Intermodal at the right time when we have capacity available. That doesn't mean that we're taking capacity away from a commitment that we've already made. As we go into '21, we did talk about, we've ordered more containers. We expect pricing to accommodate. Potentially is if velocity as our rail system today is more structurally slower than what it was 4 or 5 years ago, then pricing is going to have to contemplate that when we think about investment in those long-term assets. And so that's a big focus for us, but we did highlight that we're buying equipment this year because we're confident in the customers' desire to buy that service. So -- and as Brad mentioned, I mean, we do expect Intermodal volumes to grow at least as strong as the industry. I do think in the back half of last year, that was a challenge for us. particularly in the network and the weighting where we were relative to capacity demands on the West Coast. And as moving forward, we're going to have to grow where capacity is available. and then look to change operations in the markets where capacity is difficult and how do we drive efficiency out west. And we highlighted that we're engaged in conversations with a rail provider there, and we do believe we can both be more efficient in the coming years out West."

The outsourced market is extremely difficult. We honored commitments to our customers. And as we go through 2021, we are hopeful and have the expectation that I'm not going to -- I want to be cautious on using stability. But certainly, a lot of those challenges will fall behind us. The market certainly is ready to support strong price increases, and we'll see what we can do. I think that's been our message is that we'd like a more stable year to evaluate that.

I'll just add, Scott. This is John, that there are a number of items that are -- we hope are behind, like arbitration PSR.

This is John, that there are a number of items that are -- we hope are behind, like arbitration PSR. The pandemic has been this year and some of the outputs of that are things like -- I was talking to Craig earlier, I know, Nick, you've got some day on this. Driver availability is in a new place today. And so while we're going to go to the market for rates to help deal with changes and evolution in our cost structure to get back to that place we think we should be, by the way. And I hope we're being very clear because I think we have a duty to be clear that we haven't changed our expectations. We believe this year will solidify in a more settled -- I'd like the term, Shelley, settled environment. Now it's not a smooth environment. It's sort of the ongoing current state. 
Let's look at driver availability, as I was just referencing. Driver schools are under duress, okay? Drivers are retiring, and schools are putting out new drivers. That puts a unique pressure. That's going to be ongoing though. The things around PSR and arbitration, all that, we think, are more settled. So we've got to go to market, and we've got to see if the customer is willing to pay for J.B. Hunt to provide company assets to do dray, to present a large fleet, to have a presence that can serve, that can do things that we've been able to do in the past. They're going to answer that question for us through this year in their decisions around how they award business and outlook rates. If we can't get that answer to get us back to 11% to 13%, then I'm going to make sure we communicate that and all the things that go with it. But we're not there in early indications and conversations we're having with Shelley and the sales team and Darren and his team and all that. We still have optimism that the customer needs what we provide, and it's unique, by the way, And we want to keep providing it, but we need that support, and we need those margins to return to achieve the returns that we've enjoyed in the past. And that's really where we are. 
I also think it's important to say, it's not just Intermodal margins, which was purely the purpose of that part of my opening remarks that the whole company has to take a really deep breath and look at where we are going to both. We also need to look at where we are dedicated Because as we split that business out, we're saying, hey, we need to look at that business, the returns of the assets required for that business. And we need to make sure we're on steady, again, the term steady footing for what we can present in terms of expectations, not only to you but to our customers as we set price and as we establish contract. 
Same is true for our truckload business. We're looking at, hey, there's a place here with the growth we experienced in the fourth quarter. And some of the nuances that we're experimenting with around trailers, we might be able to remodel our capital thoughts in Truckload that might be able to be supported by a different margin profile. And I'm just trying to coordinate that conversation as not a onetime event, a one-off. I think the company has a duty to evaluate its expectations. And this is the year that we're calling out we're going to do that. I think we'll be able to give you progress reports along the way. And I think there'll be a lot of clarity or pay with it."

And I will tell you, I think that our customers want more from us than what we are planning right now. But we'll see that through the bid season and be able to establish that. 
And then to reiterate what Darren said, our margins will improve in Intermodal. That's what we're launching towards. We took care of our customers. We reiterated that through the entire pandemic all through 2020 that we would honor our commitments, and it is very much like what we did in 2017 and 2018. We honored our commitments. We came back to customers in 2018, and our customers matched up with us cost to price. We don't expect to change from that, but we want to walk through our bid season to see if we should take more of a stance on equipment ordering past what we've already committed."

So we've taken off of that offering. And today, we've seen a great growth path and being able to offer a different capital profile that can run at different margins and still present the kind of returns that we expect as Darren said. That's been our North Star for a very long time, and it serves us well, and we aren't about to abandon it.

But Darren, I wanted to ask how congestion is impacting the Intermodal business vis-a-vis volume and cost?

And I know you're adding more trailers this year, which will help with growth.

We have grown our fleet to deal with a little bit weaker terms and pricing was -- returns were supporting that. 
As we came into 2020, terms were not built around the size of our fleet, and our volume was not yet where we had anticipated it would be based on how large our fleet was. So we were anticipating velocity and improvements in 2020, and we were experiencing that right up until the pandemic. 
So really, starting in June, demand went off the charts, and everything slowed down a bit. And so yes, you're not seeing any kind of significant change in trends. And that's relevant to how bad congestion has impacted the amount of time it takes a container to travel on Intermodal loads today is longer than it was a year ago. And we would expect for that to improve this year -- or I should say it was longer in Q4. We should expect that, that transit will either improve this year or the pricing will reflect that we have to own the asset for a longer amount of time in order to accommodate the load for the customer. And that's how we're going to view it. But I do expect congestion and velocity in our system to gradually improve in '21."

So a lot of that work has already occurred. And really it's about finalizing our tech development so that we can maximize our own efficiencies with the activities that are on the platform. There's no question that we expect to continue to grow volume. We've touched on a little bit earlier that the abnormal spot volumes will look for a more efficient way to transact in '21. And that's okay, but we know we have to have a lot more momentum focused on bringing on new customers predominantly at the small and midsized shipper level to help us continue to fuel the platform. And that's where we -- as we think about second half, it really is the culmination of the completion of the tech spend and the pivot of overall volume and activity on the platform that swings us back to profitability as we model that out. 
Now what we saw again in Q4 was somewhat amplified due to the extremely abnormal high-level calling of revenue, if you will, on the stock side, And they didn't just give us a glimpse of what it will be when we get there. We are not anticipating that strength necessarily over these first few months. If it continues to stay as hot as the market, there is a chance that, that could occur a little bit earlier. But we're not talking about day 1. We're talking about months, not quarters there. So I think that, that just reaffirms that second half has high confidence on our ability to deliver the positive."

That's a direct result of our reorganization. So we've already started to see benefits from the platform in a portion of our ICS segment Our focus has been really making sure that we complete our internal work for our people, and that's what Brad is referencing are continuing to make investments. We're letting our customers and our carriers drive us on how to create a more efficient way to do business in both of those spends and now will be ongoing. However, we will complete the internal work that will actually marry the externalization of our 360 platform with our internal resources. So think of an automated shipment, they'll actually come off of the conveyor belt, if you will, to our people where we really need to problem solve. Today, that operate in 2 silos. You'll start to see the leverage that happens inside that. 
And then last note I'll make on ICS returning to profitability in the second half. Certainly, we're trying to march towards repeating what our fourth quarter performance was. So we've not given up hope that we can continue into Q1 and into Q2, but we do have specific ideas earmarked for our future. And those ideas could put pressure on us, but we will continue. Remember, our strategy is to continue to invest in our people and in our technology so that we can scale the platform. Scale is the most critical component in creating a more efficient network. And so that will be our focus through the first half of this year. And if we can outperform like we did in Q4, I think you'll be pleased with those results."

So one of the things in my standard role to really think about how do we leverage the platform across the organization, and so I'll be able to really focus in on how we do that on behalf of our customers. So if you think about the work that I've mentioned earlier that's in the platform today that should be moving Intermodal, how do we get more prescriptive on the front end of that instead of running a report afterwards, actually making the recommendation and the predicting of how a shipment or recommending how a shipment can move. That's just 1 example, but many that we see across the organization. 
And I want to make sure that I clarify something. We are not at the end of our tech spend. We are at the end of our internal work that will connect our external platform with our internal platform. We will continue to invest in J.B. Hunt 360 as we see this as an accelerator for our organization from a revenue perspective. I think you were able to see that in JBT and ICS. It's the first place that we started in our 360 platform, that was really the place that was logically adjacent to the work that we were doing. And so we were able to see the benefit there, but you'll continue to see 360. That's why Nick made in his opening comments remarks around the platform and how we will leverage that. 
And then finally, I think you'll see this in our annual report, the number of millions amounts that we eliminated from our assets leveraging the platform, we directly get to see that in cost reduction. And the more our platform scales, the more our own assets should be the most efficient assets or certainly at the top of the most efficient assets available in the market. So continuing to try to drive cost on behalf of our customers."

We really don't get a chance to talk about the more comprehensive advantages that we have. And there's a lot of discussion in our remarks about platform, enterprise companies solving problems for customers that really use all the parts. And so it's important that we hear the volume on this question, and I think we're going to work hard to make sure we get that resolved as soon as we can. But where we are in the use of our systems is encouraging for us and revealed itself a lot, I think, in the fourth quarter. I think our customers look to J.B. Hunt to get answers. They don't look for us to buy services. They find an attitude here, an investment here, a mindset that is call us, we will help you figure this out. And we are entrepreneurial enough to allow ourselves to find new leads. And I think that is a very important element that is longer term in nature. 
It doesn't necessarily answer the immediate questions, but Highway plus Intermodal plus Dedicated plus Final Mile plus platform, et cetera, is J.B. Hunt. And it's a strong position we're in. The settled nature of our go forward into '21 gives us a -- as good a chance as we're going to have to answer these questions, and we're going to answer. Whether we like the answer or not, we're going to answer the questions. And I know there's commitment there. I'm excited that we got to a place where we could add equipment in Intermodal. I think that's a very important thing to take away. This fleet will be over 100,000 units in 2021. And as a provider of services and value to customers, we stay [indiscernible] there. And that, I think, we expect demands a certain place in the market. 
The Final Mile is exciting. Our pipelines really are in good shape in all of our businesses, frankly. And I'd just add that our leadership team is very cohesive. We've made some changes that you guys can't and like you can't all see from where I sit, but our energy is up. We're asking new questions. We've moved the board around a little bit. And I'm just really excited about that. I think that's something that continue to reveal itself. I think we were pleased and encouraged for the quarter. We'll see how that's received. But we care less about this quarter. We care more about the long term. 
I'm going to give a final shout-out to the good people of J.B. Hunt who, through 2020, took on a pandemic. And not only did we survive it, we thrived in it, and we actually grew closer together as a team, both at the leadership level but at every level in the company. And I'm very proud of that.

Well, 2020, we will bid you farewell and good riddance. All kidding aside, we are thankful to enter 2021 to start a new chapter and to continue our intended journey. 2020 taught us many lessons, not the least of which is that we have a community of employees, drivers and providers that are more than capable of dealing with change in crisis. 
The past year also revealed the essential nature of the services we provide as we experienced challenging and dynamic but ever-present demand through 2020. We affirmed again that all of the businesses we have committed to and invested in complement each other and create a very differentiated model for our customers. We look ahead to 2021 and beyond with confidence. 
During the fourth quarter, we experienced some very traditional demand cycles from customers across all services consistent with holiday activities. These needs were coupled with unusual inventory restocking and import challenges, particularly on the West Coast. Our fleet in the highway and contract businesses presented reliable capacity, held up well, and we discovered new ways to integrate our assets across customers and accounts. 
In Intermodal, we did substantially meet all coverage commitments during the quarter and the year. However, we struggled to achieve meaningful search report as we have been able to do in the past. Most of the inability to provide incremental capacity in particular off the West Coast was driven by Intermodal network imbalance, no real increase in our container fleet and a lack of timely empty equipment repositioning. We are working with our network managers, pricing teams, customers and our rail providers to improve on all of these challenges as we go forward. 
Our growth in Final Mile reveals the positive attributes and market demand for this channel. The growth presented in Highway Services, ITS at 56% and JBT at 50% for the fourth quarter of 2020, is encouraging. Also, the progress made with our 360 platforms continues to reveal good placement and benefit for our customers and carriers. Additionally, we found new ways to cross utilize these systems internally during the year, which we expect to continue. 
Anticipating questions about our margin targets in general, let me submit our plans. It has been a while since we have given meaningful updates to our stated goals, and the reality is that some key inputs related to achieving those results have changed over time. For Intermodal, we acknowledge that we have not met our margin goal for several years now. We will monitor this year's bid season to inform our expectations on how well we can expect to recover increases in our overall cost structure. Clearly, we see that certain fundamental conditions have evolved in the business model, primarily relating to rail purchase transportation expense, overall rail velocity, customer behavior, container fleet utilization and driver wage costs. One way or another, we will either confirm our target range shall remain 11% to 13% for EBIT margins in Intermodal or we will reset these expectations based on our customers' reaction. 
These margin target comments do not apply to -- only to Intermodal. As you are also aware, we have outperformed the high end of our stated target range in DCS for the seventh consecutive quarter. These targets are under review and, if deemed appropriate, we will announce any changes for the segment along the same time frame as the update for JBI. 
Finally, our stated margin rate for JBT has been 8% to 12%, which doesn't fully take into account the continued movement of that segment to a more asset-light model. Accordingly, this range is also under review for customer reaction. All this being said, we'll be monitoring the market very closely over the coming months and plan on updating our targets on a comprehensive basis at a later date. As a reminder, our margin goals are established purely to support requirements for returns on needed capital investments for our shareholders and so that we can continue to reinvest in the business to grow to meet the needs of our customers. 
As previously announced, we made several leadership changes during the fourth quarter, which we believe allow the company's needs going forward in several key areas. Let me just say that we are excited about all the changes we were able to make. Our bench is very strong. We have also made recent announcements about investments supporting inclusion, diversity and sustainability with the University of Arkansas. We're excited to head into 2021 and beyond with the momentum and opportunities we see and have confidence that our experience will take us in the right direction. 
I'll now turn the call over to John Kuhlow, our newly appointed Chief Financial Officer, for his comments. John?"

Comments on the fourth -- consolidated -- can you hear me now? Okay. Sorry about that. 
Thank you, John. And good morning -- or excuse me, good afternoon to those of us -- of you joining us on the call today. I had a little technical difficulty there. I'll provide a couple of comments on the fourth quarter from a consolidated perspective and then let the business units cover their segments. 
Overall, we are pleased with the revenue growth this quarter with notable achievements in the Highway division as well as Dedicated. Cost pressures in the fourth quarter were primarily related to higher costs across network and operations due to congestion and labor tightness from increased freight demand, higher driver costs to attract and retrain drivers in a capacity-constrained environment. And we also incurred a higher group medical costs in the quarter. 
A quick update on COVID costs. We continue to offer paid time off to our employees that are quarantined due to COVID concerns, and we incurred approximately $5 million of costs in the quarter designated as specific to COVID for a total of approximately $34 million year-to-date. While I believe our facility work is complete, we expect COVID PTO costs to continue given the current level of case counts and will likely be a headwind for us over the near term. 
We continue to closely monitor our working capital metrics and the changing credit landscape as we enter the new year but are encouraged as we experienced what I would consider to be somewhat of a normal fourth quarter with respect to customer collections. 
We resumed stock buybacks early in the fourth quarter but found less opportunity in the back half of the quarter and then fell into our blackout period. We anticipate continuing our normal buyback approach in 2021. 
We ended the quarter with approximately $320 million in cash, with a resulting net debt of just under $1 billion. We still target our leverage ratio at 1x EBITDA and anticipate staying close within that range in '21. 
We ended the quarter with $150 million of net CapEx to finish the year with approximately $600 million, which was split roughly 1/3 growth CapEx and 2/3 replacement. As of today, we're forecasting our full year 2021 net capital expenditures to be approximately $850 million to $900 million, which includes revenue equipment as well as approximately $75 million of technology investment in our core transportation management system. We continued development of this technology in 2020 with more systems going live and thus becoming depreciable in 2021. For perspective, we expect approximately $20 million of incremental depreciation as we bring these systems into operations. 
Finally, we had some discrete items in the fourth quarter, which lowered our effective tax rate, ending the full year 2020 with a rate of 24%. As of today, we're expecting our 2021 effective rate to be in the range of 24% to 25%, but we'll continue to watch for new administration changes. 
That's all I have prepared today, and I'll now turn it over to Shelley."

My commercial update this afternoon will focus on general market trends, our expectations on how this will impact our organization and our customers in 2021 and how J.B.

My commercial update this afternoon will focus on general market trends, our expectations on how this will impact our organization and our customers in 2021 and how J.B. Hunt's investment in innovative culture continue to drive our ability to help us solve for our customers' supply chain needs. 
It is with little doubt that 2020 was one of the most challenging and dynamic freight markets in my career. The pandemic created a tremendous amount of uncertainty that was felt across the global supply chain. The massive shift from a services to a good economy and the inability for supply chains to keep up with demand have put inventory levels in a precarious position that will take time to rebuild. 
Import levels have and continued to surge, and congestion and dwell time at ports, rail terminals and customer warehouses is also contributing to the inefficient use of available capacity. Combined with the challenges that this pandemic has had directly on our industry heroes are drivers. 
The supply of qualified and trained driving professionals have been impacted by capacity limitations at driving schools, quarantine protocols, retirements, in addition to pressure as a result of escalating insurance costs in the recent drug and alcohol clearinghouse. Unfortunately, these challenges have put inflationary cost pressures on our and many businesses and, as the market is anticipating, will put further inflationary pressure on transportation rates in 2021.
These rates, however, are necessary to support our investment. We have already made a commitment to increase our capacity in both Intermodal and 360box. These investments are earmarked for areas in our network where we have confidence in the demand for our service at appropriate rates and our ability to turn our equipment effectively. We view both of these as requirements to support this investment and our desire to generate appropriate returns on this investment. We also have built in optionality to expand our capacity if the results that we experienced through bid season support further investment in other areas of our network, but in particular, the Intermodal Western network. 
While challenges always exist in our business, what I really want to highlight is the amazing job our organization has done at being able to solve some of our customers' toughest challenges in what was an extremely tight capacity environment in the fourth quarter. As I think you are aware by now, our organization is not constrained by the number of physical assets we own or operate, but by our ability to source capacity through our digital platform, the marketplace for J.B. Hunt 360. You see the blending of our physical assets and our digital assets enable us to accelerate our ability to solve for our customers' problems, to solve for yes when they needed capacity. The fourth quarter serves as a perfect demonstration of this dynamic as we and many other asset-based providers had physical constraints in our own capacity. But by leveraging the platform, ICS and JBT were able to deliver record-setting capacity performance for our customers. As an example, JBT delivered its highest revenue since 3Q of 2008 and with almost 1,900 fewer or 70% less company-owned trucks versus that period. 
In closing, I am proud of the team's ability to solve for yes for our customers. It's the power of our scroll, it's the power of our diversified offering and it's the power of our platform. Our customers lean into us during this challenging time, which we think continues to support our strategy to honor commitments and maintain a long-term focus on serving our customers' needs. Our organization's mission to create the most efficient transportation network in North America is what drives us to be better and to do more. It is what has and what will continue to drive innovation in our company and for our industry. 
And speaking of innovation, in my expanded role in the organization, I will be spending more time focusing on how we can leverage the platform to deliver more value across the enterprise to our customers. I believe the opportunities to deliver value around predicting both price and visibility by leveraging data will be critical elements of our strategy moving forward, and I'll just say more to come on that in the near term.

I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the performance of both Dedicated and Final Mile and also shed some light on our pipeline and some high-level views on our outlook. 
First, on Dedicated results. Dedicated had another solid quarter that delivered the highest fourth quarter revenue  and operating income for our segment in our history. And we have previously discussed the benefits of our diversified customer base and the flexibility of our operations have allowed us to serve with customers who needed while scaling back with customers who have been negatively impacted by the current state of the economy. 
Demand for our professional outsourced private fleet solution continues to build as customers and potential customers are faced with rising insurance costs, greater challenge in recruiting and retaining a professional driving workforce, and the realization of the capital tied up in their own fleet does not provide them the flexibility that we have been able to deliver for our customers. 
We ended 2020 selling 1,331 trucks in DCS, which compares to 890 trucks sold year-to-date through the end of September quarter. As you can see in our fourth quarter stats, we added 192 trucks sequentially, which did impact the quarter in terms of start-up costs, and we would expect some cadence of fleet growth and start-up costs returning to the business for the near to mid-term. Also, we expect the industry has and will continue to face driver wage pressure, and we will be keeping a close eye on it. We monitor the performance of our fleet and believe we have some of the best wages and professional drivers in the industry who enjoy the consistency of working in a dedicated environment. Finally, we do expect to return to the previously stated range of selling 800 to 1,000 trucks a year. 
On Final Mile Services. Final Mile was able to deliver an all-time record revenue of $223 -- or $213 million or 17% greater than the previous record set last quarter. This growth was driven primarily by new contracted business throughout 2020 and supplemented by acquisitions. In fact, we track our contracted sales progress very similar to DCS, and I was proud of the team's performance in selling $84 million of new business and Final Mile throughout 2020. We are continuing to see strength and robust opportunities for growth across our portfolio and are excited about further building out or exercise equipment channel with the most recent acquisition of Mass Movement. 
Going forward, we will continue to make investments in our service and product offering to ensure the highest standards of service, safety and satisfaction are met in this critical and rapidly growing part of the supply chain. We believe these investments are critical as we deliver goods inside the home of our customers' customers. As a result of these investments and our desire to provide a differentiated service product, we'll be focusing on appropriate returns in our business to support these investments. 
Also, while still early in the new role as COO, I thought I would share some high-level thoughts on how I think we can leverage our platform to manage our assets more efficiently across the enterprise. If I learned one thing in DCS over the years, it's the benefit of having density in markets and what flexibility that provides our customers and our own operations. I see tremendous opportunity for us to leverage the platform, to drive greater efficiencies across all assets across the enterprise and look forward to providing future updates in the near future. 
That concludes my remarks, and so I'll turn it over to Darren now."

Happy New Year, everyone. The quarter presented similar challenges for our Intermodal network fluidity and balance that were presented in the third quarter, similar to what we communicated that we expected would occur on our last call. Th",708,"Thank you, Nick. Happy New Year, everyone. The quarter presented similar challenges for our Intermodal network fluidity and balance that were presented in the third quarter, similar to what we communicated that we expected would occur on our last call. This afternoon, my comments will focus on network fluidity in balance, the demand pricing environment, and then I want to talk about 2021 and our focus for this year. 
First, our volumes were minus 2% in October, flat in November and plus 6% in December. Rail provider velocity challenges and terminal congestion weighed heavy on our container fleet productivity during the quarter. While we weren't able to move all the volume available to us, we were able to accomplish one of our top priorities that we have communicated since the start of the pandemic, and that is honoring our capacity commitments to our customers. 
Throughout the quarter, we utilized a much higher percentage of the outsourced dredge capacity in an effort to drive productivity through the network. This included efforts to pull containers from the rail terminals to assist in the congestion challenges. We also rerouted significant volume over Phoenix, Arizona and Stockton, California that would have normally moved from a Southern California origin rail terminal. These higher costs of the drayage operation are reflected in the results of the quarter. Our customers participated with incremental revenue to help cover those costs, but that revenue fell short of providing the same margin as what we would have seen without that activity. 
We have commented on the labor challenges we are all facing during the pandemic on the previous earnings calls. California was particularly difficult during the quarter. We certainly believe the rail network faced some labor challenges at terminals and at locations where we believe our rail providers expect and will deliver better productivity in the future, certainly better than what we experienced in the quarter. I make these comments primarily to highlight that we faced conditions in the fourth quarter that we can address and improve as we move out of the pandemic. 
So far in January, volume demand remains extremely strong, and the cost to serve our customers remains elevated. Rail velocity and congestion has improved for now, but labor challenges and increased demand will continue to impact rail velocity as the year goes on. We fully expect pricing in this bid cycle will cover the cost increases that we are experiencing that are more structural in nature in our network. 
We believe 2021 will present opportunities for us to make progress on the margin front. Costs on all fronts, dray, rail and productivity have all come at us at a fast pace in 2020, and this new year presents our opportunity to price those costs into our business. We must find growth opportunities that complement our network and provide balanced benefits while also increasing core pricing that reflects the current cost to serve our market. The very early and small percentage of pricing results achieved thus far are encouraging. We are confident that our customers want to grow with us at prices that support investment in capacity expansion. 
We have ordered over 6,000 containers that will be manufactured in 2021, and we have flexibility on how and when those containers will be rolled out. We have strong confidence in the ability of our network to consume growth, particularly in the East. We also recognize that we still have significant cost and velocity challenges in Southern California, and simply adding containers is not the only solution required to grow capacity in that key market. BNSF and J.B. Hunt are working together to find better capacity solutions for our customers, and our prices will reflect those efforts. Importantly, as we progress through bid season, we do have opportunities to increase our container order if market dynamics support the need for additional capacity. 
Throughout 2020, our employees have been the backbone of our conviction to honor the commitments we made to our customers. I am so thankful to our employee base for that conviction, and I believe we will translate that culture into benefits for our financial performance and our returns in 2021. 
That completes my prepared comments, so now I will turn it over to Brad Hicks."

I'd like to share how honored I am to be in this new role and just how much excitement there is in the organization for our Highway Services businesses, which includes both Integrated Capacity Solutions, or IPS, and",542,"Thank you, Darren, and good afternoon. I'd like to share how honored I am to be in this new role and just how much excitement there is in the organization for our Highway Services businesses, which includes both Integrated Capacity Solutions, or IPS, and trucks. My comments this afternoon will focus on the performance of both segments and, as Shelley alluded, how we were able to solve for yes in a very dynamic environment for our customers and deliver the capacity they needed in the quarter. 
ICS was able to deliver revenue of $587 million or 56% growth over the prior year, which was also 36% growth sequentially from the third quarter. As previous calls have referenced, our investments in technology and people have been around enabling us to scale the business, and we were able to see a glimpse of this dynamic play out in the quarter. 
As we talked about scaling the business, our focus has been on being able to grow revenue and gross profit at a disproportionate rate to operating costs. We were able to deliver $31 million of sequential gross profit improvement and a corresponding $24 million increase in operating income, which translates into a 77% incremental margin on every dollar of gross profit. 
Speaking of which, ICS did deliver positive $5.6 million of operating income in the quarter. And while we have shared our expectations for returning to profitability by second half of '21, we are going to stand by that view as there were just a lot of unique dynamics in play in the fourth quarter, and we expect some seasonal effects plus continued investment to keep us on track for delivering on that expectation. 
In JBT or truck, the segment was able to deliver 50% growth in fourth quarter revenue year-over-year to $140 million. This is the highest achieved -- excuse me, this is the highest revenue achieved in the segment since the third quarter of '08, as Shelley had mentioned in her opening remarks, and we have approximately 70% fewer company-owned trucks versus that time period. 
As you're beginning to see, the power of the platform allows both ICS and JBT to scale with and for our customers to solve for their needs. And in the fourth quarter, that need was capacity. As JBT has shifted to more of an asset-light model, we have an ability to provide trailing capacity to customers that may be hauled by other J.B. Hunt-owned equipment, our independent contractors or power-only capacity sourced through the platform. This is our 360box offering. This gives us greater options to choose what is best for the customer who is looking for a drop and hook capacity solution. And by best, I mean the most efficient option that eliminates waste in the system. 
To close out my comments, I would just like to reiterate how Highway Services powered by the platform was able to meet the needs of our customers in the quarter by delivering flexible capacity options. We continue to see strong activity between customers and capacity in our platform, which will continue to support investments into our Highway Services solutions, whether it's in the marketplace or within the 360 program. 
I'd like to turn it back over to Brad Delco."

And the full truckload Intermodal seems to have some momentum in terms of our ability to drive capacity out West. So I think we'll have a better position going forward in the first quarter than we felt in the early part of the fourth quarter around moving empties out West. That doesn't mean that we'll be moving as many as the customers would like for us to move. So congestion and velocity slowdown has been a challenge, but I think the fourth -- the first quarter of '21 does present the potential for better velocity than what we experienced in Q4."

That growth is not tied to customers rerouting to different imports. That's highway conversion of business that has been available for us for some time now through the back half of last year. We are aware of some customers that are talking about altering their import strategy. We'll continue to look at what their plans are, and we'll provide solutions as those opportunities present themselves.

As Shelley just mentioned, our ability to say yes and find that answer for our customers. But each and every one of them are now reevaluating what their network and what their makeup of carrier mix is going to be for 2021. So we still have work to do on our tech investments that will be somewhat of a drag for us in the first half as we close out the investment component. And so as we think about that, there's just a little bit of unusual in this in Q4 that makes it very hard to predict as we move into 2021. What I would say is that we are incredibly satisfied with how the platform performs with that rapid growth and that rapid pressure of customer needs.

Good to see that move into profitability so far ahead of schedule. A question, I think, is some of the points that I believe John made earlier in the call on considering what the kind of longer-term look would be. You implied that the margin outlook might come down on Intermodal. What about the volume outlook? Is that something -- I know you don't have a formal target, but it's been lower the last couple of years than your history. It seems like you have a great setup for Intermodal volume growth in 2021. But how should we think about just the kind of multiyear Intermodal volume look maybe compared to what we've seen the last couple of years or in the past?"

We expect Intermodal volumes to outpace growth of the general transportation industry. And given our scale and our size and our ability to serve and solve for our customers' needs, we expect to be able to grow faster than the Intermodal industry. And so we'll leave it at that. I mean that's our long-term view. I mean clearly, when capacity is constrained in areas, we'll  perform -- underperform or over-perform. But that's been our message.

And we still feel strongly. And Shelley mentioned it, we're bringing on customers with Intermodal at the right time when we have capacity available. That doesn't mean that we're taking capacity away from a commitment that we've already made. 
As we go into '21, we did talk about, we've ordered more containers. We expect pricing to accommodate potentially is if velocity of our rail system today is more structurally slower than what it was 4 or 5 years ago, then pricing is going to have to contemplate that when we think about investment in those long-term assets. And so that's a big focus for us, but we did highlight that we're buying equipment this year because we're confident in the customers' desire to buy that service. So -- and as Brad mentioned, I mean, we do expect Intermodal volumes to grow at least as strong as the industry. I do think in the back half of last year that was a challenge for us, particularly in the network and the weighting where we were relative to capacity demands on the West Coast. And as moving forward, we're going to have to grow where capacity is available. and then look to change operations in the markets where capacity is difficult and how do we drive efficiency out west. And we highlighted that we're engaged in conversations with a rail provider there, and we do believe we can both be more efficient in the coming years out West."

The pandemic has been this year and some of the outputs of that are things like -- I was talking to Craig earlier -- I don't know, Nick, if you've got something to say on this. Driver availability is in a new place today. And so while we're going to go to the market for rates to help deal with changes and evolution in our cost structure to get back to that place, we think we should be, by the way. And I hope we're being very clear because I think we have a duty to be clear that we haven't changed our expectations. We believe this year will solidify in a more settled -- I like the term Shelley used, settled environment. Now it's not a smooth environment. It's sort of the ongoing current state. 
Let's look at driver availability, as I was just referencing. Driver schools are under duress, okay? Drivers are retiring, and schools are putting out new drivers. That puts a unique pressure. That's going to be ongoing though. The things around PSR and arbitration, all that, we think, are more settled. So we've got to go to market, and we've got to see if the customer is willing to pay for J.B. Hunt to provide company assets to do dray, to present a large fleet, to have a presence that can serve, that can do things that we've been able to do in the past. They're going to answer that question for us through this year in their decisions around how they award business and outlook rates. If we can't get that answer to get us back to 11% to 13%, then I'm going to make sure we communicate that and all the things that go with it. But we're not there in early indications and conversations we're having with Shelley and the sales team and Darren and his team and all that. We still have optimism that the customer needs what we provide, and it's unique, by the way, And we want to keep providing it, but we need that support, and we need those margins to return to achieve the returns that we've enjoyed in the past. And that's really where we are. 
I also think it's important to say, it's not just Intermodal margins, which was purely the purpose of that part of my opening remarks that the whole company has to take a really deep breath and look at where we are going to go. We also need to look at where we are dedicated Because as we split that business out, we're saying, hey, we need to look at that business, the returns of the assets required for that business. And we need to make sure we're on steady, again, the term steady footing for what we can present in terms of expectations, not only to you but to our customers as we set price and as we establish contract. 
Same is true for our truckload business. We're looking at, hey, there's a place here with the growth we experienced in the fourth quarter. And some of the nuances that we're experimenting with around trailers, we might be able to remodel our capital thoughts in Truckload that might be able to be supported by a different margin profile. And I'm just trying to coordinate that conversation as not a onetime event, a one-off. I think the company has a duty to evaluate its expectations. And this is the year that we're calling out. We're going to do that. I think we'll be able to give you progress reports along the way. And I think there'll be a lot of clarity and transparency with it."

I will tell you, I think that our customers want more from us than what we are planning right now. But we'll see that through the bid season and be able to establish that. 
And then to reiterate what Darren said, our margins will improve in Intermodal. That's what we're launching towards. We took care of our customers. We reiterated that through the entire pandemic all through 2020 that we would honor our commitments, and it is very much like what we did in 2017 and 2018. We honored our commitments. We came back to customers in 2018, and our customers matched up with us cost to price.

As we came into 2020, terms were not built around the size of our fleet, and our volume was not yet where we had anticipated it would be based on how large our fleet was. So we were anticipating velocity and improvements in 2020, and we were experiencing that right up until the pandemic. 
So really, starting in June, demand went off the charts, and everything slowed down a bit. And so yes, you're not seeing any kind of significant change in turns. And that's relevant to how bad congestion has impacted the amount of time it takes a container to travel on Intermodal loads today is longer than it was a year ago. And we would expect for that to improve this year -- or I should say it was longer in Q4. We should expect that, that transit will either improve this year or the pricing will reflect that we have to own the asset for a longer amount of time in order to accommodate the load for the customer. And that's how we're going to view it. But I do expect congestion and velocity in our system to gradually improve in '21."

So a lot of that work has already occurred. And really it's about finalizing our tech development so that we can maximize our own efficiencies with the activities that are on the platform. There's no question that we expect to continue to grow volume. We've touched on a little bit earlier that the abnormal spot volumes will look for a more efficient way to transact in '21. And that's okay, but we know we have to have a lot more momentum focused on bringing on new customers predominantly at the small and midsized shipper level to help us continue to fuel the platform. And that's where we -- as we think about second half, it really is the culmination of the completion of the tech spend and the pivot of overall volume and activity on the platform that swings us back to profitability as we model that out. 
Now what we saw again in Q4 was somewhat amplified due to the extremely abnormal high-level calling of revenue, if you will, on the stock side, And they didn't just give us a glimpse of what it will be when we get there. We are not anticipating that strength necessarily over these first few months. If it continues to stay as hot as the market, then there is a chance that, that could occur a little bit earlier.

And we talked about that we had resourced our people to actually start calling on customers. And earlier in my comments, I talked about our activity levels being up substantially throughout the year. That's a direct result of our reorganization. So we've already started to see benefits from the platform in a portion of our ICS segment. Our focus has been really making sure that we complete our internal work for our people, and that's what Brad is referencing. We are continuing to make investments. We're letting our customers and our carriers drive us on how to create a more efficient way to do business in both of those spends and that will be ongoing. However, we will complete the internal work that will actually marry the externalization of our 360 platform with our internal resources. So think of an automated shipment. They'll actually come off of the conveyor belt, if you will, to our people where we really need to problem solve. Today, that operate in 2 silos. You'll start to see the leverage that happens inside that. 
And then last note I'll make on ICS returning to profitability in the second half. Certainly, we're trying to march towards repeating what our fourth quarter performance was. So we've not given up hope that we can continue into Q1 and into Q2, but we do have specific ideas earmarked for our future. And those ideas could put pressure on us, but we will continue.

That's just one example, but many that we see across the organization. 
And I want to make sure that I clarify something. We are not at the end of our tech spend. We are at the end of our internal work that will connect our external platform with our internal platform. We will continue to invest in J.B. Hunt 360 as we see this as an accelerator for our organization from a revenue perspective. I think you were able to see that in JBT and ICS. It's the first place that we started in our 360 platform, that was really the place that was logically adjacent to the work that we were doing. And so we were able to see the benefit there, but you'll continue to see 360. That's why Nick made in his opening comments remarks around the platform and how we will leverage that. 
And then finally, I think you'll see this in our annual report, the number of millions of miles that we eliminated from our assets. By leveraging the platform, we directly get to see that in cost reduction. And the more our platform scales, the more our own assets should be the most efficient assets or certainly at the top of the most efficient assets available in the market.

And so it's important that we hear the volume on this question, and I think we're going to work hard to make sure we get that resolved as soon as we can. But where we are in the use of our systems is encouraging for us and revealed itself a lot, I think, in the fourth quarter. I think our customers look to J.B. Hunt to get answers. They don't look for us to buy services. They find an attitude here, an investment here, a mindset that is call us, we will help you figure this out. And we are entrepreneurial enough to allow ourselves to find new leads. And I think that is a very important element that is longer term in nature. 
It doesn't necessarily answer the immediate questions, but Highway plus Intermodal plus Dedicated plus Final Mile plus platform, et cetera, is J.B. Hunt. And it's a strong position we're in. The settled nature of our go forward into '21 gives us a -- as good a chance as we're going to have to answer these questions, and we're going to answer them. Whether we like the answer or not, we're going to answer the questions. And I know there's commitment there. I'm excited that we got to a place where we could add equipment in Intermodal. I think that's a very important thing to take away. This fleet will be over 100,000 units in 2021. And as a provider of services and value to customers, we stay long there. And that, I think, we expect demands a certain place in the market. 
The Final Mile is exciting. Our pipelines really are in good shape in all of our businesses, frankly. And I'd just add that our leadership team is very cohesive. We've made some changes that you guys can't and like you can't all see from where I sit, but our energy is up. We're asking new questions. We've moved the board around a little bit.

As we discussed during our last call, we entered 2021 with a cautious but informed positive outlook on what we could expect in terms of demand and inventory replenishment needs from our customers. Aside from the temporary disruptions presented by weather events in February, most of the data supports a generally optimistic view of those expectations and encourages our direction going forward. 
As we evaluate current market conditions and the needs of our customers, we have determined that an increase in our capital investment plan is warranted. Accordingly, we are announcing a 40% increase in our originally saved plans to enable the procurement of incremental containers, trailers and the needed supporting equipment such as chassis and tractors for JBI. The new projections for our capital investments now reach $1.25 billion for this year, a clear milestone for our company. We have secured contracts to increase our container fleet by another 6,000 units in 2021 for Intermodal, bringing our net addition target to approximately 12,000 units for 2021, a little over 1,000 of which are temperature-controlled containers. We are also increasing our trailer fleet in highway services by 1,500 units, bringing the total fleet expansion to 3,000 for 2021. All of these equates to just above an 80% increase to our original container growth plan and a 100% increase to our treasure fleet expansion plans for our 360box programs. John Kuhlow will add his comments on our capital expenditures in his remarks. 
Let's discuss margins. After announcing our plans to issue clarification for all segment margin targets during our last call and with the understanding that we have had these margin goals under specific review for over a year, we will reestablish our targets with you here today. 
For Intermodal, we lower our margin goals from 11% to 13% to 10% to 12%. The fundamental reason for this structural change is that it presents the company with the ability to grow with and serve our customers while also generating an appropriate and sustainable ROI fee. As a component of this adjustment, we also see opportunities to improve our asset utilization box turns per month and to evaluate our tractor and chassis ratios, all of which would be positive for the business and returns. 
For DCS, we increased our margin goals from 11% to 13% to 12% to 14%. While this change appears to be a step-up in margin expectation, it is actually the realization of a fundamental increase in the fleet size, which allows growth and start-up expenses to occur without disrupting the core business as it has in the past. Another element [indiscernible] clarity for the fleet business is the removal of the final mile activities which require a lower margin given the lighter asset requirements. As discussed, the margins are set to provide an appropriate return for each business and given the asset intensity of DCS, a higher margin has always been needed. 
For JBT, we are adjusting our margin range from 8% to 12% to between 8% and 10%. The primary reason for this change is a recognition of a lighter asset position as we focus our investments on adding trailers and not tractors going forward. We do point out that we are in the early stages of transforming this model focused on more trailers and will continue to evaluate the margin requirements and market support to achieve growth in the appropriate ROIC levels to reinvest. 
For ITS, we reaffirm our long-term target margin range between 4% and 6%. 
And for Final Mile Services, we reaffirm our long-term target margin rate between 4% and 8%. Each segment leader will add comments on the main drivers for these margin targets and the resulting ROIC expectations going forward. 
Final comment from me on the availability of professional drivers for our asset-based businesses and our carrier providers is under unusual pressure currently. While we have faced driver hiring issues at varying degrees of difficulty during previous tightening cycles, we see the current pressure being meaningfully more pronounced and likely prolonged. Shelley and Nick will add more color on our prospectives. Accordingly, we are taking some unique steps in our efforts to address this critical challenge. These include reducing the eligibility time for new driver benefits from 90 to 30 days, expanded efforts to explore new ways to train and mentor new entrants to the field of professional drivers, and, of course, a comprehensive overview of driver wages and compensation. 
All in, we believe we are advantaged by our brand, our recruiting and hiring systems, a focus on retention and the vitally important increasing efforts in improving our inclusion and awareness for the vast diversity currently in place with our amazing driver and field management teams. 
I will now turn the call over to John Kuhlow for his comments."

Hunt Transport Services, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Don, and good afternoon, everyone.

I'd like to start by providing a couple of comments on our first quarter of 2021 from a consolidated perspective. Given the weather and other constraints facing the industry, we are pleased with our revenue, operating income and EPS growth for this quarter with notable achievements in our Highway Services revenue as both ICS and JBT were up significantly over the prior year quarter. 
With respect to weather, we previously guided to a $15 million to $20 million estimated operating income impact from the February winter storms. In closing the quarter, we determined this impact to be approximately $17 million, which primarily includes lost opportunities within our Intermodal segment of approximately 25,000 loads. 
Other cost pressures in the quarter were primarily related to higher driver costs to attract and retain drivers and higher costs across our various networks and operations due to congestion and the overall labor tightness from increased freight demand and capacity constraints. 
You'll note, we ended the quarter with approximately $550 million in cash, with this being driven in part by a review of the capital investments that John had highlighted. We had previously guided CapEx to be between $850 million and $900 million for 2021, and we are now updating that to $1.25 billion, primarily driven by the Intermodal container adds and the trailers for our 360box program. This investment is supported by the current environment, but also our longer-term outlook. 
While not specifically included in the CapEx plans, our cash and liquidity also allows for further consolidation in our Final Mile businesses as opportunities may arise. 
With regards to margins, as noted, the conclusion of our review of our segmented margin targets was informed by the current and future state of our business segment. In terms of our desired returns on capital, our revenue quality capital intensity and the desired market penetration rates. Other inputs to our ranges include underlying risks regarding the nature of our customer contracts, both in terms of reciprocated commitments and contract duration. 
Finally, from a capital allocation standpoint, we continued stock buybacks in the quarter but found less opportunity in the back half and then sell into our blackout period. While we have guided towards significant capital investment, we still anticipate continuing our buyback approach throughout 2021. 
A final note on COVID costs. We continue to offer pay time low -- or excuse me, paid timeoff, or PTO, to employees that have needed to quarantine. During the quarter, we committed to providing PTO to employees to allow them to be vaccinated, thereby ensuring their W-2 is not impacted when needing time away from work to be vaccinated. We have been working with local health care organizations to host vaccine clinics at our corporate headquarters to provide vaccinations to employees, their adult family members and other eligible community members. 
Together, we have inoculated more than 13,000 members of our community and are working with our field employees to provide vaccination assistance under applicable area guidelines and procedures. As a result of these efforts, we have incurred approximately $8 million in costs in the current quarter, designated at specific COVID costs compared to the $15 million that we experienced in first quarter of 2020. 
That concludes my remarks, and I'd like to now turn it over to Shelley."

As John allud",647,"Thank you, John, and good afternoon. My commercial update this afternoon will focus on general market conditions and our expectations for the year as well as an update on the progress we are making as an organization with our 360 platform. 
As John alluded to earlier, we entered 2021 with cautious optimism about the opportunities presented to us. These opportunities include a means to recover from the costs incurred last year as we honored our commitment to customers that, equally as important, the opportunities to solve capacity challenges for and on behalf of our customers. Those capacity challenges for our customers remain very present in the current landscape and will likely persist throughout 2021, highlighted by a tight labor market, elevated cost to procure capacity and overall lack of supply chain fluidity. 
As an organization, we remain committed and focused on meeting the needs of our customers, honoring our commitment and doing so by striving towards our mission to create the most efficient transportation network in North America. I remain encouraged by the level of discussion and interaction with our customers on the very important subjects of revenue quality, capacity and cost. And while our view on pricing is a little more elevated today than what we discussed on our last earnings call, the reality is that our cost to serve is also higher. This cost presents itself primarily in our labor cost as well in the utilization of our assets or equipment turns. We, and the industry as a whole, are facing meaningful cost pressures to recruit, hire, train and retain qualified professional truck drivers to meet the capacity needs of our customers. 
As our future outlook on cost remains fluid, so will our approach to price. To ensure that our investments should meet the capacity needs of our customers are supported with our expectations for an appropriate rate of return. These returns support our ability to continue to invest in our assets, which are our people and our equipment as well as our investments in technology to serve the growing needs of our customers. 
And as we prepare for record equipment adds this year, we are working very closely with our customers on equipment turns and forecast to enable better network fluidity. 
Shifting gears to our J.B. Hunt 360 platform. I could not be more excited about the progress we are making as well as the opportunities we have ahead. In the last quarter, I've been extremely encouraged by the level of engagement we are seeing in the platform from our carriers and shippers as our KPIs in this area continue to break new records weekly and monthly. 
We remain focused on reducing friction across the supply chain, making it easier for shippers and carriers to match in our system to optimize and transact in real time. One of our big areas of focus is on improving visibility and transparency across the supply chain, and we are encouraged about the opportunities we have to make progress in these areas supported by our recently announced alliance with Google as we collaborate and co-innovate on solving some of the industry's biggest problems. 
I am extremely proud and excited for all the opportunities presented to us and our ability to solve for our customers' needs, utilizing our people, products and services. Our diversified services or our skill, powered by our technology platform continues to be valued in the marketplace and supported by our customers leaning into us to solve for their needs. 
Finally, as I've recently added the role of EVP of People and Human Resources, I would like to share how encouraged at you about the work we are doing, enhancing our inclusive culture. While early in our journey, I see our organization leading in this area and with more to discuss and to share in the future.

I'm going to spend a few minutes today dealing now with several areas and topics, including the current driver environment, the results and performance of dedicated with some additional context for the updated margin target range that John mentioned earlier. And finally, I'll review the results and performance of our Final Mile Services segment. 
I'll start with some quick thoughts and comments around the driver market. In my opinion, the industry is facing the most challenged driver market that I've seen in my 37-year earlier at J.B. Hunt. We estimate that the decrease of the driving school [indiscernible] graduates, the drug and alcohol clearinghouse and the impact presented by the pandemic combined has resulted in approximately 220,000 fewer drivers available to meet industry capacity needs. As a result, we are taking a comprehensive approach to attract and retain our professional driving workforce, including adjustments to our wages and benefits while also focusing on the quality of the job. We believe we have some of the best way just professional drivers, professional driving jobs in the industry across our portfolio of services, including intermodal gray dedicated truck and final mile services. Over 90% of our driving docks are local and regional, providing consistent routes and opportunities for more home time on dedicated results. 
Dedicated continues to perform and respond in an agile fashion to the challenges thrown at it. Despite several weather-related disruptions in the quarter, TCS delivered its highest order revenue and operating income in our company's history. I believe that it is a testament to our operations team and professional drivers who responded and worked to recover for our customers. All while staying focused on safe execution and the efficient utilization of our assets. 
As a result, customers continue to see value in the quality and flexibility of our professional outsourced private fleet solutions as also as against buyer strong pipeline. 
We ended the first quarter selling approximately 380 trucks in DCS as we are off to a strong start in 2021, all while customer retention rates remain above 98%. 
Regarding everyone's favorite topic about margins, we believe it is prudent to update the market on our targeted market margin range, which now stands at 12% to 14% for the DCS segment from the previous range of 11% to 13%. 
Informing us of this decision is the following: our value proposition, scale, efficiency as well as the capital intensity of our business. More importantly, it is worth noting that nothing in our pricing model has changed but rather what has revealed itself is the realization that the current scale of our operations presents us an opportunity to grow the business while experiencing less drag and start-up costs associated with customer growth. 
Said a different way, we see the same opportunity presented to us today to balance our desire to grow well into the future while maintaining discipline around our returns on capital. 
I'll wrap up my comments on Final Mile Services. Final Mile Services were able to deliver a strong performance in the quarter as the continuation of fourth quarter peak season-like strength in our business rolled into Q1, which has not been the seasonal norm. 
While weather did disrupt the business temporarily, we were able to recover and get our customers' goods delivered and only experienced a modest impact to overall performance as a result. We remain active in conversations to grow and scale with our current and new customers across our footprint and plan to capitalize on these opportunities throughout the year. Additionally, we'll continue to invest to ensure we deliver a differentiated product focused on the high standards of service, safety and customer satisfaction. 
With regards to margins, we are maintaining our targeted range of 4% to 8%. Our growth trajectory of our asset and non-asset final mile service offerings will continue to influence where we fall within that range as we gain greater scale with our value-added services. 
That concludes my remarks, so I'll turn it over to Brad Hicks."

The organization's excitement and enthusiasm for our Highway Services business continues to be evidenced by the progress in our results and further supported by the opportunities our customers present us with -- to provide needed capacity solutions. My comments today will briefly touch on some of the highlights of our Highway Services businesses which includes both Integrated Capacity Solutions, or ICS, and Truck, or JBT. 
In short, the marketplace for J.B. Hunt 360 continues to provide our customers' capacity solutions utilizing a combination of our multimodal digital freight platform, while complemented with our drop trailer pools powered by J.B. Hunt 360. 
I'll start with ICS. ICS was able to deliver revenue of $525 million or 56% growth over the prior year and delivered operating income of $7 million, which is now the second consecutive quarter of profitability since our journey along our digital transformation. 
Similar to the fourth quarter of 2020, the quarter presented us with opportunities to help customers source capacity effectively and efficiently on our platform in an otherwise constrained market environment. 
Segment volumes were down 1% year-over-year, driven by a decline of LTL volumes. offset, however, by truckload volumes, which were up 10% in the quarter. Higher spot market opportunities, higher contractual rates and the previously mentioned mix change contributed to the 58% increase in gross revenue per load. Going forward, we will remain focused on balancing the right mix of volume growth opportunities presented to us as we remain committed to our investments in 3 key areas: our people, our technology and scaling the platform. As John alluded to earlier, our margin target remains 4% to 6% in this segment, which we believe is achievable as we move beyond our heavy investment cycle, achieve scale and as the business model matures. 
In JBT, or Truck, the segment was able to deliver 43% year-over-year growth in first quarter revenue, following just shy of $150 million. Operating income was $10 million, which is the highest for a first quarter since 2007. Growth in the segment continues to be driven by non-asset and asset-light service offerings powered and supported by the J.B. Hunt 360 platform. 
As JBT has shifted to more of an asset-light model, we have an ability to provide trailing capacity to customers that may be hauled by either J.B. Hunt-owned equipment, our independent contractors or power-only capacity sourced through the platform. This is our 360 offering. Demand for this service is strong and supports the previously disclosed 100% increase to our prior trailer fleet investment for 2021. 
Our margin targets in JBT are now 8% to 10% from the prior 8% to 12%, which recognizes the shift to a more asset-light model. That said, and similar to Final Mile services, our performance relative to those targets will be dependent on the asset intensity of the business as it evolves. But as always, our returns on capital remain the core focus of our investments to grow this business. 
In closing, I would just like to reiterate the excitement and growth opportunities we see across our highway services portfolio to solve for our customers' needs in an efficient and as Shelley alluded to earlier, more frictionless way. We remain committed to our investments in our people, technology and scaling the platform, which includes our investment to expand our 360 program. 
That concludes my comments, and I'll pass it over to Darren."

Hello to everyone. Today, I will provide some additional details on our first quarter performance, give you some thoughts about network fluidity and balance, provide some perspective on the demand and pricing environment and cap it off with comments on our updated capital investment and target margin range that John highlighted earlier. 
Volumes declined 3% in the quarter. Broken down by month that's plus 3% in January, a 16% decline in February and plus 4% in March. As we called out in the earnings release, the weather challenges in the quarter are estimated to have impacted us by 25,000 Intermodal loads primarily in February, but the effects did carry over into March. The rail network has shown signs of improvement so far in April. Although we are not fully back to pre weather service levels we have and continue to expect to see improvement as we move through the second quarter. 
While rail challenges are well-known, another challenge we face is what we refer to as customer street time, which has increased as our customers are falling behind on unloading inbound delivered units in a timely manner. We believe both the rail terminal congestion and the customer unloading challenges are direct results of labor challenges. 
Inside our operation, driver hiring continues to be a significant challenge and the industry will take on higher wages in order to attract and retain new drivers. We fully expect the same is true for the rail terminal contractors and customer warehouse labor. Demand for our intermodal service remains at incredibly strong levels. The pricing market is performing at a level to cover our cost increases from last year as we honored our commitments as well as the inflationary cost pressures we are experiencing this year related to driver hiring. Certainly, the increasing driver wage and rail costs are topics with our customers, but we are also highlighting the velocity challenges and the cost of equipment ownership. 
As you should be able to conclude, the pricing environment supports our decision to add additional capacity to our fleet, as John highlighted earlier and as we discussed last quarter. During the last call, we said we expected pricing to come in at high single to low double-digit increases. And at this point, we feel more optimistic about things trending towards the higher end of that range adjusting for mix. 
As we entered the quarter, just over 10% of our business had implemented 21 mid-cycle rates. By the end of the quarter, just over 40% of the volume had current bid cycle rates. We will expect that to climb to 70% by the end of Q2 and the remainder to finalize during Q3. As John covered in his opening comments, we have adjusted the margin target range to 10% to 12%. And we have highlighted many times that we remain focused on generating the appropriate return on our invested capital in the business. And while margins are an output of achieving our targeted returns, returns are also influenced by other factors, including asset turns, capital intensity and consideration of contribution per load. We believe this new target range strikes the right balance between generating appropriate returns that support reinvestment to capitalize on what we believe is a long sustainable growth opportunity presented by the market. 
The future of Intermodal remains bright as it provides an economically attractive alternative to some of the challenges our industry is facing, including the driver market, higher fuel cost, capacity, the carbon intensity of the supply chain and the need for investment in public infrastructure. 
Also as John highlighted, we have expanded our container order in 2021 to approximately 12,000 new containers, including both dry and temp controlled that will begin to arrive in Q2 and continue through the end of the year. 
As we have moved through the current bid cycle, it is clear that our customers want more capacity from us and we are responding. The commitments from our customers thus far during bid season fully support this additional investment in capacity. We are confident that focusing and delivering value to our customers will support the appropriate returns needed to invest to meet their needs and put us on a strong path toward long sustainable growth. 
That concludes my prepared comments."

And so we manage the balance of the segments on a consolidated basis, and those are going to increase and decrease just depending on the level of investment that we have at that time."

So I guess, in other words, how long do you think it takes to deploy those sort of actively in the market?

But the market conditions really are very favorable as we think about revenue quality and our overall ability to get the rate at a level that accounts for the increase in PTE that we have seen. The revenue per load levels are amongst the highest we've seen in our history, but also too is PTE. And so the combination of those 2 with where we're at in our platform development which we feel very encouraged by as we turn into Q2 is very favorable for us.

When we started our bid season really across all of our segments, our customer alignment on cost and capacity wasn't necessarily reflective and the feedback we were getting versus what the competitive market looks like. So if you look at what happened in first quarter, we moved a disproportionate amount of spot shipments versus what we have historically moved and published volumes were lower than we expected at the beginning of the first quarter. 
As we have progressed through that quarter and even moving here into April, we have seen our customers lean into us significantly and really giving us larger bid awards across our segments and particularly inside highway. So I would say our beat in Q1 was a more robust environment, more spot price in general. And as we move into Q2, I think that there will be seasonal margin pressure, in particular, having published pricing that should be more on an annual basis. But having said that, more specific to the work that we are working on with Google in our alliance, we still are very focused on our co-innovation together to solve industry challenges focused primarily right now on transparency and visibility. We do think that, that will help connect to our bottom line, which is why Brad reaffirmed our margin targets in ICS. We are encouraged with our results.

And so any of the connections that we can make and leverage other people's expertise and really bring that or solve for that through J.B. Hunt 360, we will review and implement. So I would say our scale, our ability to scale, we'll be continuing to solve for our customers, number one, from a scale or from a full scroll perspective, but also making sure that we highlight the technology, so that they can get access to the right mode, the right truck at the right time. 
Pricing then will be reflective in transparency. And then ultimately, customers want to be able to track their shipment the same way we track a Domino's pizza, from the time we call it into the time it gets to our home, and that's what we're focused on."

And also, just related to that, 1 thing that I'm trying to understand is how the KPIs in the business and the Intermodal business kind of evolve as that new capacity comes online? It's obviously a lot of capacity, 12% new capacity. I assume it's good for growth because of the improvement in turns and maybe dilutive to length of haul in yields, maybe even slightly dilutive to margins but not dilutive to ROIC. I'm just trying to think through that.

Now the dry boxes, the logistics plan to get those boxes into our system continues to evolve in some ways. We're securing capacity to bring that equipment predominantly to the West Coast and predominantly to Southern California, so that it enters our market at the right time. Those boxes begin to deliver during Q2 and really are spread throughout the rest of the year with. And they're probably a little bit extra during Q3, where you'll be receiving a little bit heavier flow of that equipment in to help us for peak season.

We did adjust slightly our truck targets, but mostly just a pure reflection, as John alluded to, of a movement towards more of an asset-light position where we're growing our box program without having to make the historical heavy investment of the tractor. And so that really just helped us kind of shore up where we think that will be. We are still on that journey. Our box initiative really just launched less than 18 months ago. 
And as we've also stated today, we've increased the investment for incremental boxes just this year. And so we're tracking along per our expectations, and we see the ability to get back to that expectation. 
Switching gears over to ICS similarly, we're at the end of our heavy investment period. But again, characteristics, productivity gains, the advantages that we're seeing and capitalizing on because of the platform where we're able to just be more efficient and make better decisions and really eliminate waste. We see those things that reinforce the affirmation of the range that John reiterated. And so those are the things that drove us. But again, I think it's important for all of our BUs. 
Fundamentally, it's about return on invested capital for us. And if things change in the model, whether that be a further movement to asset-light in our truck model, then that could influence things down the road. But at this point, those are the targets that we think are extremely realistic and achievable."

We really have a key customer that we have been overcoming that comp inside our LTL sector, we're starting to see growth, particularly in our 360 platforms to feel confident about our plan around the LTL side. 
In general, if you just look at truckload volumes, particularly in ITS, those volumes were at a 10% growth plan. But I did talk about this earlier in this call that the very first part of bid season, although we have been educating and talking through what we believe the cost base would be to serve our customers in all of our services that didn't directly align to the competitive pressure we were feeling from our customers in big season. 
I will say we held our ground on price in really all of our segments overall. And as our customers implemented those bids in first quarter. Many of these bits were not working. They were falling apart because the price was not commensurate to the cost that the carriers and the brokers were giving to customers. 
So as we progressed through first quarter, we started picking up volume again, pretty much in line with what our strategy was as an organization in total and have a lot of confidence in our scaling and gaining more market share in Q2 and beyond, not just in ICS, but also in JBT. Remember, the platform is not just an ICS product. It is across our entire enterprise, how we can leverage that for our customers to really allow them to have the right cost service and capacity. 
We saw scaling inside JBT as well in the first quarter, and we will continue to gain and take market share in both JBT and ICS from a 360 platform and then certainly in the intermodal space as well."

As we discussed during our last call, we entered 2021 with a cautious but informed positive outlook on what we could expect in terms of demand and inventory replenishment needs from our customers.

As we discussed during our last call, we entered 2021 with a cautious but informed positive outlook on what we could expect in terms of demand and inventory replenishment needs from our customers. Aside from the temporary disruptions presented by weather events in February, most of the data supports a generally optimistic view of those expectations and encourages our direction going forward. 
As we evaluate current market conditions and the needs of our customers, we have determined that an increase in our capital investment plan is warranted. Accordingly, we are announcing a 40% increase in our originally saved plans to enable the procurement of incremental containers, trailers and the needed supporting equipment such as chassis and tractors for JBI. The new projections for our capital investments now reach $1.25 billion for this year, a clear milestone for our company. 
We have secured contracts to increase our container fleet by another 6,000 units in 2021 for Intermodal, bringing our net addition target to approximately 12,000 units for 2021, a little over 1,000 of which are temperature-controlled containers. We are also increasing our trailer fleet in highway services by 1,500 units, bringing the total fleet expansion to 3,000 for 2021. All of these equates to just above an 80% increase to our original container growth plan and a 100% increase to our treasure fleet expansion plans for our 360box programs. John Kuhlow will add his comments on our capital expenditures in his remarks. 
Let's discuss margins. After announcing our plans to issue clarification for all segment margin targets during our last call and with the understanding that we have had these margin goals under specific review for over a year, we will reestablish our targets with you here today. 
For Intermodal, we lower our margin goals from 11% to 13% to 10% to 12%. The fundamental reason for this structural change is that it presents the company with the ability to grow with and serve our customers while also generating an appropriate and sustainable ROI fee. As a component of this adjustment, we also see opportunities to improve our asset utilization box turns per month and to evaluate our tractor and chassis ratios, all of which would be positive for the business and returns. 
For DCS, we increased our margin goals from 11% to 13% to 12% to 14%. While this change appears to be a step-up in margin expectation, it is actually the realization of a fundamental increase in the fleet size, which allows growth and start-up expenses to occur without disrupting the core business as it has in the past. Another element revealing clarity for the fleet business is the removal of the final mile activities which require a lower margin given the lighter asset requirements. As discussed, the margins are set to provide an appropriate return for each business and given the asset intensity of DCS, a higher margin has always been needed. 
For JBT, we are adjusting our margin range from 8% to 12% to between 8% and 10%. The primary reason for this change is a recognition of a lighter asset position as we focus our investments on adding trailers and not tractors going forward. We do point out that we are in the early stages of transforming this model focused on more trailers and will continue to evaluate the margin requirements and market support to achieve growth in the appropriate ROIC levels to reinvest. 
For ITS, we reaffirm our long-term target margin range between 4% and 6%. And for Final Mile Services, we reaffirm our long-term target margin rate between 4% and 8%. Each segment leader will add comments on the main drivers for these margin targets and the resulting ROIC expectations going forward. 
Final comment from me on the availability of professional drivers for our asset-based businesses and our carrier providers is under unusual pressure currently. While we have faced driver hiring issues at varying degrees of difficulty during previous tightening cycles, we see the current pressure being meaningfully more pronounced and likely prolonged. Shelley and Nick will add more color on our prospectives. 
Accordingly, we are taking some unique steps in our efforts to address this critical challenge. These include reducing the eligibility time for new driver benefits from 90 to 30 days, expanding efforts to explore new ways to train and mentor new entrants to the field of professional drivers, and, of course, a comprehensive overview of driver wages and compensation. 
All in, we believe we are advantaged by our brand, our recruiting and hiring systems, a focus on retention and the vitally important increasing efforts in improving our inclusion and awareness for the vast diversity currently in place with our amazing driver and field management teams. 
I will now turn the call over to John Kuhlow for his comments."

Hunt Transport Services, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Don, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start by providing a couple of comments on our first quarter of 2021 from a consolidated perspective. Given the weather and other constraints facing the industry, we are pleased with our revenue,",553,"Thank you, Don, and good afternoon, everyone. 
I'd like to start by providing a couple of comments on our first quarter of 2021 from a consolidated perspective. Given the weather and other constraints facing the industry, we are pleased with our revenue, operating income and EPS growth for this quarter with notable achievements in our Highway Services revenue as both ICS and JBT were up significantly over the prior year quarter. 
With respect to weather, we previously guided to a $15 million to $20 million estimated operating income impact from the February winter storms. In closing the quarter, we determined this impact to be approximately $17 million, which primarily includes lost opportunities within our Intermodal segment of approximately 25,000 loads. 
Other cost pressures in the quarter were primarily related to higher driver costs to attract and retain drivers and higher costs across our various networks and operations due to congestion and the overall labor tightness from increased freight demand and capacity constraints. 
You'll note, we ended the quarter with approximately $550 million in cash, with this being driven in part by a review of the capital investments that John had highlighted. We had previously guided CapEx to be between $850 million and $900 million for 2021, and we are now updating that to $1.25 billion, primarily driven by the Intermodal container adds and the trailers for our 360box program. This investment is supported by the current environment, but also our longer-term outlook. 
While not specifically included in the CapEx plans, our cash and liquidity also allows for further consolidation in our Final Mile businesses as opportunities may arise. 
With regards to margins, as noted, the conclusion of our review of our segmented margin targets was informed by the current and future state of our business segment. In terms of our desired returns on capital, our revenue quality capital intensity and the desired market penetration rates. Other inputs to our ranges include underlying risks regarding the nature of our customer contracts, both in terms of reciprocated commitments and contract duration. 
Finally, from a capital allocation standpoint, we continued stock buybacks in the quarter but found less opportunity in the back half and then sell into our blackout period. While we have guided towards significant capital investment, we still anticipate continuing our buyback approach throughout 2021. 
A final note on COVID costs. We continue to offer pay time low -- or excuse me, paid time-off, or PTO, to employees that have needed to quarantine. During the quarter, we committed to providing PTO to employees to allow them to be vaccinated, thereby ensuring their W-2 is not impacted when needing time away from work to be vaccinated. We have been working with local health care organizations to host vaccine clinics at our corporate headquarters to provide vaccinations to employees, their adult family members and other eligible community members. 
Together, we have inoculated more than 13,000 members of our community and are working with our field employees to provide vaccination assistance under applicable area guidelines and procedures. As a result of these efforts, we have incurred approximately $8 million in costs in the current quarter, designated at specific COVID costs compared to the $15 million that we experienced in first quarter of 2020. 
That concludes my remarks, and I'd like to now turn it over to Shelley."

My commercial update this afternoon will focus on general market conditions and our expectations for the year as well as an update on the progress we are making as an organization with our 360 platform. As John all",647,"Thank you, John, and good afternoon. 
My commercial update this afternoon will focus on general market conditions and our expectations for the year as well as an update on the progress we are making as an organization with our 360 platform. 
As John alluded to earlier, we entered 2021 with cautious optimism about the opportunities presented to us. These opportunities include a means to recover from the costs incurred last year as we honored our commitment to customers, but equally as important, the opportunities to solve capacity challenges for and on behalf of our customers. Those capacity challenges for our customers remain very present in the current landscape and will likely persist throughout 2021, highlighted by a tight labor market, elevated cost to procure capacity and overall lack of supply chain fluidity. 
As an organization, we remain committed and focused on meeting the needs of our customers, honoring our commitment and doing so by striving towards our mission to create the most efficient transportation network in North America. 
I remain encouraged by the level of discussion and interaction with our customers on the very important subjects of revenue quality, capacity and cost. And while our view on pricing is a little more elevated today than what we discussed on our last earnings call, the reality is that our cost to serve is also higher. This cost presents itself primarily in our labor cost as well in the utilization of our assets or equipment turns. We, and the industry as a whole, are facing meaningful cost pressures to recruit, hire, train and retain qualified professional truck drivers to meet the capacity needs of our customers. 
As our future outlook on cost remains fluid, so will our approach to price. To ensure that our investments should meet the capacity needs of our customers are supported with our expectations for an appropriate rate of return. These returns support our ability to continue to invest in our assets, which are our people and our equipment as well as our investments in technology to serve the growing needs of our customers. And as we prepare for record equipment adds this year, we are working very closely with our customers on equipment turns and forecast to enable better network fluidity. 
Shifting gears to our J.B. Hunt 360 platform. I could not be more excited about the progress we are making as well as the opportunities we have ahead. In the last quarter, I've been extremely encouraged by the level of engagement we are seeing in the platform from our carriers and shippers as our KPIs in this area continue to break new records weekly and monthly. 
We remain focused on reducing friction across the supply chain, making it easier for shippers and carriers to match in our system to optimize and transact in real time. One of our big areas of focus is on improving visibility and transparency across the supply chain, and we are encouraged about the opportunities we have to make progress in these areas supported by our recently announced alliance with Google as we collaborate and co-innovate on solving some of the industry's biggest problems. 
I am extremely proud and excited for all the opportunities presented to us and our ability to solve for our customers' needs, utilizing our people, products and services. Our diversified services, or our Scroll, powered by our technology platform, continues to be valued in the marketplace and supported by our customers leaning into us to solve for their needs. 
Finally, as I've recently added the role of EVP of People and Human Resources, I would like to share how encouraged at you about the work we are doing, enhancing our inclusive culture. While early in our journey, I see our organization leading in this area and with more to discuss and to share in the future. 
I'd now like to turn it over to Nick."

I'm going to spend a few minutes today dealing now with several areas and topics, including the current driver environment, the results and performance of Dedicated with some additional context for the updated margin target range that John mentioned earlier. And finally, I'll review the results and performance of our Final Mile Services segment. 
I'll start with some quick thoughts and comments around the driver market. In my opinion, the industry is facing the most challenged driver market that I've seen in my 37-year career at J.B. Hunt. We estimate that the decrease of the driving school applicants and graduates, the drug and alcohol clearinghouse, and the impact presented by the pandemic combined has resulted in approximately 220,000 fewer drivers available to meet industry capacity needs. As a result, we are taking a comprehensive approach to attract and retain our professional driving workforce, including adjustments to our wages and benefits while also focusing on the quality of the job. 
We believe we have some of the best waged professional drivers, professional driving jobs in the industry across our portfolio of services, including intermodal-grade, dedicated, truck and final mile services. Over 90% of our driving docks are local and regional, providing consistent routes and opportunities for more home time. 
On Dedicated results. Dedicated continues to perform and respond in an agile fashion and the challenges thrown at it. Despite several weather-related disruptions in the quarter, DCS delivered its highest order revenue and operating income in our company's history. I believe that it is a testament to our operations team and professional drivers who responded and worked to recover for our customers, all while staying focused on safe execution and the efficient utilization of our assets. As a result, customers continued to see value in the quality and flexibility of our professional outsourced private fleet solutions as also evidenced by our strong pipeline. We ended the first quarter selling approximately 380 trucks in DCS as we are off to a strong start in 2021, all while customer retention rates remain above 98%. 
Regarding everyone's favorite topic about margins. We believe it is prudent to update the market on our targeted market margin range, which now stands at 12% to 14% for the DCS segment from the previous range of 11% to 13%. 
Informing us of this decision is the following: our value proposition, scale, efficiency as well as the capital intensity of our business. More importantly, it is worth noting that nothing in our pricing model has changed but rather what has revealed itself is the realization that the current scale of our operations presents us an opportunity to grow the business while experiencing less drag and start-up costs associated with customer growth. Said a different way, we see the same opportunity presented to us today to balance our desire to grow well into the future while maintaining discipline around our returns on capital. 
I'll wrap up my comments on Final Mile Services. Final Mile Services was able to deliver a strong performance in the quarter as the continuation of fourth quarter peak season-like strength in our business rolled into Q1, which has not been the seasonal norm. While weather did disrupt the business temporarily, we were able to recover and get our customers' goods delivered and only experienced a modest impact to overall performance as a result. We remain active in conversations to grow and scale with our current and new customers across our footprint and plan to capitalize on these opportunities throughout the year. Additionally, we'll continue to invest to ensure we deliver a differentiated product focused on the high standards of service, safety and customer satisfaction. 
With regards to margins, we are maintaining our targeted range of 4% to 8%. Our growth trajectory of our asset and non-asset Final Mile Service offerings will continue to influence where we fall within that range as we gain greater scale with our value-added services. 
That concludes my remarks, so I'll turn it over to Brad Hicks."

The organization's excitement and enthusiasm for our Highway Services business continues to be evidenced by the progress in our results and further supported by the opportunities our customers present us with to provide needed capacity",565,"Thank you, Nick. 
The organization's excitement and enthusiasm for our Highway Services business continues to be evidenced by the progress in our results and further supported by the opportunities our customers present us with to provide needed capacity solutions. My comments today will briefly touch on some of the highlights of our Highway Services businesses, which includes both Integrated Capacity Solutions, or ICS, and Truck, or JBT. In short, the marketplace for J.B. Hunt 360 continues to provide our customers capacity solutions utilizing a combination of our multimodal digital freight platform, while complemented with our drop trailer pools powered by J.B. Hunt 360. 
I'll start with ICS. ICS was able to deliver revenue of $525 million or 56% growth over the prior year and delivered operating income of $7 million, which is now the second consecutive quarter of profitability since our journey along our digital transformation. Similar to the fourth quarter of 2020, the quarter presented us with opportunities to help customers source capacity effectively and efficiently on our platform in an otherwise constrained market environment. 
Segment volumes were down 1% year-over-year, driven by a decline of LTL volumes, offset, however, by truckload volumes, which were up 10% in the quarter. Higher spot market opportunities, higher contractual rates and the previously mentioned mix change contributed to the 58% increase in gross revenue per load. Going forward, we will remain focused on balancing the right mix of volume growth opportunities presented to us as we remain committed to our investments in 3 key areas: our people, our technology and scaling the platform. As John alluded to earlier, our margin target remains 4% to 6% in this segment, which we believe is achievable as we move beyond our heavy investment cycle, achieve scale and as the business model matures. 
In JBT, or Truck, the segment was able to deliver 43% year-over-year growth in first quarter revenue, following just shy of $150 million. Operating income was $10 million, which is the highest for a first quarter since 2007. Growth in the segment continues to be driven by non-asset and asset-light service offerings powered and supported by the J.B. Hunt 360 platform. 
As JBT has shifted to more of an asset-light model, we have an ability to provide trailing capacity to customers that may be hauled by either J.B. Hunt-owned equipment, our independent contractors or power-only capacity sourced through the platform. This is our 360box offering. Demand for this service is strong and supports the previously disclosed 100% increase to our prior trailer fleet investment for 2021. 
Our margin targets in JBT are now 8% to 10% from the prior 8% to 12%, which recognizes the shift to a more asset-light model. That said, and similar to Final Mile services, our performance relative to those targets will be dependent on the asset intensity of the business as it evolves. But as always, our returns on capital remain the core focus of our investments to grow this business. 
In closing, I would just like to reiterate the excitement and growth opportunities we see across our highway services portfolio to solve for our customers' needs in an efficient, and as Shelley alluded to earlier, more frictionless way. We remain committed to our investments in our people, technology and scaling the platform, which includes our investment to expand our 360box program. 
That concludes my comments, and I'll pass it over to Darren."

Hello to everyone. Today, I will provide some additional details on our first quarter performance, give you some thoughts about network fluidity and balance, provide some perspective on the demand and pricing environment and cap it off",712,"Thank you, Brad. Hello to everyone. 
Today, I will provide some additional details on our first quarter performance, give you some thoughts about network fluidity and balance, provide some perspective on the demand and pricing environment and cap it off with comments on our updated capital investment and target margin range that John highlighted earlier. 
Volumes declined 3% in the quarter. Broken down by month, that's plus 3% in January, a 16% decline in February and plus 4% in March. As we called out in the earnings release, the weather challenges in the quarter are estimated to have impacted us by 25,000 Intermodal loads primarily in February, but the effects did carry over into March. The rail network has shown signs of improvement so far in April. Although we are not fully back to pre weather service levels we have and continue to expect to see improvement as we move through the second quarter. 
While rail challenges are well-known, another challenge we face is what we refer to as customer street time, which has increased as our customers are falling behind on unloading inbound delivered units in a timely manner. We believe both the rail terminal congestion and the customer unloading challenges are direct results of labor challenges. 
Inside our operation, driver hiring continues to be a significant challenge and the industry will take on higher wages in order to attract and retain new drivers. We fully expect the same is true for the rail terminal contractors and customer warehouse labor. Demand for our intermodal service remains at incredibly strong levels. The pricing market is performing at a level to cover our cost increases from last year as we honored our commitments as well as the inflationary cost pressures we are experiencing this year related to driver hiring. Certainly, the increasing driver wage and rail costs are topics with our customers, but we are also highlighting the velocity challenges and the cost of equipment ownership. 
As you should be able to conclude, the pricing environment supports our decision to add additional capacity to our fleet, as John highlighted earlier and as we discussed last quarter. During the last call, we said we expected pricing to come in at high single to low double-digit increases. And at this point, we feel more optimistic about things trending towards the higher end of that range adjusting for mix. 
As we entered the quarter, just over 10% of our business had implemented 21 bid cycle rates. By the end of the quarter, just over 40% of the volume had current bid cycle rates. We will expect that to climb to 70% by the end of Q2 and the remainder to finalize during Q3. 
As John covered in his opening comments, we have adjusted the margin target range to 10% to 12%. We have highlighted many times that we remain focused on generating the appropriate return on our invested capital in the business. And while margins are an output of achieving our targeted returns, returns are also influenced by other factors, including asset turns, capital intensity and consideration of contribution per load. We believe this new target range strikes the right balance between generating appropriate returns that support reinvestment to capitalize on what we believe is a long sustainable growth opportunity presented by the market. 
The future of Intermodal remains bright as it provides an economically attractive alternative to some of the challenges our industry is facing, including the driver market, higher fuel cost, capacity, the carbon intensity of the supply chain and the need for investment in public infrastructure. 
Also as John highlighted, we have expanded our container order in 2021 to approximately 12,000 new containers, including both dry and temp-controlled that will begin to arrive in Q2 and continue through the end of the year. 
As we have moved through the current bid cycle, it is clear that our customers want more capacity from us and we are responding. The commitments from our customers thus far during bid season fully support this additional investment in capacity. We are confident that focusing and delivering value to our customers will support the appropriate returns needed to invest to meet their needs and put us on a strong path toward long sustainable growth. 
That concludes my prepared comments."

We may have been too cautious when we spoke at the end of Q4 about what the first part of this year held. We still are in a heavy investment window as we clarified, I think, 8 quarters ago. But the market conditions really are very favorable as we think about revenue quality and our overall ability to get the rate at a level that accounts for the increase in PTE that we have seen. The revenue per load levels are amongst the highest we've seen in our history, but also, too, is PTE.

And so did that allow us to get further ahead than we had anticipated? Certainly, the outcome and output of Q1 would reinforce that to some degree. But we still have work to do. We still have heavy investments, but we are at a place that we are very satisfied with on our journey. Shelley?"

When we started our bid season really across all of our segments, our customer alignment on cost and capacity wasn't necessarily reflective in the feedback we were getting versus what the competitive market looks like. So if you look at what happened in first quarter, we moved a disproportionate amount of spot shipments versus what we have historically moved, and published volumes were lower than we expected at the beginning of the first quarter. 
As we have progressed through that quarter and even moving here into April, we have seen our customers lean into us significantly and really giving us larger bid awards across our segments and particularly inside highway. So I would say our beat in Q1 was a more robust environment, more spot price in general. And as we move into Q2, I think that there will be seasonal margin pressure, in particular, having published pricing that should be more on an annual basis. 
But having said that, more specific to the work that we are working on with Google in our alliance, we still are very focused on our co-innovation together to solve industry challenges focused primarily right now on transparency and visibility. We do think that, that will help connect to our bottom line, which is why Brad reaffirmed our margin targets in ICS. We are encouraged with our results. We are laser-focused on getting to scale.

I think we are trending that way. From what we're seeing with contract rates, they are going up with our contractors. The market is very tight, particularly with the amount of background checks we do for security, safety protocols. We try to hold ourselves to the highest standard, and our contractors that way to the cost Google was. But we're able to pass that along to our customers. They're not structured, yet, the way dedicated contracts are, but we have very good relationship with our customers with the top-performing metrics on service all the way around. So we think we'll be able to go back to our customers if the market demands it to get that. 
So yes, I think we're in the right market streams. We're going to see us work to improve the margins, and we've done some of that with the rates with existing customers. And we're going to continue to do that as we move forward. So yes, we feel comfortable with the 4% to 8% and where we're going there."

We did adjust slightly our truck targets, but mostly just a pure reflection, as John alluded to, of a movement towards more of an asset-light position where we're growing our box program without having to make the historical heavy investment of the tractor. And so that really just helped us kind of shore up where we think that will be. 
We are still on that journey. Our box initiative really just launched less than 18 months ago. And as we've also stated today, we've increased the investment for incremental boxes just this year. And so we're tracking along per our expectations, and we see the ability to get back to that expectation. 
Switching gears over to ICS similarly. We're at the end of our heavy investment period. But again, characteristics, productivity gains, the advantages that we're seeing and capitalizing on because of the platform, where we're able to just be more efficient and make better decisions and really eliminate waste. We see those things that reinforce the affirmation of the range that John reiterated. And so those are the things that drove us, but again, I think it's important for all of our BUs. 
Fundamentally, it's about return on invested capital for us. And if things change in the model, whether that be a further movement to asset-light in our truck model, then that could influence things down the road. But at this point, those are the targets that we think are extremely realistic and achievable."

We really have a key customer that we have been overcoming that comp. Inside our LTL sector, we're starting to see growth, particularly in our 360 platforms, so feel confident about our plan around the LTL side. In general, if you just look at truckload volumes, particularly in ITS, those volumes were at a 10% growth plan. 
But I did talk about this earlier in this call that the very first part of bid season, although we have been educating and talking through what we believe the cost base would be to serve our customers and all of our services, that didn't directly align to the competitive pressure we were feeling from our customers in this season. I will say we held our ground on price in really all of our segments overall. And as our customers implemented those bids in first quarter, many of these bids were not working. They were falling apart because the price was not commensurate to the cost that the carriers and the brokers were giving to customers. 
So as we progressed through first quarter, we started picking up volume again, pretty much in line with what our strategy was as an organization in total, and have a lot of confidence in our scaling and gaining more market share in Q2 and beyond, not just in ICS, but also in JBT. Remember, the platform is not just an ICS product. It is across our entire enterprise, how we can leverage that for our customers to really allow them to have the right cost service and capacity. 
We saw scaling inside JBT as well in the first quarter, and we will continue to gain and take market share in both JBT and ICS from a 360 platform, and then, certainly in the Intermodal space as well."

As we open our earnings call for the second quarter of 2021, it makes sense to consider our comparison data with recognition for where we all were this time last year with the onset of the COVID virus. That said, we will continue our discussion on our views of our progress across the enterprise. A general term, we believe fits our current position is momentum. We noted for you during our last call that we have meaningfully increased our equipment orders for containers and intermodal and trailers for the J.B. Hunt 360box program. Through the quarter, we gained confidence in these decisions, and are working with our vendors to accommodate delivery of this equipment throughout the balance of the year with a keen focus on being able to meet the needs of our customers as we approach the traditional peak season.
This is a fluid situation, and we are deploying some new and creative ideas for ongoing equipment delivery. Shelley will add color for us on how we plan to work with our customers heading into the second half of 2021 and 2022.
A high-level overview provides visibility for us to see that the company increased revenues, operating income and earnings per share in total and in all segments compared to the unusual second quarter of 2020. Further review shows that Intermodal, Dedicated and Truckload all increased both revenue and operating income over Q1 of this year. ICS and Final Mile increased revenue but failed to increase operating income and looking sequentially and adjusting Final Mile Services for the gain we called out in our release.
As our segment leaders will discuss for you, the segments are all performing well and presents solid evidence that support both our strategy to this point and what I believe to be strong momentum as we move forward from here. Given the work we have completed with our customers, current demand trends, order flows and sales pipelines, coupled with the data revealing some of the lowest inventory levels we have seen, give us confidence in this momentum continuing.
One last point I'd like to highlight is the progress the company has made in increasing our transparency and focus on our overall sustainability efforts. Under the leadership of our Chief Sustainability Officer, Craig Harper, we have recently published our first sustainability report in accordance with the GRI, SASB and TCFD framework, which is easily accessed via our website. I think it's also worth noting that over the last year, our broader sustainability disclosure efforts have been recognized by SmartWay CDP, formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project, Sustainalytics and [ eco ] with meaningful improvements in our scoring across these platforms. Craig called out 25 unique people internally and many more who have helped with this improvement. As noted, this is a journey and not just for a few but for our entire organization.
I will now turn the call over to our CFO, John Kuhlow, for his comments. John?"

I'd like to start with providing a couple of comments on our second quarter just from a consolidated perspective.
As John noted, we are pleased with our revenue, operating income and EPS growth for the quarter with notable achievements in our highway services revenue as both ICS and JBT there was certainly over prior year quarter, but more importantly, they're carrying the momentum from their first quarter results into the second. Current quarter was significantly impacted by labor shortages, putting a strain on our ability to service demand and effectively use our assets. Cost pressures in the quarter were primarily related to higher purchase transportation costs, salaries and wages and other costs across our networks and operations. While we are hopeful for an improvement, this still remains an area of concern.
We ended the quarter with approximately $570 million in cash. On our first quarter call, we communicated our increase in equipment orders and guided our CapEx to be approximately $1.25 billion for 2021. While all orders are still in place, we anticipate some of these to push to 2022 because of the congestion on the waterways and also at the ports.
We are committed to obtaining capacity to serve our customers, but our view today is that net capital expenditures for 2021 will be closer to $1.15 billion because of these delays and other challenges to equipment needs. We resumed stock buybacks on a more regular basis in the second quarter, and have acquired approximately $80 million rounding out close to $85 million year-to-date. We will continue to balance our cash spend on equipment, dividends and buybacks through the remainder of the year as opportunities unfold, and trend closer to our targeted 1x EBITDA leverage metric on a net basis when the environment begins to normalize.
As John noted, segment comparisons to the prior year are difficult because of the pandemic. But I would like to point out an item for consideration on the year-over-year comparisons for salaries and wages. COVID costs in the second quarter decreased nearly $10 million from the prior year quarter, which was primarily due to a reduction in PTO for employees needing to quarantine. However, as we called out in the release, this reduction was meaningfully offset by increases across all pay items for both drivers and nondriver employees. The impact of the reopening on salaries and wages is widespread, and we see challenges in this area continuing because of the importance of attracting and retaining our people.
This concludes my remarks. And I will now turn it over to Shelley."

My commercial update will focus on general market conditions, our expectations and plan for our customers' peak season capacity needs as well as an update on the progress we are making as an organization with our J.B.",821,"Thank you, John, and good afternoon. My commercial update will focus on general market conditions, our expectations and plan for our customers' peak season capacity needs as well as an update on the progress we are making as an organization with our J.B. Hunt 360 multimodal digital freight platform.
As we discussed last quarter, we entered 2021 with cautious optimism about the opportunities the market could present to us during the year. Now that the year is just halfway over, clearly, the opportunities are bountiful but so too are the challenges. Demand for our capacity solutions across the scroll services remains at elevated levels. Capacity across the supply chain remains tight. And challenges around velocity and fluidity are still very present and likely to persist at least through the end of the year.
As an organization, we are committed to working with our customers to address these challenges together and have plans in place to provide even greater assistance as we approach peak. And that, I'll speak to next. The result of the current market conditions is that demand for our trucks, containers and trailers far exceeds our capacity to serve. Thankfully, our ability to provide value to our customers is no longer limited by our physical assets as the power of our people and our platform allows us to source the most efficient capacity for and on behalf of our customers. This dynamic is evident across all of our business segments that we will be discussing during our prepared remarks.
As we approach bid season and peak season, we are taking a collaborative approach with our customers to ensure that we have an actionable plan to provide the capacity solutions to meet their needs. One of our biggest challenges this year, which got even worse during the second quarter, was the detention of our trailing equipment by customers across both our intermodal and truck segments. We are addressing these issues with our customers through direct conversations and accessorial charges, and in some instances, we are restricting capacity to certain customer locations. To be clear, we did not implement or augment new accessorial programs with the intent of increasing the cost of our customers. Our intent was to provide the appropriate incentive to our customers to encourage the improvements needed to be able to turn our equipment efficiently. This improvement will afford us to deliver more value to our customers by being able to provide additional capacity.
To wrap up my comments on our plan for peak season, we remain very confident in our ability to execute on the plans we are developing with our customers. Our capacity and ability to service our customers will be determined by our performance around 3 key items: first, the onboarding of equipment orders we discussed last quarter but specifically the containers for JBI and trailers for 360box; second, improvement in rail validity and velocity; and third, improvements in customer retention or dwell time. Progress on these fronts will go a long way in meeting and exceeding customer expectations.
Shifting gears to our J.B. Hunt 360 platform, we continue to see solid and record-breaking trends around user activity, engagement and growth across both our carrier and shipper platforms. This is evidenced by our organization serving the largest number of unique customers in our history during the quarter. A tall task considering the supply limitations and restrictions that typically exist in a market like we are experiencing currently.
We believe we are continuing to build momentum as both carriers and shippers see the value in optimizing and transacting in our system in real time in an improving frictionless digital process. Going forward, our focus remains on improving access, visibility and transparency across the supply chain, which we believe sets us up to achieve our mission statement: To create the most efficient transportation network in North America.
In closing, as I look across our organization, I remain extremely proud and excited for all the opportunities we have to solve for our customers' needs. I believe we are in a unique position to leverage our people, assets, technology, and maybe most important, our experience in bringing those elements together. I'd like to think of that as our scroll. And the power of the J.B. Hunt's scroll is strong as customers continue to lean in to us to help them solve for their needs.
Finally, as previously disclosed, I've been given the responsibility of the role of EVP for People and Human Resources. Last quarter, I discussed how encouraged show us about the progress we are making on enhancing our inclusive culture, and our belief that our organization could lead in this area. As an update, I want to share that we have hired our first Vice President of Inclusion during the quarter. We are excited about our journey ahead and the incredible progress we can make in this area.
I'd now like to turn it over to Nick."

I'm going to spend my time giving a brief operational update focused on the current driver market and some other processes we are reviewing, in addition to providing some greater detail on the performance",808,"Thank you, Shelley, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to spend my time giving a brief operational update focused on the current driver market and some other processes we are reviewing, in addition to providing some greater detail on the performance of DCS and Final Mile Services in the quarter. I'll start with some quick thoughts from our operational perspective focused on the current state of the driver market in addition to our current review of some of our processes.
Consistent with my comments from last quarter, the driver market remains as challenged as I've seen in my 37-year career. As you will hear from Darren's comments in a few moments, we believe the availability of labor is having a meaningful impact across almost every part of the supply chain, ranging from the ports to rail terminal operations, warehouse operations and certainly over-the-road driver market. While we continue to believe we are in a relatively solid position with some of the best paying and highest quality jobs in the market with over 90% of our jobs being either local or regional in our dedicated intermodal dray, truck and Final Mile operations. The truth is we are not immune to the industry's driver challenges. We continue to make adjustments, and are experiencing inflationary cost pressures with driver wages and benefits in addition to experiencing elevated driver hiring and recruiting costs across all businesses.
To close up on my operational comments, I want to provide a brief update that I'm leading our efforts to review each of our vendors and suppliers to make sure we are properly aligned across our operational and sustainability goals, while also ensuring we are receiving the best value for our entire organization.
Now let me shift my comments to focus on the performance of Final Mile Services. Final Mile was able to continue its streak of strong performance with revenue growth of 52% in the quarter. Operating income was $10.7 million. But as disclosed in our press release, it did benefit from $3.2 million net settlement of claims in the quarter. Demand for our services across Final Mile remains strong, particularly across our big and bulky home delivery and fulfillment services. That said, availability of inventory, particularly across the appliance and furniture categories, is tempering what would otherwise be even stronger demand for our services.
Going forward, we're going to remain encouraged by the onboarding of new business as the year progresses and more importantly, remain encouraged about our pipelines, both organic and inorganic growth opportunities over the long term. As we continue to focus on the growth and scaling of the business, we will remain committed to protecting and investing in our service product and customer experience for and on behalf of our customers.
I'll close with some comments on results in DCS. Our backlog and pipeline for new dedicated private fleet start-ups is as strong as our company has ever seen. By the end of June, we will have added 555 trucks to the fleet from the end of the prior quarter, which is the third highest truck adds we've had in any single quarter. I am pleased that we are able to onboard not only a significant amount of new accounts but also across a diverse group of industries, all while continuing to perform within our newly established long-term margin target range of 12% to 14%.
We saw 17% growth in revenue driven by a 5% growth in our average fleet count year-over-year in addition to better productivity defined as revenue per truck per week, which was supported by contractual annual price escalators and the decline of idled equipment from prior year levels. Additionally, with regards to productivity in many locations across our network, we have been able to get additional funding to support the needed investment in driver wages in order to maintain performance standards and maintain our competitiveness in certain markets.
While we have strong momentum with our sales and operational efforts, we think it is important to recognize that driver and equipment availability -- In addition to the ability of trained and experienced account managers is moderately governing our ability to grow faster. Operating income was down 5% year-over-year as tailwinds in the prior year related to lower driver turnover, travel and entertainment expense and lack of start-ups have returned as anticipated in additional to higher personnel costs in the current quarter. Importantly, we believe our investments to grow the business will help us carry momentum well into 2022 and beyond.
To round out my DCS comments, we ended the second quarter selling approximately 1,165 trucks year-to-date. Given our prior guidance to sell 800 to 1,000 for the year, I believe it's safe for you to assume that we will exceed our targets for the full year.
That concludes my remarks, so I'll turn it over to Brad Hicks."

Hunt Transport Services, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Nick, and good afternoon. My comments today will focus on the performance of our highway services -- highway service business during the quarter, which includes both Integrated Capacity Solutions, or ICS, and truck or JBT.Let me start off by",613,"Thank you, Nick, and good afternoon. My comments today will focus on the performance of our highway services -- highway service business during the quarter, which includes both Integrated Capacity Solutions, or ICS, and truck or JBT.
Let me start off by saying how excited I am to see our team respond to the opportunities our customers present us with to deliver both truck and trailing capacity solutions to serve their needs. These capacity solutions were enabled by our multimodal digital freight platform, J.B. Hunt 360 and complemented by our drop-trailer pools with 360box. Additionally, these capacity solutions across highway services continues to provide value for our customers as evidenced by this most recent performance being the third quarter in a row in which both ICS and JBT delivered the strongest growth within our organization. This continues to support our decisions to focus our investments on our people and technology, which is driving further scale across the platform and our organization.
I'll start with my comments on JBT or our Truck segment. Revenue grew 70% to $184 million, which is the highest revenue this segment has delivered since the second quarter of 2008. Operating income was $14 million, which was the highest second quarter level achieved by the segment since 2007. Our growth and performance continues to be driven by our ability to provide capacity solutions with or without our physical trucking assets but with our trailing assets. Our ability to sell for the most efficient way of load should move by finding the right carrier at the right time and at the right price is what continues to drive strong demand for our 360box product. More importantly, our ability to access capacity quickly has allowed us to be able to tell our customers [ yes ].
As we have discussed in prior calls, we continue to see the business shifting to a more asset-light model and will remain focused on investing and scaling our service offering while staying focused on generating adequate returns on our investment. This will require a focus on balancing our growth with network efficiencies as we scale in the future.
Next, on ICS. The segment delivered $608 million of revenue, which broke our previous record set in the fourth quarter just last year. Revenue grew 100% versus the prior year period. Segment volumes grew 20% within the quarter, while specifically, truckload volume growth was up 30%.
Market dynamics remain challenged as freight demand strengthened from already elevated levels, while capacity remained constrained across the country. The result of which put seasonal pressure on net revenue margins, which was consistent with our expectation. We continue to see solid trends with our carrier and shipper engagement on the 360 platform, and remain encouraged by the productivity we are seeing with our people. All of which is enabled by our investments in both our people and technology.
We continue to see opportunities to invest in our 3 critical areas: our people, our technology and scaling the platform and remain committed to these investments. In closing, our performance this quarter in ICS and JBT aligned with one of our key objectives, which is to grow volume and gain market share by leveraging our platform and using data to help our customers make the best decisions and deliver value to their supply chains. We do this by eliminating waste in the system, and creating a frictionless way to access vast amounts of capacity across a multimodal digital freight platform. We remain excited about our opportunity to deliver our capacity solutions to our customers across our highway service businesses well into the future.
That concludes my comments, so I'll pass it over to Darren."

My comments this afternoon will focus on Intermodal's performance during the quarter. I will also provide some additional details on our network operations, including the onboarding",607,"Thank you, Brad, and good afternoon, everyone listening to today's call. My comments this afternoon will focus on Intermodal's performance during the quarter. I will also provide some additional details on our network operations, including the onboarding of new containers, and how we are working to improve velocity and in turn capacity in our network for and on behalf of our customers as we approach peak season.
Demand for our intermodal capacity remains robust. In fact, demand continues to significantly outpace our available capacity, which remains constrained by rail performance and restrictions in addition to customer detention of our trailing equipment. We continue to believe that the origin of these challenges center on the availability of labor for both the railroads, particularly in their terminals and our customers in their warehouse operations.
Volumes in the quarter increased 6%, broken down by month as plus 17% in April, plus 8% in May and minus 6% in June. As we discussed a year ago, June 2020 was a particularly strong month for us as we had equipment properly positioned for the surge in demand as the activity across the supply chain restarted.
Network velocity continues to be well below our expectations as evidenced by our box turns, which were approximately 1.65 turns per month during the quarter. We are working very closely with our rail providers and customers to improve our capacity across the network by focusing on reducing the detention of equipment and helping our rail providers reduce congestion across their terminal infrastructure. Going forward, the onboarding of our new equipment will also assist us in serving our customers' capacity needs, particularly as we approach peak season.
On that front, we began taking delivery of our new equipment in the last few weeks and have even more on the water as we speak. We expect a steady flow of equipment into the West Coast at this point moving forward, which is now likely to stretch into early 2022.
At this time, we are through the majority of repricing efforts for this latest bid season and rates came in at the higher end of our earlier expectation, which our original expectations were for high single to low double-digit increases. By the end of the quarter, about 70% of the volume had current bid cycle rates and we expect the remaining 30% of the business yet to reprice to implement in Q3. Inflationary cost pressures continue to present themselves in the way of driver wages and recruitment costs in addition to the cost of equipment ownership, particularly as utilization levels remain challenged by both the rail and customer activity previously discussed. We believe we have put in place the right pricing structure and programs that protect our necessity to generate an adequate return on our significant investment in our people and our equipment even if box turns remain challenged due to events outside of our control.
As we approach peak season, it is clear that our customers continue to want to lean into us for more capacity, and we feel very confident in our ability to execute our plan. Customers value our intermodal service offering as it continues to be a very cost-effective alternative to truck, and even more so now due to rapidly rising driver wages and fuel prices but also because of the environmental benefits of intermodal as its carbon intensity is 60% lower than the truck alternative. Going forward, we will continue to prioritize delivering value to our customers generating appropriate returns in our business, reinvesting to meet their future capacity needs and keeping us on a path toward long-term sustainable growth. That concludes my prepared comments."

The team is working every day to continue to receive more containers as we move into the fourth quarter. But for now, we can highlight 3,000 to 4,000 in Q3.
I think that on the velocity front, we're working with customers to find ways to free up the equipment faster. That's certainly an ongoing effort. And then the railroads, the key there is getting faster velocity out of the rail system. And we're aligned with all of our rail providers on their mission to improve their velocity. And so that is an expectation of ours during the quarter. If you're asking for specifics, we highlighted 1.65 turns in the second quarter.

And everything we can do to create fluidity at the terminals in order to help provide that, we're doing that and working with our customers on scheduling. We're drawing loads out of the terminals. We're doing a tremendous amount of work in order to improve fluidity.
So when you're hearing some of that restriction information, sometimes it's more international focused than it is domestic. We have some energy from that is I think the international supply chain has been one of the more significant drags on productivity for the various rail terminals and certainly if they can be focused on eliminating some of the congestion from international in order to free up capacity for domestic, we would certainly stand to have some benefit from that. I'm not saying that's what they're doing, but certainly the announcement from UMP was focused on international only."

So we depleted our stored containers in -- at the -- during June of 2020, which largely created a lot of very fast it for us because we had gone into storage during the really weakened part of the  second quarter last year. So during the third quarter, demand was so strong. No, we didn't have equipment really positioned strongly. So that was back to the need to really reposition the equipment, which drove a lot of the velocity challenges that we certainly had a year ago.
On the margin front, it's a range because a lot of factors influence that. Certainly, can we achieve it. It really depends on some of the cost challenges. And at this point, there's no letup on challenges for recruiting and hiring and retaining drivers. There's no let up on the cost to outsource capacity, our need to secure capacity in order to dray loads out of the terminal. So all of those cost challenges are real, so we just got to stick within the state that it's going to be within the range. And I think that's really all I can comment on the margin."

And then I would just say the other side of it is we have very good, as Shelley alluded to, relationships with our customer. We're very open. We try to stay ahead of that. Show them metrics in those areas and try to get ahead of that with them. So I think it's an advantage to us personally in the top market. Now does that mean we don't have pain? No, we have pain, but probably not as much as others.
And then on your question about unemployment, it's too early to say. We've been having some conversations about can we measure in the states that rolled back the unemployment benefits that we've been able to recruit more there. It's too early for us to tell. I think by the end of Q3, we'll have a better feel for that. I know at the end of September, supposedly, the rest of the country will roll back on that.

And then how do we think about the seasonality of either EBIT or the earnings cadence in the second half of the year. Should that follow kind of the change in customer shipping habits? Or is it just a situation where we're going to be at this elevated level for a longer period of time just where the demand environment is."

I'll take the customer side, and then I'll turn it over to John on the last part of the question. The disruption that occurred in 2020 has continued all the way through today, and we believe will continue through the rest of this year and into next year. Our customers do have a displacement happening from an inventory perspective. And have heard our customers say they moved from being -- ordering from a need by day to when can you get it to me date. And so there is inventory in the supply chain today that has already been delivered that is typically would not be there. So there has been some pull forward. I think it's just been based on a lot of the disruption that's happened particularly in the global supply chain. So that has caused kind of the upstream issues that are now hitting in the U.S. as well. And then certainly, we know the problems are occurring across every part of the supply chain and delivering goods for our customers.
I would say our customers from a demand perspective, believe that the rest of this year will be strong into next year as well. And finally, I would say peak season, we are doing a ton of peak planning. I talked about that on the last earnings call, we are doing that again now. And we're really doing that comprehensively across all of our 5 segments. And so how can we help understand the needs of our customers, what that will look like. And then what will we do when more disruption occurs in locations that are outside of what we are focusing on from a peak perspective, the sooner we can do that, the more success we'll have together with our customers."

As we open our earnings call for the second quarter of 2021, it makes sense to consider our comparison data with recognition for where we all were this time last year with the onset of the COVID virus. 
That said, we will continue our discussion on our views of our progress across the enterprise. A general term, we believe, fits our current position is momentum. We noted for you during our last call that we have meaningfully increased our equipment orders for containers in Intermodal and trailers for the J.B. Hunt 360box program. Through the quarter, we gained confidence in these decisions, and are working with our vendors to accommodate delivery of this equipment throughout the balance of the year with a keen focus on being able to meet the needs of our customers as we approach the traditional peak season. This is a fluid situation, and we are deploying some new and creative ideas for ongoing equipment delivery. Shelley will add color for us on how we plan to work with our customers heading into the second half of 2021 and 2022. 
A high-level overview provides visibility for us to see that the company increased revenues, operating income and earnings per share in total and in all segments compared to the unusual second quarter of 2020. Further review shows that Intermodal, Dedicated and Truckload all increased both revenue and operating income over Q1 of this year. ICS and Final Mile increased revenue but failed to increase operating income and looking sequentially and adjusting Final Mile Services for the gain we called out in our release. 
As our segment leaders will discuss for you, the segments are all performing well and presents solid evidence that support both our strategy to this point and what I believe to be strong momentum as we move forward from here. Given the work we have completed with our customers, current demand trends, order flows and sales pipelines, coupled with the data revealing some of the lowest inventory levels we have seen, give us confidence in this momentum continuing. 
One last point I'd like to highlight is the progress the company has made in increasing our transparency and focus on our overall sustainability efforts. Under the leadership of our Chief Sustainability Officer, Craig Harper, we have recently published our first sustainability report in accordance with the GRI, SASB and TCFD frameworks, which is easily accessed via our website. I think it's also worth noting that over the last year, our broader sustainability disclosure efforts have been recognized by SmartWay, CDP, formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project, Sustainalytics and EcoVadis with meaningful improvements in our scoring across these platforms. Craig called out 25 unique people internally and many more who have helped with this improvement. As noted, this is a journey and not just for a few but for our entire organization. 
I will now turn the call over to our CFO, John Kuhlow, for his comments. John?"

I'd like to start with providing a couple of comments on our second quarter just from a consolidated perspective. 
As John noted, we are pleased with our revenue, operating income and EPS growth for the quarter with notable achievements in our highway services revenue as both ICS and JBT there was certainly over prior year quarter, but more importantly, they're carrying the momentum from their first quarter results into the second. Current quarter was significantly impacted by labor shortages, putting a strain on our ability to service demand and effectively use our assets. Cost pressures in the quarter were primarily related to higher purchase transportation costs, salaries and wages and other costs across our networks and operations. 
While we are hopeful for an improvement, this still remains an area of concern. 
We ended the quarter with approximately $570 million in cash. On our first quarter call, we communicated our increase in equipment orders and guided our CapEx to be approximately $1.25 billion for 2021. While all orders are still in place, we anticipate some of these to push to 2022 because of the congestion on the waterways and also at the ports. 
We are committed to obtaining capacity to serve our customers, but our view today is that net capital expenditures for 2021 will be closer to $1.15 billion because of these delays and other challenges to equipment needs. We resumed stock buybacks on a more regular basis in the second quarter, and have acquired approximately $80 million rounding out close to $85 million year-to-date. We will continue to balance our cash spend on equipment, dividends and buybacks through the remainder of the year as opportunities unfold, and trend closer to our targeted 1x EBITDA leverage metric on a net basis when the environment begins to normalize. 
As John noted, segment comparisons to the prior year are difficult because of the pandemic. But I would like to point out an item for consideration on the year-over-year comparisons for salaries and wages. COVID costs in the second quarter decreased nearly $10 million from the prior year quarter, which was primarily due to a reduction in PTO for employees needing to quarantine. However, as we called out in the release, this reduction was meaningfully offset by increases across all pay items for both drivers and nondriver employees. The impact of the reopening on salaries and wages is widespread, and we see challenges in this area continuing because of the importance of attracting and retaining our people. 
This concludes my remarks. And I will now turn it over to Shelley."

My commercial update will focus on general market conditions, our expectations and plan for our customers' peak season capacity needs as well as an update on the progress we are making as an organization with our J.B.",822,"Thank you, John, and good afternoon. My commercial update will focus on general market conditions, our expectations and plan for our customers' peak season capacity needs as well as an update on the progress we are making as an organization with our J.B. Hunt 360 multimodal digital freight platform. 
As we discussed last quarter, we entered 2021 with cautious optimism about the opportunities the market could present to us during the year. Now that the year is just halfway over, clearly, the opportunities are bountiful but so too are the challenges. Demand for our capacity solutions across the scroll of services remains at elevated levels. Capacity across the supply chain remains tight, and challenges around velocity and fluidity are still very present and likely to persist at least through the end of the year. 
As an organization, we are committed to working with our customers to address these challenges together and have plans in place to provide even greater assistance as we approach peak. And that, I'll speak to next. The result of the current marketing conditions is that demand for our trucks, containers and trailers far exceeds our capacity to serve. Thankfully, our ability to provide value to our customers is no longer limited by our physical assets as the power of our people and our platform allows us to source the most efficient capacity for and on behalf of our customers. 
This dynamic is evident across all of our business segments that we will be discussing during our prepared remarks. 
As we approach bid season and peak season, we are taking a collaborative approach with our customers to ensure that we have an actionable plan to provide the capacity solutions to meet their needs. One of our biggest challenges this year, which got even worse during the second quarter, was the detention of our trailing equipment by customers across both our intermodal and truck segments. We are addressing these issues with our customers through direct conversations and accessorial charges, and in some instances, we are restricting capacity to certain customer locations. To be clear, we did not implement or augment new accessorial programs with the intent of increasing the cost of our customers. Our intent was to provide the appropriate incentive to our customers to encourage the improvements needed to be able to turn our equipment efficiently. This improvement will afford us to deliver more value to our customers by being able to provide additional capacity. 
To wrap up my comments on our plan for peak season, we remain very confident in our ability to execute on the plans we are developing with our customers. Our capacity and ability to service our customers will be determined by our performance around 3 key items: first, the onboarding of equipment orders we discussed last quarter but specifically the containers for JBI and trailers for 360box; second, improvements in rail solidity and velocity; and third, improvements in customer detention or dwell time. Progress on these fronts will go a long way in meeting and exceeding customer expectations. 
Shifting gears to our J.B. Hunt 360 platform. We continue to see solid and record-breaking trends around user activity, engagement and growth across both our carrier and shipper platforms. This is evidenced by our organization serving the largest number of unique customers in our history during the quarter, a tall task considering the supply limitations and restrictions that typically exist in a market like we are experiencing currently. 
We believe we are continuing to build momentum as both carriers and shippers see the value in optimizing and transacting in our system in real time in an improving frictionless digital process. Going forward, our focus remains on improving access, visibility and transparency across the supply chain, which we believe sets us up to achieve our mission statement: To create the most efficient transportation network in North America. 
In closing, as I look across our organization, I remain extremely proud and excited for all the opportunities we have to solve for our customers' needs. I believe we are in a unique position to leverage our people, assets, technology, and maybe most important, our experience in bringing those elements together. I'd like to think of that as our scroll. And the power of the J.B. Hunt's scroll is strong as customers continue to lean in to us to help them solve for their needs. 
Finally, as previously disclosed, I've been given the responsibility of the role of EVP for People and Human Resources. Last quarter, I discussed how encouraged I was about the progress we are making on enhancing our inclusive culture, and our belief that our organization could lead in this area. As an update, I want to share that we have hired our first Vice President of Inclusion during the quarter. We are excited about our journey ahead and the incredible progress we can make in this area. 
I'd now like to turn it over to Nick."

I'm going to spend my time giving a brief operational update focused on the current driver market and some other processes we are reviewing, in addition to providing some greater detail on the performance",807,"Thank you, Shelley, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to spend my time giving a brief operational update focused on the current driver market and some other processes we are reviewing, in addition to providing some greater detail on the performance of DCS and Final Mile Services in the quarter. 
I'll start with some quick thoughts from our operational perspective focused on the current state of the driver market in addition to our current review of some of our processes. Consistent with my comments from last quarter, the driver market remains as challenged as I've seen in my 37-year career. As you will hear from Darren's comments in a few moments, we believe the availability of labor is having a meaningful impact across almost every part of the supply chain, ranging from the ports to rail terminal operations, warehouse operations and certainly over-the-road driver market. 
While we continue to believe we are in a relatively solid position with some of the best paying and highest quality jobs in the market with over 90% of our jobs being either local or regional in our dedicated intermodal dray, truck and Final Mile operations, the truth is we are not immune to the industry's driver challenges. We continue to make adjustments, and are experiencing inflationary cost pressures with driver wages and benefits in addition to experiencing elevated driver hiring and recruiting costs across all businesses. 
To close up on my operational comments, I want to provide a brief update that I'm leading our efforts to review each of our vendors and suppliers to make sure we are properly aligned across our operational and sustainability goals, while also ensuring we are receiving the best value for our entire organization. 
Now let me shift my comments to focus on the performance of Final Mile Services. Final Mile was able to continue its streak of strong performance with revenue growth of 52% in the quarter. Operating income was $10.7 million. But as disclosed in our press release, it did benefit from $3.2 million net settlement of claims in the quarter. Demand for our services across Final Mile remains strong, particularly across our big and bulky home delivery and fulfillment services. That said, availability of inventory, particularly across the appliance and furniture categories, is tempering what would otherwise be even stronger demand for our services. 
Going forward, we're going to remain encouraged by the onboarding of new business as the year progresses and more importantly, remain encouraged about our pipelines', both organic and inorganic, growth opportunities over the long term. As we continue to focus on the growth and scaling of the business, we will remain committed to protecting and investing in our service product and customer experience for and on behalf of our customers. 
I'll close with some comments on results in DCS. Our backlog and pipeline for new dedicated private fleet start-ups is as strong as our company has ever seen. By the end of June, we will have added 555 trucks to the fleet from the end of the prior quarter, which is the third highest truck adds we've had in any single quarter. I am pleased that we are able to onboard not only a significant amount of new accounts but also across a diverse group of industries, all while continuing to perform within our newly established long-term margin target range of 12% to 14%. 
We saw 17% growth in revenue driven by a 5% growth in our average fleet count year-over-year in addition to better productivity, defined as revenue per truck per week, which was supported by contractual annual price escalators and the decline of idled equipment from prior year levels. Additionally, with regards to productivity in many locations across our network, we have been able to get additional funding to support the needed investment in driver wages in order to maintain performance standards and maintain our competitiveness in certain markets. 
While we have strong momentum with our sales and operational efforts, we think it is important to recognize that driver and equipment availability, in addition to the ability of trained and experienced account managers, is moderately governing our ability to grow faster. Operating income was down 5% year-over-year as tailwinds in the prior year related to lower driver turnover, travel and entertainment expense and lack of start-ups have returned as anticipated in additional to higher personnel costs in the current quarter. Importantly, we believe our investments to grow the business will help us carry momentum well into 2022 and beyond. 
To round out my DCS comments, we ended the second quarter selling approximately 1,165 trucks year-to-date. Given our prior guidance to sell 800 to 1,000 for the year, I believe it's safe for you to assume that we will exceed our targets for the full year. 
That concludes my remarks, so I'll turn it over to Brad Hicks."

My comments today will focus on the performance of our highway services -- highway service business during the quarter, which includes both Integrated Capacity Solutions, or ICS, and truck or JBT. Let me start off by",611,"Thank you, Nick, and good afternoon. My comments today will focus on the performance of our highway services -- highway service business during the quarter, which includes both Integrated Capacity Solutions, or ICS, and truck or JBT. 
Let me start off by saying how excited I am to see our team respond to the opportunities our customers present us with to deliver both truck and trailing capacity solutions to serve their needs. These capacity solutions were enabled by our multimodal digital freight platform, J.B. Hunt 360 and complemented by our drop-trailer pools with 360box. Additionally, these capacity solutions across highway services continues to provide value for our customers as evidenced by this most recent performance being the third quarter in a row in which both ICS and JBT delivered the strongest growth within our organization. This continues to support our decisions to focus our investments on our people and technology, which is driving further scale across the platform and our organization. 
I'll start with my comments on JBT or our Truck segment. Revenue grew 70% to $184 million, which is the highest revenue this segment has delivered since the second quarter of 2008. Operating income was $14 million, which was the highest second quarter level achieved by the segment since 2007. Our growth and performance continues to be driven by our ability to provide capacity solutions with or without our physical trucking assets but with our trailing assets. Our ability to sell for the most efficient way a load should move by finding the right carrier at the right time and at the right price is what continues to drive strong demand for our 360box product. More importantly, our ability to access capacity quickly has allowed us to be able to tell our customers yes. 
As we have discussed in prior calls, we continue to see the business shifting to a more asset-light model and will remain focused on investing and scaling our service offering while staying focused on generating adequate returns on our investment. This will require a focus on balancing our growth with network efficiencies as we scale in the future. 
Next, on ICS. The segment delivered $608 million of revenue, which broke our previous record set in the fourth quarter just last year. Revenue grew 100% versus the prior year period. Segment volumes grew 20% within the quarter, while specifically, truckload volume growth was up 30%. 
Market dynamics remain challenged as freight demand strengthened from already elevated levels, while capacity remained constrained across the country, the result of which put seasonal pressure on net revenue margins, which was consistent with our expectation. We continue to see solid trends with our carrier and shipper engagement on the 360 platform, and remain encouraged by the productivity we are seeing with our people, all of which is enabled by our investments in both our people and technology. We continue to see opportunities to invest in our 3 critical areas: our people, our technology and scaling the platform and remain committed to these investments. 
In closing, our performance this quarter in ICS and JBT aligned with one of our key objectives, which is to grow volume and gain market share by leveraging our platform and using data to help our customers make the best decisions and deliver value to their supply chains. We do this by eliminating waste in the system and creating a frictionless way to access vast amounts of capacity across a multimodal digital freight platform. We remain excited about our opportunity to deliver our capacity solutions to our customers across our highway service businesses well into the future. 
That concludes my comments, so I'll pass it over to Darren."

My comments this afternoon will focus on Intermodal's performance during the quarter. I will also provide some additional details on network operations, including the onboarding of n",605,"Thank you, Brad, and good afternoon, everyone listening to today's call. My comments this afternoon will focus on Intermodal's performance during the quarter. I will also provide some additional details on network operations, including the onboarding of new containers, and how we are working to improve velocity and in turn capacity in our network for and on behalf of our customers as we approach peak season. 
Demand for our intermodal capacity remains robust. In fact, demand continues to significantly outpace our available capacity, which remains constrained by rail performance and restrictions in addition to customer detention of our trailing equipment. We continue to believe that the origin of these challenges center on the availability of labor for both the railroads, particularly in their terminals, and our customers in their warehouse operations. 
Volumes in the quarter increased 6%, broken down by month as plus 17% in April, plus 8% in May and minus 6% in June. As we discussed a year ago, June 2020 was a particularly strong month for us as we had equipment properly positioned for the surge in demand as the activity across the supply chain restarted. 
Network velocity continues to be well below our expectations as evidenced by our box turns, which were approximately 1.65 turns per month during the quarter. We are working very closely with our rail providers and customers to improve our capacity across the network by focusing on reducing the detention of equipment and helping our rail providers reduce congestion across their terminal infrastructure. Going forward, the onboarding of our new equipment will also assist us in serving our customers' capacity needs, particularly as we approach peak season. 
On that front, we began taking delivery of our new equipment in the last few weeks and have even more on the water as we speak. We expect a steady flow of equipment into the West Coast at this point moving forward, which is now likely to stretch into early 2022. 
At this time, we are through the majority of repricing efforts for this latest bid season and rates came in at the higher end of our earlier expectation, which our original expectations were for high-single to low double-digit increases. By the end of the quarter, about 70% of the volume had current bid cycle rates and we expect the remaining 30% of the business yet to reprice to implement in Q3. Inflationary cost pressures continue to present themselves in the way of driver wages and recruitment costs in addition to the cost of equipment ownership, particularly as utilization levels remain challenged by both the rail and customer activity previously discussed. We believe we have put in place the right pricing structure and programs that protect our necessity to generate an adequate return on our significant investment in our people and our equipment even if box turns remain challenged due to events outside of our control. 
As we approach peak season, it is clear that our customers continue to want to lean into us for more capacity, and we feel very confident in our ability to execute our plan. Customers value our intermodal service offering as it continues to be a very cost-effective alternative to truck, and even more so now due to rapidly rising driver wages and fuel prices but also because of the environmental benefits of intermodal as its carbon intensity is 60% lower than the truck alternative. Going forward, we will continue to prioritize delivering value to our customers, generating appropriate returns in our business, reinvesting to meet their future capacity needs and keeping us on a path toward long-term sustainable growth. That concludes my prepared comments."

JBI is further along. I think that's because of the volatility that's happening in the brokerage market in general, just under 60% has been implemented. I would also say that our revenue per load changed inside ICS as a result of moving more business in near term to contract versus contract with carriers. And so that business and a higher revenue per load did yield a lower gross margin percentage, but our gross margin dollars per load was still up. So it's a little bit apples and oranges compared to what we have historically done just because the revenue per load has changed so dramatically."

We highlighted that we have new containers on the water today. We have strong confidence in our ability to receive between 3,000 and 4,000 during the third quarter. We also highlighted that we feel like of the 12,000 we announced at the first quarter earnings call, some of those will certainly filter into the early stages of '22. The team is working every day to continue to receive more containers as we move into the fourth quarter. But for now, we can highlight 3,000 to 4,000 in Q3.
I think that on the velocity front, we're working with customers to find ways to free up the equipment faster. That's certainly an ongoing effort. And then the railroads, the key there is getting faster velocity out of the rail system. And we're aligned with all of our rail providers on their mission to improve their velocity. And so that is an expectation of ours during the quarter. If you're asking for specifics, we highlighted 1.65 turns in the second quarter. We think that can improve somewhat to slightly in the third quarter, but not yet ready to believe it's going to be a real material impact at this stage."

And then you've been really helpful in the past about talking about maybe the margin progression expectations and you've been bang on in terms of sequential margin improvement as the pricing further gets implemented. You guys have shown good drop-through in the intermodal on the incremental revenue growth, at least sequentially as some of the pricing comes through.

The thing on the restrictions that you've heard from UMP is those are -- well, we don't operate on Union Pacific, but it's largely understood to be international only.

And everything we can do to create fluidity at the terminals in order to help provide that, we're doing that and working with our customers on scheduling. We're drawing loads out of the terminals. We're doing a tremendous amount of work in order to improve fluidity.
So when you're hearing some of that restriction information, sometimes it's more international focused than it is domestic. We have some energy from that is I think the international supply chain has been one of the more significant drags on productivity for the various rail terminals and certainly if they can be focused on eliminating some of the congestion from international in order to free up capacity for domestic, we would certainly stand to have some benefit from that. I'm not saying that's what they're doing, but certainly the announcement from UMP was focused on international only."

So that was back to the need to really reposition the equipment, which drove a lot of the velocity challenges that we certainly had a year ago.
On the margin front, it's a range because a lot of factors influence that. Certainly, can we achieve it? It really depends on some of the cost challenges. And at this point, there's no let up on challenges for recruiting and hiring and retaining drivers. There's no let up on the cost to outsource capacity, our need to secure capacity in order to dray loads out of the terminal.

So John, maybe step back and give a little bit of your thoughts on labor. And when you think about hearing impacts of embargoes on some of the networks, any concern that the network starts to melt down like we've seen on some of the rail networks when it starts spreading and spreading out wider from just one area, especially when you're adding capacity when the rail network is not fluid. Is there concern that it gets gummed up and they're not able to take advantage of their [ precision ] scheduled railroading overhauls?"

I do think that -- when we talk about labor challenges with the rail system, I mean, I really do think it's -- we're talking about locations that need to find 4% or 5% more employees in order to be fully staffed and overcome kind of a challenge that they're in now. These aren't just massive, massive amounts of people that they need to hire. So it feels like that would be highly unusual.

And then I would just say the other side of it is we have very good, as Shelley alluded to, relationships with our customer. We're very open. We try to stay ahead of that. Show them metrics in those areas and try to get ahead of that with them. So I think it's an advantage to us personally in the top market. Now does that mean we don't have pain? No, we have pain, but probably not as much as others.
And then on your question about unemployment, it's too early to say. We've been having some conversations about can we measure in the states that rolled back the unemployment benefits that we've been able to recruit more there. It's too early for us to tell. I think by the end of Q3, we'll have a better feel for that. I know at the end of September, supposedly, the rest of the country will roll back on that. So I think it will just kind of become very clear at that time. But it's too early right now to tell. Most of that's in the south.

Our customers do have a displacement happening from an inventory perspective. And have heard our customers say they moved from being -- ordering from a need-by date to a when-can-you-get-it-to-me date. And so there is inventory in the supply chain today that has already been delivered that is typically would not be there. So there has been some pull forward. I think it's just been based on a lot of the disruption that's happened particularly in the global supply chain. So that has caused kind of the upstream issues that are now hitting in the U.S. as well. And then certainly, we know the problems that are occurring across every part of the supply chain and delivering goods for our customers.
I would say our customers, from a demand perspective, believe that the rest of this year will be strong into next year as well.

As we open our earnings call for the second quarter of 2021, it makes sense to consider our comparison data with recognition for where we all were this time last year with the onset of the COVID virus. 
That said, we will continue our discussion on our views of our progress across the enterprise. A general term, we believe, fits our current position is momentum. We noted for you during our last call that we have meaningfully increased our equipment orders for containers in Intermodal and trailers for the J.B. Hunt 360box program. Through the quarter, we gained confidence in these decisions and are working with our vendors to accommodate delivery of this equipment throughout the balance of the year with a keen focus on being able to meet the needs of our customers as we approach the traditional peak season. This is a fluid situation, and we are deploying some new and creative ideas for ongoing equipment delivery. Shelley will add color for us on how we plan to work with our customers heading into the second half of 2021 and 2022.
A high-level overview provides visibility for us to see that the company increased revenues, operating income and earnings per share in total and in all segments compared to the unusual second quarter of 2020. Further review shows that Intermodal, Dedicated and Truckload all increased both revenue and operating income over Q1 of this year. ICS and Final Mile increased revenue but failed to increase operating income when looking sequentially and adjusting Final Mile Services for the gain we called out in our release. 
As our segment leaders will discuss for you, the segments are all performing well and present solid evidence that support both our strategy to this point and what I believe to be strong momentum as we move forward from here. Given the work we have completed with our customers, current demand trends, order flows and sales pipelines, coupled with the data revealing some of the lowest inventory levels we have seen, give us confidence in this momentum continuing. 
One last point I'd like to highlight is the progress the company has made in increasing our transparency and focus on our overall sustainability efforts. Under the leadership of our Chief Sustainability Officer, Craig Harper, we have recently published our first sustainability report in accordance with the GRI, SASB and TCFD frameworks, which is easily accessed via our website. I think it's also worth noting that over the last year, our broader sustainability disclosure efforts have been recognized by SmartWay; CDP, formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project; Sustainalytics; and EcoVadis with meaningful improvements in our scoring across these platforms. Craig called out 25 unique people internally and many more who have helped with this improvement. As noted, this is a journey and not just for a few but for our entire organization. 
I will now turn the call over to our CFO, John Kuhlow, for his comments. John?"

I'd like to start with providing a couple of comments on our second quarter just from a consolidated perspective. 
As John noted, we are pleased with our revenue, operating income and EPS growth for the quarter with notable achievements in our highway services revenue as both ICS and JBT that was certainly over prior year quarter, but more importantly, they're carrying the momentum from their first quarter results into the second. Current quarter was significantly impacted by labor shortages, putting a strain on our ability to service demand and effectively use our assets. Cost pressures in the quarter were primarily related to higher purchase transportation costs, salaries and wages and other costs across our networks and operations.  While we are hopeful for an improvement, this still remains an area of concern. 
We ended the quarter with approximately $570 million in cash. On our first quarter call, we communicated our increase in equipment orders and guided our CapEx to be approximately $1.25 billion for 2021. While all orders are still in place, we anticipate some of these to push to 2022 because of the congestion on the waterways and also at the ports.  We are committed to obtaining capacity to serve our customers, but our view today is that net capital expenditures for 2021 will be closer to $1.15 billion because of these delays and other challenges to equipment needs. 
We resumed stock buybacks on a more regular basis in the second quarter, and have acquired approximately $80 million rounding out close to $85 million year-to-date. We will continue to balance our cash spend on equipment, dividends and buybacks through the remainder of the year as opportunities unfold, and trend closer to our targeted 1x EBITDA leverage metric on a net basis when the environment begins to normalize. 
As John noted, segment comparisons to the prior year are difficult because of the pandemic. But I would like to point out an item for consideration on the year-over-year comparisons for salaries and wages. COVID costs in the second quarter decreased nearly $10 million from the prior year quarter, which was primarily due to a reduction in PTO for employees needing to quarantine. However, as we called out in the release, this reduction was meaningfully offset by increases across all pay items for both drivers and nondriver employees. The impact of the reopening on salaries and wages is widespread, and we see challenges in this area continuing because of the importance of attracting and retaining our people. 
This concludes my remarks. And I will now turn it over to Shelley."

My commercial update will focus on general market conditions, our expectations and plan for our customers' peak season capacity needs as well as an update on the progress we are making as an organization with our J.B.",822,"Thank you, John, and good afternoon. My commercial update will focus on general market conditions, our expectations and plan for our customers' peak season capacity needs as well as an update on the progress we are making as an organization with our J.B. Hunt 360 multimodal digital freight platform. 
As we discussed last quarter, we entered 2021 with cautious optimism about the opportunities the market could present to us during the year. Now that the year is just halfway over, clearly, the opportunities are bountiful but so too are the challenges. Demand for our capacity solutions across the scroll of services remains at elevated levels. Capacity across the supply chain remains tight, and challenges around velocity and fluidity are still very present and likely to persist at least through the end of the year. 
As an organization, we are committed to working with our customers to address these challenges together and have plans in place to provide even greater assistance as we approach peak. And that, I'll speak to next. The result of the current market conditions is that demand for our trucks, containers and trailers far exceeds our capacity to serve. Thankfully, our ability to provide value to our customers is no longer limited by our physical assets as the power of our people and our platform allows us to source the most efficient capacity for and on behalf of our customers. 
This dynamic is evident across all of our business segments that we will be discussing during our prepared remarks. 
As we approach bid season and peak season, we are taking a collaborative approach with our customers to ensure that we have an actionable plan to provide the capacity solutions to meet their needs. One of our biggest challenges this year, which got even worse during the second quarter, was the detention of our trailing equipment by customers across both our intermodal and truck segments. We are addressing these issues with our customers through direct conversations and accessorial charges, and in some instances, we are restricting capacity to certain customer locations. To be clear, we did not implement or augment new accessorial programs with the intent of increasing the cost of our customers. Our intent was to provide the appropriate incentive to our customers to encourage the improvements needed to be able to turn our equipment efficiently. This improvement will afford us to deliver more value to our customers by being able to provide additional capacity. 
To wrap up my comments on our plan for peak season, we remain very confident in our ability to execute on the plans we are developing with our customers. Our capacity and ability to service our customers will be determined by our performance around 3 key items: first, the onboarding of equipment orders we discussed last quarter but specifically the containers for JBI and trailers for 360box; second, improvements in rail fluidity and velocity; and third, improvements in customer detention or dwell time. Progress on these fronts will go a long way in meeting and exceeding customer expectations. 
Shifting gears to our J.B. Hunt 360 platform, we continue to see solid and record-breaking trends around user activity, engagement and growth across both our carrier and shipper platforms. This is evidenced by our organization serving the largest number of unique customers in our history during the quarter, a tall task considering the supply limitations and restrictions that typically exist in a market like we are experiencing currently. 
We believe we are continuing to build momentum as both carriers and shippers see the value in optimizing and transacting in our system in real time in an improving frictionless digital process. Going forward, our focus remains on improving access, visibility and transparency across the supply chain, which we believe sets us up to achieve our mission statement: To create the most efficient transportation network in North America. 
In closing, as I look across our organization, I remain extremely proud and excited for all the opportunities we have to solve for our customers' needs. I believe we are in a unique position to leverage our people, assets, technology, and maybe most important, our experience in bringing those elements together. I'd like to think of that as our scroll. And the power of the J.B. Hunt scroll is strong as customers continue to lean in to us to help them solve for their needs. 
Finally, as previously disclosed, I've been given the responsibility of the role of EVP for People and Human Resources. Last quarter, I discussed how encouraged I was about the progress we are making on enhancing our inclusive culture, and our belief that our organization could lead in this area. As an update, I want to share that we have hired our first Vice President of Inclusion during the quarter. We are excited about our journey ahead and the incredible progress we can make in this area. 
I'd now like to turn it over to Nick."

I'm going to spend my time giving a brief operational update focused on the current driver market and some other processes we are reviewing, in addition to providing some greater detail on the performance",807,"Thank you, Shelley, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to spend my time giving a brief operational update focused on the current driver market and some other processes we are reviewing, in addition to providing some greater detail on the performance of DCS and Final Mile Services in the quarter. 
I'll start with some quick thoughts from our operational perspective focused on the current state of the driver market in addition to our current review of some of our processes. Consistent with my comments from last quarter, the driver market remains as challenged as I've seen in my 37-year career. As you will hear from Darren's comments in a few moments, we believe the availability of labor is having a meaningful impact across almost every part of the supply chain, ranging from the ports to rail terminal operations, warehouse operations and certainly over-the-road driver market. 
While we continue to believe we are in a relatively solid position with some of the best paying and highest quality jobs in the market with over 90% of our jobs being either local or regional in our dedicated intermodal dray, truck and Final Mile operations, the truth is we are not immune to the industry's driver challenges. We continue to make adjustments, and are experiencing inflationary cost pressures with driver wages and benefits in addition to experiencing elevated driver hiring and recruiting costs across all businesses. 
To close up on my operational comments, I want to provide a brief update that I'm leading our efforts to review each of our vendors and suppliers to make sure we are properly aligned across our operational and sustainability goals, while also ensuring we are receiving the best value for our entire organization. 
Now let me shift my comments to focus on the performance of Final Mile Services. Final Mile was able to continue its streak of strong performance with revenue growth of 52% in the quarter. Operating income was $10.7 million. But as disclosed in our press release, it did benefit from $3.2 million net settlement of claims in the quarter. Demand for our services across Final Mile remains strong, particularly across our big and bulky home delivery and fulfillment services. That said, availability of inventory, particularly across the appliance and furniture categories, is tempering what would otherwise be even stronger demand for our services. 
Going forward, we're going to remain encouraged by the onboarding of new business as the year progresses and more importantly, remain encouraged about our pipelines' both organic and inorganic growth opportunities over the long term. As we continue to focus on the growth and scaling of the business, we will remain committed to protecting and investing in our service product and customer experience for and on behalf of our customers. 
I'll close with some comments on results in DCS. Our backlog and pipeline for new dedicated private fleet start-ups is as strong as our company has ever seen. By the end of June, we will have added 555 trucks to the fleet from the end of the prior quarter, which is the third highest truck adds we've had in any single quarter. I am pleased that we are able to onboard not only a significant amount of new accounts but also across a diverse group of industries, all while continuing to perform within our newly established long-term margin target range of 12% to 14%. 
We saw 17% growth in revenue driven by a 5% growth in our average fleet count year-over-year in addition to better productivity, defined as revenue per truck per week, which was supported by contractual annual price escalators and the decline of idled equipment from prior year levels. Additionally, with regards to productivity, in many locations across our network, we have been able to get additional funding to support the needed investment in driver wages in order to maintain performance standards and maintain our competitiveness in certain markets. 
While we have strong momentum with our sales and operational efforts, we think it is important to recognize that driver and equipment availability, in addition to the ability of trained and experienced account managers, is moderately governing our ability to grow faster. Operating income was down 5% year-over-year as tailwinds in the prior year related to lower driver turnover, travel and entertainment expense and lack of start-ups have returned as anticipated in addition to higher personnel costs in the current quarter. Importantly, we believe our investments to grow the business will help us carry momentum well into 2022 and beyond. 
To round out my DCS comments, we ended the second quarter selling approximately 1,165 trucks year-to-date. Given our prior guidance to sell 800 to 1,000 for the year, I believe it's safe for you to assume that we will exceed our targets for the full year. 
That concludes my remarks, so I'll turn it over to Brad Hicks."

My comments today will focus on the performance of our highway services -- highway service business during the quarter, which includes both Integrated Capacity Solutions, or ICS, and truck or JBT. Let me start off by",611,"Thank you, Nick, and good afternoon. My comments today will focus on the performance of our highway services -- highway service business during the quarter, which includes both Integrated Capacity Solutions, or ICS, and truck or JBT. 
Let me start off by saying how excited I am to see our team respond to the opportunities our customers present us with to deliver both truck and trailing capacity solutions to serve their needs. These capacity solutions were enabled by our multimodal digital freight platform, J.B. Hunt 360, and complemented by our drop-trailer pools with 360box. Additionally, these capacity solutions across highway services continues to provide value for our customers as evidenced by this most recent performance being the third quarter in a row in which both ICS and JBT delivered the strongest growth within our organization. This continues to support our decisions to focus our investments on our people and technology, which is driving further scale across the platform and our organization. 
I'll start with my comments on JBT or our Truck segment. Revenue grew 70% to $184 million, which is the highest revenue this segment has delivered since the second quarter of 2008. Operating income was $14 million, which was the highest second quarter level achieved by the segment since 2007. Our growth and performance continues to be driven by our ability to provide capacity solutions with or without our physical trucking assets but with our trailing assets. Our ability to solve for the most efficient way a load should move by finding the right carrier at the right time and at the right price is what continues to drive strong demand for our 360box product. More importantly, our ability to access capacity quickly has allowed us to be able to tell our customers yes. 
As we have discussed in prior calls, we continue to see the business shifting to a more asset-light model and we'll remain focused on investing and scaling our service offering while staying focused on generating adequate returns on our investment. This will require a focus on balancing our growth with network efficiencies as we scale in the future. 
Next, on ICS. The segment delivered $608 million of revenue, which broke our previous record set in the fourth quarter just last year. Revenue grew 100% versus the prior year period. Segment volumes grew 20% within the quarter, while specifically, truckload volume growth was up 30%. 
Market dynamics remain challenged as freight demand strengthened from already elevated levels, while capacity remained constrained across the country, the result of which put seasonal pressure on net revenue margins, which was consistent with our expectation. We continue to see solid trends with our carrier and shipper engagement on the 360 platform, and remain encouraged by the productivity we are seeing with our people, all of which is enabled by our investments in both our people and technology. We continue to see opportunities to invest in our 3 critical areas: our people, our technology and scaling the platform, and remain committed to these investments. 
In closing, our performance this quarter in ICS and JBT aligned with one of our key objectives, which is to grow volume and gain market share by leveraging our platform and using data to help our customers make the best decisions and deliver value to their supply chains. We do this by eliminating waste in the system and creating a frictionless way to access vast amounts of capacity across a multimodal digital freight platform. We remain excited about our opportunity to deliver our capacity solutions to our customers across our highway service businesses well into the future. 
That concludes my comments, so I'll pass it over to Darren."

My comments this afternoon will focus on Intermodal's performance during the quarter. I will also provide some additional details on network operations, including the onboarding of new containers, and how we are working to improve velocity and in turn capacity in our network for and on behalf of our customers as we approach peak season. 
Demand for our intermodal capacity remains robust. In fact, demand continues to significantly outpace our available capacity, which remains constrained by rail performance and restrictions in addition to customer detention of our trailing equipment. We continue to believe that the origin of these challenges center on the availability of labor for both the railroads, particularly in their terminals, and our customers in their warehouse operations. 
Volumes in the quarter increased 6%, broken down by month as plus 17% in April, plus 8% in May and minus 6% in June. As we discussed a year ago, June 2020 was a particularly strong month for us as we had equipment properly positioned for the surge in demand as the activity across the supply chain restarted. 
Network velocity continues to be well below our expectations as evidenced by our box turns, which were approximately 1.65 turns per month during the quarter. We are working very closely with our rail providers and customers to improve our capacity across the network by focusing on reducing the detention of equipment and helping our rail providers reduce congestion across their terminal infrastructure. Going forward, the onboarding of our new equipment will also assist us in serving our customers' capacity needs, particularly as we approach peak season. 
On that front, we began taking delivery of our new equipment in the last few weeks and have even more on the water as we speak. We expect a steady flow of equipment into the West Coast at this point moving forward, which is now likely to stretch into early 2022. 
At this time, we are through the majority of repricing efforts for this latest bid season and rates came in at the higher end of our earlier expectation, which our original expectations were for high-single to low double-digit increases. By the end of the quarter, about 70% of the volume had current bid cycle rates and we expect the remaining 30% of the business yet to reprice to implement in Q3. Inflationary cost pressures continue to present themselves in the way of driver wages and recruitment costs in addition to the cost of equipment ownership, particularly as utilization levels remain challenged by both the rail and customer activity previously discussed. We believe we have put in place the right pricing structure and programs that protect our necessity to generate an adequate return on our significant investment in our people and our equipment even if box turns remain challenged due to events outside of our control. 
As we approach peak season, it is clear that our customers continue to want to lean into us for more capacity, and we feel very confident in our ability to execute our plan. Customers value our intermodal service offering as it continues to be a very cost-effective alternative to truck, and even more so now due to rapidly rising driver wages and fuel prices but also because of the environmental benefits of intermodal as its carbon intensity is 60% lower than the truck alternative. Going forward, we will continue to prioritize delivering value to our customers, generating appropriate returns in our business, reinvesting to meet their future capacity needs and keeping us on a path toward long-term sustainable growth. That concludes my prepared comments."

The team is working every day to continue to receive more containers as we move into the fourth quarter. But for now, we can highlight 3,000 to 4,000 in Q3.
I think that on the velocity front, we're working with customers to find ways to free up the equipment faster. That's certainly an ongoing effort. And then the railroads, the key there is getting faster velocity out of the rail system. And we're aligned with all of our rail providers on their mission to improve their velocity. And so that is an expectation of ours during the quarter. If you're asking for specifics, we highlighted 1.65 turns in the second quarter. We think that can improve somewhat to slightly in the third quarter, but not yet ready to believe it's going to be a real material impact at this stage."

The thing on the restrictions that you've heard from UMP is those are -- well, we don't operate on Union Pacific but it's largely understood to be international only.

And everything we can do to create fluidity at the terminals in order to help provide that, we're doing that and working with our customers on scheduling. We're draying loads out of the terminals. We're doing a tremendous amount of work in order to improve fluidity.
So when you're hearing some of that restriction information, sometimes it's more international focused than it is domestic. We have some energy from that as I think the international supply chain has been one of the more significant drags on productivity for the various rail terminals and certainly if they can be focused on eliminating some of the congestion from international in order to free up capacity for domestic, we would certainly stand to have some benefit from that. I'm not saying that's what they're doing, but certainly the announcement from UMP was focused on international only."

So during the third quarter, demand was so strong. No, we didn't have equipment really positioned strongly. So that was back to the need to really reposition the equipment, which drove a lot of the velocity challenges that we certainly had a year ago.
On the margin front, it's a range because a lot of factors influence that. Certainly, can we achieve it? It really depends on some of the cost challenges. And at this point, there's no let-up on challenges for recruiting and hiring and retaining drivers. There's no let-up on the cost to outsource capacity, our need to secure capacity in order to dray loads out of the terminal.

No, we have pain, but probably not as much as others.
And then on your question about unemployment, it's too early to say. We've been having some conversations about, can we measure in the states that rolled back the unemployment benefits that we've been able to recruit more there. It's too early for us to tell. I think by the end of Q3, we'll have a better feel for that. I know at the end of September, supposedly, the rest of the country will roll back on that. So I think it will just kind of become very clear at that time. But it's too early right now to tell. Most of that's in the south. And if I was going to say any area was a little less pressured than the other, it would be in the south, a little less pressured. They're all pressured but a little less pressure there in general.

And so 360 platform has certainly enabled us to be more flexible for our customers and be able to do more for them in that environment is just another good example of that."

So we can always say yes; it's just down to cost and what that means from a pressure perspective helping us meet with our customers and helping make sure that their budgets are intact."

Obviously, with the work that we're doing with Google and the co-innovation that will come from that will allow us to make good decisions around how we continue to invest to enhance the 360 platform and how we can make sure that we're providing value for our customers and for carriers.
I think it's clear that our goals are to create the most efficient transportation network in North America, and we feel real good about where we sit with respect to that.

I'll take the customer side, and then I'll turn it over to John on the last part of the question. The disruption that occurred in 2020 has continued all the way through today, and we believe will continue through the rest of this year and into next year. Our customers do have a displacement happening from an inventory perspective. And have heard our customers say they moved from being -- ordering from a need-by date to a when-can-you-get-it-to-me date. And so there is inventory in the supply chain today that has already been delivered that typically would not be there. So there has been some pull-forward. I think it's just been based on a lot of the disruption that's happened, particularly in the global supply chain. So that has caused kind of the upstream issues that are now hitting in the U.S. as well, and then certainly we know the problems that are occurring across every part of the supply chain and delivering goods for our customers.
I would say our customers, from a demand perspective, believe that the rest of this year will be strong into next year as well. And finally, I would say peak season, we are doing a ton of peak planning. I talked about that on the last earnings call. We are doing that again now. And we're really doing that comprehensively across all of our 5 segments.

Through the quarter, we gained confidence in these decisions and are working with our vendors to accommodate delivery of this equipment throughout the balance of the year with a keen focus on being able to meet the needs of our customers as we approach the traditional peak season. This is a fluid situation, and we are deploying some new and creative ideas for ongoing equipment delivery. Shelley will add color for us on how we plan to work with our customers heading into the second half of 2021 and 2022.
A high-level overview provides visibility for us to see that the company increased revenues, operating income and earnings per share in total and in all segments compared to the unusual second quarter of 2020. Further review shows that Intermodal, Dedicated and Truckload all increased both revenue and operating income over Q1 of this year. ICS and Final Mile increased revenue but failed to increase operating income when looking sequentially and adjusting Final Mile Services for the gain we called out in our release. 
As our segment leaders will discuss for you, the segments are all performing well and present solid evidence that support both our strategy to this point and what I believe to be strong momentum as we move forward from here. Given the work we have completed with our customers, current demand trends, order flows and sales pipelines, coupled with the data revealing some of the lowest inventory levels we have seen, give us confidence in this momentum continuing. 
One last point I'd like to highlight is the progress the company has made in increasing our transparency and focus on our overall sustainability efforts. Under the leadership of our Chief Sustainability Officer, Craig Harper, we have recently published our first sustainability report in accordance with the GRI, SASB and TCFD frameworks, which is easily accessed via our website. I think it's also worth noting that over the last year, our broader sustainability disclosure efforts have been recognized by SmartWay; CDP, formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project; Sustainalytics; and EcoVadis with meaningful improvements in our scoring across these platforms. Craig called out 25 unique people internally and many more who have helped with this improvement. As noted, this is a journey and not just for a few but for our entire organization. 
I will now turn the call over to our CFO, John Kuhlow, for his comments. John?"

I'd like to start with providing a couple of comments on our second quarter just from a consolidated perspective. 
As John noted, we are pleased with our revenue, operating income and EPS growth for the quarter with notable achievements in our highway services revenue as both ICS and JBT that was certainly over prior year quarter, but more importantly, they're carrying the momentum from their first quarter results into the second. Current quarter was significantly impacted by labor shortages, putting a strain on our ability to service demand and effectively use our assets. Cost pressures in the quarter were primarily related to higher purchase transportation costs, salaries and wages and other costs across our networks and operations.  While we are hopeful for an improvement, this still remains an area of concern. 
We ended the quarter with approximately $570 million in cash. On our first quarter call, we communicated our increase in equipment orders and guided our CapEx to be approximately $1.25 billion for 2021. While all orders are still in place, we anticipate some of these to push to 2022 because of the congestion on the waterways and also at the ports.  We are committed to obtaining capacity to serve our customers, but our view today is that net capital expenditures for 2021 will be closer to $1.15 billion because of these delays and other challenges to equipment needs. 
We resumed stock buybacks on a more regular basis in the second quarter, and have acquired approximately $80 million rounding out close to $85 million year-to-date. We will continue to balance our cash spend on equipment, dividends and buybacks through the remainder of the year as opportunities unfold, and trend closer to our targeted 1x EBITDA leverage metric on a net basis when the environment begins to normalize. 
As John noted, segment comparisons to the prior year are difficult because of the pandemic. But I would like to point out an item for consideration on the year-over-year comparisons for salaries and wages. COVID costs in the second quarter decreased nearly $10 million from the prior year quarter, which was primarily due to a reduction in PTO for employees needing to quarantine. However, as we called out in the release, this reduction was meaningfully offset by increases across all pay items for both drivers and nondriver employees. The impact of the reopening on salaries and wages is widespread, and we see challenges in this area continuing because of the importance of attracting and retaining our people. 
This concludes my remarks. And I will now turn it over to Shelley."
278576,1672742951,2351980,"J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2021",2021-07-19,"Earnings Calls","J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John, and good afternoon. My commercial update will focus on general market conditions, our expectations and plan for our customers' peak season capacity needs as well as an update on the progress we are making as an organization with our J.B.",822,"Thank you, John, and good afternoon. My commercial update will focus on general market conditions, our expectations and plan for our customers' peak season capacity needs as well as an update on the progress we are making as an organization with our J.B. Hunt 360 multimodal digital freight platform. 
As we discussed last quarter, we entered 2021 with cautious optimism about the opportunities the market could present to us during the year. Now that the year is just halfway over, clearly, the opportunities are bountiful but so too are the challenges. Demand for our capacity solutions across the scroll of services remains at elevated levels. Capacity across the supply chain remains tight, and challenges around velocity and fluidity are still very present and likely to persist at least through the end of the year. 
As an organization, we are committed to working with our customers to address these challenges together and have plans in place to provide even greater assistance as we approach peak. And that, I'll speak to next. The result of the current market conditions is that demand for our trucks, containers and trailers far exceeds our capacity to serve. Thankfully, our ability to provide value to our customers is no longer limited by our physical assets as the power of our people and our platform allows us to source the most efficient capacity for and on behalf of our customers. 
This dynamic is evident across all of our business segments that we will be discussing during our prepared remarks. 
As we approach bid season and peak season, we are taking a collaborative approach with our customers to ensure that we have an actionable plan to provide the capacity solutions to meet their needs. One of our biggest challenges this year, which got even worse during the second quarter, was the detention of our trailing equipment by customers across both our intermodal and truck segments. We are addressing these issues with our customers through direct conversations and accessorial charges, and in some instances, we are restricting capacity to certain customer locations. To be clear, we did not implement or augment new accessorial programs with the intent of increasing the cost of our customers. Our intent was to provide the appropriate incentive to our customers to encourage the improvements needed to be able to turn our equipment efficiently. This improvement will afford us to deliver more value to our customers by being able to provide additional capacity. 
To wrap up my comments on our plan for peak season, we remain very confident in our ability to execute on the plans we are developing with our customers. Our capacity and ability to service our customers will be determined by our performance around 3 key items: first, the onboarding of equipment orders we discussed last quarter but specifically the containers for JBI and trailers for 360box; second, improvements in rail fluidity and velocity; and third, improvements in customer detention or dwell time. Progress on these fronts will go a long way in meeting and exceeding customer expectations. 
Shifting gears to our J.B. Hunt 360 platform, we continue to see solid and record-breaking trends around user activity, engagement and growth across both our carrier and shipper platforms. This is evidenced by our organization serving the largest number of unique customers in our history during the quarter, a tall task considering the supply limitations and restrictions that typically exist in a market like we are experiencing currently. 
We believe we are continuing to build momentum as both carriers and shippers see the value in optimizing and transacting in our system in real time in an improving frictionless digital process. Going forward, our focus remains on improving access, visibility and transparency across the supply chain, which we believe sets us up to achieve our mission statement: To create the most efficient transportation network in North America. 
In closing, as I look across our organization, I remain extremely proud and excited for all the opportunities we have to solve for our customers' needs. I believe we are in a unique position to leverage our people, assets, technology, and maybe most important, our experience in bringing those elements together. I'd like to think of that as our scroll. And the power of the J.B. Hunt scroll is strong as customers continue to lean in to us to help them solve for their needs. 
Finally, as previously disclosed, I've been given the responsibility of the role of EVP for People and Human Resources. Last quarter, I discussed how encouraged I was about the progress we are making on enhancing our inclusive culture, and our belief that our organization could lead in this area. As an update, I want to share that we have hired our first Vice President of Inclusion during the quarter. We are excited about our journey ahead and the incredible progress we can make in this area. 
I'd now like to turn it over to Nick."

I'm going to spend my time giving a brief operational update focused on the current driver market and some other processes we are reviewing, in addition to providing some greater detail on the performance",807,"Thank you, Shelley, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to spend my time giving a brief operational update focused on the current driver market and some other processes we are reviewing, in addition to providing some greater detail on the performance of DCS and Final Mile Services in the quarter. 
I'll start with some quick thoughts from our operational perspective focused on the current state of the driver market in addition to our current review of some of our processes. Consistent with my comments from last quarter, the driver market remains as challenged as I've seen in my 37-year career. As you will hear from Darren's comments in a few moments, we believe the availability of labor is having a meaningful impact across almost every part of the supply chain, ranging from the ports to rail terminal operations, warehouse operations and certainly over-the-road driver market. 
While we continue to believe we are in a relatively solid position with some of the best paying and highest quality jobs in the market with over 90% of our jobs being either local or regional in our dedicated intermodal dray, truck and Final Mile operations, the truth is we are not immune to the industry's driver challenges. We continue to make adjustments, and are experiencing inflationary cost pressures with driver wages and benefits in addition to experiencing elevated driver hiring and recruiting costs across all businesses. 
To close up on my operational comments, I want to provide a brief update that I'm leading our efforts to review each of our vendors and suppliers to make sure we are properly aligned across our operational and sustainability goals, while also ensuring we are receiving the best value for our entire organization. 
Now let me shift my comments to focus on the performance of Final Mile Services. Final Mile was able to continue its streak of strong performance with revenue growth of 52% in the quarter. Operating income was $10.7 million. But as disclosed in our press release, it did benefit from $3.2 million net settlement of claims in the quarter. Demand for our services across Final Mile remains strong, particularly across our big and bulky home delivery and fulfillment services. That said, availability of inventory, particularly across the appliance and furniture categories, is tempering what would otherwise be even stronger demand for our services. 
Going forward, we're going to remain encouraged by the onboarding of new business as the year progresses and more importantly, remain encouraged about our pipelines' both organic and inorganic growth opportunities over the long term. As we continue to focus on the growth and scaling of the business, we will remain committed to protecting and investing in our service product and customer experience for and on behalf of our customers. 
I'll close with some comments on results in DCS. Our backlog and pipeline for new dedicated private fleet start-ups is as strong as our company has ever seen. By the end of June, we will have added 555 trucks to the fleet from the end of the prior quarter, which is the third highest truck adds we've had in any single quarter. I am pleased that we are able to onboard not only a significant amount of new accounts but also across a diverse group of industries, all while continuing to perform within our newly established long-term margin target range of 12% to 14%. 
We saw 17% growth in revenue driven by a 5% growth in our average fleet count year-over-year in addition to better productivity, defined as revenue per truck per week, which was supported by contractual annual price escalators and the decline of idled equipment from prior year levels. Additionally, with regards to productivity, in many locations across our network, we have been able to get additional funding to support the needed investment in driver wages in order to maintain performance standards and maintain our competitiveness in certain markets. 
While we have strong momentum with our sales and operational efforts, we think it is important to recognize that driver and equipment availability, in addition to the ability of trained and experienced account managers, is moderately governing our ability to grow faster. Operating income was down 5% year-over-year as tailwinds in the prior year related to lower driver turnover, travel and entertainment expense and lack of start-ups have returned as anticipated in addition to higher personnel costs in the current quarter. Importantly, we believe our investments to grow the business will help us carry momentum well into 2022 and beyond. 
To round out my DCS comments, we ended the second quarter selling approximately 1,165 trucks year-to-date. Given our prior guidance to sell 800 to 1,000 for the year, I believe it's safe for you to assume that we will exceed our targets for the full year. 
That concludes my remarks, so I'll turn it over to Brad Hicks."

My comments today will focus on the performance of our highway services -- highway service business during the quarter, which includes both Integrated Capacity Solutions, or ICS, and truck or JBT. Let me start off by",611,"Thank you, Nick, and good afternoon. My comments today will focus on the performance of our highway services -- highway service business during the quarter, which includes both Integrated Capacity Solutions, or ICS, and truck or JBT. 
Let me start off by saying how excited I am to see our team respond to the opportunities our customers present us with to deliver both truck and trailing capacity solutions to serve their needs. These capacity solutions were enabled by our multimodal digital freight platform, J.B. Hunt 360, and complemented by our drop-trailer pools with 360box. Additionally, these capacity solutions across highway services continues to provide value for our customers as evidenced by this most recent performance being the third quarter in a row in which both ICS and JBT delivered the strongest growth within our organization. This continues to support our decisions to focus our investments on our people and technology, which is driving further scale across the platform and our organization. 
I'll start with my comments on JBT or our Truck segment. Revenue grew 70% to $184 million, which is the highest revenue this segment has delivered since the second quarter of 2008. Operating income was $14 million, which was the highest second quarter level achieved by the segment since 2007. Our growth and performance continues to be driven by our ability to provide capacity solutions with or without our physical trucking assets but with our trailing assets. Our ability to solve for the most efficient way a load should move by finding the right carrier at the right time and at the right price is what continues to drive strong demand for our 360box product. More importantly, our ability to access capacity quickly has allowed us to be able to tell our customers yes. 
As we have discussed in prior calls, we continue to see the business shifting to a more asset-light model and we'll remain focused on investing and scaling our service offering while staying focused on generating adequate returns on our investment. This will require a focus on balancing our growth with network efficiencies as we scale in the future. 
Next, on ICS. The segment delivered $608 million of revenue, which broke our previous record set in the fourth quarter just last year. Revenue grew 100% versus the prior year period. Segment volumes grew 20% within the quarter, while specifically, truckload volume growth was up 30%. 
Market dynamics remain challenged as freight demand strengthened from already elevated levels, while capacity remained constrained across the country, the result of which put seasonal pressure on net revenue margins, which was consistent with our expectation. We continue to see solid trends with our carrier and shipper engagement on the 360 platform, and remain encouraged by the productivity we are seeing with our people, all of which is enabled by our investments in both our people and technology. We continue to see opportunities to invest in our 3 critical areas: our people, our technology and scaling the platform, and remain committed to these investments. 
In closing, our performance this quarter in ICS and JBT aligned with one of our key objectives, which is to grow volume and gain market share by leveraging our platform and using data to help our customers make the best decisions and deliver value to their supply chains. We do this by eliminating waste in the system and creating a frictionless way to access vast amounts of capacity across a multimodal digital freight platform. We remain excited about our opportunity to deliver our capacity solutions to our customers across our highway service businesses well into the future. 
That concludes my comments, so I'll pass it over to Darren."

My comments this afternoon will focus on Intermodal's performance during the quarter. I will also provide some additional details on network operations, including the onboarding of new containers, and how we are working to improve velocity and in turn capacity in our network for and on behalf of our customers as we approach peak season. 
Demand for our intermodal capacity remains robust. In fact, demand continues to significantly outpace our available capacity, which remains constrained by rail performance and restrictions in addition to customer detention of our trailing equipment. We continue to believe that the origin of these challenges center on the availability of labor for both the railroads, particularly in their terminals, and our customers in their warehouse operations. 
Volumes in the quarter increased 6%, broken down by month as plus 17% in April, plus 8% in May and minus 6% in June. As we discussed a year ago, June 2020 was a particularly strong month for us as we had equipment properly positioned for the surge in demand as the activity across the supply chain restarted. 
Network velocity continues to be well below our expectations as evidenced by our box turns, which were approximately 1.65 turns per month during the quarter. We are working very closely with our rail providers and customers to improve our capacity across the network by focusing on reducing the detention of equipment and helping our rail providers reduce congestion across their terminal infrastructure. Going forward, the onboarding of our new equipment will also assist us in serving our customers' capacity needs, particularly as we approach peak season. 
On that front, we began taking delivery of our new equipment in the last few weeks and have even more on the water as we speak. We expect a steady flow of equipment into the West Coast at this point moving forward, which is now likely to stretch into early 2022. 
At this time, we are through the majority of repricing efforts for this latest bid season and rates came in at the higher end of our earlier expectation, which our original expectations were for high-single to low double-digit increases. By the end of the quarter, about 70% of the volume had current bid cycle rates and we expect the remaining 30% of the business yet to reprice to implement in Q3. Inflationary cost pressures continue to present themselves in the way of driver wages and recruitment costs in addition to the cost of equipment ownership, particularly as utilization levels remain challenged by both the rail and customer activity previously discussed. We believe we have put in place the right pricing structure and programs that protect our necessity to generate an adequate return on our significant investment in our people and our equipment even if box turns remain challenged due to events outside of our control. 
As we approach peak season, it is clear that our customers continue to want to lean into us for more capacity, and we feel very confident in our ability to execute our plan. Customers value our intermodal service offering as it continues to be a very cost-effective alternative to truck, and even more so now due to rapidly rising driver wages and fuel prices but also because of the environmental benefits of intermodal as its carbon intensity is 60% lower than the truck alternative. Going forward, we will continue to prioritize delivering value to our customers, generating appropriate returns in our business, reinvesting to meet their future capacity needs and keeping us on a path toward long-term sustainable growth. That concludes my prepared comments."

We also highlighted that we feel like of the 12,000 we announced at the first quarter earnings call, some of those will certainly filter into the early stages of '22. The team is working every day to continue to receive more containers as we move into the fourth quarter. But for now, we can highlight 3,000 to 4,000 in Q3.
I think that on the velocity front, we're working with customers to find ways to free up the equipment faster. That's certainly an ongoing effort. And then the railroads, the key there is getting faster velocity out of the rail system. And we're aligned with all of our rail providers on their mission to improve their velocity. And so that is an expectation of ours during the quarter. If you're asking for specifics, we highlighted 1.65 turns in the second quarter. We think that can improve somewhat to slightly in the third quarter, but not yet ready to believe it's going to be a real material impact at this stage."

We've obviously had some updates from the Rail Union Pacific shutdown eastbound movements to their global 4 terminal. I think BM has also started to meter space on its own intermodal trains at least through the end of this month. Can you just help us think about what the volume impact is, a little bit similar to the last question, in terms of what the headwind this may be as you move from the second quarter to third quarter?
And then you've been really helpful in the past about talking about maybe the margin progression expectations and you've been bang on in terms of sequential margin improvement as the pricing further gets implemented. You guys have shown good drop-through in the intermodal on the incremental revenue growth, at least sequentially as some of the pricing comes through. Should that just be a continuation into the third quarter as that 30% gets repriced? What's the right expectation around margins? If you can just answer those 2 questions."

The thing on the restrictions that you've heard from UMP is those are -- well, we don't operate on Union Pacific but it's largely understood to be international only. So there's not a lot of impact to us on domestic volumes. And BNSF and J.B. Hunt are working really well together every day in an effort to expand our capacity and improve velocity. And everything we can do to create fluidity at the terminals in order to help provide that, we're doing that and working with our customers on scheduling. We're draying loads out of the terminals. We're doing a tremendous amount of work in order to improve fluidity.
So when you're hearing some of that restriction information, sometimes it's more international focused than it is domestic. We have some energy from that as I think the international supply chain has been one of the more significant drags on productivity for the various rail terminals and certainly if they can be focused on eliminating some of the congestion from international in order to free up capacity for domestic, we would certainly stand to have some benefit from that. I'm not saying that's what they're doing, but certainly the announcement from UMP was focused on international only."

So during the third quarter, demand was so strong. No, we didn't have equipment really positioned strongly. So that was back to the need to really reposition the equipment, which drove a lot of the velocity challenges that we certainly had a year ago.
On the margin front, it's a range because a lot of factors influence that. Certainly, can we achieve it? It really depends on some of the cost challenges. And at this point, there's no let-up on challenges for recruiting and hiring and retaining drivers. There's no let-up on the cost to outsource capacity, our need to secure capacity in order to dray loads out of the terminal.

And so really allowing us to use that frictionless digital platform externally and connecting that with people where we really need to be problem-solvers on behalf of our customers and our carriers. And so we've made improvements there. We do still have improvements left that need to occur in our 5-year modeling.
And then certainly, in the scaling piece, our gross margins as a percentage, those numbers, we still believe that we will continue to find the right truck at the right time at the right price that will allow us to continue to expand margins inside that overall."

I'll take the customer side, and then I'll turn it over to John on the last part of the question. The disruption that occurred in 2020 has continued all the way through today, and we believe will continue through the rest of this year and into next year. Our customers do have a displacement happening from an inventory perspective. And have heard our customers say they moved from being -- ordering from a need-by date to a when-can-you-get-it-to-me date. And so there is inventory in the supply chain today that has already been delivered that typically would not be there. So there has been some pull-forward. I think it's just been based on a lot of the disruption that's happened, particularly in the global supply chain. So that has caused kind of the upstream issues that are now hitting in the U.S. as well, and then certainly we know the problems that are occurring across every part of the supply chain and delivering goods for our customers.
I would say our customers, from a demand perspective, believe that the rest of this year will be strong into next year as well. And finally, I would say peak season, we are doing a ton of peak planning. I talked about that on the last earnings call. We are doing that again now. And we're really doing that comprehensively across all of our 5 segments.

The third quarter continued to present the momentum we spoke of during our last earnings call. We also see persistent irregularities in demand patterns substantially resulting from poor labor and inventory challenges with our customers. The key inbound port locations has further challenged the desired smoothing of supply chains [indiscernible] for the upcoming holiday season. We find that the dialogue with our customers reveals both a challenged labor mark and a pent-up need to increase the in-stock across the system.  Planned additions to our container and trailing fleets and the expansion in contract services, both Final Mile and Dedicated should all contribute positively as these headwinds abate. 
The company is not insulated from the labor dynamics mentioned above for our customers. This year, we have reached all-time highs in the need for company drivers in all locations as well as openings we have on our office and seal teams. We have done comprehensive and exhaustive research on our current compensation and benefits programs along with our incentive plans to help better position our jobs going forward. Progress in closing the gaps for both driver and non-driver positions has been made during the quarter, and we are optimistic these gaps will continue to shrink for us. 
As our executives will address today, we're generally pleased with the performance of all segments. However, we do have ample room for improvement with the inventory flows and contractor model in our Final Mile business as well as in the utilization of equipment in Intermodal. Even with these opportunities, we see our supply chain focused service is well positioned and healthy for the long-term needs of our customers. We are also encouraged by the continued progress we see in the utilization of our 360 platforms and the productivity gains resulting from expanded usage across the company with our carriers and with our shippers. The past few weeks have returned us to the annual tradition of honoring our multimillion mile drivers, who over many years, accomplished the pinnacle of our profession. And [indiscernible] we have posted 2 sessions for a total of over 100 drivers reaching between 2 million and 5 million safe miles along with their families for a 2-day celebration with our entire corporate team.

I'll start by providing a couple of comments on our third quarter of 2021 from a consolidated perspective. Overall, we're pleased with our revenue growth of the prior year, which was up 27% and the result of improvements in all segments. Our operating income increased 56% with mixed results from some segments that are the result of cost pressures from labor issues, but also due to the significant growth in implementing new contractual businesses that will be addressed in the segment discussions. 
Interest expense was consistent with prior year, and we had a slight increase in our tax rate, resulting in earnings per share of $1.88 for the quarter, which is an increase of nearly 60% over the prior year. The impacts of labor shortages, network congestion and just general supply chain challenges are well known, and they persisted in the quarter, again, straining our ability to service the demand and effectively utilize our assets, similar to what we experienced in the second quarter. 
The digital cost pressures in the quarter were primarily related to higher purchase transportation costs or employee costs of incentive compensation and medical benefits. We ended the quarter with approximately $530 million in cash. At the beginning of the year, we had announced a heavy investment in equipment for 2021. While all orders remain in place, the constraints noted have limited our ability to in service this equipment. Through unconventional means, including leasing our own private vessels, we are able to add just shy of 3,000 JBI containers and over 900 JBT trailers during the quarter as well as having success in sourcing our tractor needs as a result of solid relationships with our equipment manufacturers. Considering these constraints, we are adjusting our expected CapEx spend for the remainder of 2021 and now expect our CapEx to approximate a little over $1 billion for the full year. 
We remain committed to obtaining capacity to serve our customers and continue our focus on obtaining the equipment order. While we haven't finalized plans for 2022 yet, our initial expectations are for CapEx to exceed 2021 levels but will depend largely on the ability and timing to obtaining the equipment. We purchased $50 million of our shares in the third quarter, bringing us to $135 million for the year and anticipate continuing buybacks on a more regular basis. We will continue to balance our cash outlay on equipment, dividends and buybacks for the remainder of the year as opportunities unfold, trending towards our targeted 1x EBITDA leverage metric on a net basis. 
In recent quarters, we have updated you on costs directly related to COVID, which have principally been in the form of special bonuses for frontline employees and PTO for employees need to quarantine. While we still incur these costs, we have now lapped quarters of providing this, and as such, there are no meaningful reconciliations to the prior year quarter. We continue to monitor the impacts of COVID focusing on the health and safety of our people while staying informed of state and federal mandates around vaccinations and other protocols. This concludes my remarks, and I'll now turn it over to Shelley."

My commercial update will focus on general market conditions, our updated thoughts around peak season and our preliminary planning for 2022. I will also give some updated thoughts on the progress we are making inside our J.B. Hunt 360 multimodal digital freight platform. We continue to see plenty of opportunities in the market to provide valuable services for customers meeting comprehensive supply chain solutions. While fluidity across the supply chain remains challenging, we are working closely with our customers to develop and execute plans that get their freight delivered. We believe our ability to source capacity on the J.B. Hunt 360 platform continues to differentiate us and our go-to-market strategy and ensure customers find the most efficient way to move their freight. 
Capacity remains tight across all channels as evidenced by elevated spot and contract rates across all modes of transportation. Further adding to fluidity challenges is the backlog of freight off the West Coast waiting to get unloaded at the ports. We share in these frustrations and are not immune to these impacts, as some of our containers are also sitting out in the Pacific waiting to be unloaded. While peak season is upon us, we believe the bottlenecks in the West are going to compact and even intensify further peak season capacity needs into November and December and are preparing ourselves accordingly. 
As we think about planning for 2022, we will turn our attention to leveraging our people, technology and equipment to not only optimize our customers' freight, but even more important, optimize their freight spend. Freight is moving inefficiently today at elevated truck and spot rates, which will be ripe for conversion to Intermodal when we also have the full onboarding of our 12,000 new intermodal containers. While we remain focused on executing our peak season plans, we are also focused on positioning our customers to deliver on their budget for 2022 with the most efficient and cost-effective solution available. And again, we stand ready to meet the needs of our customers as we enter the new year. 
We continue to be extremely encouraged by the trends we are seeing in our J.B. Hunt 360 multimodal digital freight platform. Carrier and shipper user activity and engagement metrics continue to accelerate, providing further evidence in the value of being able to optimize and transact in real time and a more frictionless process. With regards to automation, we have completed the pilot of some of our automated tools for marketplace between shippers and carriers and have begun us thoughtfully paste rollout of the system to our personnel in the field. We expect to see additional productivity and service quality benefits over the next year as the system is fully rolled out and utilized. 
As we move forward, we remain focused on improving access, visibility and transparency on our platform, which we believe sets us up to achieve your mission statement to create the most efficient transportation network in North America. 
Closing out my comments and similar to message I shared with you last quarter, I remain extremely encouraged about our position to leverage our people, access and technology to help our customers through their supply chain challenges. Those attributes combined with our experience, tenured workforce and broad and expanding scroll of services is what I believe differentiates us in the market and why I believe customers continue to lean into us during these challenging times. 
That concludes my comments, and I'd now like to turn it over to Nick."

I will focus my comments on the performance of both our Dedicated Contract Service business or DCS and the Final Mile Service businesses, FMS. I'll also provide you an update from a general operational perspective on both the driver market as well as our ability to source equipment. 
In our Dedicated business, we continue to see tremendous demand for our professionally outsourced fleet solutions. Propelled by the current market dynamics around driver and equipment availability, our backlog and pipeline remains strong. I am extremely proud of the team's ability to execute this quarter, highlighted by the addition of 744 trucks in the quarter. This is the largest number of truck adds in any single quarter. As historically is the case, start-up costs did put pressure on margins in the quarter as we incurred costs before we begin to recognize revenue. But let me be clear,  we are extremely pleased with [indiscernible] as it sets the stage for solid growth and momentum as we roll forward. The new business we have been onboarding represent a broad and diverse mix of customer accounts across both industry verticals and geographies. While we in the industry are facing driver recruitment challenges, customers in most instances have been willing to support our out-of-cycle adjustments to support higher wages for our professional workforce. 
As I alluded to earlier, we continue to see strong demand for our service. And as an update, we have sold 1,899 trucks year-to-date as of September 30 on incrementals of 134 trucks from my last update on our second quarter call. 
Now transitioning to our Final Mile Services update. We see solid growth opportunities in this market that is and will be supported by our ability to differentiate our service product. As a result, we continue to make investments in our people and processes to support our growth outlook.  Relative to some of our recent quarters, profitability was pressured as a result of several factors. 
Similar to Dedicated, we priced start-up costs for the quarter, given the smaller base of business that had a disproportionate impact on our results. Additionally, our contract carriers are also facing labor challenges particularly for the second set in the delivery trucks in addition to those at our customer warehouses. 
Finally, and as we discussed last quarter, supply chain issues are impacting product availability, and in turn, our ability to leverage our network to deliver goods, potentially in the appliance and furniture categories. We believe these challenges are mostly transitory. Going forward, we are encouraged by the new business we are onboarding, and we are on pace for a record new year of sales. We continue to see a solid pipeline of growth opportunities that we plan to capitalize on in the future. Our success will be largely dependent on our ability to differentiate the service experience for our customers' customers, and we remain committed to making the needed investments to achieve that differentiation. 
Finally, to close on some general operational updates, we have been extremely focused on our hires in the field to support our growth. As we have discussed in past quarters, we believe this offers one of the most attractive driving opportunities given the concentration of work in both local and regional applications, combined with top pay and career advancement opportunities. This is also true for our field managers and operations personnel. We have continued to make adjustments to wages and benefits to make our company even more attractive doses seeking a rewarding employment opportunity. Additionally, we have been working closely with our equipment providers in order to support our growth. We have had to hold trades of some of our equipment to support our pipeline, continue to stay attentive to both maintenance cost and fuel economy as a result. That concludes my remarks, so I'll turn it over to Brad."

I will focus my comments on the performance of Integrated Capacity Solutions and trucks. I'd like to start off by recognizing all members of our ICS and JBT segments for how they continue to respond in the current cement to elevated demand trends. Our customers continue to present us with opportunities to deliver both truck and trailing capacity solutions, and the team continues to respond very well in these demanding types. The experience of our people, and our technology platform and our physical assets continues to provide us opportunities to source and provide capacity for customers in what continues to be an extremely capacity constrained environment. The ability to service capacity has enabled by our technology investments into our JBT 360 platform and is complemented by our drop trailer pools with 360box. We continue to invest in these areas as well as in our people to provide more solutions from our customers. 
I'll start with my comments on truck or JBT. Revenue grew 87% year-over-year to $204 million. This is the first quarter that the JBT segment has generated over $200 million of revenue since 2007, and we were able to accomplish this with approximately 60% fewer trucks versus that period. This is yet another example of our organization's focus on providing value-added solutions for customers while maintaining our focus on scaling into large addressable markets with our desire for adequate returns on our capital. We believe our drop trailer capacity or 360box is the power-only capacity sourced through our platform provides us an opportunity for sustainable growth. Our trailing capacity increased 20% versus the prior year and 11% from the end of the second quarter, and the segment generated $14.7 million of operating income, the highest of any third quarter since 2006. 
Going forward, we will continue to stay disciplined on our desire to grow while also focusing on driving greater network efficiencies, particularly in our drop trailer network. Shifting gears to Integrated Capacity Solutions, or our ICS segment. ICS delivered $666 million of revenue, breaking our prior quarterly record achieved just last quarter. 
Revenue grew 55% versus the prior year period. Segment volumes grew 4% in the quarter, while truckload volume growth was 14% year-over-year. The cost of sourcing third-party capacity remains elevated, which is a continuation of the same trends we have seen through the latter parts of 2020 and all of 2021. That said, gross margins did expand 150 basis points sequentially as a result of further scaling of our products, implementation of higher contractual rates and robust [indiscernible] We believe that in the fourth quarter as congestion across the supply chain is likely to compress, the timing of peak season and intensified customer needs for capacity solutions right up to the holidays. 
Going forward, we will continue to invest to expand the capabilities and functions of our multimodal digital freight platform for our carriers and customers as well as for our people to drive greater productivity and efficiency and sourcing cost-effective solutions for our customers while giving carriers great visibility to the freight on our platform. 
In closing, we continue to see solid momentum across our JBT and ICS segments as evidenced by both segments delivering the strongest top line growth across our scroll of services for the fourth [indiscernible] while  but along the way, we will remain committed to our investments and our people and our technology platform that will drive waste out of the system and help us deliver on our mission to create the most efficient transportation network in North America. This concludes my comments. I'll pass it over to Darren."

I'm going to focus my comments on 3 items related to our Intermodal business. First, I'm going to review performance in the quarter; I will also discuss network fluidity and our continuing and [indiscernible] -- and finally, I will discuss continued investment in both people and the onboarding of our trailing capacity that we think is going to [indiscernible] for our services further the truck to rail conversion opportunities. 
While demand for our Intermodal services remains very strong, our volume performance in the quarter doesn't reflect that as fluidity challenges across our network continue to temper available capacity to serve that demand. As we discussed last quarter, we believe the core challenges around network fluidity for both our rail providers and customers center around availability of labor and has continued to provide challenges across the entire supply chain. Volumes for the quarter were down 6% and by a month, volume was down 7% in July, down, 6% in August and down over [ 60-plus ] [indiscernible] improvement particularly and [indiscernible] quicker turns of our equipment at customer locations, combined with the onboarding of the new containers would and will help us provide additional capacity. 
As we discussed last quarter, we implemented programs with our customers to encourage better utilization of our equipment while protecting our need to generate appropriate returns on our significant value and equipment to support additional capacity. Importantly, these programs are designed to provide the benefit of additional capacity that results from gained efficiencies. I would say that the results from this program thus far have been mixed. We have some customer locations improve, while other locations have deteriorated even in instances within the same customers footprint. I would also say, from our perspective, the results of the program have been mixed based simply on the fact that we would absolutely prefer to move more volume and provide more capacity for customers, which was not the case in the quarter. 
I believe this highlights the severity of the labor challenges across the supply chain.  Box turns in the quarter fell sequentially to 1.62 versus 1.65 in the prior quarter, further supporting that view. We continue to be optimistic about the opportunities for long-term sustainable growth in our Intermodal business. Customer demand continues to grow, and our rail providers continue to view us as a solution to the current congestion challenges that are even more severe in the international intermodal market. owning our own equipment, including power, trailing and chassis and our highly skilled driver and operations personnel are differentiated in the market, particularly around fluidity and service. 
This is further supported by our J.B. Hunt 360 platform that allows us to source capacity when rail congestion or restrictions hamper our ability to serve. In closing, Intermodal's value proposition remains strong as driver and labor challenges continue to plague the supply chain combined with higher energy prices and the fact that an intermodal shipment on average is 60% less carbon intensive than the all-truck alternative. We will continue to make investments to support the meaningful growth opportunities in the market. We expect to take delivery of our entire 12,000 [indiscernible] 2022, setting us up to provide meaningful savings for our customers as we begin the next bid cycle. That concludes my prepared comments."

That's always going to drive our pricing decisions as we're focused on the returns of the investments we put into place. 
Certainly, the container order for 12,000 that we announced earlier this year, we'll continue to onboard that equipment as fast as we can get it here. Decisions about advancing the equipment next year will continue we finalize plans for next year. And frankly, as we continue to work with customers and see what's happening in the market relative to demand velocity improvements that are really available to our customer base to achieve savings not only in what their intermodal experience be, but converting more business off the highway at better pricing to truckload can really produce an awful lot of capacity if we can just improve the velocity of the current fleet. All that being said, if we see an opportunity to expand our equipment and the customers are supporting that with pricing, then I have no doubt our organization will set a path to do that, but we have a long way to go before a decision is made on that."

If you think about the advantages we can give at the railroads and our customers really is around our operations as we control really the 3 critical components: the chassis, the driver and the container. Our ability to create a very fluid network at the destination is very different than what happens today from an international perspective. 
And when there are constrained, that allows us to think about and process differently there. The second one is in over-the-road conversions to which I did talk about that in my opening remarks, but we do see a high percentage of shipments that are moving on rail today. Part of that are our intentional strategy to own any lane that moves intermodal in our highway space. And so we're gaining access and information through our J.B. Hunt 360 multimodal digital freight platform, to be able to know what we can and should talk to our customers about converting. So that's going to be a big focus for us as we come through the rest of this fourth quarter, very focused on peak and helping our customers be successful. We also are working closely with them to determine the price that's moving on the highway today that we know to move into Intermodal. So I would tell you, those 12,000 boxes I have high confidence in. To lower at good quality revenue. And I think, to earlier question around what we would add would really be dependent on what our customers can do from a fluidity perspective on turning in equipment."

There's still a lot of demand for our services and our pipeline is very, very full.  On the Dedicated and on the Final Mile side. 
And then on the Final Mile side, it's got a smaller base. And so the start-ups are really dramatically impacting that. Because contractor rates are up and we're just seeing a lot of warehouse labor rates up as well. So we're getting a lot of costs in there.

And some of that is contributing to elongated needs. But I do believe as we go moving forward, you'll look to see more published balance."

So I think that's really important. If I go to your question around automation, we think of JBH 360 has a full ecosystem that helps connect our customers, carriers and our people to that. So our automation is intended to across those 3 groups that are interconnected in the platform, the current automation is intended for our people. And so that's really connecting our shippers 360 internally for our people and our new system.

The third quarter continued to present the momentum we spoke of during our last earnings call. We also see persistent irregularities in demand patterns substantially resulting from port, labor and inventory challenges with our customers. The congestion at key inbound port locations has further challenged the desired smoothing of supply chains in preparation for the upcoming holiday season. We find that the dialogue with our key customers reveals both a challenged labor market and a pent-up need to increase the in-stock levels across the system.  Planned additions to our container and trailing fleets and the expansion in contract services, both final mile and dedicated, should all contribute positively as these headwinds abate. 
The company is not insulated from the labor dynamics mentioned above for our customers. This year, we have reached all-time highs in the need for company drivers in all segments as well as openings we have on our office and field teams. We have done comprehensive and exhaustive research on our current compensation and benefits programs along with our incentive plans to help better position our jobs going forward. Progress in closing the gaps for both driver and non-driver positions has been made during the quarter, and we are optimistic these gaps will continue to shrink for us. 
As our executives will discuss today, we're generally pleased with the performance of all segments. However, we do have ample room for improvement with the inventory flows and contractor model in our Final Mile business as well as in the utilization of equipment in Intermodal. Even with these opportunities, we see our supply chain-focused service is well positioned and healthy for the long-term needs of our customers. 
We are also encouraged by the continued progress we see in the utilization of our 360 platforms and the productivity gains resulting from expanded usage across the company with our carriers and with our shippers. The past few weeks have returned us to the annual tradition of honoring our multimillion mile drivers, who over many years, accomplished the pinnacle of our profession. In Lowell, we have hosted 2 sessions for a total of over 100 drivers reaching between 2 million and 5 million safe miles along with their families for a 2-day celebration with our entire corporate team. We have been extremely careful to host these sessions following CDC guidelines. 
Nevertheless, it has done all of us a world of good to see our very best in person again. The energy has been contagious, and I assure that it will carry us forward nicely.

Staying consistent with recent quarters, I'll start by providing a couple of comments on our third quarter of 2021 from a consolidated perspective. Overall, we are pleased with our revenue growth over the prior year, which was up 27% from the result of improvements in all segments. Our operating income increased 56% with mixed results from some segments that are the result of cost pressures from labor issues, but also due to the significant growth in implementing new contractual businesses that will be addressed in the segment discussions. 
Interest expense was consistent with prior year, and we had a slight increase in our tax rate, resulting in earnings per share of $1.88 for the quarter, which is an increase of nearly 60% over the prior year. The impacts of labor shortages, network congestion and just general supply chain challenges are well known, and they persisted in the quarter, again, straining our ability to service the demand and effectively utilize our assets, similar to what we experienced in the second quarter. 
Additional cost pressures in the quarter were primarily related to higher purchase transportation costs and other employee costs of incentive compensation and medical benefits. We ended the quarter with approximately $530 million in cash. At the beginning of the year, we had announced a heavy investment in equipment for 2021. While all orders remain in place, the constraints noted have limited our ability to in-service this equipment. Through unconventional means, including leasing our own private vessels, we are able to add just shy of 3,000 JBI containers and over 900 JBT trailers during the quarter as well as having success in sourcing our tractor needs as a result of solid relationships with our equipment manufacturers. Considering these constraints, we are adjusting our expected CapEx spend for the remainder of 2021 and now expect our CapEx to approximate a little over $1 billion for the full year. 
We remain committed to obtaining capacity to serve our customers and continue our focus on obtaining the equipment ordered. While we haven't finalized plans for 2022 yet, our initial expectations are for CapEx to exceed 2021 levels but will depend largely on the ability and timing to obtaining the equipment. We purchased $50 million of our shares in the third quarter, bringing us to $135 million for the year and anticipate continuing buybacks on a more regular basis. We will continue to balance our cash outlay on equipment, dividends and buybacks for the remainder of the year as opportunities unfold, trending towards our targeted 1x EBITDA leverage metric on a net basis. 
In recent quarters, we have updated you on costs directly related to COVID, which have principally been in the form of special bonuses for frontline employees and PTO for employees who need to quarantine. While we still incur these costs, we have now lapped quarters of providing this, and as such, there are no meaningful reconciliations to the prior year quarter. We continue to monitor the impacts of COVID, focusing on the health and safety of our people while staying informed of state and federal mandates around vaccinations and other protocols. This concludes my remarks, and I'll now turn it over to Shelley."

My commercial update will focus on general market conditions, our updated thoughts around peak season and our preliminary planning for 2022. I will also give some updated thoughts on the progress we are making inside our J.B. Hunt 360 multimodal digital freight platform. We continue to see plenty of opportunities in the market to provide valuable services for customers needing comprehensive supply chain solutions. While fluidity across the supply chain remains challenging, we are working closely with our customers to develop and execute plans that get their freight delivered. We believe our ability to source capacity on the J.B. Hunt 360 platform continues to differentiate us and our go-to-market strategy and ensure customers find the most efficient way to move their freight. 
Capacity remains tight across all channels as evidenced by elevated spot and contract rates across all modes of transportation. Further adding to fluidity challenges is the backlog of freight off the West Coast waiting to get unloaded at the ports. We share in these frustrations and are not immune to these impacts, as some of our containers are also sitting out in the Pacific waiting to be unloaded. While peak season is upon us, we believe the bottlenecks in the West Coast are going to compact and even intensify further peak season capacity needs into November and December and are preparing ourselves accordingly. 
As we think about planning for 2022, we will turn our attention to leveraging our people, technology and equipment to not only optimize our customers' freight, but even more important, optimize their freight spend. Freight is moving inefficiently today at elevated truck and spot rates, which will be ripe for conversion to Intermodal when we also have the full onboarding of our 12,000 new intermodal containers. While we remain focused on executing our peak season plans, we are also focused on positioning our customers to deliver on their budget for 2022 with the most efficient and cost-effective solution available. And again, we stand ready to meet the needs of our customers as we enter the new year. 
We continue to be extremely encouraged by the trends we are seeing in our J.B. Hunt 360 multimodal digital freight platform. Carrier and shipper user activity and engagement metrics continue to accelerate, providing further evidence in the value of being able to optimize and transact in real time in a more frictionless process. With regards to automation, we have completed the pilot of some of our automated tools for matching freight between shippers and carriers and have begun a thoughtfully paced rollout of the system to our personnel in the field. We expect to see additional productivity and service quality benefits over the next year as the system is fully rolled out and utilized. 
As we move forward, we remain focused on improving access, visibility and transparency on our platform, which we believe sets us up to achieve our mission statement to create the most efficient transportation network in North America. 
Closing out my comments and similar to the message I shared with you last quarter, I remain extremely encouraged about our position to leverage our people, assets and technology to help our customers through their supply chain challenges. Those attributes, combined with our experience, tenured workforce and broad and expanding scroll of services is what I believe differentiates us in the market and why I believe customers continue to lean into us during these challenging times. 
That concludes my comments, and I'd now like to turn it over to Nick."

I will focus my comments on the performance of both our Dedicated Contract Service business or DCS and the Final Mile Service businesses, FMS. I'll also provide you an update from a general operational perspective on both the driver market as well as our ability to source equipment. 
In our Dedicated business, we continue to see tremendous demand for our professionally outsourced fleet solutions. Propelled by the current market dynamics around driver and equipment availability, our backlog and pipeline remains strong. I am extremely proud of the team's ability to execute this quarter, highlighted by the addition of 744 trucks in the quarter. This is the largest number of truck adds in any single quarter. As historically is the case, start-up costs did put pressure on margins in the quarter as we incur costs before we begin to recognize revenue. But let me be clear,  we are extremely pleased with these results as it sets the stage for solid growth and momentum as we roll forward. The new business we have been onboarding represents a broad and diverse mix of customer accounts across both industry verticals and geographies. While we in the industry are facing driver recruitment challenges, customers in most instances have been willing to support our out-of-cycle adjustments to support higher wages for our professional driving workforce. 
As I alluded to earlier, we continue to see strong demand for our service. And as an update, we have sold 1,899 trucks year-to-date as of September 30, with an incremental 734 trucks from my last update on our second quarter call. 
Now transitioning to our Final Mile Services update. We see solid growth opportunities in this market that is and will be supported by our ability to differentiate our service product. As a result, we continue to make investments in our people and processes to support our growth outlook.  Relative to some of our recent quarters, profitability was pressured as a result of several factors. 
Similar to Dedicated, we experienced start-up costs in the quarter, given the smaller base of business that had a disproportionate impact on our results. Additionally, our contract carriers are also facing labor challenges particularly for the second seat in the delivery trucks in addition to those at our customer warehouses. 
Finally, and as we discussed last quarter, supply chain issues are impacting product availability and, in turn, our ability to leverage our network to deliver goods, potentially in the appliance and furniture categories. We believe these challenges are mostly transitory. Going forward, we are encouraged by the new business we are onboarding, and we are on pace for a record new year of sales. We continue to see a solid pipeline of both growth opportunities that we plan to capitalize on in the future. Our success will be largely dependent on our ability to differentiate the service experience for our customers' customers, and we remain committed to making the needed investments to achieve that differentiation. 
Finally, to close on some general operational updates, we have been extremely focused on our hiring efforts in the field to support our growth. As we have discussed in past quarters, we believe J.B. Hunt offers one of the most attractive driving opportunities given the concentration of work in both local and regional applications, combined with top pay and career advancement opportunities. This is also true for our field managers and operations personnel. We have continued to make adjustments to wages and benefits to make our company even more attractive for those seeking a rewarding employment opportunity. Additionally, we have been working closely with our equipment providers in order to support our growth. We have had to hold trades of some of our equipment to support our pipeline, but continue to stay attentive to both maintenance cost and fuel economy as a result. That concludes my remarks, so I'll turn it over to Brad."

I will focus my comments on the performance of Integrated Capacity Solutions and trucks. I'd like to start off by recognizing all members of our ICS and JBT segments for how they continue to respond in the current environment to elevated demand trends. Our customers continue to present us with opportunities to deliver both truck and trailing capacity solutions, and the team continues to respond very well in these demanding times. The experience of our people, leveraging our technology platform and our physical assets, continue to provide us opportunities to source and provide capacity for customers in what continues to be an extremely capacity-constrained environment. The ability to source that capacity is enabled by our technology investments into our J.B. Hunt 360 platform and is complemented by our drop trailer pools with 360box. We continue to invest in these areas as well as in our people to provide more solutions for our customers. 
I'll start with my comments on truck for JBT. Revenue grew 87% year-over-year to $204 million. This is the first quarter that JBT segment has generated over $200 million of revenue since 2007, and we were able to accomplish this with approximately 60% fewer trucks versus that period. This is yet another example of our organization's focus on providing value-added solutions for customers while maintaining our focus on scaling into large addressable markets with our desire for adequate returns on our capital. We believe our drop trailer capacity or 360box is the power-only capacity source through our platform provides us an opportunity for sustainable growth. Our trailing capacity increased 20% versus the prior year and 11% from the end of the second quarter, and the segment generated $14.7 million of operating income, the highest of any third quarter since 2006. 
Going forward, we will continue to stay disciplined on our desire to grow while also focusing on driving greater network efficiencies, particularly in our drop trailer network. 
Shifting gears to Integrated Capacity Solutions or our ICS segment. ICS delivered $666 million of revenue, breaking our prior quarterly record achieved just last quarter. Revenue grew 55% versus the prior year period. Segment volumes grew 4% in the quarter, while specifically truckload volume growth was 14% year-over-year. The cost of sourcing third-party capacity remains elevated, which is a continuation of the same trends we have seen through the latter parts of 2020 and all of 2021. That said, gross margins did expand 150 basis points sequentially as a result of further scaling of our platform, implementation of higher contractual rates and robust spot opportunities. We believe that market dynamics could tighten even further in the fourth quarter as congestion across the supply chain is likely to compress the timing of peak season and intensify customer needs for capacity solutions right up to the holidays. 
Going forward, we will continue to invest to expand the capabilities and functions of our multimodal digital freight platform for our carriers and customers as well as for our people to drive greater productivity and efficiencies in sourcing cost-effective solutions for our customers while giving carriers great visibility to the freight on our platform. 
In closing, we continue to see solid momentum across our JBT and ICS segments as evidenced by both segments delivering the strongest top line growth across our scroll of services for the fourth consecutive quarter in a row. While much work has been done, there is still much to accomplish. But along the way, we will remain committed to our investments in our people and our technology platform that will drive waste out of the system and help us deliver on our mission to create the most efficient transportation network in North America. This concludes my comments. I'll pass it over to Darren."

I'm going to focus my comments on 3 items related to our Intermodal business. First, I'm going to review performance in the quarter. I will also discuss network fluidity and our continuous effort to improve velocity and capacity for our customers. And finally, I will discuss continued investment in both people and the onboarding of our trailing capacity that we think is going to put us in a solid position to meet the tremendous demand we are seeing for our services and to further  support and accelerate the truck-to-rail conversion opportunities. 
While demand for our Intermodal services remains very strong, our volume performance in the quarter doesn't reflect that as fluidity challenges across our network continue to temper available capacity to serve that demand. As we discussed last quarter, we believe the core challenges around network fluidity for both our rail providers and customers center around availability of labor and has continued to provide challenges across the entire supply chain. Volumes for the quarter were down 6% and by month, volumes were down 7% in July, down 6% in August and down 5% in September. Improvements in rail network fluidity, particularly at the terminals and quicker turns of our equipment at customer locations, combined with the onboarding of the new containers, would and will help us provide additional capacity. 
As we discussed last quarter, we implemented programs with our customers to encourage better utilization of our equipment while protecting our need to generate appropriate returns on our significant investment in both people and equipment to support additional capacity. Importantly, these programs are designed to provide the benefit of additional capacity that results from gained efficiencies. I would say that the results from this program thus far have been mixed. We have seen some customer locations improve, while other locations have deteriorated even in instances within the same customer's footprint. I would also say, from our perspective, the results of the program have been mixed based simply on the fact that we would absolutely prefer to move more volume and provide more capacity for customers, which was not the case in the quarter. 
I believe this highlights the severity of the labor challenges across the supply chain.  Box turns in the quarter fell sequentially to 1.62 versus 1.65 in the prior quarter, further supporting that view. We continue to be optimistic about the opportunities for long-term sustainable growth in our Intermodal business. Customer demand continues to grow, and our rail providers continue to view us as a solution to the current congestion challenges that are even more severe in the international intermodal market. Owning our own equipment, including power, trailing and chassis and our highly skilled driver and operations personnel are differentiated in the market, particularly around fluidity and service. 
This is further supported by our J.B. Hunt 360 platform that allows us to source capacity when rail congestion or restrictions hamper our ability to serve. In closing, Intermodal's value proposition remains strong as driver and labor challenges continue to plague the supply chain combined with higher energy prices and the fact that an intermodal shipment on average is 60% less carbon intensive than the all-truck alternative. We will continue to make investments to support the meaningful growth opportunities in the market. We expect to take delivery of our entire 12,000 container order by early 2022, setting us up to provide meaningful savings for our customers as we begin the next bid cycle.

If we layer that on top of the high-profile announcement made this week from the administration and the port shifting to 24/7 operations conceivably, how do you think that, that plays into your volumes? And quite frankly, the fluidity of the system in the year end? And do you think you and your partners have the capacity if the gates are open longer to handle more volumes? And finally, can you do that profitably? I don't know if that translates into overtime costs. Like how does that figure into the profitability of the business if you're kind of running 24/7?"

We are -- continue to be confident that as our customers have growing demand in Southern California, that we have capacity to continue growing with those customers, but we are asking the customers to help us in that area to help us unload faster and create a more fluid capacity solution for us. We're also onboarding additional equipment during the fourth quarter, which will certainly help. But we would anticipate that we will continue to offer additional capacity for our customers as the customers participate in that solution. So that's the key element of this, while getting equipment out of the port is going to drive new demand. But at the same time, the customers have to be able to receive it.

We're paying drivers more today. We're hiring outsourced carriers at higher rates today. Our equipment utilization is down. That's driving some of the pricing out there. And certainly, our rail providers also participate in our cost base. So those are all factors that drive core pricing, and we really probably don't have any other commentary on that at this point."

We're surprised that anybody would come out and say anything about that at this point. There's just too much unknown today. I mean we've never been in an environment like this and the cost environment is going to drive pricing for us. That's always going to drive our pricing decisions as we're focused on the returns of the investments we put into place. 
Certainly, the container order for 12,000 that we announced earlier this year, we continue to onboard that equipment as fast as we can get it here. Decisions about advancing the equipment next year will continue as we finalize plans for next year. And frankly, as we continue to work with customers and see what's happening in the market relative to demand velocity improvements that are really available to our customer base to achieve savings not only in what their intermodal experience today, but converting more business off the highway at better pricing compared to truckload can really produce an awful lot of capacity if we can just improve the velocity of the current fleet. All that being said, if we see an opportunity to expand our equipment and the customers are supporting that with pricing, then I have no doubt our organization will set a path to do that, but we have a long way to go before a decision is made on that."

At this point, I'd say we would end the year somewhere between 8,000 and 9,000 of the box turns onboarded. So we feel like there is an improved cadence in the fourth quarter coming with new boxes onboarding. But we're not immune to the challenges. The port of Los Angeles and onboarding that equipment, that certainly has influenced our ability to get that equipment here, and we'll continue to work through it. We feel really good about how we approach that this year, and we'll continue to work to that end. But 8,000 to 9,000 by the end of the year, so I'll let you do the math on the fourth quarter. 
As far as box turn sequential cadence, that's a great question and that we're focusing with our customers every single day on how to improve that number related to their actions that are influencing it. Now they're not the only influencer. Certainly, our rail providers are moving somewhat slower than we would have anticipated. So at this point, I would have said at the end of Q2 that I can't imagine it getting worse. And you know what, it did. So I'm going to be cautious to give you any kind of thoughts on that moving forward. I just want to highlight that we're working every single day to improve that number. And that won't end any time.

For a long time, our target for growth in Intermodal has been highway conversion first. But certainly, we have felt that domestic Intermodal in a 53-foot container was a benefit to shippers importing through Southern California, and the flows of the international equipment and the massive amounts of empties that flow to various ports in order to get back to Asia certainly does represent an opportunity. I think that as the international congestion at various rail terminals throughout the interior of the country have driven a lot of conversations with customers that are looking for that solution. We have grown with transload for many, many years now and would anticipate that, that is a primary focus for our growth in the coming years and absolutely plan to capitalize on that.

So we look at our ability to grow intermodal in 2 areas. So transloading for sure would be an opportunity. If you think about the advantages we can give both the railroads and our customers, really it's around our operations because we control really the 3 critical components: the chassis, the driver and the container. Our ability to create a very fluid network at the destination is very different than what happens today from an international perspective. 
And when railroads are constrained, that allows us to think about and process differently there. The second one is in over-the-road conversions, which I did talk about that in my opening remarks. But we do see a high percentage of shipments that are moving on the rail today. Part of that are our intentional strategy to own any lane that moves Intermodal in our highway space. And so we're gaining access and information through our J.B. Hunt 360 multimodal digital freight platform to be able to know what we can and should talk to our customers about converting. So that's going to be a big focus for us as we come through the rest of this fourth quarter, very focused on peak and helping our customers be successful. 
We also are working closely with them to determine the freight that's moving on the highway today that we know to move into Intermodal. So I would tell you, those 12,000 boxes, I have high confidence in being able to load those at good quality of revenue. And I think, to the earlier question around what we would add, would really be dependent on what our customers can do from a fluidity perspective on turning our equipment."

There is too much uncertainty, which is driving too much cost in unplanned events whether that is unplanned on the shipping side, where it should be shipping from or even where it's going to. So I think there is a good hope that we can create more efficiency. That's something that we're working on with our customers. The last thing we want to do is be inflationary in total without looking first to say what can we do to help our customers meet their budgets overall. 
I would tell you customers, in general, the theme accelerate is something we rolled out in our sales summit February 2020. It could not have been a better theme as we moved into COVID, and we have continued to see our customers accelerate on solutions, idea sets. I think they are leaning more into providers that can do a multitude of different deliveries for them across the supply chain. Certainly, we are seeing that with the market share gains across all 5 of our segments.  And our customers are asking us to consider and do things we've not done before. And so we are being open to solving for best answers for them. We are agnostic as to how we move a shipment, so that helps create a differentiation in the market for us, but they need a lot of help. They are constrained on labor, not just at their DC locations but also just in their office personnel. And so we are leaning into our technology, our engineering teams, I would say, across the board. Have a lot of confidence that we're going to be able to continue to take more market share and help our customers be right when it comes to having an efficient supply chain."

Let me take that first, and then we'll have Nick comment on some thoughts around driver availability and vaccine mandates as well and other labor thoughts. So I think our rail providers and the transportation system that we're running, we're recruiting truck drivers at -- in Intermodal in addition to the rest of the organization at an extremely rapid pace and it's difficult. I don't want that to come across -- it's never been more difficult than it is today to find and attract and retain qualified drivers. It's very, very challenging. And certainly, the costs are -- we're facing that. 
I believe our rail providers are not immune to it and that contract workers inside the terminals continues to be a challenge for the rail providers, but I think they have actions in place to counter that. And certainly, at the end of the day, that simply means we all have to compete for that labor. The thing that has been the most difficult for us to get eyes on is customer warehouse labor, and that's where there is a significant bottleneck is our customers' ability to unload the demand that they have. 
And so when you ask the question about what's -- do we see a future in which that changes, I don't know that we have a line of sight to any kind of real dramatic improvements in it. But what we have line of sight to is our customers have to process supply chains more efficiently to achieve their goals. And that seems logical to us that they will attack this labor situation.

It's pushing peak longer into November and December, and that will make for more replenishment in the first quarter and even into the second quarter of next year. So we do believe that the first quarter will be unusually stronger than it has been in maybe a more typical environment really trying to get their shelves and inventory in the right places in the right time. So demand from that perspective is still there in total. I don't have great comments about the second half of the year because people are asking us and customers are really trying to do that through their budget process right now. But I would say strong demand, optimistic, feel really good. 
And then last comment, I've been asking retailers if they feel like because this Christmas season, the right products won't be on the shelves, will gift cards be more here in this Christmas season. And I think that we're leaning to a yes, which means there would be more shopping and more retail sales in January and, obviously, more need for us to replenish any of those goods as well."

We have high confidence in the amount of time we've actually been with carriers and the different measurements that we're seeing continuing to break records even in this very constrained environment.

Obviously, bid season just kicked off for this next year about 1.5 weeks ago. And so we'll see where that sits, but it's certainly our expectation to continue to grow in published freight to create balance against the spot opportunity. Some of that really goes back to the disruption that Shelley spoke of earlier in the call, where freight patterns are different and freight demands are different. And some of that is contributing to elongated spot needs. But I do believe as we think about moving forward, you'll look to see more published balance."

And that's part of the reason that you see more spot than you see contract as well on top of what Brad talked about. So I think that's really important. If I go to your question around automation, we think of J.B. Hunt 360 as a full ecosystem that helps connect our shippers, our carriers and our people to that. So automation is intended to be across those 3 groups that are interconnected in the platform. The current automation is intended for our people, and so that's really connecting our Shipper 360 and Carrier 360 internally for our people and our new system.

Our equipment is not getting any cheaper, so I would segment the question into those 2 areas. Our base costs will continue, and that is going to be our new norm.
