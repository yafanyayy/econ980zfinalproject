As you saw from our announcements last night, we delivered another year of solid growth in 2020. We expect to generate double-digit AFFO growth per share in 2021, and we secured our largest-ever small cell commitment with the 15,000 note award -- 15,000 note awards from Verizon to support their 5G build-out. Dan will discuss the results in our full year 2021 outlook in a bit more detail in a minute. So I want to focus my comments on 2 areas: Our strategy to maximize long-term shareholder value while also delivering attractive near-term returns and the recent positive developments that increased my confidence on our strategy and growth opportunity. 
I believe our strategy and unmatched portfolio of more than 40,000 towers and approximately 80,000 route miles of fiber concentrated in the top U.S. markets have positioned Crown Castle to generate growth in cash flows and dividends per share, both in the near term and for years to come. Despite the challenges presented last year, we continued to build on our long history of consistently delivering compelling growth through various market cycles, highlighting both the strength of our business model and the significant value creation opportunity our strategy provides to shareholders. 
One of the core principles of our long-term strategy is to focus on the U.S. market. because we believe it represents the fastest-growing market for wireless network investment with the least amount of risk, leading to superior long-term returns. The demand for our shared infrastructure is fundamentally tied to the insatiable demand for mobile data in the U.S., which increased by 30% again last year. Because the growth outlook and market fundamentals are so compelling, the U.S. wireless market continues to attract a disproportionate amount of capital investment. This dynamic is again apparent with the C-Band spectrum auction with gross proceeds of more than $80 billion. 
During my more than 20 years at Crown Castle, large-scale wireless spectrum auctions in the U.S., like this one, have followed a consistent pattern. First, industry observers questioned whether the capital required to secure the valuable spectrum will crowd out investment in wireless networks. And second, these questions are answered with long periods of sustained significant investment. Similar to the past, the seemingly insatiable demand for data drives the need for additional spectrum. Further, the only way the spectrum can meet the demand is for our customers to deploy it on towers and small cells. I am confident that we will look back in the years to come and recognize how important this auction was for the development of nationwide 5G in the U.S. 
In addition to deploying more spectrum, cell site densification has always been a key tool that carriers have used to add network capacity, enabling our customers to get the most out of their spectrum assets by reusing the spectrum over shorter and shorter distances. The nature of wireless networks requires that cell site densification will continue as the density of data demand grows, particularly given the higher spectrum bands that have been auctioned in recent years and that have shorter propagation characteristics. 
Slide 3 illustrates this point. The higher frequency spectrum bands are valuable because they provide our customers with the ability to significantly increase network capacity, given how much more spectrum is available in those higher frequencies. However, as you can also see on this slide, the signal travels over shorter distances requiring more cell sites. As a result, we expect both the deployment of additional spectrum and this densification trend to drive significant demand for our tower and small cell assets for years to come. 
To address this sizable and growing opportunity, we have invested nearly $40 billion of capital over the last couple of decades in shared infrastructure assets that we believe are mission-critical for wireless networks. Our tower investments began more than 20 years ago when we built and acquired assets that we could share across multiple customers, providing a lower cost to each customer while generating attractive returns for our shareholders over time as we lease up those assets. 
More recently, as wireless network architecture evolve to require a network of cell sites that is much denser and closer to the end users, we established the leading small cell business in the U.S., with the same thought process in mind: Provide a shared infrastructure solution that lowers the cost to each customer while generating compelling returns for our shareholders over time as we lease up those assets. We believe the addition of small cells and fiber to our strategy both complements our tower business and provides substantial potential upside to our 5G growth strategy. 
To that point, we recently signed 2 strategic agreements. In November, we announced a 15-year agreement to lease DISH base on up to 20,000 of our tower sites. This strategic agreement established Crown Castle as DISH's anchor tower provider and includes certain fiber transport services to further support their nationwide 5G build-out. This agreement will contribute to our financial results over time as DISH deploys on our tower sites, and we expect to start in the back half of this year. We're excited to partner with DISH to support their long-term infrastructure needs and look forward to working with them as they deploy nationwide 5G network. 
As we announced yesterday, we are also excited that we have expanded our strategic relationship with Verizon by signing a long-term small cell agreement to support Verizon's 5G ultra wideband and 5G nationwide deployment. Under this agreement, Verizon has committed to lease 15,000 new small cells, representing the largest small cell award in our history and demonstrating the value of sharing small cell and fiber infrastructure assets with multiple customers. While we believe it is our ability to provide the full breadth of wireless infrastructure assets that allowed us to secure the agreements with DISH and Verizon, highlighting the benefits of the unique portfolio we have built over the last 20 years. With our 40,000 towers and 80,000 route miles of high-capacity fiber concentrated in the top U.S. markets, we believe we will continue to reap the rewards of our investments as our customers continue to roll out their nationwide 5G network. 
As we noted in our press release, late last year, T-Mobile notified us that they were canceling approximately 5,700 small cells that we initially contracted with Sprint. The majority of the small cells were yet to be constructed and would have been located at the same locations as other T-Mobile small cells, once completed. The Sprint cancellation resulted in T-Mobile accelerating the payment of all contractual rent obligations for those small cells as well as the payment of capital costs we had already incurred. In addition to receiving the future rent associated with the canceled nodes, the small cell locations are now again available for future customers, and this development does not impact the long-term growth opportunity for our small cell business. As a result, we finished 2020 with approximately 50,000 small cells on air, and we have meaningfully increased our backlog of small cells committed or under construction to approximately 30,000. 
As I reflect on 2020, I'm proud of how well our team delivered for our customers and our shareholders during a difficult operating environment. Looking forward, I'm excited about the growth opportunity as our customers embark on what is likely to be a decade-long investment cycle to develop 5G in what remains the best wireless market in the world. Our strategy remains unchanged as we focus on delivering the highest risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders by growing our dividend and investing in assets we believe will drive future growth. And I believe Crown Castle offers shareholders an unmatched opportunity to benefit from the launch of 5G wireless networks. We provide a compelling total return opportunity with a high-quality dividend yielding more than 3%. We are delivering the highest tower revenue growth rate in the U.S. among our peers. We expect to generate double-digit AFFO per share growth this year even before 5G spending occurs in earnest. Our customers are affirming the value we bring with our comprehensive portfolio of shared infrastructure assets by entering into long-term agreements to access those assets. And we are investing in new infrastructure assets that we expect will extend the opportunity to grow dividends per share 7% to 8% per year. I believe this combination is as compelling for future value creation as we've ever seen at Crown Castle. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dan."

As Jay mentioned, our 2020 financial results add to our long history of consistently delivering attractive growth. Specifically, we increased dividends per share by 8%, which reflects our commitment to return capital to shareholders and demonstrate our ability to grow through various market cycles. We delivered approximately 6% growth in organic contribution to site rental revenue. And we continue to improve our financial flexibility as we lowered our weighted average borrowing cost, extended the average maturity of our debt and reduced our leverage. 
Before I walk through the financial results in more detail, I wanted to briefly discuss the nontypical items described in our earnings release yesterday that impacted fourth quarter and full year 2020 results. 
The Sprint cancellation Jay mentioned generated the biggest of these impacts, including an increase to other operating income, partially offset by a related increase in operating expense and the write-off of capital already spent on the construction of the canceled nodes. Additionally, we implemented a reduction in staffing primarily in our fiber segment that resulted in associated severance costs in the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter and full year 2020 net benefit of these nontypical items, which were not contemplated in our prior full year 2020 outlook on both adjusted EBITDA and AFFO, is approximately $286 million. We do not anticipate the nontypical items will have a material impact on our 2021 outlook, which remains consistent with the outlook we've provided in October. To make the financial figures in this earnings presentation more comparable, full year 2020 results and growth figures for full year 2021 have been adjusted to exclude the impact of these nontypical items. 
Turning to Slide 4 of the presentation. Full year 2020 results were consistent with our prior expectations with site rental revenues and adjusted EBITDA increasing 4%, while AFFO increased 9% when compared to full year 2019. The 4% growth in site rental revenues included approximately 6% growth in the organic contribution to site rental revenues, consisting of approximately 5% growth from towers, 15% growth from small cells and 3% growth from fiber solutions. 
Focusing on investment activity during the year, we deployed approximately $1.5 billion toward discretionary investments in 2020, including $1.2 billion for fiber and approximately $320 million for towers. These investments were balanced with approximately $2.1 billion paid in common stock dividends or $4.93 per share, representing 8% growth when compared to dividends paid during 2019. 
Now turning to Slide 5. Our full year 2021 outlook remains unchanged, with 4% growth in site rental revenues, 5% growth in adjusted EBITDA and 12% growth in AFFO. 
As shown on Slide 6, the expected 4% growth in site rental revenues includes approximately 6% growth in the organic contribution to site rental revenues, consisting of approximately 6% growth from towers, 15% growth from small cells and 3% growth from Fiber Solutions. As a reminder, DISH has publicly stated they expect to begin their network deployment later this year, so our outlook does not include a material contribution from DISH's build-out. Likewise, our recent agreement with Verizon is not expected to have a material impact on 2021 results. 
As it relates to the balance sheet, we finished the year with approximately 4x debt to EBITDA on a last quarter annualized basis, which includes the net benefit from the nontypical items discussed earlier. Adjusting to include those items as onetime impacts that are not annualized, our leverage would have been approximately 5x. During 2020, we improved our balance sheet flexibility by extending the weighted average maturity by nearly 2 years, reducing our average borrowing cost by 40 basis points and reducing our leverage to our target of approximately 5x. Looking forward, our expectation for 2021 capital expenditures remains unchanged at approximately $1.5 billion. We expect we will be able to once again fund this discretionary capital with free cash flow and incremental borrowings, consistent with our investment-grade credit profile. 
As I wrap up, we are excited about the positive demand trends in the U.S. wireless market and the opportunity we see to translate that demand into double-digit growth in AFFO per share this year. Looking further out, we believe our focus on the U.S. market and our ability to offer a broad portfolio of towers, small cells and fiber solutions, which are all integral components of communications networks, provides us the best opportunity to deliver superior long-term, risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. 
Before we open the call to questions, I want to also mention that we were recently informed by the SEC that they have concluded the previously disclosed investigation and that they do not currently intend to pursue an enforcement action. 
With that, David, I'd like to open the call to questions."

A few things I would mention about this, and obviously, we're careful about the commercial terms under which we negotiate with the customers. But I think there are a few things that we can speak to related to it. 
First is the returns that we would expect to gain from this agreement are consistent with the long-term approach that we've taken with deploying small cells. So initial yields of 6% to 7%, if they were to be the anchor deployment. And then if they were to be a co-location on existing infrastructure, it would take those returns into the yields on invested capital into the low double digits. So from a return standpoint, really consistent with what we've seen historically. 
We don't know the exact locations that these nodes that they've committed to will ultimately land in. So I can't be more specific than that in terms of what the returns will look like. We'll have to let some time pass and see as they identify the locations and then we'll update that, obviously, as we go. 
I do think broadly, this is a -- the Verizon agreement is a real affirmation of our small cell strategy. And they believe there's real value in a third party providing the infrastructure to them. And I think we're in a great position to do that. So we're focused on making sure we deliver for them and help them get their 5G launch. And this agreement is really it's the floor. It's the beginning of what we think is a big start towards 5G. And I think we'll see more of this as time passes as we work to build out these 5G networks, but this is the early days and the start of something pretty exciting that we're doing with Verizon."

Obviously, we're trying everything we can to increase the speed at which we deploy small cells. It's a very difficult and challenging activity to get through the process of working with local communities, making sure the way we design these is consistent with the aesthetic that they would want in their particular communities. And so I don't really have any update to the time line that we're typically seeing as we deploy these. It's generally kind of 2 to 3 years from the time that we identify a location to where we're ultimately able to build them. But there is a lot of work that we're doing in trying to figure out ways to do that faster for our customers. And obviously, it's to the benefit of their networks to be able to get them out there faster. But there's also a component to this that, as we've talked about, similar to towers, these are very high barriers to entry at the local community level. And so the careful work that we have to do with those communities to make sure we're sensitive to the aesthetics that they want as well as building these within the parameters that they desire into their community is critically important and something we're really focused on making sure we balance those 2 desires for speed as well as doing things the right way. 
The question on the FCC and the support that we've seen from the regulatory agency there over time I think will continue. Obviously, it's a big push of the current administration to have broadband for all. And they have been very supportive in their public comments about the need and necessity for 5G to be deployed in the U.S. and to lead the world in 5G deployment. So I think the operating environment in which we're both co-locating on existing assets as well as making investments into future assets. I think the environment that we see from a regulatory standpoint will be pretty similar to what we've seen over the last several years. 
On your last question around C-Band and the impact on 2021. Obviously, the auction is just drawing to a conclusion now, and I think we will see later in this year as the carriers start to speak about what their actual deployment plans for that spectrum will be. As we think about the outlook that we've provided, we really didn't include any impact from C-Band. And I think given the calendar, it's probably unlikely that, that would contribute to our financial results in calendar 2021. But as we get into the year and the auction gets completely wrapped up and carriers can speak to the spectrum positions that they gained, I think we'll be able to provide more clarity at that point, probably later this year as we think about 2022 and beyond."

We're always focused on trying to operate the business as efficiently as possible. And in those efforts, we found some opportunities to gain some synergies. And so we did that in the fourth quarter of last year. Obviously, there were a number of employees that were affected by that and had done a great job for us, and I wish them all the best in their next endeavors. 
As I think about strategically around small cells and the fiber business and what we're seeing, there are a lot of positive developments. Obviously, the completion of the agreement with Verizon is a really positive development. We're going to be working hard for them to help them get their network on air. The beginning of the launch of 5G creates another opportunity for cell site densification. And then the work that we've talked about over the last several years around 4G, I think the carriers are going to continue to densify their 4G networks in addition to the investment that they've made -- that they're going to make on the 5G side. I think we'll continue to see 4G sites deployed and over time there. 
Great to have our new COO in place, [ Chris Pobeda ]. He's been with the company for a number of years.

Just curious if that's correct. And again, just trying to get a better sense on the quantification.

Big picture, Colby, I would go back to some of the things that we've talked about in the past. And I know you're referencing some of the materials that are available in our supplement, which I would encourage investors to take a look at if we break down details by customer by year. Big picture, there's 5 years weighted average remaining on the T-Mobile and legacy Sprint contracts. There's about -- on a consolidated basis, there's about 5% of our revenues that are overlapping sites, sites where both Sprint and then legacy Sprint and T-Mobile are co-located on. And we use that as kind of a bookend of what the potential impact around churn could be. 
At this point, there are no specifics of what their plans are that we have to share. So being specific about what will exactly happen in '23 or '28, we're not prepared to speak to that because we don't know. Broadly, though, I think, and this is where your question is going, broadly, we're always open to working with our customers on structures that meet their needs without compromising our own economics under those lease agreements. We were really intentional several years ago with both Sprint and T-Mobile about extending the agreements that we had -- tower agreements that we had with them over multiple years, and that's why we sit here today with 5-year weighted average life remaining. Obviously, that gives us significant ability to navigate through the work that they're going to do around finding synergies in their network. And I think they will find synergies in the network and will be impacted to some degree by that. 
But I think it's also true that we've grown through past events of churn, past events of consolidation. And I'm comfortable that we'll be able to do the same. So as we talk about our long-term goal of being able to grow the dividend 7% to 8% per year, we think about that in the context of a multitude of different opportunities and risks at the top line. And on balance, I think we'll be able to navigate through the one that you're raising here, without any significant challenges to our long-term growth rate and targeted dividends per share."

And so it makes sense that the current site density is insufficient to fully utilize them. So the question I have is what about the tower inventory? Towers historically have been built in locations that are optimized around the frequency bands carriers were using. So are you seeing an emerging opportunity to maybe more meaningfully reengage your tower construction business for your own use because it's been a while since you've materially built out your portfolio? And then are there any other infrastructure categories that might become increasingly interactive for you to invest in as carriers look at a new degree of density whether that's helping them build out indoor systems where we can make better use of these high frequencies and maybe looking at the economics around [indiscernible]"

Obviously, the deployment of the spectrum and the acquisition of the spectrum by the carriers is going to need both macro sites and small cells. And similar to the past deployments, I think probably in the early days, we'll see that more weighted towards the macro site. But where you went with your question around the build of additional assets, the opportunity to build additional towers in the U.S. is really, really limited. And I don't think anything about this spectrum auction is going to change that. So I would not expect that you're going to see either our own allocation of capital or, frankly, investment across our industry broadly, whether that's the large players, public players in the space or even the smaller players in the space. I don't think you're going to see a significant increase in the amount of tower build that happened in the country. It is very, very difficult to colocate -- or to build new assets, new tower assets in the top 100, top 150 markets in the U.S. That is basically blanketed with an -- with the tower infrastructure that's there today. The opportunity to densify is really going to come with fiber and small cells. And it's why we made the investment many years ago, got ourselves into the space and started to learn how to build it, how to deploy it and get the right kind of assets for where the world was headed. We saw this densification coming and the need for it, realized that macro towers wouldn't be able to entirely meet that need. And so we began to invest in the complementary assets of small cells and fiber that are going to make this densification possible. So I think you'll see colocations on towers. Tower is going to see a great amount of growth from the deployment of the spectrum bands. And then I think you're really going to see the reason why we originally made these investments and have continued to make the investments. As densification happens, I think that will happen in great amounts on fiber and small cells. 
Are there other areas of infrastructure that are interesting to us? You spoke to in-building. There are some small number of in-building systems that we are doing. We find venues to be attractive when they meet our rigorous approach to allocating capital. If they exceed our returns and we think there's colocation there, some of those make sense. But frankly, in terms of the scale of investment, it's really relatively small compared to what we see in the more public right-of-way opportunities to do infill and site densification with small cells and fiber, complementing the tower portfolios that are out there. So I don't see anything on the horizon currently that would cause us to deviate from our plan of the primary investment opportunities in front of us are small cell related."

But if I think about long term, 10 years, 15 years, 20 years out, in the top 100 markets, I think virtually all of the spectrum bands that the carriers have today will be operating all of those spectrum bands over time. The carriers will upgrade their equipment. They'll add additional lines and antennas and ultimately be broadcasting all of the spectrum bands that they have for the -- on the vast, vast majority of the macro tower sites that they're on. 
And then I think based on the amount of usage that ultimately happens, you'll see them be targeted in terms of the deployment and densification inside of those markets to supplement and extend the -- and expand the network capacity by utilizing fiber and small cells to make those macro sites as efficient as they possibly can. That generally happens over a period of time. So if we go back in history and watch it and look at how the carriers have deployed network, you can almost look at kind of the top urban markets, the most densely populated. And those will see the benefit of this kind of activity first. And then over time, you'd see that expand out to the more suburbia and as well as to other markets that maybe are not quite as densely populated.

The dynamics and physics of the way these wireless networks work, in the places where we operate infrastructure towers and small cells and fiber, I really don't see any opportunity for satellite to be a meaningful component of the network. Frankly, I think it will be a very, very small component, if any at all, over time. The ability to transfer data quickly as well as the time it takes to move the data from earth to even a low-orbit satellite is going to create just too much latency in the network to be a viable competitor to the terrestrial-based infrastructure that makes up the vast majority of the infrastructure in the market today. 
I think there are places, though, particularly really rural locations where some of the low-orbit satellite opportunities could be really interesting of a way of the delivering broadband to places that just economically don't make sense to build terrestrial networks, too. 
And then the other place where I think there will be opportunity over time is in disaster recovery situations where you have -- we've seen this happen in Puerto Rico a couple of years ago and other places where there's a targeted area that needs to be covered. And I think you'll -- you may see some solutions. People have talked about balloons. They talked about satellites. I really think those are short-term solutions except in rural locations, but could be helpful in a disaster recovery situation where there's a small area of the terrestrial network that's been removed as a result of a natural disaster, could be interesting in those locations. But beyond that, I really don't see any meaningful portion of the wireless networks that are going to be handled that way. 
And I think you can point to -- obviously, we can point to the agreements that our customers are signing. If you look at what DISH just committed to us on -- for the deployment of their network as well as the behavior of our customers, I don't -- I think our contracts speak to the fact that they believe this is -- this terrestrial-based infrastructure and towers and small cells is the way that networks are going to be deployed over the long period of time."

And that leads to a significant demand for our tower infrastructure and believe this will be similar for our fiber and small cells. And this is a dynamic that will be beneficial to our industry and particularly to our company. And we expect that to be the exact same case in -- once the C-Band spectrum is in the hands of carriers and they're ready to deploy it. 
More spectrum is obviously needed. Much has been written on this topic. The FCC has talked about it. The carriers have talked about it, that more spectrum is absolutely needed in order to meet this 30-plus percent annual demand of growth in wireless data. And the significant investment that the carriers are making today in that spectrum can only meet that growing demand and to generate returns for our customers once it's actually deployed. So spectrum goes first and then the operators, then deploy that spectrum, and that goes really well for the infrastructure providers. 
To the extent, as you were alluding to, that the size of the check raises questions about the capacity for future investment going forward, I think it further highlights the value proposition that we offer as a shared infrastructure provider. We're offering capital, in essence, to the wireless carriers across our towers and small cells, and it's cheaper for them to deploy that spectrum that they acquire across the shared asset because we're willing to take the risk that we'll be able to get multiple users and thereby reduce the cost to the carriers of deploying that spectrum across the market. 
So I think it feeds right into our value proposition, and it's one of the most encouraging things that happens in our infrastructure business. Once the spectrum is in the hands of the operators, we're able to come alongside the operators and provide a shared infrastructure solution to help them get it deployed. And I think the C-Band auction is just another example of how the run rate -- the runway of growth is extended in the business and should lead to great things in our industry and for our business."

And the dynamics that are in the market today in terms of the spectrum deployment, the growing demand for data, the obvious need for the carriers to continue to invest in their network to meet that growing demand for data are leading to conversations that give us confidence that we'll be in and around that pacing of about 10,000 small cells per year. 
One of the things -- just thought might bring up in terms of making parallels to the history and passage of time of small cells and towers. If you think back over the last 20 years of the tower business, the commitments that have been made by the carriers and that have been announced, when they commit to a number of new installations or new sites with us, those commitments help establish protocols that enable us, both sides of the agreement, to work collectively and easily through the deployment cycles. And the establishment of a number, like in the case of the Verizon commitment of 15,000 small cells, it enables both parties to set up some ease of doing business together that, frankly, just make it easier for us to go through the process of deploying infrastructure for them. The same thing has been true on the tower side. But if you zoom out and think about the last 20 years, the same thing was true on the tower side. The carriers over time have made commitments to us for a certain number of new sites that they'll co-locate on or that we'll build for them. But those are a fraction of the overall tower activity that they ultimately did with us. 
I think the same thing is true on the small cell side. So commitments by the carriers are helpful. I think they're helpful data points for investors to look at and to see that there's commitments by the carriers towards future deployments. But our expectation is that this is more the start of the floor of the activity and that the business will follow more the pattern of the history of the tower business where it establishes the ability for the companies to do business relatively easily. But ultimately, the amount of sites that get deployed will be far in excess of the sites that just show up on commitments that are talked about in grand scale. And that's the nature of the type of business that we're doing, where this is really a local business. So working with the local markets at each of the carriers to ensure that we're providing an infrastructure solution that meets their need at the local market area is really how we transact with our customers. And some of these agreements like the one with Verizon enabled that to happen more easily."

Is that bottleneck in terms of deployment actually may be an advantage for you guys to lever in terms of initial yields? If you could talk about that? 
And then the second question was, we revolve on a ton of work on DISH and what they might be doing with [ open end ], and you've beaten that to death. But one of the things that has come up in that is that there's this new generation of multi-buy tenants that have much broader range than normal, and that's what visual intention is in order to exploit a pretty diverse spectrum portfolio. Do you see anyone insight to the possibility that the carriers are kind of forced through the C-Band process? So we let every 1 of their towers to kind of come back and maybe economize on their footprint on a tower?"

I'm not sure there's much more to add there in terms of We think we're going to be building about 10,000 per year. The places where we could increase the pace of that building would largely be around gaining municipality approvals, permits. And I don't see anything in the current environment that would suggest the pace at which we're doing that would increase or decrease meaningfully from the current operating environment. But we're going to continue to work at it and see opportunities to the extent that we get kind of a breakthrough there and that changes, we'll obviously let you know. 
The other thing I would just mention about this is that the amount of revenue that are -- is added site, rental revenue that comes online from small cells, is based on the return profile of the systems that we're building or that carriers are deploying on. So there can be pretty significant variance in terms of what those revenues look like on a per node basis based on the environment in which we're putting those nodes into and what the underlying costs associated with that deployment is. We think about pricing small cells much more on a return basis rather than just the price per node. It's driven by what our returns are. So that may be part of what causes -- as you kind of do the math and think about it. That's probably the -- one of the places that I would point to is maybe a little bit of a difference in the way that we think and as we're operating the business. 
On your second question around DISH and the antennas and how do the carriers economize their network. I think the carriers will continue to use technology to reduce the amount of cell sites that are ultimately needed or antennas or lines that are ultimately needed on infrastructure. It's a way of reducing their deployment cost for deploying sites. And we've seen that happen over a long period of time. I know there've been a number of studies that have talked about how the use of next-generation antennas over time have increased the ability for the carriers to cover a particular location. We talked about MIMO antennas and the benefits of those of reducing some of the deployment costs. And I would expect the carriers will continue to be really thoughtful about how they allocate the capital and use technology to reduce the cost of those deployments. And ultimately, that adheres to our benefit. As they've reduced the actual cost to deploy, it enables there to be more capital for them to deploy additional sites. So it's synergistic in terms of the densification process that they use technology to reduce the cost. They're able to put more of that capital into densifying their network, which obviously in [ your star ] benefit."

And that growth in dividends of 7% to 8% per year per share, we think we can do that over a long period of time. Obviously, the law of large numbers is at play in our business because it's a fixed asset that's put in the ground. And then upon which, we start to add co-location and growth. And when we have 1 tenant on them and add the second tenant, the revenue grows by 100%. And then when we add the third tenant, the growth rate on that individual asset is much lower than it was when we added just second tenant. So absolutely, the path that has been followed by towers will be followed by small cells where the growth rate comes down, but growth rates don't ultimately drive the value in our business. It's about the return on the invested capital that ultimately adheres to the benefit of shareholders. So our focus around where we're investing the capital and where we see the growth opportunities are about expanding those returns across that investment base and the assets that we own. So yes, at the top line, it will come down over time, but that doesn't necessarily parallel to the growth and the returns that we ultimately achieve by the -- through the asset investments that we've made."

And a lot of that's going to go to small cells, and we're just now seeing the beginnings of that."

But the agreement is also a significant investment commitment of capital on our part. 
And as you know, when we invest for these multiple -- as we invest -- make those investments, we're thinking about multiple carriers that are ultimately going to need these sites in order for us to make those investments. And we're not going to do all of the small cells in the market. So there are going to be locations, markets, where, frankly, the growth in small cells are not going to align with places where we think there will be multiple carriers.

And the carriers need flexibility when they make commitments to be able to go out and build where they're -- they have need but in places where our -- we don't think our returns are going to align with that.

So I think there will be -- as Dan was speaking to a moment ago, I think there will continue to be growth over a long period of time, and we will see increasing numbers of small cells. And I think the Verizon agreement is sort of a first step towards the benefit that's going to come with 5G and the increased need for small cells. And I think you'll see -- you are going to see, I believe, millions of small cells ultimately in the U.S. market. And we'll get our share of those in places where we own the fiber, but there's also going to be lots of places where the carriers decide to do it themselves. And some of that will be because, frankly, we don't see the opportunity to put capital to work at risk-adjusted returns that make sense for our shareholders."

The business -- I mean it's just stepping back from it, and it's a good question to say, okay, at what point do you ultimately get the returns in the business? And I think a couple of quarters ago, we went back and walked through kind of what we saw on the tower space. 
It took us nearly or, I think, a little over 10 years just to get to the point where we were clearing the cost of capital on the tower side from a return standpoint. This is a business that's marked by making sure we get the right locations early and then over time, incrementally growing those returns. And there's nothing that I see in the small cell business that would say our yield on invested assets from a fiber standpoint is north of 7% today, and it's basically right around where our blended cost of capital is. And I don't see anything on the horizon that would suggest to me that we're going to market -- see a significant increase in the yield in that capital. What I do think will happen over a long period of time through operating the business well, adding colocations, is will incrementally increase that yield over a long period of time, such that when we look back after 10 or 20 years, we look at it and see the benefit of the investment that we're making, which is really incumbent upon us then as we think about where do we put the capital, we're trying to align that with the places that are most likely to need that lease-up over a long period of time in the exact same way that we did it with towers. 
And as we talked about a couple of quarters ago, as we took a deep dive into certain markets, then we'll update that again and the midyear of 2021. As we go down to the market level and to the asset level, we can see it playing out exactly like that, where in certain markets where the investments are really new and early. The yields on the invested capital are relatively low in markets where we've been in for a long period of time, and the assets have started to see the colocation, then the returns that you're asking about start to come to fruition. 
Big picture, the entire pie of opportunity, we think, directionally is going to increase over time. And if you ask my really long view, then yes, I think there is going to be a day when we're doing meaningfully more small cells than what we're doing in the calendar year. But then we'll have to look at, ""Okay, what's the appropriate capital base against that?"" And as time passes, then we'll update you on what that looks like and where the opportunity is."

They're different because of the actual dynamics that are occurring in the market in the situations that the customers are in with the assets. In the case of DISH, they have no existing infrastructure or they're not on any meaningful number of tower sites in the market. So they're deploying a nationwide network, and it is helpful and cost-effective for them to pick an anchor provider upon which they design their entire network around. They chose Crown Castle to do that. We believe, in part, because of the quality of our tower assets as well as our ability to deliver fiber transport services to them. And that means that they're anchoring or building, designing their network around our sites. We think that creates a significant opportunity for us, both in the near-term years to come, but also over the long term, as they deploy that network. I can't think of another example in the last 15 years where a carrier from scratch was looking at deploying a nationwide network. So I think the basic idea of having to deploy a network from scratch drives the need to pick an anchor provider and then work closely with them. And we're obviously pleased to be their partner and working hard to deliver on their expectations of getting their network built. 
In the case of Verizon, again, I would point to some of the comments that I made before that whenever there's a commitment of size like this and obviously the largest 1 we've ever done with a carrier with Verizon this quarter that we're announcing, this creates really an opportunity for us to work together through some of the operating protocols to make sure that we're able to work together well. And the commitment and size enables us to go do that work together as to how we're going to work together. And we think it's a good start for the deployment of 5G small cells. But it's just to start and think there will be more to come. I think there will be some operating benefits going through this for us and then ultimately the returns as we both colocate those nodes on existing infrastructure and then deploy capital to build anchor nodes for them in places where we think there will be future returns."

And it's really a site-by-site decision that the carriers are going to make.

As you saw from our announcements last night, we delivered another year of solid growth in 2020. We expect to generate double-digit AFFO growth per share in 2021, and we secured our largest-ever small cell commitment with the 15,000 node award from Verizon to support their 5G build-out. 
Dan will discuss the results in our full year 2021 outlook in a bit more detail in a minute, so I want to focus my comments on 2 areas: our strategy to maximize long-term shareholder value while also delivering attractive near-term returns and the recent positive developments that increased my confidence on our strategy and growth opportunity.
I believe our strategy and unmatched portfolio of more than 40,000 towers and approximately 80,000 route miles of fiber concentrated in the top U.S. markets have positioned Crown Castle to generate growth in cash flows and dividends per share, both in the near term and for years to come. Despite the challenges presented last year, we continued to build on our long history of consistently delivering compelling growth through various market cycles, highlighting both the strength of our business model and the significant value-creation opportunity our strategy provides to shareholders.
One of the core principles of our long-term strategy is to focus on the U.S. market because we believe it represents the fastest-growing market for wireless network investment with the least amount of risk, leading to superior long-term returns. The demand for our shared infrastructure is fundamentally tied to the insatiable demand for mobile data in the U.S., which increased by 30% again last year. Because these growth outlook and market fundamentals are so compelling, the U.S. wireless market continues to attract a disproportionate amount of capital investment. This dynamic is again apparent with the C-Band spectrum auction with gross proceeds of more than $80 billion.
During my more than 20 years at Crown Castle, large-scale wireless spectrum auctions in the U.S., like this one, have followed a consistent pattern. First, industry observers questioned whether the capital required to secure the valuable spectrum will crowd out investment in wireless networks. And second, these questions are answered with long periods of sustained significant investment. Similar to the past, the seemingly insatiable demand for data drives the need for additional spectrum. Further, the only way the spectrum can meet the demand is for our customers to deploy it on towers and small cells. I am confident that we will look back in the years to come and recognize how important this auction was for the development of nationwide 5G in the U.S. 
In addition to deploying more spectrum, cell site densification has always been a key tool that carriers have used to add network capacity, enabling our customers to get the most out of their spectrum assets by reusing the spectrum over shorter and shorter distances. The nature of wireless networks requires that cell site densification will continue as the density of data demand grows, particularly given the higher-spectrum bands that have been auctioned in recent years and that have shorter propagation characteristics.
Slide 3 illustrates this point. The higher-frequency spectrum bands are valuable because they provide our customers with the ability to significantly increase network capacity given how much more spectrum is available in those higher frequencies. However, as you can also see on this slide, the signal travels over shorter distances, requiring more cell sites. As a result, we expect both the deployment of additional spectrum and this densification trend to drive significant demand for our tower and small cell assets for years to come.
To address this sizable and growing opportunity, we have invested nearly $40 billion of capital over the last couple of decades in shared infrastructure assets that we believe are mission critical for wireless networks. Our tower investments began more than 20 years ago when we built and acquired assets that we could share across multiple customers, providing a lower cost to each customer while generating attractive returns for our shareholders over time as we leased up those assets.
More recently, as wireless network architecture evolve to require a network of cell sites that is much denser and closer to the end users, we established the leading small cell business in the U.S. with the same thought process in mind: provide a shared infrastructure solution that lowers the cost to each customer while generating compelling returns for our shareholders over time as we lease up those assets. We believe the addition of small cells and fiber to our strategy both complements our tower business and provides substantial potential upside to our 5G growth strategy.
To that point, we recently signed 2 strategic agreements. In November, we announced a 15-year agreement to lease DISH space on up to 20,000 of our tower sites. This strategic agreement established Crown Castle as DISH's anchor tower provider and includes certain fiber transport services to further support their nationwide 5G build-out. This agreement will contribute to our financial results over time as DISH deploys on our tower sites, and we expect to start in the back half of this year. We're excited to partner with DISH to support their long-term infrastructure needs and look forward to working with them as they deploy nationwide 5G network.
As we announced yesterday, we are also excited that we have expanded our strategic relationship with Verizon by signing a long-term small cell agreement to support Verizon's 5G ultra-wide band and 5G nationwide deployment. Under this agreement, Verizon has committed to lease 15,000 new small cells, representing the largest small cell award in our history and demonstrating the value of sharing small cell and fiber infrastructure assets with multiple customers. 
While we believe it is our ability to provide the full breadth of wireless infrastructure assets that allowed us to secure the agreements with DISH and Verizon, highlighting the benefits of the unique portfolio we have built over the last 20 years. With our 40,000 towers and 80,000 route miles of high-capacity fiber concentrated in the top U.S. markets, we believe we will continue to reap the rewards of our investments as our customers continue to roll out their nationwide 5G network.
As we noted in our press release, late last year, T-Mobile notified us that they were canceling approximately 5,700 small cells that we initially contracted with Sprint. The majority of the small cells were yet to be constructed and would have been located at the same locations as other T-Mobile small cells once completed. The Sprint cancellation resulted in T-Mobile accelerating the payment of all contractual rent obligations for those small cells as well as the payment of capital costs we had already incurred. 
In addition to receiving the future rent associated with the canceled nodes, the small cell locations are now again available for future customers. And this development does not impact the long-term growth opportunity for our small cell business. As a result, we finished 2020 with approximately 50,000 small cells on air, and we have meaningfully increased our backlog of small cells committed or under construction to approximately 30,000.
As I reflect on 2020, I'm proud of how well our team delivered for our customers and our shareholders during a difficult operating environment. Looking forward, I'm excited about the growth opportunity as our customers embark on what is likely to be a decade-long investment cycle to develop 5G in what remains the best wireless market in the world. 
Our strategy remains unchanged as we focus on delivering the highest risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders by growing our dividend and investing in assets we believe will drive future growth, and I believe Crown Castle offers shareholders an unmatched opportunity to benefit from the launch of 5G wireless networks. We provide a compelling total return opportunity with a high-quality dividend yielding more than 3%. We are delivering the highest tower revenue growth rate in the U.S. among our peers. We expect to generate double-digit AFFO per share growth this year, even before 5G spending occurs in earnest. 
Our customers are affirming the value we bring with our comprehensive portfolio of shared infrastructure assets by entering into long-term agreements to access those assets, and we are investing in new infrastructure assets that we expect will extend the opportunity to grow dividends per share 7% to 8% per year. I believe this combination is as compelling for future value creation as we've ever seen at Crown Castle.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dan."

As Jay mentioned, our 2020 financial results add to our long history of consistently delivering attractive growth. Specifically, we increased dividends per share by 8%, which reflects our commitment to return capital to shareholders and demonstrate our ability to grow through various market cycles. We delivered approximately 6% growth in organic contribution to site rental revenue, and we continue to improve our financial flexibility as we lowered our weighted average borrowing costs, extended the average maturity of our debt and reduced our leverage.
Before I walk through the financial results in more detail, I wanted to briefly discuss the nontypical items described in our earnings release yesterday that impacted fourth quarter and full year 2020 results. The Sprint cancellation Jay mentioned generated the biggest of these impacts, including an increase to other operating income, partially offset by a related increase in operating expense and the write-off of capital already spent on the construction of the canceled nodes. Additionally, we implemented a reduction in staffing primarily in our fiber segment that resulted in associated severance costs in the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter and full year 2020 net benefit of these nontypical items, which were not contemplated in our prior full year 2020 outlook on both adjusted EBITDA and AFFO, is approximately $286 million. We do not anticipate the nontypical items will have a material impact on our 2021 outlook, which remains consistent with the outlook we've provided in October. To make the financial figures in this earnings presentation more comparable, full year 2020 results and growth figures for full year 2021 have been adjusted to exclude the impact of these nontypical items.
Turning to Slide 4 of the presentation. Full year 2020 results were consistent with our prior expectations with site rental revenues and adjusted EBITDA increasing 4%, while AFFO increased 9% when compared to full year 2019. The 4% growth in site rental revenues included approximately 6% growth in the organic contribution to site rental revenues, consisting of approximately 5% growth from towers, 15% growth from small cells and 3% growth from fiber solutions.
Focusing on investment activity during the year, we deployed approximately $1.5 billion toward discretionary investments in 2020, including $1.2 billion for fiber and approximately $320 million for towers. These investments were balanced with approximately $2.1 billion paid in common stock dividends or $4.93 per share, representing 8% growth when compared to dividends paid during 2019.
Now turning to Slide 5. Our full year 2021 outlook remains unchanged with 4% growth in site rental revenues, 5% growth in adjusted EBITDA and 12% growth in AFFO. 
As shown on Slide 6, the expected 4% growth in site rental revenues includes approximately 6% growth in the organic contribution to site rental revenues, consisting of approximately 6% growth from towers, 15% growth from small cells and 3% growth from fiber solutions. As a reminder, DISH has publicly stated they expect to begin their network deployment later this year, so our outlook does not include a material contribution from DISH's build-out. Likewise, our recent agreement with Verizon is not expected to have a material impact on 2021 results.
As it relates to the balance sheet, we finished the year with approximately 4x debt to EBITDA on a last quarter annualized basis, which includes the net benefit from the nontypical items discussed earlier. Adjusting to include those items as onetime impacts that are not annualized, our leverage would have been approximately 5x. During 2020, we improved our balance sheet flexibility by extending the weighted average maturity by nearly 2 years, reducing our average borrowing cost by 40 basis points and reducing our leverage to our target of approximately 5x. 
Looking forward, our expectation for 2021 capital expenditures remains unchanged at approximately $1.5 billion. We expect we will be able to once again fund this discretionary capital with free cash flow and incremental borrowings, consistent with our investment-grade credit profile.
As I wrap up, we are excited about the positive demand trends in the U.S. wireless market and the opportunity we see to translate that demand into double-digit growth in AFFO per share this year. Looking further out, we believe our focus on the U.S. market and our ability to offer a broad portfolio of towers, small cells and fiber solutions, which are all integral components of communications networks, provides us the best opportunity to deliver superior long-term, risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders.
Before we open the call to questions, I want to also mention that we were recently informed by the SEC that they have concluded the previously disclosed investigation and that they do not currently intend to pursue an enforcement action.
With that, David, I'd like to open the call to questions."

Thanks, Mike. A few things I would mention about this. And obviously, we're careful about the commercial terms under which we negotiate with the customers, but I think there are a few things that we can speak to related to it.
First is the returns that we would expect to gain from this agreement are consistent with the long-term approach that we've taken with deploying small cells. So initial yields of 6% to 7%, if they were to be the anchor deployment and then if they were to be a co-location on existing infrastructure, it would take those returns into the yields on invested capital into the low double digits. So from a return standpoint, really consistent with what we've seen historically.
We don't know the exact locations that these nodes that they've committed to will ultimately land in, so I can't be more specific than that. In terms of what the returns will look like, we'll have to let some time pass and see as they identify the locations, and then we'll update that, obviously, as we go.
I do think broadly, this is a -- the Verizon agreement is a real affirmation of our small cell strategy, and they believe there's real value in a third party providing the infrastructure to them. And I think we're in a great position to do that. So we're focused on making sure we deliver for them and help them get their 5G launched. And this agreement is really -- it's the floor. It's the beginning of what we think is a big start towards 5G, and I think we'll see more of this as time passes as we work to build out these 5G networks, but this is the early days and the start of something pretty exciting that we're doing with Verizon."

Obviously, we're trying everything we can to increase the speed at which we deploy small cells. It's a very difficult and challenging activity to get through the process of working with local communities, making sure the way we design these is consistent with the aesthetic that they would want in their particular communities. And so I don't really have any update to the time line that we're typically seeing as we deploy these. It's generally kind of 2 to 3 years from the time that we identify a location to where we're ultimately able to build them. But there is a lot of work that we're doing, trying to figure out ways to do that faster for our customers. And obviously, it's to the benefit of their networks to be able to get them out there faster. 
But there's also a component to this that, as we've talked about, similar to towers, these are very high barriers to entry at the local community level. And so the careful work that we have to do with those communities to make sure we're sensitive to the aesthetics that they want as well as building these within the parameters that they desire into their community is critically important and something we're really focused on making sure we balance those 2 desires for speed as well as doing things the right way.
The question on the FCC and the support that we've seen from the regulatory agency there over time, I think, will continue. Obviously, it's a big push of the current administration to have broadband for all, and they have been very supportive in their public comments about the need and necessity for 5G to be deployed in the U.S. and to lead the world in 5G deployment. So I think the operating environment in which we're both co-locating on existing assets as well as making investments into future assets, I think the environment that we see from a regulatory standpoint will be pretty similar to what we've seen over the last several years.
On your last question around C-Band and the impact on 2021. Obviously, the auction is just drawing to a conclusion now, and I think we will see later in this year as the carriers start to speak about what their actual deployment plans for that spectrum will be. As we think about the outlook that we've provided, we really didn't include any impact from C-Band. And I think given the calendar, it's probably unlikely that, that would contribute to our financial results in calendar 2021. But as we get into the year and the auction gets completely wrapped up and carriers can speak to the spectrum positions that they gained, I think we'll be able to provide more clarity at that point, probably later this year as we think about 2022 and beyond."

Obviously, there were a number of employees that were affected by that and had done a great job for us, and I wish them all the best in their next endeavors.
As I think about, strategically, around small cells and the fiber business and what we're seeing, there are a lot of positive developments. Obviously, the completion of the agreement with Verizon is a really positive development. We're going to be working hard for them to help them get their network on air. The beginning of the launch of 5G creates another opportunity for cell site densification and then the work that we've talked about over the last several years around 4G. I think the carriers are going to continue to densify their 4G networks. In addition to the investment that they've made -- that they're going to make on the 5G side, I think we'll continue to see 4G sites deployed and -- over time there.
Great to have our new COO in place, Chris Levendos. He's been with the company for a number of years.

Just curious if that's correct, and again, just trying to get a better sense on the quantification.

And I know you're referencing some of the materials that are available in our supplement, which I would encourage investors to take a look at, if we break down details by customer by year. 
Big picture, there's 5 years weighted average remaining on the T-Mobile and legacy Sprint contracts. There's about -- on a consolidated basis, there's about 5% of our revenues that are overlapping sites, sites where both Sprint and then legacy Sprint and T-Mobile are co-located on. And we've used that as kind of a bookend of what the potential impact around churn could be. 
At this point, there are no specifics of what their plans are that we have to share. So being specific about what will exactly happen in '23 or '28, we're not prepared to speak to that because we don't know. Broadly, though, I think, and this is where your question is going, broadly, we're always open to working with our customers on structures that meet their needs without compromising our own economics under those lease agreements. We were really intentional several years ago with both Sprint and T-Mobile about extending the agreements that we had -- tower agreements that we had with them over multiple years, and that's why we sit here today with 5-year weighted average life remaining. Obviously, that gives us significant ability to navigate through the work that they're going to do around finding synergies in their network. And I think they will find synergies in the network, and we'll be impacted to some degree by that.
But I think it's also true that we've grown through past events of churn, past events of consolidation, and I'm comfortable that we'll be able to do the same. So as we talk about our long-term goal of being able to grow the dividend 7% to 8% per year, we think about that in the context of a multitude of different opportunities and risks at the top line. And on balance, I think we'll be able to navigate through the one that you're raising here without any significant challenges to our long-term growth rate and targeted dividends per share."

And so it makes sense that the current site density is insufficient to fully utilize them. 
So the question I have is what about the tower inventory? Tower, historically, have been built in locations that are optimized around the frequency bands carriers were using. So are you seeing an emerging opportunity to maybe more meaningfully reengage your tower construction business for your own use because it's been a while since you've materially built out your portfolio? And then are there any other infrastructure categories that might become increasingly attractive for you to invest in as carriers look at a new degree of density, whether that's helping them build out indoor systems where they can make better use of these high frequencies and maybe looking at the economics around rooftops?"

Obviously, the deployment of the spectrum and the acquisition of the spectrum by the carrier is going to need both macro sites and small cells. And similar to the past deployments, I think probably in the early days, we'll see that more weighted towards the macro site. 
But the -- where you went with your question around the build of additional assets, the opportunity to build additional towers in the U.S. is really, really limited, and I don't think anything about this spectrum auction is going to change that. So I would not expect that you're going to see either our own allocation of capital or, frankly, investment across our industry broadly, whether that's the large players, public players in the space or even the smaller players in the space. I don't think you're going to see a significant increase in the amount of tower build that happened in the country. It is very, very difficult to co-locate -- or to build new assets, new tower assets in the top 100, top 150 markets in the U.S. That is basically blanketed with an -- with the tower infrastructure that's there today. 
The opportunity to densify is really going to come with fiber and small cells. And it's why we made the investment many years ago, got ourselves into the space and started to learn how to build it, how to deploy it and get the right kind of assets for where the world was headed. We saw this densification coming and the need for it, realized that macro towers wouldn't be able to entirely meet that need. And so we began to invest in the complementary assets of small cells and fiber that are going to make this densification possible. 
So I think you'll see co-locations on towers. Towers is going to see a great amount of growth from the deployment of these spectrum bands, and then I think you're really going to see the reason why we originally made these investments and have continued to make the investments. As densification happens, I think that will happen in great amounts on fiber and small cells.
Are there other areas of infrastructure that are interesting to us? You spoke to in-building. There are some small number of in-building systems that we are doing. We find venues to be attractive when they meet our rigorous approach to allocating capital, if they exceed our returns and we think there's co-location there. Some of those make sense. But frankly, in terms of the scale of investment, it's really relatively small compared to what we see in the more public right-of-way opportunities to do infill and site densification with small cells and fiber, complementing the tower portfolios that are out there. So I don't see anything on the horizon currently that would cause us to deviate from our plan of the primary investment opportunities in front of us are small cell related."

But if I think about long term, 10 years, 15 years, 20 years out, in the top 100 markets, I think virtually all of the spectrum bands that the carriers have today will be operating all of those spectrum bands over time. The carriers will upgrade their equipment. They'll add additional lines and antennas and ultimately be broadcasting all of the spectrum bands that they have for the -- on the vast, vast majority of the macro tower sites that they're on.
And then I think based on the amount of usage that ultimately happens, you'll see them be targeted in terms of the deployment and densification inside of those markets to supplement and extend the -- and expand the network capacity by utilizing fiber and small cells to make those macro sites as efficient as they possibly can. 
That generally happens over a period of time. So if we go back in history and watch and look at how the carriers have deployed network, you can almost look at kind of the top urban markets, the most densely populated, and those will see the benefit of this kind of activity first.

So as I mentioned earlier, we try to avoid getting into too much detail around the commercial -- the key commercial terms of the agreement. But what -- the commitment there, it's similar to what we would have seen historically from a tower standpoint, where the carrier is making a commitment to us of a certain number of sites. And obviously, we're making a commitment to Verizon to extend the capital to deploy those small cells for them. 
So as we get into the agreement and time passes, then we'll be identifying together the appropriate sites that meet our rigorous return thresholds. And there may be other locations that they have an interest to build small cells that really don't clear our investment hurdles, and they'll end up finding -- building it themselves or finding another third party to provide those. But we'll really just have to go through a passage of time and see ultimately how that comes out.
But the commitment is 15,000 small cells over a long period of time. They're making a 10-year commitment to us in terms of rent on those 15,000 sites, and the rent will commence once we install and build the small cells.

The dynamics and physics of the way these wireless networks work, in the places where we operate infrastructure towers and small cells and fiber, I really don't see any opportunity for satellite to be a meaningful component of the network. Frankly, I think it will be a very, very small component, if any at all, over time. 
The ability to transfer data quickly as well as the time it takes to move the data from earth to even a low-orbit satellite is going to create just too much latency in the network to be a viable competitor to the terrestrial-based infrastructure that makes up the vast majority of the infrastructure in the market today. 
I think there are places, though, particularly really rural locations where some of the low-orbit satellite opportunities could be really interesting of a way of the delivering broadband to places that just economically don't make sense to build terrestrial networks, too.
And then the other place where I think there will be opportunity over time is in disaster recovery situations where you have -- we've seen this happen in Puerto Rico a couple of years ago and other places where there's a targeted area that needs to be covered. And I think you'll -- you may see some solutions. People have talked about balloons. They've talked about satellites. I really think those are short-term solutions, except in rural locations, but could be helpful in a disaster recovery situation where there's a small area of the terrestrial network that's been removed as a result of a natural disaster, could be interesting in those locations. But beyond that, I really don't see any meaningful portion of the wireless networks that are going to be handled that way.
And I think you can point to -- obviously, we can point to the agreements that our customers are signing. If you look at what DISH just committed to us on -- for the deployment of their network as well as the behavior of our customers, I don't -- I think our contracts speak to the fact that they believe this is -- this terrestrial-based infrastructure and towers and small cells is the way that networks are going to be deployed over the long period of time."

As is typically the case going into the first quarter, there's seasonality to it. So we would expect a downtick going into Q1 in the services business and also some incremental costs that we see that generally happen in the first quarter around property taxes and employee expenses, things like that. But nothing that I would say is indicative of a change in our expectation around activity that's happening in the tower business going forward."

To your second question, Tim, and I spoke to some of this in the prepared remarks. But there's a long history of what happens in the U.S. after large spectrum auctions, and that leads to a significant demand for our tower infrastructure and believe this will be similar for our fiber and small cells. And this is a dynamic that will be beneficial to our industry and particularly to our company, and we expect that to be the exact same case once the C-Band spectrum is in the hands of carriers and they're ready to deploy it.
More spectrum is obviously needed. Much has been written on this topic. The FCC has talked about it. The carriers have talked about it that more spectrum is absolutely needed in order to meet this 30-plus percent annual demand of growth in wireless data. And the significant investment that the carriers are making today in that spectrum can only meet that growing demand and generate for -- generate returns for our customers once it's actually deployed. So spectrum goes first and then the operators then deploy that spectrum, and that goes really well for the infrastructure providers. 
To the extent, as you were alluding to, that the size of the check raises questions about the capacity for future investment going forward, I think it further highlights the value proposition that we offer as a shared infrastructure provider. We're offering capital, in essence, to the wireless carriers across our towers and small cells, and it's cheaper for them to deploy that spectrum that they acquire across the shared asset because we're willing to take the risk that we'll be able to get multiple users and thereby reduce the cost to the carriers of deploying that spectrum across the market.
So I think it feeds right into our value proposition, and it's one of the most encouraging things that happens in our infrastructure business. Once the spectrum is in the hands of the operators, we're able to come alongside the operators and provide a shared infrastructure solution to help them get it deployed. And I think the C-Band auction is just another example of how the run rate -- the runway of growth is extended in the business and should lead to great things in our industry and for our business."

One of the things -- just thought might bring up in terms of making parallels to the history and passage of time of small cells and towers. If you think back over the last 20 years of the tower business, the commitments that have been made by the carriers and that have been announced when they commit to a number of new installations or new sites with us, those commitments help establish protocols that enable us, both sides of the agreement, to work collectively and easily through the deployment cycles. And the establishment of a number, like in the case of the Verizon commitment of 15,000 small cells, it enables both parties to set up some ease of doing business together that, frankly, just make it easier for us to go through the process of deploying infrastructure for them. 
The same thing has been true on the tower side. But if you zoom out and think about the last 20 years, the same thing was true on the tower side. The carriers, over time, have made commitments to us for a certain number of new sites that they'll co-locate on or that we'll build for them, but those are a fraction of the overall tower activity that they ultimately did with us.
I think the same thing is true on the small cell side. So commitments by the carriers are helpful. I think they're helpful data points for investors to look at and to see that there's commitments by the carriers towards future deployment. But our expectation is that this is more the start of the floor of the activity and that the business will follow more the pattern of the history of the tower business where it establishes the ability for the companies to do business relatively easily. But ultimately, the amount of sites that gets deployed will be far in excess of the sites that just show up on commitments that are talked about in grand scale. 
And that's the nature of the type of business that we're doing, where this is really a local business. So working with the local markets at each of the carriers to ensure that we're providing an infrastructure solution that meets their need at the local market area is really how we transact with our customers. And some of these agreements, like the one with Verizon, enabled that to happen more easily."

Is that bottleneck in terms of deployment actually may be an advantage for you guys to lever in terms of initial yields? If you could talk about that.
And then the second question was, you evolved on a ton of work on DISH and what they might be doing with open RAN and then beating that to death. But one of the things that has come up in that is that there's this new generation of multi-beam antennas that have much broader range than normal, and that's what DISH's intention is in order to exploit a pretty diverse spectrum portfolio. Do you see any line of sight to the possibility that the carriers are kind of forced through the C-Band process, simply that every one of their towers to kind of come back and maybe economize on their footprint on a tower?"

I'm not sure there's much more to add there in terms of we think we're going to be building about 10,000 per year. The places where we could increase the pace of that building would largely be around gaining municipality approvals, permits. And I don't see anything in the current environment that would suggest the pace at which we're doing that would increase or decrease meaningfully from the current operating environment. But we're going to continue to work at it and see opportunities. To the extent that we get kind of a breakthrough there and that changes, we'll obviously let you know.
The other thing I would just mention about this is that the amount of revenue that are -- is added site rental revenue that comes online from small cells is based on the return profile of the systems that we're building or that carriers are deploying on, so there can be pretty significant variance in terms of what those revenues look like on a per-node basis based on the environment in which we're putting those nodes into and what the underlying costs associated with that deployment is. 
We think about pricing small cells much more on a return basis rather than just the price per node. It's driven by what our returns are. So that may be part of what causes -- as you kind of do the math and think about it, that's probably the -- one of the places that I would point to is maybe a little bit of a difference in the way that we think and as we're operating the business.
On your second question around DISH and the antennas and how do the carriers economize their network, I think the carriers will continue to use technology to reduce the amount of cell sites that are ultimately needed or antennas or lines that are ultimately needed on infrastructure. It's a way of reducing their deployment costs for deploying sites. And we've seen that happen over a long period of time. I know there've been a number of studies that have talked about how the use of next-generation antennas over time have increased the ability for the carriers to cover a particular location. We've talked about MIMO antennas and the benefits of those of reducing some of the deployment costs. 
And I would expect the carriers will continue to be really thoughtful about how they allocate the capital and use technology to reduce the cost of those deployments. And ultimately, that adheres to our benefit. As they reduced the actual cost to deploy, it enables there to be more capital for them to deploy additional sites. So it's synergistic in terms of the densification process that they use technology to reduce the costs. They're able to put more of that capital into densifying their network, which obviously a [indiscernible] benefit."

And that growth in dividends of 7% to 8% per year per share, we think we can do that over a long period of time. 
Obviously, the law of large numbers is at play in our business because it's a fixed asset that's put in the ground. And then upon which, we start to add co-location and growth. And when we have one tenant on them and add the second tenant, the revenue grows by 100%. And then when we add the third tenant, the growth rate on that individual asset is much lower than it was when we added just second tenant. 
So absolutely, the path that has been followed by towers will be followed by small cells where the growth rate comes down. But growth rates don't ultimately drive the value in our business. It's about the return on the invested capital that ultimately adheres to the benefit of shareholders. So our focus around where we're investing the capital and where we see the growth opportunities are about expanding those returns across that investment base and the assets that we own.

I think it represents a significant investment on the case of -- by Verizon. It's the largest in our company history in terms of the commitment by any customer to us. So from a scale standpoint, it would point to sort of a meaningful increase or inflection point, as you described it, from what we've seen historically. 
I think that -- and I made these comments a little bit earlier around thinking about the Verizon agreement is more of a floor than a ceiling, but the agreement is also a significant investment commitment of capital on our part.
And as you know, when we invest for these multiple -- as we invest -- make those investments, we're thinking about multiple carriers that are ultimately going to need these sites in order for us to make those investments. And we're not going to do all of the small cells in the market. So there are going to be locations, markets, where, frankly, the growth in small cells are not going to align with places where we think there will be multiple carriers. And so we're not going to do it all. And the carriers need flexibility when they make commitments to be able to go out and build where they're -- they have need but in places where our -- we don't think our returns are going to align with that. And when that happens, then they'll either use another third party or they'll build it themselves.
So I think there will be -- as Dan was speaking to a moment ago, I think there will continue to be growth over a long period of time, and we will see increasing numbers of small cells. And I think the Verizon agreement is sort of a first step towards the benefit that's going to come with 5G and the increased need for small cells. And I think you'll see -- you are going to see, I believe, millions of small cells ultimately in the U.S. market. And we'll get our share of those in places where we own the fiber, but there's also going to be lots of places where the carriers decide to do it themselves. And some of that will be because, frankly, we don't see the opportunity to put capital to work at risk-adjusted returns that make sense for our shareholders."

Let me just try the question one more way. Forget about law of large numbers. Again, I realize that the small cell opportunity is massive over time when it comes. But if you only add, again, a certain number of nodes every year, by definition, the law of large numbers kicks in.

The business -- I mean just stepping back from it. And it's a good question to say, ""Okay. At what point do you ultimately get the returns in the business?"" And I think a couple of quarters ago, we went back and walked through kind of what we saw on the tower space.
It took us nearly or like I think a little over 10 years just to get to the point where we were clearing the cost of capital on the tower side from a return standpoint. This is a business that's marked by making sure we get the right locations early and then, over time, incrementally growing those returns. 
And there's nothing that I see in the small cell business that would say our yield on invested assets from a fiber standpoint is north of 7% today, and it's basically right around where our blended cost of capital is. And I don't see anything on the horizon that would suggest to me that we're going to market -- see a significant increase in the yield in that capital. 
What I do think will happen over a long period of time through operating the business well, adding co-locations is we'll incrementally increase that yield over a long period of time, such that when we look back after 10 or 20 years, we look at it and see the benefit of the investment that we're making, which is really incumbent upon us then as we think about where do we put the capital, we're trying to align that with the places that are most likely to need that lease-up over a long period of time in the exact same way that we did it with towers.
And as we talked about a couple of quarters ago, as we took a deep dive into certain markets, then we'll update that again and the midyear of 2021. As we go down to the market level and to the asset level, we can see it playing out exactly like that, where in certain markets where the investments are really new and early, the yields on the invested capital are relatively low. In markets where we've been in for a long period of time and the assets have started to see the co-location, then the returns that you're asking about start to come to fruition.
Big picture, the entire pie of opportunity, we think, directionally, is going to increase over time. And if you ask my really long view, then, yes, I think there is going to be a day when we're doing meaningfully more small cells than what we're doing in the calendar year. But then we'll have to look at, ""Okay. What's the appropriate capital base against that?"" And as time passes, then we'll update you on what that looks like and where the opportunity is."

They're different because of the actual dynamics that are occurring in the market in the situations that the customers are in with the assets. 
In the case of DISH, they have no existing infrastructure or they're not on any meaningful number of tower sites in the market. So they're deploying a nationwide network, and it is helpful and cost-effective for them to pick an anchor provider upon which they design their entire network around. They chose Crown Castle to do that, we believe, in part, because of the quality of our tower assets as well as our ability to deliver fiber transport services to them. And that means that they're anchoring or building, designing their network around our sites. We think that creates a significant opportunity for us, both in the near-term years to come, but also over the long term, as they deploy that network. 
I can't think of another example in the last 15 years where a carrier, from scratch, was looking at deploying a nationwide network. So I think the basic idea of having to deploy a network from scratch drives the need to pick an anchor provider and then work closely with them, and we're obviously pleased to be their partner and working hard to deliver on their expectations of getting their network built. 
In the case of Verizon, again, I would point to some of the comments that I made before that whenever there's a commitment of size like this and obviously the largest one we've ever done with a carrier with Verizon this quarter that we're announcing, this creates, really, an opportunity for us to work together through some of the operating protocols to make sure that we're able to work together well. And the commitment and size enables us to go do that work together as to how we're going to work together. And we think it's a good start for the deployment of 5G small cells, but it's just to start and think there will be more to come. I think there will be some operating benefits going through this for us and then ultimately the returns as we both co-locate those nodes on existing infrastructure and then deploy capital to build anchor nodes for them in places where we think there will be future returns."

Brandon, similar to history, as the carriers transition from the current generation, whatever that is, to the next generation of infrastructure, they go through a process of going through their network, generally starting in the most urban densely populated areas, converting those networks into the new generation, in this case, converting towards 5G, and then over time, moving themselves out from that core to more rural locations. 
And the carriers have been in the process of converting 3G networks into 4G networks for better part of the last decade. And I think as we build out 5G, that will be at least a decade-long process would be our estimation. And you'll see the carriers continue to convert legacy 3G into either 4G or maybe skipping a generation and going directly to 5G.

So being really specific as to what the opportunity of dollars per site will ultimately be for us is probably more precise than we're able to be.
But directionally, in terms of return on assets, both on the tower side and on the small cell side, I think the deployment of these spectrum bands enables us to increase both our revenues and gross margin at the per-site level and then most importantly increase our yield on assets over time as we lease up the assets."

(REIT), Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2021",2021-04-22,"Earnings Calls","Crown Castle Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on the call. As you saw from our first quarter results and increased full year outlook, our consistent execution is delivering outstanding results as we support our customers' growth initiat",1101,"Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on the call. 
As you saw from our first quarter results and increased full year outlook, our consistent execution is delivering outstanding results as we support our customers' growth initiatives with their deployment of nationwide 5G in the U.S. Following a period of building excitement and anticipation, we have seen a significant increase in activity as our customers have started to upgrade their networks to 5G at scale. We expect this elevated level of activity to result in a year of outsized growth for Crown Castle as we now anticipate 11% growth in AFFO per share for the full year 2021, meaningfully above our long-term annual target of 7% to 8%. 
Beyond 2021, I believe our strategy and unmatched portfolio of more than 40,000 towers, approximately 80,000 small cells on air or committed in backlog and 80,000 route miles of fiber concentrated in the top U.S. markets have positioned Crown Castle to generate growth in cash flows and dividends per share for years to come. 
Our strategy is to deliver the highest risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders by growing our dividend and investing in assets that will drive future growth. That focus has led us to invest in towers, small cells and fiber assets that are all foundational for the development of 5G networks in the U.S. We believe the series of strategic agreements that we have announced in recent months further highlights the synergistic value our shared infrastructure provides to our customers. 
Building on the momentum from our recent 15-year agreement with DISH to support our nationwide 5G build-out and our recent long-term 5G small cell agreement with Verizon to support their network deployment, we are excited to once again expand our strategic relationship with Verizon through a recent long-term tower leasing agreement. We believe this agreement will deliver significant value for both parties as it establishes terms for leasing additional capacity on existing tower sites with a structure that is intended to make it easier to expedite the deployment of C-band equipment over the next several years. The agreement also resulted in an increase in the average remaining current contracted lease term under our Verizon site leases to approximately 10 years. Dan will discuss the expected financial impact of this agreement later in the call. 
Turning back to our focus on generating superior long-term returns, one of our core principles of our strategy is to remain U.S. only, because we believe it represents the best market for wireless infrastructure ownership since it has the most attractive growth profile and the lowest risk. And we believe this dynamic of higher growth and lower risk will continue into the future which is why we expect our U.S.-based strategy to drive significant returns for our shareholders. 
Starting with the higher growth we see in the U.S., the demand for our shared infrastructure offering across towers, small cells and fiber is tied to the robust demand for mobile data in the U.S. which continues to increase by more than 30% annually. Because the outlook is so compelling, the U.S. wireless market continues to attract a disproportionate amount of global capital investment. This is likely due in part to the fact that the durability and scale of wireless data growth in the U.S. has repeatedly outperformed expectations. 
I remember fielding questions from investors and analysts nearly a decade ago trying to understand why we were not expanding our tower business into less established international markets that offered the promise of outsized growth to compensate for the outsized risk. The core set of assumptions underpinning that line of questioning included a view by many that it was inevitable that U.S. growth rates would slow, leading to a desire to augment that growth by investing in international wireless markets that hopefully would develop the same key set of fundamentals over time that has made the U.S. market so successful for decades. 
We didn't buy into that argument at the time, and sitting here today, on the doorsteps of 5G, we reached a similar conclusion that the U.S. is still among the highest growth markets for wireless infrastructure. Importantly, in a shared infrastructure business with long-term investment horizons, we have benefited from these superior growth rates while avoiding the risks associated with investment opportunities in less established international wireless market. These risks can have a meaningful impact on long-term returns, and many have materialized in recent years, including the outsized churn due to less favorable industry dynamics relative to the U.S., sustained foreign currency devaluation that results in revenue churn and disruptive social or governmental environments in less developed countries. 
Because we believe the U.S. has both greater potential for growth and lower risk, we are focused on growing cash flows on our 40,000 towers by providing access to existing and new customers that are building 5G wireless network. We are investing in new small cell and fiber assets that our customers need for their wireless networks which we believe increases our ability to capitalize on the 5G growth trends in the U.S. And we are developing new capabilities and offerings that will leverage our existing assets to drive innovation and we believe will further extend our growth opportunity, such as CBRS and edge computing. 
I believe that Crown Castle offers shareholders an unmatched opportunity to benefit from the launch of 5G wireless networks in the U.S. In the near to medium term, we expect to deliver outsized AFFO per share growth of 11% this year as we translate this increasing 5G activity into very attractive bottom line growth. We expect to once again deliver the highest tower revenue growth rate in the U.S. among our public tower peers in 2021. And our customers are affirming the value we bring with our comprehensive portfolio of shared wireless infrastructure assets by entering into long-term agreements to access those assets. 
Longer term, we believe Crown Castle provides an exciting opportunity for shareholders to potentially compound double-digit total returns over a long period of time with a high-quality dividend that currently yields 3% and that we expect to be able to grow 7% to 8% annually. 
When I consider the durability of the underlying demand trends we see in the U.S. that provide significant visibility into the future growth for our business, the deliberate decisions we have made to reduce the risks associated with our strategy and our history of steady execution, I believe that Crown Castle stands out as a unique investment that will generate compelling returns over time. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dan."

Good morning, everyone. As Jay mentioned, we are excited to see our customers beginning to deploy 5G at scale.

As Jay mentioned, we are excited to see our customers beginning to deploy 5G at scale. We have seen a significant increase in activity levels, leading to solid first quarter results that exceeded our expectations and support our increased full year guidance. 
Turning to Slide 4 of our earnings presentation. You can see our strong top line results were driven by more than 6% growth and organic contribution to site rental revenue. This growth included more than 9% growth from new leasing activity and contracted escalators, net of approximately 3% from nonrenewals. 
We also generated a $23 million increase in contribution from services when compared to the first quarter 2020, culminating in 10% growth in adjusted EBITDA and 20% growth in AFFO per share on a year-over-year basis. 
Turning to Slide 5. We increased our full year AFFO guidance by $40 million, reflecting a $25 million increase in expected services contribution as a result of higher-than-expected tower activity levels, and a $30 million reduction to interest expense following our successful recent refinancing activities, partially offset by $15 million of additional labor-related costs associated with the higher activity levels. 
Additionally, as Jay discussed, we entered into a long-term tower leasing agreement with Verizon that resulted in increasing the average current lease term of our Verizon tower site leases to approximately 10 years and adding straight-line revenue of approximately $140 million in 2021. 
Taking these changes into account, we now expect our adjusted EBITDA to be $150 million higher than our previously provided 2021 outlook. Our expectation for site rental revenue growth has increased to approximately 7%, inclusive of the expected organic contribution to site rental revenues of 6%, which remains unchanged. 
Our expectation for growth -- organic growth across towers, small cells and fiber solutions, also remain consistent, with approximately 6% growth from towers, approximately 15% growth from small cells and approximately 3% growth from fiber solutions. 
Focusing on investment activities, during the first quarter, capital expenditures totaled $302 million, including $17 million of sustaining capital expenditures, $49 million of discretionary capital expenditures for our tower segment and $225 million of discretionary capital expenditures for our fiber segment. 
Our full year expectation for capital expenditures remains unchanged at approximately $1.5 billion or less than $1 billion after customer cash flow contributions. And we continue to expect to fund our discretionary investments this year with free cash flow and incremental borrowings. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the first quarter at approximately 5.5x net debt-to-EBITDA and expect to exit 2021 at our target leverage of approximately 5x based on the anticipated growth and cash flows through the balance of the year. 
As Jay discussed, in addition to driving significant dividend growth, a key part of our strategy is to reduce the overall risk profile of the business to further enhance the value created for shareholders over time. Along with focusing on what we believe is the highest-growth and lowest-risk market in the world for wireless infrastructure ownership, we have methodically reduced the risk profile of our balance sheet with the same goal of maximizing long-term shareholder value. With that in mind, we were able to opportunistically access the bond market during the first quarter to refinance upcoming maturities, reduce our debt costs and extend our maturity profile. 
Looking back 5 years to when we achieved our initial investment grade credit rating, and inclusive of our recent refinancing transaction, we have increased our debt -- average debt maturity to nearly 10 years from just over 5 years, reduced our average borrowing cost to 3.1% from 3.8%, increased our mix of fixed-rate debt to more than 90% from just under 70% and reduced our reliance on secured debt to just 15% from nearly 50%. With limited upcoming debt maturities in the near term and more than $4 billion of undrawn capacity on our revolving credit facility, we believe the balance sheet is positioned well to support our growth initiatives. 
Turning back to the growth side of the value equation and to wrap things up, we are excited about the increasing level of activity we are seeing as our customers begin to deploy 5G at scale. Our customers continue to recognize the differentiated value our comprehensive shared infrastructure offering brings, leading them to sign significant long-term agreements with us. We expect to once again generate industry-leading U.S. tower revenue growth this year. And we expect to generate 11% growth in AFFO per share in 2021, which provides a very attractive total return opportunity when combined with the current 3% dividend yield. Importantly, we are generating these returns while making strategic investments in new small cell and fiber assets that we believe will add to our long-term growth opportunity. 
And with that, Vicki, I'd like to open the call to questions."

We're not surprised by the urgency that our customers are showing in deploying 5G. The level of commitment that they showed during the C-band auction was really a clear sign that they're going to invest heavily in 5G. And so the activity we're seeing, I think, just flows from that. We're seeing that turn into actions as they're deploying significant amounts of 5G networks. And we're really encouraged by the activity that we're seeing. 
When we think about that activity translating towards revenue growth, we obviously saw a big step up towards the end of last year and that's continued into this first quarter. 
And as it relates to the services activity, obviously, most of that activity is either in the nature of preconstruction work that we're doing for carriers and then some portion of it carries over to work that we're doing as we actually install them on the site. 
So the elevated activity that we saw, the step-up we think sort of continues through the balance of this year and is a direct result of the overall encouraging level of activity that we're seeing from the carriers."

We think most of those assets that we wanted, we have purchased. There may be some others out there that meet the criteria we've looked at, being high-capacity dense metro fiber, but not a lot. So we anticipate most of our capital will go to organic growth in our business but also in fiber business."

I think it provides significant value and certainty to Verizon as well as to ourselves. And I think the significance of that agreement is obviously evidenced by the impact that it has on our 2021 outlook and the step-up that we put into that outlook last night in the press release. 
This really went through the same thought process that we've gone through over the last several years as we've done large transactions with the carriers on the MLA side, and have similar components to it, we're trying to meet the customers' needs, particularly with regards to certainty of price and then lowering or reducing the amount of time that it takes to go through the paper portion of getting them on to our site. So it's designed to facilitate their ability to go back to sites that they're already on and speed up that process of them being able to do upgrades. And obviously, they've been specific about the desire to do that with regards to C-band. 
And then on our side of it, we're trying to make sure that we price the economics of that transaction appropriately. And I think we've seen over multiple of those kinds of transactions with customers, multiple customers and multiple transactions over time, an ability to do that well, to both get the right economics on the site and then provide our customers with the right access and speed to get there. 
So we did something similar and has a lot of components to things that we've done in the past and thought about it in a similar way. We get the 10-year extension on the leases that they're already on which moves the maturity out from about 4 years to about 10 years on those sites. And then over the next several years, gives them an opportunity on those sites that they're already on to upgrade their equipment to handle new spectrum bands and to get that where they want it to be from a 5G standpoint. 
We still maintain the upside on new leasing and other activities associated with that. And then once we get past sort of this initial push into 5G, then obviously the opportunity is there for us to see greater growth over time. 
So excited about the agreement there and excited about what it means in terms of total activity. And as I said before in the prepared remarks, I think right on the doorsteps of seeing 5G deployments at scale enables us to be able to be responsive to Verizon's desires to get there."

We think on the fiber solutions side will be around 3% for the full year. And then towers right there at around 6%, as we previously expected.

And as we look at the full year, I think that's more indicative of the actual activity, what we're seeing from the carriers and how we expect those businesses to perform. 
On the services side and the cadence there, look, we're at a level of elevated activity. So we probably had a better first quarter in terms of services than we would in many years, where we often talk about years being back -- heavily back-end loaded to the second half or even towards the fourth quarter. And we saw a step-up in activity going into the end of last year. And that level of elevated activity just carried right into the first quarter. So we saw a real nice contribution from services in the first quarter and expect basically our full year assumption to be pretty similar to where we were previously with that adjustment for the first quarter."

It just seems like given how early you gave your guidance and how quickly the demand has kind of ramped that you wouldn't have necessarily included that. 
And then secondly, as it relates to the Verizon MLA, you talked about making it easier to deploy. And I guess one of the bigger questions people are trying to get a sense, that investors are trying to get a sense on, is whether or not the agreement includes just some standardized pricing to make it easier for them to move quicker or whether or not there's actually some type of financial benefit where you allow them to go to x amount of sites over x amount of period, shorter than that 10-year period, to kind of move quickly. And if that's the case, I would assume that there's some type of cash benefit, yet we didn't really see the AFFO change for that in particular.

On the first question around organic tower growth, a couple of things I would put in front of you on that. One is there's a pretty good lead time or lag time from the time that we see revenue start to turn on, start to g",670,"Colby, thanks for the questions. On the first question around organic tower growth, a couple of things I would put in front of you on that. 
One is there's a pretty good lead time or lag time from the time that we see revenue start to turn on, start to get the applications from the customers to when we actually see the revenues start to turn on. That's about 6 to 9 months. So the increased level of activity that we've been talking about for 2021 is something we did see all the way back into the fourth quarter of 2020. We started to see the application step up then, and that informed our increase in the overall activity. 
I was sort of curious to this point the other day and just looks back to kind of our organic revenue growth over the last 2017 through 2020. And the organic revenue growth in '21 is in our outlook is a step-up of a little over 25% of that average over those previous 4 years. So it's a meaningful increase in the activity, and we bake that into our outlook when we gave 2021. 
So what we're seeing now in terms of that activity is pretty consistent with what we had expected. But it's always good to see it materialized and then not just the expectations as where we were back in the October time frame. 
The other thing that I would mention about this is, as we look at this activity, we're encouraged and think that there's the opportunity for it to stay at this level of elevated activity for a period of time. So I think in the business, oftentimes people start to look for inflection points or points where it's going to be the highest and then expect it to kind of fall off. And our prior experience would tell us that those inflection points are relatively rare, that you see the carrier step up level of activities and hold at a plus or minus a certain amount for a long period of time. So when we look at that activity, really encouraged by what we're seeing and, frankly, not surprised. 
To the broader point on, as we look at revenue growth and activity, the way that we create value for shareholders is by stacking years of good growth one on top of another. And what is happening in the business right now is a tremendous year of growth, of growing that AFFO at 11% year-over-year on a per share basis and just stacking another year of great growth on top of what was a good base. And our goal is to consistently deliver that growth, like we've talked about over the long term, 7% to 8%. And what we're seeing at the top line certainly indicates our ability to achieve that longer-term goal. 
On your second question around the Verizon MLA, we try to stay away from getting too specific about the terms of the agreement that we do with our customers. We'll let them speak to how they think about their deployment plans and why they structured certain agreements with us. But I would tell you that there are components of both parts of your question in the agreement. It certainly does include certainty of pricing for them and if -- depending on levels of activity, then it will drive an answer for us in terms of top line growth over a long period of time. So it does provide pricing with them. And then there's also a component of committed activity that's in it where we have certainty of some revenues associated with activity as they deploy C-band over the next several years. So there's components of both of those in the agreement. And as we go forward, we'll see more consolidated, rather than specific to a customer relationship, the contribution of cash revenues beyond what Dan spoke to in terms of the impact of the GAAP financial statements this year and years to come."

On -- around CapEx, we spent some time, I think, over the last couple of quarters talking about our expectation for this year's CapEx, which on a net basis is down about $400 million from the levels that we saw in 2019",722,"Yes, Phil, thanks for the questions. On -- around CapEx, we spent some time, I think, over the last couple of quarters talking about our expectation for this year's CapEx, which on a net basis is down about $400 million from the levels that we saw in 2019. That was largely related to the fiber acquisitions that we made. Those companies had committed to a number of large enterprise and government buildouts that were built specifically for kind of those kind of activities, enterprise and government broadband services. And post those acquisitions, we just haven't signed up those kind of agreements at any kind of scale like those prior companies had done. 
And as a result of that and our strategic focus around small cells, the CapEx has come down as we've built out those really long lead-time contracts. Many times, they were 3 to 5 years of build-out and commitment. 
So those have basically rolled off. And now as we think about capital spending, it's strategically focused on what we believe is the long-term value driver of the business around small cells and the opportunity to kind of build these networks for carriers as they build 5G networks. 
I don't want to get too much into what we think in '22 and beyond. We've given guidance this year that our net CapEx will be a little less than $1 billion. For the longer term, the driver of CapEx will be what are the opportunities mostly around small cells. And those will go through the same rigorous process that we put all of our CapEx processes through, understanding what the return is. We look to see at 6% to 7% initial yield on invested capital. And then we want to make sure that we believe there's good opportunity for additional lease-up beyond that, that can drive that yield into the double digits and higher returns on capital over time as we see more lease-up. 
So in the future, we'll just have to evaluate what the opportunities are, and then we'll give you an update on CapEx as we get later in the year. In October, we would plan to give our 2022 outlook as we typically do. 
With regards to DISH, I'll probably beg off most of that and let DISH and Amazon speak to how their agreements between the 2 of them are going to drive activity. But obviously, DISH has made a significant commitment to us recently in terms of the deployment of their network, and our operating team is incredibly busy and focused on delivering for them based on their expectations. The team has done a great job out of the gate and I believe delivering for them what they had hoped. And we're ready to support DISH in any way possible as they work on building out their 5G network. 
Your last question around edge computing. We think, today, a lot of this -- a lot of the edge computing activity is around traffic management and potentially reducing costs. But as wireless networks move into 5G, I think the opportunity is going to expand well beyond that to really delivering solutions to customers and increasing the applications as innovation occurs. And we think tower sites are uniquely positioned to be able to provide the real estate, the connectivity as well as power that enables edge computing. So it's a foundation of long-term innovation and our [ combination with fiber, ] I think really uniquely position us to be able to capture that. 
I know we've highlighted that component of both fiber and towers in the DISH agreement. It was something that was really important to them as they designed and decided to anchor their network around our sites. And I think -- I think it's another example of kind of the combination of our assets sets us up for opportunities for growth that are frankly beyond what we put into our forecast. When we talk about being able to grow the dividend 7% to 8% over a long period of time, things like edge computing and CBRS are really not in our forecast. So we view that as unmodeled upside and opportunity and believe the type of assets acquired and where those assets are located really give us the optionality to benefit from that over the long term."

We were intentional about acquiring highcapacity dense, urban, fiber. And as we've seen kind of in the later stages of 4G and now as we enter into 5G, there is a disproportionate amount of traffic in dense urban and suburban areas in the United States. And in order to solve that increased traffic, small cells are absolutely necessary. They're a critical component of their network. And I think the locations that we've acquired fiber in and where we've built fiber and then where we started to build small cells sets us up really nicely as we get into 5G and we start to see network densification. And that fiber that we have existing, I think we'll see additional co-location on, driving up the yields and the returns of those assets. 
And as has happened in prior cycles of going from 2 to 2.5G and then to 3G and then to 4G and now into 5G, we would expect there will be innovation that will further drive demand, wireless traffic demand. And that increased traffic, again, [indiscernible] to kind of the benefit of those those assets. 
So we think we've got great assets in the right location and think that we're going to see a really strong tailwind in the business over a long period of time. 
And you're right to point out the impact directly to site rental revenues is not going to happen overnight. It will happen over time. But the conversations and the discussions that we're having with carriers and the activity, and I would point to the Verizon commitment of 15,000 small cells that we talked about in the last quarter, those are all early indications that these assets are of the critical nature necessary to deploy wireless carrier networks, and we're really excited about where we're positioned. 
On your last question around C-band spectrum and constraints and supply chain, et cetera, we haven't seen anything at this point that would suggest to us that the numbers that we have out there are not going to be achievable. If we start to see something, obviously, we'll update you on our expectations. But normally in the business, sort of the quarter-to-quarter changes and timing are not that impactful to our overall results, as I spoke to earlier, in terms of the lead time and the commitment of revenues. We have a pretty long lead time. So we have a lot of visibility into what we'll do in 2021 and feel good about where the forecast is. And if that changes, we'll update you. But I think the supply chains will resolve themselves over time and don't expect that to have an impact in terms of our growth."

So that's -- what's in the supplement is not our forecast of actual churn, but just the actual numbers so you can separate locations where the legacy Sprint and T-Mobile were on the same sites and sites where legacy Sprint was stand-alone on the site and not co-located with T-Mobile. 
We're always open to considering a new structure or an agreement with a customer, but there's not any need per se to do that. We were intentional a number of years ago about extending the terms. So if you look back in that disclosure, we've got a lot of term remaining on those leases. And it's provided a lot of -- which was the goal when we did it, extending those [ Sprint ] leases, we were trying to make sure that we had a lot of flexibility through the -- if there was consolidation. So pleased about where we are there. And I would look at what we've been historically. We're always open, as I mentioned earlier, of working with the carriers to help them facilitate what they need. And whether that's achieving synergies or increasing speed of deployment of network, we're happy to work with carriers on that basis and, at the same time, making sure we maintain and protect the economics of both the agreements that we have in place as well as the economics of the site and driving the right return on the asset. So we'll hold that in balance as we usually do and make sure we do the right thing for both shareholders and for our customers. 
I would just point out this, which I think is helpful as we think about entering 2023 and beyond, the next big date of 2028, where we have some exposure to leases potentially being terminated from the T-Mobile acquisition. In past carrier consolidation, we've been able to grow AFFO and dividend right through those periods of time. And the other reality is that consolidations have actually led to increased spending. So we've had this view for a long period of time that, ultimately, the combination of T-Mobile and Sprint will be a good thing for the tower industry and, net-net, will end up with more activity and more leasing than we would have otherwise. And so I certainly expect that at some point in time, we'll see some -- the benefit to T-Mobile of some synergies of taking down some sites. But I think the overall investment and activity that they will do in -- with regards to 5G will far exceed the deducts that we may see from synergies that they try to achieve in taking down some sites. 
So net-net, back to the earlier comments, feel really good about the activity we're going to see in 5G. And we'll work through the consolidation when the time comes several years from now."

But as Jay pointed out, there's nothing that would stop us with greater bookings to speed up that deployment, and we would anticipate that to be the case as the necessity of small cells continues to get clearer for the deployment of 5G and networks overall."

We've done a number of trials on that front and with some success. So I think there's an opportunity to expand the density of the network for the wireless carriers into buildings to reach places that are very difficult to do from the outside. So I think there's opportunities there. 
I think there's also going to be some opportunities in the macro environment in certain settings where CBRS may be used by a content provider or others who want access to spectrum. So being able to use some of the unlicensed spectrum components of CBRS is an opportunity to do that in more macro environment. 
I think there are probably also some opportunities around campus-specific activities, whether that's universities or other locations where someone controls a large portion of land and has a discrete user use for CBRS that could be interesting as a share provider. 
So I think there are a number of opportunities. And it's not in guidance yet because it's not large enough to be -- to be beyond a rounding here. But I certainly think, over time, as we see 5G develop, the need for this to be for wireless opportunities to be ubiquitous, I think will drive uses for CBRS. 
And I think the other component of it is, obviously, everyone is trying to figure out how to get more spectrum into the hands of the wireless operators, and CBRS is another way to do that. And I think that spectrum will be utilized over time. And I think we stand to benefit from that as that spectrum is deployed."

Nick, this has been a focus of ours for about 15, 18 years, something like that, where we've been specifically focused on extending the maturity of our ground leases. When we started that activity, I think we were in the neighborhood of about 17 or 18 years of remaining term on average. And we had in the neighborhood of about 20% or a little less than 20% of the land that was owned. And we've increased -- over the last 15 to 18 years, we've increased the percentage of land owned to about 1/3, a little over 1/3 of our overall ground leases. And in addition to that, we've taken the average maturity to longer than 30 years. So there's been a concerted effort for us to get well ahead of any date at which a landlord would have a termination right or gain leverage from a financial standpoint over what those extension terms would be. And the team has just done a phenomenal job over a long period of time of consistently improving the quality of the assets and reducing the risks, albeit relatively small in an individual tower basis. 
Cumulatively, I think I would put that in the category, as Dan was talking about, balance sheet risk. That's another risk that we've methodically eliminated in the business and really excited about where we are today. It's an ongoing activity. As long as we're in the business, we're going to continue to be there. So we are constantly working on buying out land that makes sense, that we can acquire at the appropriate multiple. And at the same time, working on extending ground leases. And some component of the ground leases, I think, will always be in that maintenance mode, where we're extending and working to extend it. 
So some of the activity coming down is just a result of terrific execution over a long period of time and the natural evolution of -- once we get 80, 100 years on a ground lease or we acquire it, then that comes off the board and there's no longer any work to do on that site. So it'll probably, in terms of quantity or number, continue to come down over time, and we'll continue to kind of make the right financial decision around buying or extending the leases."

So yes, there's a natural limitation. We're not really close to it yet. There is just the practical aspects of it where people love to own the land and believe that Crown Castle will be there to pay the ground lease for a long period of time. So it's a good stream of income that they want to continue to hold the lease.

You mentioned 1 of them, proximity to existing plants that they have is certainly a reason why they would self-perform and use their existing plant to do it. 
The other reason, frankly, is that there are places where we're not interested in putting the capital because we don't see the lease-up opportunity. So there are limited number of providers of third-party capital building these small cells. Obviously, ourselves and then inside of the Digital Colony portfolio, as they're delivering that as a offering to customers. But beyond that, there just aren't anybody -- there isn't anybody else who's doing that at scale. 
So we're selective in terms of the opportunities in places where we want to invest the capital and put the capital. It's got to not only meet that kind of initial return, but we've also got to be comfortable that there's going to be big demand over time for other carriers to need it. And in places where we would look at it and evaluate the nodes as not meeting the return thresholds by virtue of either the cost to build them or the lack of certainty of lease-up, then those would be locations where we would pass and decide not to invest the capital and the carrier would self-perform. So it's a combination of those 2 would lead to the vast majority of the reasons why they would self-perform. 
We've talked about this some in the past, but our view of the number of small cells that is going to be needed in the market, aligns pretty closely with a number of the comments that the carriers have made where they've indicated there's going to be more than 1 million small cells in the U.S. We certainly don't anticipate building all of those. And so I think as long as the business is around and we're building small cell nodes, I think we're going to continue to see the wireless carriers self-perform. And our opportunity for value creation is to be rigorous and disciplined in our approach to evaluating those markets that have the best potential for lease-up and then making sure that we're really thoughtful about which ones we pick and then how we build those sites on cost and on time. And those are sort of the value opportunities that we're looking for. 
And then there will be lots of small cells, I think, that will exist in the U.S. that are going to be self-performed by the carriers. And I would look at that as overall activity, it's just a trajectory that I think aligns well with our strategy."

Meaning there's a lot of opportunity for the carriers to deploy beyond the first 45 markets should they choose to do so. And I was interested if you had any color as to whether you have [indiscernible] whether that may or may not be happening. 
And then the second question would be, again with respect to the idea that the carriers are mostly looking [indiscernible] start primarily because of the [indiscernible] and backhaul that they have on existing sites. Are you seeing or expecting that the kind of incumbent tower carriers are going to be gaining the lion's share of the demand here? Or are you seeing the kind of [ interloafers ],  the new tower companies, the Unitis, the Tillmans of the world, are they getting a super normal share of -- or the supernormal part of the conversation at the margin as we think about this new deployment?"

It's probably just a little too specific for us to make those kind of comments or indications. We're obviously, as I mentioned in my earlier comments, we're seeing a lot of C-band activity is driving a lot of leasing activity. And I think, over time, the driver of our business is, as I mentioned before, kind of stacking years of growth. And it's going to take multiple years for C-band to be deployed, and we think it's going to be great for us for an extended period of time. But specificity beyond that, I'll let the carriers speak to kind of their own plans and initiatives. 
On the second component of your question around where does the activity go? History, I think, is a really helpful indication of where the carriers are going to deploy this 5G network and how they'll think about the C-band spectrum. It is always most cost-effective to deploy the spectrum on locations where they have existing infrastructure. They've already got connectivity there. They've already got power. They've got the basic infrastructure there to be able to add additional spectrum bands. So at least initially, I think the vast, vast majority of the activity will end up on sites where they are already located on. So the existing owners of towers where these carriers are co-located on those sites I think will see the preponderance of activity for some extended period of time. 
As it gets built out and then as the spectrum begins to be used, then step 2 is the densification activity. And then that activity is likely to go, frankly, again, on existing sites where the carrier is not yet co-located. The opportunity for new and upcoming tower companies is generally pretty limited to places that are outside the core areas where the big -- at least the 3 big public tower companies own their assets, into places where new housing developments, the extension of suburbia, the sprawl, those kind of areas. Those companies that you mentioned are often building towers in those locations and putting their capital up to meet that need. 
But that's the sort of second, third kind of level of activity. I think the vast majority of the activities in early days and even maybe even in the medium term is on existing sites."

There's a little more specificity than we would get into on our customer contracts, as I mentioned to Colby earlier. There's a component of that that's related to giving them knowledge of what the actual pricing is going to be for new activity. There's a commitment on their part in terms of activity on existing sites. And then there's obviously the extension of the existing sites to 10 years. And we priced that and negotiated that with the economics of the sites in mind and the right returns. But beyond that, I think that's just too specific and not in our best interest for that of our customers to get into that level of detail. 
On the second part of the question, around Sprint churn in the quarter, was negligible. Longer term and what you should assume, frankly, it's really early. As we laid out that schedule, we have our first meaningful amount of churn not until 2023. And then after that, I think in each year, it's less than $20 million all the way out to 2028, which is the bulk here of the thereafter that's included in the table. 
So we're a long way away from kind of needing to have that conversation and too early to predict ultimately what the outcome is. 
Big picture, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, I think the net investment by T-Mobile in building out 5G will far exceed any of the synergies that they achieve. I think that's consistent with the public comments that they've made and their desire to build out 5G networks. 
And when we get to a place where we have a better -- a better view, whether that's because of contract or just because of the activity that we're seeing, we'll certainly come back and take just the disclosure and turn that into more of a forecasted view of what we actually think will start to impact the numbers. But it's a long way out. And at this point, not really ready to provide a specific forecast on timing or amount.

Thanks for joining us on the call.
As you saw from our first quarter results and increased full year outlook, our consistent execution is delivering outstanding results as we support our customers' growth initiatives with their deployment of nationwide 5G in the U.S. Following a period of building excitement and anticipation, we have seen a significant increase in activity as our customers have started to upgrade their networks to 5G at scale. We expect this elevated level of activity to result in a year of outsized growth for Crown Castle as we now anticipate 11% growth in AFFO per share for the full year 2021, meaningfully above our long-term annual target of 7% to 8%.
Beyond 2021, I believe our strategy and unmatched portfolio of more than 40,000 towers, approximately 80,000 small cells on air or committed in backlog and 80,000 route miles of fiber concentrated in the top U.S. markets have positioned Crown Castle to generate growth in cash flows and dividends per share for years to come.
Our strategy is to deliver the highest risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders by growing our dividend and investing in assets that will drive future growth. That focus has led us to invest in towers, small cells and fiber assets that are all foundational for the development of 5G networks in the U.S. We believe the series of strategic agreements that we have announced in recent months further highlights the synergistic value our shared infrastructure provides to our customers.
Building on the momentum from our recent 15-year agreement with DISH to support our nationwide 5G build-out and our recent long-term 5G small cell agreement with Verizon to support their network deployment, we are excited to once again expand our strategic relationship with Verizon through a recent long-term tower leasing agreement. We believe this agreement will deliver significant value for both parties as it establishes terms for leasing additional capacity on existing tower sites with a structure that is intended to make it easier to expedite the deployment of C-Band equipment over the next several years. The agreement also resulted in an increase in the average remaining current contracted lease term under our Verizon site leases to approximately 10 years. Dan will discuss the expected financial impact of this agreement later in the call.
Turning back to our focus on generating superior long-term returns, one of our core principles of our strategy is to remain U.S. only, because we believe it represents the best market for wireless infrastructure ownership since it has the most attractive growth profile and the lowest risk. And we believe this dynamic of higher growth and lower risk will continue into the future which is why we expect our U.S.-based strategy to drive significant returns for our shareholders.
Starting with the higher growth we see in the U.S., the demand for our shared infrastructure offering across towers, small cells and fiber is tied to the robust demand for mobile data in the U.S. which continues to increase by more than 30% annually. Because the outlook is so compelling, the U.S. wireless market continues to attract a disproportionate amount of global capital investment. This is likely due in part to the fact that the durability and scale of wireless data growth in the U.S. has repeatedly outperformed expectations.
I remember fielding questions from investors and analysts nearly a decade ago trying to understand why we were not expanding our tower business into less established international markets that offered the promise of outsized growth to compensate for the outsized risk. The core set of assumptions underpinning that line of questioning included a view by many that it was inevitable that U.S. growth rates would slow, leading to a desire to augment that growth by investing in international wireless markets that, hopefully, would develop the same key set of fundamentals over time that has made the U.S. market so successful for decades.
We didn't buy into that argument at the time, and sitting here today, on the doorsteps of 5G, we reached a similar conclusion that the U.S. is still among the highest growth markets for wireless infrastructure. Importantly, in a shared infrastructure business with long-term investment horizons, we have benefited from these superior growth rates while avoiding the risks associated with investment opportunities in less established international wireless market.
These risks can have a meaningful impact on long-term returns, and many have materialized in recent years, including the outsized churn due to less favorable industry dynamics relative to the U.S., sustained foreign currency devaluation that results in revenue churn and disruptive social or governmental environments in less developed countries.
Because we believe the U.S. has both greater potential for growth and lower risk, we are focused on growing cash flows on our 40,000 towers by providing access to existing and new customers that are building 5G wireless network.
We are investing in new small cell and fiber assets that our customers need for their wireless networks which we believe increases our ability to capitalize on the 5G growth trends in the U.S. And we are developing new capabilities and offerings that will leverage our existing assets to drive innovation and we believe will further extend our growth opportunity, such as CBRS and edge computing.
I believe that Crown Castle offers shareholders an unmatched opportunity to benefit from the launch of 5G wireless networks in the U.S. In the near to medium term, we expect to deliver outsized AFFO per share growth of 11% this year as we translate this increasing 5G activity into very attractive bottom line growth.
We expect to once again deliver the highest tower revenue growth rate in the U.S. among our public tower peers in 2021. And our customers are affirming the value we bring with our comprehensive portfolio of shared wireless infrastructure assets by entering into long-term agreements to access those assets.
Longer term, we believe Crown Castle provides an exciting opportunity for shareholders to potentially compound double-digit total returns over a long period of time with a high-quality dividend that currently yields 3%, and that we expect to be able to grow 7% to 8% annually.
When I consider the durability of the underlying demand trends we see in the U.S. that provide significant visibility into the future growth for our business, the deliberate decisions we have made to reduce the risks associated with our strategy and our history of steady execution, I believe that Crown Castle stands out as a unique investment that will generate compelling returns over time.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dan."

Good morning, everyone. As Jay mentioned, we are excited to see our customers beginning to deploy 5G at scale. We have seen a significant increase in activity levels, leading to solid first quarter results that exceeded our expectations and s",801,"Thanks, Jay. Good morning, everyone. As Jay mentioned, we are excited to see our customers beginning to deploy 5G at scale. We have seen a significant increase in activity levels, leading to solid first quarter results that exceeded our expectations and support our increased full year guidance.
Turning to Slide 4 of our earnings presentation. You can see our strong top line results were driven by more than 6% growth and organic contribution to site rental revenue. This growth included more than 9% growth from new leasing activity and contracted escalators, net of approximately 3% from nonrenewals.
We also generated a $23 million increase in contribution from services when compared to the first quarter 2020, culminating in 10% growth in adjusted EBITDA and 20% growth in AFFO per share on a year-over-year basis.
Turning to Slide 5. We increased our full year AFFO guidance by $40 million, reflecting a $25 million increase in expected services contribution as a result of higher-than-expected tower activity levels, and a $30 million reduction to interest expense following our successful recent refinancing activities, partially offset by $15 million of additional labor-related costs associated with the higher activity levels.
Additionally, as Jay discussed, we entered into a long-term tower leasing agreement with Verizon that resulted in increasing the average current lease term of our Verizon tower site leases to approximately 10 years and adding straight-line revenue of approximately $140 million in 2021.
Taking these changes into account, we now expect our adjusted EBITDA to be $150 million higher than our previously provided 2021 outlook. Our expectation for site rental revenue growth has increased to approximately 7%, inclusive of the expected organic contribution to site rental revenues of 6%, which remains unchanged. 
Our expectation for growth -- organic growth across towers, small cells and fiber solutions, also remain consistent, with approximately 6% growth from towers, approximately 15% growth from small cells and approximately 3% growth from fiber solutions.
Focusing on investment activities, during the first quarter, capital expenditures totaled $302 million, including $17 million of sustaining capital expenditures, $49 million of discretionary capital expenditures for our tower segment and $225 million of discretionary capital expenditures for our fiber segment.
Our full year expectation for capital expenditures remains unchanged at approximately $1.5 billion or less than $1 billion after customer cash flow contributions. And we continue to expect to fund our discretionary investments this year with free cash flow and incremental borrowings.
Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the first quarter at approximately 5.5x net debt-to-EBITDA and expect to exit 2021 at our target leverage of approximately 5x based on the anticipated growth and cash flows through the balance of the year.
As Jay discussed, in addition to driving significant dividend growth, a key part of our strategy is to reduce the overall risk profile of the business to further enhance the value created for shareholders over time. Along with focusing on what we believe is the highest-growth and lowest-risk market in the world for wireless infrastructure ownership, we have methodically reduced the risk profile of our balance sheet with the same goal of maximizing long-term shareholder value. With that in mind, we were able to opportunistically access the bond market during the first quarter to refinance upcoming maturities, reduce our debt costs and extend our maturity profile.
Looking back 5 years to when we achieved our initial investment grade credit rating, and inclusive of our recent refinancing transaction, we have increased our debt -- average debt maturity to nearly 10 years from just over 5 years, reduced our average borrowing cost to 3.1% from 3.8%, increased our mix of fixed-rate debt to more than 90% from just under 70% and reduced our reliance on secured debt to just 15% from nearly 50%. With limited upcoming debt maturities in the near term and more than $4 billion of undrawn capacity on our revolving credit facility, we believe the balance sheet is positioned well to support our growth initiatives.
Turning back to the growth side of the value equation and to wrap things up, we are excited about the increasing level of activity we are seeing as our customers begin to deploy 5G at scale. Our customers continue to recognize the differentiated value our comprehensive shared infrastructure offering brings, leading them to sign significant long-term agreements with us.
We expect to once again generate industry-leading U.S. tower revenue growth this year. And we expect to generate 11% growth in AFFO per share in 2021, which provides a very attractive total return opportunity when combined with the current 3% dividend yield. Importantly, we are generating these returns while making strategic investments in new small cell and fiber assets that we believe will add to our long-term growth opportunity.
And with that, Vicki, I'd like to open the call to questions."

We're not surprised by the urgency that our customers are showing in deploying 5G. The level of commitment that they showed during the C-Band auction was really a clear sign that they're going to invest heavily in 5G. And so the activity we're seeing, I think, just flows from that. We're seeing that turn into actions as they're deploying significant amounts of 5G networks. And we're really encouraged by the activity that we're seeing.
When we think about that activity translating towards revenue growth, we obviously saw a big step up towards the end of last year and that's continued into this first quarter.
And as it relates to the services activity, obviously, most of that activity is either in the nature of preconstruction work that we're doing for carriers and then some portion of it carries over to work that we're doing as we actually install them on the site.
So the elevated activity that we saw, the step-up we think sort of continues through the balance of this year and is a direct result of the overall encouraging level of activity that we're seeing from the carriers."

We think most of those assets that we wanted, we have purchased.
There may be some others out there that meet the criteria we've looked at, being high-capacity dense metro fiber, but not a lot. So we anticipate most of our capital will go to organic growth in our business but also in fiber business."

I think it provides significant value and certainty to Verizon as well as to ourselves. And I think the significance of that agreement is obviously evidenced by the impact that it has on our 2021 outlook and the step-up that we put into that outlook last night in the press release.
This really went through the same thought process that we've gone through over the last several years as we've done large transactions with the carriers on the MLA side, and have similar components to it, we're trying to meet the customers' needs, particularly with regards to certainty of price and then lowering or reducing the amount of time that it takes to go through the paper portion of getting them on to our site. So it's designed to facilitate their ability to go back to sites that they're already on and speed up that process of them being able to do upgrades. And obviously, they've been specific about the desire to do that with regards to C-Band.
And then on our side of it, we're trying to make sure that we price the economics of that transaction appropriately. And I think we've seen over multiple of those kinds of transactions with customers, multiple customers and multiple transactions over time, an ability to do that well, to both get the right economics on the site and then provide our customers with the right access and speed to get there.
So we did something similar, it has a lot of components to things that we've done in the past and thought about it in a similar way. We get the 10-year extension on the leases that they're already on which moves the maturity out from about 4 years to about 10 years on those sites. And then over the next several years, gives them an opportunity on those sites that they're already on to upgrade their equipment to handle new spectrum bands and to get that where they want it to be from a 5G standpoint.
We still maintain the upside on new leasing and other activities associated with that. And then once we get past sort of this initial push into 5G, then obviously the opportunity is there for us to see greater growth over time.
So excited about the agreement there and excited about what it means in terms of total activity. And as I said before in the prepared remarks, I think right on the doorsteps of seeing 5G deployments at scale enables us to be able to be responsive to Verizon's desires to get there."

So a little bit of timing changes kind of -- which is naturally going to happen as we go through the construction phase of small cells, it's going to have some quarter-to-quarter movements that may not tie out exactly to the full year outlook.
But as we look at the full year outlook, still think small cell growth year-over-year is in the 15% range, that mid-teens that we've talked about for a long time. We think on the fiber solutions side will be around 3% for the full year. And then towers right there at around 6%, as we previously expected.
So I don't see anything, Matt, in terms of those numbers in the quarter that are indicative of anything happening in the underlying business that I would point to. I think it's just the timing differences quarter-to-quarter. And as we look at the full year, I think that's more indicative of the actual activity, what we're seeing from the carriers and how we expect those businesses to perform.
On the services side and the cadence there, look, we're at a level of elevated activity. So we probably had a better first quarter in terms of services than we would in many years, where we often talk about years being back -- heavily back-end loaded to the second half or even towards the fourth quarter. And we saw a step-up in activity going into the end of last year. And that level of elevated activity just carried right into the first quarter.
So we saw a real nice contribution from services in the first quarter and expect, basically, our full year assumption to be pretty similar to where we were previously with that adjustment for the first quarter."

And then secondly, as it relates to the Verizon MLA, you talked about making it easier to deploy. And I guess one of the bigger questions people are trying to get a sense -- investors are trying to get a sense on, is whether or not the agreement includes just some standardized pricing to make it easier for them to move quicker or whether or not there's actually some type of financial benefit where you allow them to go to x amount of sites over x amount of period, shorter than that 10-year period, to kind of move quickly.

On the first question around organic tower growth, a couple of things I would put in front of you on that.
One is there's a pretty good lead time or lag time from the time that we see revenue start to turn on, start to get the applications from the customers to when we actually see the revenues start to turn on. That's about 6 to 9 months. So the increased level of activity that we've been talking about for 2021 is something we did see all the way back into the fourth quarter of 2020. We started to see the application step up then, and that informed our increase in the overall activity.
I was sort of curious to this point the other day and just looks back to kind of our organic revenue growth over the last 2017 through 2020. And the organic revenue growth in '21 is in our outlook is a step-up of a little over 25% of that average over those previous 4 years. So it's a meaningful increase in the activity, and we bake that into our outlook when we gave 2021.
So what we're seeing now in terms of that activity is pretty consistent with what we had expected. But it's always good to see it materialized and then not just the expectations as where we were back in the October time frame.
The other thing that I would mention about this is, as we look at this activity, we're encouraged and think that there's the opportunity for it to stay at this level of elevated activity for a period of time.
So I think in the business, oftentimes people start to look for inflection points or points where it's going to be the highest and then expect it to kind of fall off. And our prior experience would tell us that those inflection points are relatively rare, that you see the carrier step up level of activities and hold at a plus or minus a certain amount for a long period of time. So when we look at that activity, really encouraged by what we're seeing and not -- and, frankly, not surprised.
To the broader point on, as we look at revenue growth and activity, the way that we create value for shareholders is by stacking years of good growth one on top of another. And what is happening in the business right now is a tremendous year of growth, of growing that AFFO at 11% year-over-year on a per share basis and just stacking another year of great growth on top of what was a good base. And our goal is to consistently deliver that growth, like we've talked about over the long term, 7% to 8%. And what we're seeing at the top line certainly indicates our ability to achieve that longer-term goal.
On your second question around the Verizon MLA, we try to stay away from getting too specific about the terms of the agreement that we do with our customers. We'll let them speak to how they think about their deployment plans and why they structured certain agreements with us.
But I would tell you that there are components of both parts of your question in the agreement. It certainly does include certainty of pricing for them and if -- depending on levels of activity, then it will drive an answer for us in terms of top line growth over a long period of time. So it does provide pricing with them. And then there's also a component of committed activity that's in it where we have certainty of some revenues associated with activity as they deploy C-Band over the next several years.
So there's components of both of those in the agreement. And as we go forward, we'll see more consolidated, rather than specific to a customer relationship, the contribution of cash revenues beyond what Dan spoke to in terms of the impact of the GAAP financial statements this year and years to come."

(REIT), Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2021",2021-04-22,"Earnings Calls","Crown Castle Inc.","Executives","Yes, Phil, thanks for the questions. On -- around CapEx, we spent some time, I think, over the last couple of quarters talking about our expectation for this year's CapEx, which on a net basis is down about $400 million from the levels that we saw in 2019",720,"Yes, Phil, thanks for the questions. On -- around CapEx, we spent some time, I think, over the last couple of quarters talking about our expectation for this year's CapEx, which on a net basis is down about $400 million from the levels that we saw in 2019. That was largely related to the fiber acquisitions that we made. Those companies had committed to a number of large enterprise and government buildouts that were built specifically for kind of those kind of activities, enterprise and government broadband services. And post those acquisitions, we just haven't signed up those kind of agreements at any kind of scale like those prior companies had done.
And as a result of that and our strategic focus around small cells, the CapEx has come down as we've built out those really long lead-time contracts. Many times, they were 3 to 5 years of build-out and commitment.
So those have basically rolled off. And now as we think about capital spending, it's strategically focused on what we believe is the long-term value driver of the business around small cells and the opportunity to kind of build these networks for carriers as they build 5G networks.
I don't want to get too much into what we think in '22 and beyond. We've given guidance this year that our net CapEx will be a little less than $1 billion. For the longer term, the driver of CapEx will be what are the opportunities mostly around small cells. And those will go through the same rigorous process that we put all of our CapEx processes through, understanding what the return is. 
We look to see a 6% to 7% initial yield on invested capital. And then we want to make sure that we believe there's good opportunity for additional lease-up beyond that, that can drive that yield into the double digits and higher returns on capital over time as we see more lease-up. 
So in the future, we'll just have to evaluate what the opportunities are, and then we'll give you an update on CapEx as we get later in the year. In October, we would plan to give our 2022 outlook as we typically do. 
With regards to DISH, I'll probably beg off most of that and let DISH and Amazon speak to how their agreements between the 2 of them are going to drive activity. But obviously, DISH has made a significant commitment to us recently in terms of the deployment of their network, and our operating team is incredibly busy and focused on delivering for them based on their expectations. The team has done a great job out of the gate and I believe delivering for them what they had hoped. And we're ready to support DISH in any way possible as they work on building out their 5G network.
Your last question around edge computing. We think, today, a lot of this -- a lot of the edge computing activity is around traffic management and potentially reducing costs. But as wireless networks move into 5G, I think the opportunity is going to expand well beyond that to really delivering solutions to customers and increasing the applications as innovation occurs. And we think tower sites are uniquely positioned to be able to provide the real estate, the connectivity as well as power that enables edge computing. So it's a foundation of long-term innovation and our [ combination with fiber, ] I think really uniquely position us to be able to capture that. 
I know we've highlighted that component of both fiber and towers in the DISH agreement. It was something that was really important to them as they designed and decided to anchor their network around our sites. And I think it's another example of kind of the combination of our assets sets us up for opportunities for growth that are frankly beyond what we put into our forecast.
When we talk about being able to grow the dividend 7% to 8% over a long period of time, things like edge computing and CBRS are really not in our forecast. So we view that as unmodeled upside and opportunity and believe the type of assets we've acquired and where those assets are located really gives us the optionality to benefit from that over the long term."

And then on the small cells, it does seem, as I think you alluded to in the script and elsewhere, that you have some structural advantages as we get to the infill and densification part of C-Band and other mid-band frequencies. I just wondered if you're starting to see that in the pipeline yet. I realize the revenues might be a little ways off, but are there active discussions at this point? Or is that more on the come?
And then finally, one of the C-Band licensees talked earlier this morning about supply chain constraints that they're seeing. On the other hand, another one put out a press release talking about how second quarter they're already kind of starting to deploy C-Band. And as you kind of consider all those data points around what the carriers are saying, I wondered how that affects your expectation around second half and what type of ramp you might see."

And as we'",478,"On your second question around small cells, we believe that we do have a structural advantage around the assets that we've acquired, as Dan mentioned in his earlier comments. We were intentional about acquiring highcapacity dense, urban, fiber. And as we've seen kind of in the later stages of 4G and now as we enter into 5G, there is a disproportionate amount of traffic in dense urban and suburban areas in the United States. And in order to solve that increased traffic, small cells are absolutely necessary.
They're a critical component of their network. And I think the locations that we've acquired fiber in and where we've built fiber and then where we started to build small cells sets us up really nicely as we get into 5G and we start to see network densification. And that fiber that we have existing, I think we'll see additional co-location on, driving up the yields and the returns of those assets.
And as has happened in prior cycles of going from 2 to 2.5G and then to 3G and then to 4G and now into 5G, we would expect there will be innovation that will further drive demand, wireless traffic demand. And that increased traffic, again, [indiscernible] to kind of the benefit of those those assets. 
So we think we've got great assets in the right location and think that we're going to see a really strong tailwind in the business over a long period of time.
And you're right to point out the impact directly to site rental revenues is not going to happen overnight. It will happen over time. But the conversations and the discussions that we're having with carriers and the activity, and I would point to the Verizon commitment of 15,000 small cells that we talked about in the last quarter, those are all early indications that these assets are of the critical nature necessary to deploy wireless carrier networks, and we're really excited about where we're positioned.
On your last question around C-Band spectrum and constraints and supply chain, et cetera, we haven't seen anything at this point that would suggest to us that the numbers that we have out there are not going to be achievable. If we start to see something, obviously, we'll update you on our expectations.
But normally in the business, sort of the quarter-to-quarter changes and timing are not that impactful to our overall results, as I spoke to earlier, in terms of the lead time and the commitment of revenues. We have a pretty long lead time.
So we have a lot of visibility into what we'll do in 2021 and feel good about where the forecast is. And if that changes, we'll update you. But I think the supply chains will resolve themselves over time, and don't expect that to have an impact in terms of our growth."

So we did -- thanks for mentioning the disclosure. We did add some additional disclosure to the supplement. We have gotten some questions, we thought it would be helpful to give you a little more granularity.
It's not intended to be a forecast. So that's -- what's in the supplement is not our forecast of actual churn, but just the actual numbers so you can separate locations where the legacy Sprint and T-Mobile were on the same sites and sites where legacy Sprint was stand-alone on the site and not co-located with T-Mobile.
We're always open to considering a new structure or an agreement with a customer, but there's not any need per se to do that. We were intentional a number of years ago about extending the terms. So if you look back in that disclosure, we've got a lot of term remaining on those leases. And it's provided a lot of -- which was the goal when we did it, of extending those Sprint leases, we were trying to make sure that we had a lot of flexibility through the -- if there was consolidation. So pleased about where we are there. 
And I would look at what we've been historically. We're always open to, as I mentioned earlier, of working with the carriers to help them facilitate what they need. And whether that's achieving synergies or increasing speed of deployment of network, we're happy to work with carriers on that basis and, at the same time, making sure we maintain and protect the economics of both the agreements that we have in place as well as the economics of the site and driving the right return on the asset.
So we'll hold that in balance as we usually do and make sure we do the right thing for both shareholders and for our customers.
I would just point out this, which I think is helpful as we think about entering 2023 and beyond, the next big date of 2028, where we have some exposure to leases potentially being terminated from the T-Mobile acquisition. In past carrier consolidation, we've been able to grow AFFO and dividend right through those periods of time. And the other reality is that consolidations have actually led to increased spending.
So we've had this view for a long period of time that, ultimately, the combination of T-Mobile and Sprint will be a good thing for the tower industry and, net-net, will end up with more activity and more leasing than we would have otherwise. And so I certainly expect that at some point in time, we'll see some -- the benefit to T-Mobile of some synergies of taking down some sites.
But I think the overall investment and activity that they will do in -- with regards to 5G will far exceed the deducts that we may see from synergies that they try to achieve in taking down some sites. 
So net-net, back to the earlier comments, feel really good about the activity we're going to see in 5G. And we'll work through the consolidation when the time comes several years from now."

So I think our view would be, over a longer period of time, that, that activity will increase beyond those levels. But in the near term, I think that, that's a pretty good gauge.
The carriers and the activity and the discussions and their public comments around the necessity of small cells I think really sets the environment for the opportunity for us to capture a larger portion of it. But as you know, there's a long lead time for that. So we get lots of visibility as we go from commitments of the carriers to go on certain sites to when we're actually turning them on.

We don't see the 18 to 36 months changing all that much. But if we got a lot more bookings, we could put a lot more on air than just 10,000 in a year.
So 10,000 is a good point to look at for the next few years just because -- or next couple of years because of where we are with the bookings that we've had recently.
But as Jay pointed out, there's nothing that would stop us with greater bookings to speed up that deployment, and we would anticipate that to be the case as the necessity of small cells continues to get clearer for the deployment of 5G and networks overall."

So I think there's an opportunity to expand the density of the network for the wireless carriers into buildings to reach places that are very difficult to do from the outside. So I think there's opportunities there.
I think there's also going to be some opportunities in the macro environment in certain settings where CBRS may be used by a content provider or others who want access to spectrum. So being able to use some of the unlicensed spectrum components of CBRS is an opportunity to do that in more macro environment.
I think there are probably also some opportunities around campus-specific activities, whether that's universities or other locations where someone controls a large portion of land and has a discrete user use for CBRS that could be interesting as a share provider.
So I think there are a number of opportunities. And it's not in guidance yet because it's not large enough to beyond -- to be beyond a rounding here. But I certainly think, over time, as we see 5G develop, the need for this to be -- for wireless opportunities to be ubiquitous, I think will drive uses for CBRS.
And I think the other component of it is, obviously, everyone is trying to figure out how to get more spectrum into the hands of the wireless operators, and CBRS is another way to do that. And I think that spectrum will be utilized over time. And I think we stand to benefit from that as that spectrum is deployed."

Nick, this has been a focus of ours for about 15, 18 years, something like that, where we've been specifically focused on extending the maturity of our ground leases. When we started that activity, I think we were in the neighborhood of about 17 or 18 years of remaining term on average. And we had in the neighborhood of about 20% or a little less than 20% of the land that was owned. And we've increased -- over the last 15 to 18 years, we've increased the percentage of land owned to about 1/3, a little over 1/3 of our overall ground leases. And in addition to that, we've taken the average maturity to longer than 30 years.
So there's been a concerted effort for us to get well ahead of any date at which a landlord would have a termination right or gain leverage from a financial standpoint over what those extension terms would be. And the team has just done a phenomenal job over a long period of time of consistently improving the quality of the assets and reducing the risks, albeit relatively small in an individual tower basis.
Cumulatively, I think I would put that in the category, as Dan was talking about, balance sheet risk. That's another risk that we've methodically eliminated in the business and really excited about where we are today. It's an ongoing activity. As long as we're in the business, we're going to continue to be there.
So we are constantly working on buying out land that makes sense, that we can acquire at the appropriate multiple. And at the same time, working on extending ground leases. And some component of the ground leases, I think, will always be in that maintenance mode, where we're extending and working to extend it.
So some of the activity coming down is just a result of terrific execution over a long period of time and the natural evolution of -- once we get 80, 100 years on a ground lease or we acquire it, then that comes off the board and there's no longer any work to do on that site. So it'll probably, in terms of quantity or number, continue to come down over time, and we'll continue to kind of make the right financial decision around buying or extending the leases."

I think there's probably 2 factors. You mentioned 1 of them, proximity to existing plants that they have is certainly a reason why they would self-perform and use their existing plant to do it.
The other reason, frankly, is that there are places where we're not interested in putting the capital because we don't see the lease-up opportunity. So there are limited number of providers of third-party capital building these small cells. Obviously, ourselves and then inside of the digital colony portfolio, as they're delivering that as a offering to customers. But beyond that, there just aren't anybody -- there isn't anybody else who's doing that at scale.
So we're selective in terms of the opportunities in places where we want to invest the capital and put the capital. It's got to not only meet that kind of initial return, but we've also got to be comfortable that there's going to be big demand over time for other carriers to need it. And in places where we would look at it and evaluate the nodes as not meeting the return thresholds by virtue of either the cost to build them or the lack of certainty of lease-up, then those would be locations where we would pass and decide not to invest the capital and the carrier would self-perform.
So it's a combination of those 2 would lead to the vast majority of the reasons why they would self-perform.
We've talked about this some in the past, but our view of the number of small cells that is going to be needed in the market, aligns pretty closely with a number of the comments that the carriers have made where they've indicated there's going to be more than 1 million small cells in the U.S. We certainly don't anticipate building all of those.
And so I think as long as the business is around and we're building small cell nodes, I think we're going to continue to see the wireless carriers self-perform. And our opportunity for value creation is to be rigorous and disciplined in our approach to evaluating those markets that have the best potential for lease-up and then making sure that we're really thoughtful about which ones we pick and then how we build those sites on cost and on time. And those are sort of the value opportunities that we're looking for.
And then there will be lots of small cells, I think, that will exist in the U.S. that are going to be self-performed by the carriers. And I would look at that as -- overall activity as just a trajectory that I think aligns well with our strategy."

Meaning there's a lot of opportunity for the carriers to deploy beyond the first 45 markets should they choose to do so. And I was interested if you had any color as to whether you have some insight into whether that may or may not be happening.
And then the second question would be, again with respect to the idea that the carriers are mostly looking at C-Band as a macro [indiscernible] start primarily because of the [indiscernible] and backhaul that they have on existing sites.
Are you seeing or expecting that the kind of incumbent tower carriers are going to be gaining the lion's share of the demand here? Or are you seeing the kind of interlopers, the new tower companies, the Unitis, the Tillmans of the world, are they getting a super normal share of -- or the supernormal part of the conversation at the margin as we think about this new deployment?"

It's probably just a little too specific for us to make those kind of comments or indications. We're obviously -- as I mentioned in my earlier comments, we're seeing a lot of C-Band activity is driving a lot of leasing activity. And I think, over time, the driver of our business is, as I mentioned before, kind of stacking years of growth. And it's going to take multiple years for C-Band to be deployed, and we think it's going to be great for us for an extended period of time.
But specificity beyond that, I'll let the carriers speak to kind of their own plans and initiatives.
On the second component of your question around where does the activity go? History, I think, is a really helpful indication of where the carriers are going to deploy this 5G network and how they'll think about the C-Band spectrum. It is always most cost-effective to deploy the spectrum on locations where they have existing infrastructure.
They've already got connectivity there. They've already got power. They've got the basic infrastructure there to be able to add additional spectrum bands. So at least initially, I think the vast, vast majority of the activity will end up on sites where they are already located on. So the existing owners of towers where these carriers are co-located on those sites I think will see the preponderance of activity for some extended period of time.
As it gets built out and then as the spectrum begins to be used, then step 2 is the densification activity. And then that activity is likely to go, frankly, again, on existing sites where the carrier is not yet co-located. The opportunity for new and upcoming tower companies is generally pretty limited to places that are outside the core areas where the big -- at least the 3 big public tower companies own their assets, into places where new housing developments, the extension of suburbia, the sprawl, those kind of areas. Those companies that you mentioned are often building towers in those locations and putting their capital up to meet that need.
But that's the sort of second, third kind of level of activity. I think the vast majority of the activities in early days and even -- maybe even in the medium term is on existing sites."

There's a little more specificity than we would get into on our customer contracts, as I mentioned to Colby earlier. There's a component of that, that's related to giving them knowledge of what the actual pricing is going to be for new activity. There's a commitment on their part in terms of activity on existing sites. And then there's obviously the extension of the existing sites to 10 years. And we priced that and negotiated that with the economics of the sites in mind and the right returns.
But beyond that, I think that's just too specific and not in our best interest or that of our customers to get into that level of detail.
On the second part of the question, around Sprint churn in the quarter, it was negligible. Longer term and what you should assume, frankly, it's really early. As we laid out that schedule, we have our first meaningful amount of churn not until 2023. And then after that, I think in each year, it's less than $20 million all the way out to 2028, which is the bulk here of the thereafter that's included in the table.
So we're a long way away from kind of needing to have that conversation and too early to predict ultimately what the outcome is. 
Big picture, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, I think the net investment by T-Mobile in building out 5G will far exceed any of the synergies that they achieve. I think that's consistent with the public comments that they've made and their desire to build out 5G networks.
And when we get to a place where we have a better view, whether that's because of contract or just because of the activity that we're seeing, we'll certainly come back and take just the disclosure and turn that into more of a forecasted view of what we actually think will start to impact the numbers. But it's a long way out. And at this point, not really ready to provide a specific forecast on timing or amount.

As you saw from our second quarter results and increased full year outlook, we continue to generate significant growth in cash flows and dividends from the deployment of 5G in",2166,"Thanks, Ben, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call this morning. As you saw from our second quarter results and increased full year outlook, we continue to generate significant growth in cash flows and dividends from the deployment of 5G in the U.S. We are experiencing the highest level of tower activity in our history, resulting in a year of outsized growth as we now anticipate 12% growth in AFFO per share for full year 2021, meaningfully above our long-term annual target of 7% to 8%. 
Our current 7% to 8% growth target was established in 2017 when we expanded our fiber and small cell strategy through the completion of our largest acquisition. This 7% to 8% growth target was an increase of 100 basis points from our prior target since we expected a diverse portfolio to increase our ability to consistently drive long-term growth. Since that time, the strategy has worked better than expected as we have grown our dividend per share at a compounded annual growth rate of 9%, with some years being driven by outsized growth in our fiber and small cell business like last year, and other years like this one being driven by higher growth in our tower business. 
This record level of activity is tied to the existing wireless carriers increasing their spend to add more equipment to tower sites and DISH starting to build a new nationwide 5G network from scratch. We expect this elevated level of activity to continue beyond this year and support future growth on our towers. While driving strong growth in our tower business this year, the initial focus by our customers on towers has also led to some delays in our small cell deployment, shifting the timing of when we expect to complete the nearly 30,000 small cells contractually committed in our backlog. When combined with zoning and permitting challenges as well as the previously disclosed Sprint cancellation, we now expect to deploy approximately 5,000 small cells in each of this year and next year with the remaining nearly $20,000 from our current backlog completed beyond 2022.  
This delay has not impacted our view of long-term attractiveness of small cells since the fundamental need for small cells continues and the unit economics remain in line with our expectation. With more than 50,000 small cells on air, we have already seen how important small cells are as a key tool used by the carriers to add network capacity by reusing their spectrum over shorter and shorter distances. We believe small cells will be an even more important tool going forward as the nature of wireless networks requires continued cell site densification to meet the increasing demand for data, especially as 5G networks are deployed. 
As a result, we believe these timing factors will not alter our long-term returns on our investments or our ability to deliver on our growth objectives. Dan is going to discuss our second quarter results and our expectations for the balance of 2021 in a bit more detail, so I want to focus my comments this morning on our strategy to deliver the highest risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. One of the core principles of our strategy is to focus on the U.S. market because we believe it is the best market for communications infrastructure ownership, with the most attractive growth profile and the lowest risk. With that view in mind, we've invested nearly $40 billion in shared infrastructure assets that we believe are mission-critical for today's wireless networks and sit in front of what is expected to be a massive decade-long investment by our customers to deploy 5G in the U.S. 
As you can see on Slide 4, our tower and fiber investments are at 2 different stages of development and maturity. Our tower investment began more than 20 years ago at an approximately 3% yield, when we built and acquired assets that we could share across multiple customers. By providing a lower cost to each customer, we have leased up those assets over the years and generated compelling returns for our shareholders. 
As we have proven out the value proposition for our customers over time, our tower assets now generate a yield on invested capital of 11% with meaningful capacity to support additional growth. As we realize the wireless network architecture would need to evolve with 4G, requiring a network of cell sites that would be much denser and closer to end users, we expanded our shared infrastructure offering beyond towers establishing the industry-leading small cell business in the U.S. It's encouraging that the business is already generating a current yield on invested capital of more than 7%, given the relative immaturity of these investments. 
To provide additional visibility into how our investments are progressing, we've updated our analysis of the cohort of 5 markets we introduced a year ago. Looking at a collective view of how these 5 markets have performed over the last year on Slide 5. Growth from both small cells and fiber solutions has contributed to an incremental yield of 7% on the approximately $200 million of incremental net capital investment. Adjusted for the timing impacts associated with the large in-process small cell project, where capital investment has occurred in advance of the corresponding revenue and cash flows, the incremental yield is approximately 8%. This incremental yield resulted in a modest decline in the combined cash yield from 9.2% a year ago to 9% currently. This is in line with our expectations as we have invested in new small cells at a 6% to 7% initial yield that we expect to grow over time as we lease up those assets to additional customers. 
During the last year in these markets, we have added more than 500 route miles of new high-capacity fiber to support the deployment of approximately 2,000 small cells. Importantly, approximately 40% of the small cells deployed were co-located on existing fiber with the balance representing new anchor builds in attractive areas of these markets where we expect to capture future small cell and fiber solutions demand. We believe each of the markets shown on Slide 6 provides a helpful representation of how our overall strategy is performing over time, given how different these markets are when it comes to the average life of the investment, the density of small cell nodes per mile of fiber and the degree of contribution from both small cells and fiber solutions. 
Generally speaking, we would expect markets that have a longer average investment life to have higher returns than those with less mature assets. This is true because we have more time to add customers to existing assets, which is consistent with our historical experience with towers, where we have, on average, added about 1 tenant -- 1 new tenant every 10 years. 
Similar to our experience with the movement in yield and tower investments over time, as we showed back on Page 4. Sometimes the steady climb of yields on legacy investment is less obvious as we invest in less mature assets that bring down the overall market yield. This is certainly true of some of the cohort. Very much related to the average life of the investment is the density of small cells per route mile of fiber. Since as in the tower business, the colocation of additional nodes on existing fiber is what drives the yields up over time. 
Consequently, we typically see a higher percentage of nodes co-located on existing fiber as the density of nodes increases. On the third characteristic, we believe the markets with both small cells and fiber solutions will ultimately have higher yields than those with only 1 of the 2 revenue streams. With this set up as a backdrop, I want to share a few observations that I think are important to highlight as we assess this data set on Page 6. 
Looking across the markets, you can see the longer average investment lives tend to correspond to higher yield. Denver has the least mature capital base and the lowest market yield, while Orlando has one of the most mature capital bases and the highest yields. In addition, the higher density of nodes per mile, which is generally correlated with the longer investment life and higher percentage of co-located nodes generates higher market yield. The financial benefit associated with co-locating nodes is apparent when looking at the incremental yield in Los Angeles and Phoenix. 
In the last year, about half of the small cells deployed across those 2 markets were co-located on existing fiber, resulting in a strong incremental yield. Meanwhile, Denver does not fit neatly into this framework, featuring the highest node density, but the lowest yield. Part of the explanation is that Denver is a market where we spent more than we originally budgeted on our initial build activity, which weighed down the starting yield. 
Importantly, during the last 12 months, we achieved strong yields on incremental invested capital in Denver, increasing the market yield by 70 basis points. This is consistent with our experience more broadly in the small cell business as co-located nodes on existing fiber come at high incremental yields, driving attractive returns over time. And finally, looking at the financial benefit of having both small cells and fiber solutions leveraging the same asset base, you can see the markets with a meaningful contribution from both offerings are generally performing better. The best example to point to here is Philadelphia, where despite having a less mature capital base and lower node density than Phoenix, it is generating a similar yield on invested capital of nearly 10%, due primarily to the higher contribution from fiber solutions. 
Our experience in Philadelphia also highlights another important point when assessing the performance of a portfolio of assets. similar to what we've seen throughout our long history of towers, when you zoom in on a particular set of assets and focus on a short time period, the picture may not always be perfect. Over the last year, the market yield in Philadelphia has contracted by 60 basis points due to a combination of a lack of small cell activity as this was not a priority market for our customers and more muted growth from fiber solutions. 
Despite this, Philadelphia is still generating a very attractive yield on invested capital, and we believe our dense fiber footprint in this top market is positioned well to capture future small cell and fiber solutions growth. In summary, the combined performance of this cohort of market provides another point of validation for our strategy, with small cells and fiber solutions growth contributing to attractive incremental yields while we continue to make discretionary investments in new assets that will expand the long-term growth opportunity. 
Turning back now to our overall strategy. As has been obvious to all of us over the last 18 months, connectivity is vital to our economy and how we live and interact with one another. Our strategy is to provide profitable solutions to connect communities and people to each other. Our business is also inherently sustainable. Our shared infrastructure solutions limit the proliferation of infrastructure and minimize the use of natural resources. 
Our solutions help address societal challenges like the digital divide in underserved communities by advancing access to education and technology. As you've seen in our last 2 sustainability reports, we've enhanced our focus on ESG, which we believe will drive increased revenue opportunities from things like smart cities and broadband for all and lower operating costs in areas like tower lighting, electric vehicles and interest savings, which Dan will discuss in just a minute. 
Importantly, none of this is possible without a team at Crown Castle that embraces diversity and inclusion, ensuring that our employees and our business partners are empowered to help us serve our customers, connect our communities and build the future of communications infrastructure in the U.S. So to wrap up, we expect to deliver outsized AFFO per share growth of 12% this year as we capitalize on the highest tower activity levels in our history with our customers deploying 5G at scale. 
We expect this elevated level of tower activity to continue beyond this year. Our diversified strategy of towers and small cells has driven higher growth than expected as we have grown our dividend at a compounded annual growth rate of 9% since we expanded our strategy in 2017. And looking forward, I believe our strategy to offer a combination of towers, small cells and fiber solutions, which are all critical components needed to develop 5G will extend our opportunity to deliver dividend per share growth of 7% to 8% per year. And when I consider the durability of the underlying demand trends we see in the U.S. that provides significant visibility into the future growth for our business, I believe Crown Castle stands out as a unique investment that we believe will generate compelling returns over time. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dan."

As Jay mentioned, 2021 is shaping up to be a great year of growth for Crown Castle as our customers deploy 5G nationwide. The elevated tower activity drove strong second quarter financial results and another increase to our full year outlook, which now includes an expected 12% growth in AFFO per share. 
Turning to second quarter results on Slide 7. Site rental revenue increased 8%, including 5.3% growth in organic contribution to site rental revenue. This growth included 8.6% growth from new leasing activity and contracted escalators net of 3.3% from nonrenewal. The higher activity levels also drove a $40 million increase in contribution from services when compared to second quarter 2020, leading to 15% growth in adjusted EBITDA and 18% growth in AFFO per share. 
Turning to Slide 8. With the strong second quarter and continued momentum, we have again increased our full year outlook, highlighted by a $30 million increase to adjusted EBITDA and a $20 million increase to AFFO. The higher activity in towers drove the majority of these changes to our outlook, including an additional $15 million in straight-line revenue, a $45 million increase to the expected contribution from services and $15 million of additional labor costs. 
The lower expected volume of small cells deployed this year that Jay discussed earlier, results in a $10 million reduction in organic contribution to site rental revenue, which translates to a 20 basis point reduction in the expected full year growth in consolidated organic contribution to site rental revenue to 5.7%. Our expectations for the contribution to full year growth from towers and fiber solutions remains unchanged, and at approximately 6% for towers and 3% for fiber solutions with small cell growth now expected to be approximately 10% compared to our previous outlook of approximately 13% growth. 
Moving to investment activities. During the second quarter, capital expenditures totaled $308 million, including $19 million of sustaining expenditures, $60 million of discretionary capital expenditures for our tower segment and $223 million of discretionary capital expenditures for our fiber segment. Our full year expectation for capital expenditures has reduced to $1.3 billion from our prior expectation of $1.5 billion. primarily attributed to the reduction in small cells we expect to deploy this year. 
Turning to our balance sheet. We exited the second quarter with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of approximately 5x, which is in line with our target leverage. Consistent with our overall focus on delivering the highest risk-adjusted return for shareholders, we have methodically reduced risk across our balance sheet over the last 5 years by reducing our exposure to variable rate debt in extending the maturity profile of our borrowings to better align the duration of our assets and liabilities. Specifically, since our first investment-grade bond offering in early 2016, we have increased the weighted average maturity from just over 5 years to nearly 10 years, increased our mix of fixed rate debt from just under 70% to more than 90%. And reduced our weighted average borrowing rate from 3.8% to 3.2%. 
Consistent with that focus, we issued $750 million of 10-year senior unsecured notes in June at 2.5% to refinance outstanding notes maturing in 2022 and to repay outstanding borrowings on our commercial paper program. Additionally, in June, we amended our existing credit facility, extending the maturity date to June 2026 and incorporating sustainability targets that resulted in lower interest rates in the facility as we achieve specified sustainability metrics over the next 5 years. We believe this was the first time sustainability targets had been incorporated in a credit facility for tower company. Adding quantifiable sustainability metrics to our inherently sustainable business model that Jay outlined earlier, highlights our commitment to delivering value to all our stakeholders. 
Stepping back and to wrap things up. We are excited about the record levels of tower activity as our customers deploy 5G at scale. We are capitalizing on those positive fundamentals and expect to deliver a great year of growth with AFFO now expected to grow 12% for the full year 2021, meaningfully above our long-term annual target of 7% to 8%. Our diverse portfolio of assets and customer solutions has performed better than expected since we meaningfully augmented our fiber footprint with a large acquisition in 2017 as we have grown our dividend per share at a compound annual growth rate of 9% over that time. 
Importantly, in some years like last year, our fiber and small cell business has driven that outperformance, while in other years like this when our tower business is the driver. We continue to invest in new assets that we believe will allow us to grow our dividend per share at 7% to 8% per year going forward. This growth provides a very attractive total return opportunity, which combined with our current approximately 3% dividend yield, and we believe our investments in new assets will extend this opportunity into the future. 
With that, Cody, I'd like to open the call to questions."

As we highlighted, there's 3 primary components of our decision to push out some of this activity beyond 2022. There's the customer prioritization, which we highlighted, the Sprint cancellation and then also the zoning and permitting challenges. 
Breaking that out by years, I would put the customer prioritization and some of the zoning and planning challenges as hitting us in 2021. And then the Sprint cancellation in '22 is the biggest impact there, along with some of the timing of the new nodes and those going out in years beyond 2022. Big picture, if I go back up to kind of what drives that and why are we seeing it? I would go back to past experiences as we've gone through technology cycles and upgrades, the network went from 2G to 3G, 3 to 4. And now we're in the middle of this move from 4G to 5G. And the carriers go through a process of really prioritizing the sites that they're already on and upgrading those sites with the new technology and in this case, it's a combination of new technology and upgrading those sites with the new spectrum bands that they've acquired. 
And so what we've seen in these early stages of 5G is a real focus on getting those new spectrum bands out on macro sites. So there's been a reprioritization of the capital spend here in calendar year 2021 of moving towards getting those macros upgraded for 5G and be prioritizing in the near term some of those small cells. So we think it's just timing, as I mentioned earlier, that they're just pushing out to the right. 
And obviously, when you look at our results and our outlook, we're seeing the push on that is going towards towers. So meaningful uplift on the services side and the tower activity and a level of elevated activity we really, frankly, on the macro tower side, have never seen in our company's history,  and we think that's going to continue into 2022 as the carriers over allocate towards macro sites, not only this year, but then next year. And then while we think it probably comes back to a more balanced activity level as we get into 2023."

As we've discussed before, those straight line increases happened a couple of ways. On the first-time install, you can see it where we get a 10-year contract, and that includes some straight-line impact. But or on an amendment where we go and add additional equipment on existing sites, we actually extend the term of the contracts or the leases at that point. We get additional straight line for both of those things. 
So what I would say is the increase in activity that Jay just talked about across both first-time installs and across the new amendment is causing a lot more activity and then more straight line to hit our numbers this year. And some of that is also having the impact you're talking about of extending the contracts, both within the large 3 national carriers, but also outside of that as other companies are increasing their activity, especially like we've talked about with DISH starting to deploy nationwide 5G network going forward. So all of those things will add into both straight line and the extension of the contract life over time."

So in some cases, those applications are related to going on towers, they're not previously on then in some cases, those applications would be for amendments on sites that they're already co-located on. So we need it collectively in terms of total applications. I don't want to get specifically into which carriers we're getting the benefit from. But we're seeing it across the board on the tower side. 
Obviously, from the 4 carriers that everybody thinks about as well as the cures that Dan was referencing that are outside of the large nationwide carriers. We're seeing activity increase there. And 2021 represents a pretty meaningful step-up from anything that we saw in the years prior to 2021. And as I mentioned before, we think that activity is going to continue into 2022 and will be reflected in our results. Obviously, big picture, as I spoke to, the longer term, this diversification, I think, has really helped us. Last year, as we went into 2020, we saw  an allocation away from towers and towards small cells and small cells and towers really helped us as we looked at our growth rate last year. And this year, moving the other direction and an allocation more towards towers and one that we think continues into '22 as securities focus on upgrading their macro sites. 
And I think -- and maybe this is kind of at the heart of your question around the activity, the carriers, it's very common for them in the -- through past technological upgrade cycles, and we think this will be true in 5G, they'll go back to the sites that they're already on and upgrade those sites for the new technology that will drive activity. And then as they move towards densification activities then we'll see more of that focused on small cells.  And then also some on the macro sites as they go on towers that they're not on currently. But we're in the cycle of the long cycle of upgrading to 5G, those early stages. They're focused on upgrading the sites that they're already on."

On your first question, I don't see it as a risk to small cells. One of the things that we have been a hallmark of the way we thought about capital investment has been a rigorous process where we consider how we invest capital. And that process",642,"Yes, Matt. On your first question, I don't see it as a risk to small cells. One of the things that we have been a hallmark of the way we thought about capital investment has been a rigorous process where we consider how we invest capital. And that process that we go through analyzes where we think demand is going to be not in the near term, but over the long term for a particular asset. As we're investing in assets like on the small cell side, where we're putting assets in at an initial yield of 6% to 7%. We have to depend on and count on future lease-up of those assets over a long period of time. And so we analyzed the opportunity to invest in those assets based on what do we believe the long-term prospects for lease-up against those assets will ultimately be. There are plenty of places around the U.S. where I think small cells will be built that our analysis will point to an answer that says that doesn't make sense for us to invest our capital there. 
We've tried to allocate our capital to the places that have the highest return and the lowest risk against that potential lease up. And as we talk about the cohort and look at these markets, they have a lot of similar characteristics in terms of what's driving that co-location. And obviously, given the amount of co-location that we've seen, even in just those cohorts that we were talking about this morning, have a lot of data around what leads to that co-location. And so we're trying to make sure we allocate capital based on the lessons that we've learned thus far and where we think the future demand is going to be. 
Now that's going to leave a lot of opportunities for somebody else to build small cells where based on our rigorous analysis, it's just not going to clear our return threshold. And so I believe the carriers will build some of that. They may find other third parties to help build some of that. I think in general, we have talked about publicly and I saw a public research report a few weeks ago that pointed to about half of the overall demand for small cells, we've constructed or built that, and the other half has been split between other third parties and the wireless carrier. 
I think as the market continues to grow, we're not so much focused on what is our percent share of the total market, but how are we doing in the particular markets where we're investing capital or have invested capital. And are we seeing co-location that's going to drive long-term yield against those assets over the long term. So it doesn't concern me. In fact, I think it points to the reality that there's going to be a lot of need for these small cells and there are going to be certain locations where it just doesn't hit our return threshold, and therefore, we won't invest capital there. 
On your second question around the 2022 guidance, I'm going to mostly beg off on that other than to make the point that we try to make in our prepared remarks. I think there are -- the large portion of our business is our tower business. We're at an elevated level of activity in calendar year 2021. We think that continues into 2022. And as we assess kind of our long-term target of growing the AFFO per share at 7% to 8% a -- We feel good about where that target is set and feel like we'll be able to meet that as we go into 2022. And the specific numbers about where that is and where it lands, we'll get into that next quarter when we give you guidance for 2022."

And obviously, they've done that in past cycles, as we mentioned. I think we were a bit surprised by how much -- how quickly it moved and how they reallocated as quickly as they did. So we got close to the final stages on a lot of these nodes, and there was a capital allocation decision on their part to invest in the equipment around macro sites over some of these small cells. So again, I mean, we said it a couple of different ways, but we think it's just timing and doesn't have any impact on the long-term returns. So a little bit surprised, but I probably would have said the same answer last year if you asked me about the macro tower business, a little bit surprised about how allocated they went towards  fiber and small cells. 
And the movement in any given year in the moment, I guess, maybe could surprise us a little bit. But longer term, when I look at the underlying returns of the business and the unit economics and where the activity is, I think we're on track for what we overall would have expected. 
With regards to -- are we looking for better returns in the fiber business, on the fiber solutions side, obviously, we're looking to grow all the revenue streams. And so to the extent there's an opportunity there that materializes, we'll pursue it.

On your first question, yes, typically, our build cycle is about 24 to 36 months. And  when you think about where is the world going, it's an interesting year on the small cell side because while we're talking about the contraction of how many nodes we're actually going to put on this year,  we signed the largest commitment of new nodes in the company's history just a few months ago. So when the carriers think about their deployment plans not just thinking about them on a 12- or an 18-month cycle. They're thinking about it over a much longer-term basis. So the 15,000 nodes that we contracted to build just a few months ago, that's in the backlog, and we're working with the customers around identifying exactly where those locations are and where they're going to be. 
And against that backdrop, I think we're still, as Dan and I both spoke to, the macro environment is very healthy today for macro towers, but the need for densification remains. And as we look at the 50,000 small cell nodes that we put in place, during 4G and see how those benefited the overall network, we think those dynamics are going to be at play in 5G, if not to a greater degree. And so the environment and where it goes, I mean, we'll give you guidance on '22 next quarter. And as we get into years beyond that, we'll give more guidance as we get to it. But I think the macro environment would suggest that the fundamental view that we had about the need for small cells, complementing the macro sites that provide coverage in the market, those tenets of our strategy are intact, and that haven't seen anything that dissuades us from that longer-term view of where capital allocation will go from the carriers, the way networks will be deployed and then where good returns will be achieved by balancing the capital investment that we have between both towers and small cells. 
On your second question around staffing, yes, the majority of that cost is coming as we scale up for this elevated level of services. And much of that would be outsourced activity and cost in order to perform that work. There are components where we staff up internally.  And then we need to scale that based on the level of activity. So if we were to see the revenues from the services business come down, then we bring back down the costs associated with it that are scaling up."

Jonathan, that's been something that we've been careful about since the beginning of the company where we wanted to make sure there wasn't an opportunity to replace our role of being the shared infrastructure provider. And so our leases prohibit network sharing and using the spectrum in a way that would, in essence, replace our role in the ecosystem. So the carriers as we contract with them, they have the right to use their spectrum for their own use and for their own network. But if we get into things like network sharing, that would be a conversation they would need to have with us, and we would -- there's a revenue opportunity there. 
Now obviously, we'd be open to having those conversations. So to the extent that there was economic value and return for one of our customers certainly be open to entertaining that conversation, but I think it would come with additional revenues as it's not permitted currently."

But as the tone and the activity would suggest that this elevated level of activity that we're seeing currently is going to continue into 2022. We have not spoken about what we think it will continue -- whether or not it will continue beyond 2022. 
I think big picture, if you look at the last decade, 2 decades of activity is there's a baseline level of activity that we have seen consistently in and out of cycles of deployment of new technologies that in many ways, it's almost like maintenance CapEx that the carriers continually invest in their assets and that drives our top line revenue growth number from new organic leasing activity. And that has happened at the beginning of cycles, middle and towards the end of technology cycles. And I think that will continue. It underlines our long-term forecast of believing that we can grow the dividend 7% to 8% per year on a compounded annual basis for a long period of time. 
And everything we see in the environment today, as 5G is getting deployed suggests that, that long-term view is intact, and we feel really good about it. So  how long it will last? We'll just have to wait and see as we get into 2022, we'll start to give you a view for '23 at that point.

The best times to be in the infrastructure business over our history have been times from the carriers had a combination of new spectrum that they had gained either through acquisitions or through auctions at the SEC. New technology changes and enough cash flow or cash on hand on the balance sheet to be able to deploy that. And we're sitting at a period of time where those factors -- all 3 of those factors are true. They have fallow spectrum that needs to be deployed. They're engaging in new technologies that are going to lower their overall costs and bring more products to us as consumers. And at the same time, they have sufficient cash flows to pay for those deployments. So that's the -- those are the best of days to be in the infrastructure business. And we have multiple well-capitalized carriers who are in exactly that position with spectrum, technology and an ability to deploy it. 
And I think that points to why we've seen these elevated levels. You paused on your second question, and I would just circle back. I think it's a fair question to ask around what is the timing of activity in the business. And one of the things that has held true for me, a truism about this industry is that you just can't predict with a lot of precision exactly when activity on a particular asset is going to see that lease-up activity. We often colloquially talk about the fact that a tower adds about 1 tenant every 10 years. Well, in reality, that means that, that 1 theoretical tower adds a tenant in a year, and the other 9 years, it doesn't add a tenant. And so looking at any short period of time can really mask what happens over a long period of time. The assets that we own, whether it's fiber or towers are located in places that we believe there's going to be a lot of need for the upgrade, both for densification and for coverage reasons, and these new technologies are driving the demand on those assets. 
And if we look out rather than looking at kind of a shorter period of time of a 1- or a 2-year period of time and look out over 10 years or 20 years, ultimately, that's how we achieve our returns. It's stacking years upon years of good growth, consistent growth in that 7% to 8% that drive towards a larger overall total return and yield across all of the assets. 
And the portfolio nature of the assets means that in certain markets, we'll see activity, in certain assets, we'll see activity in a given year. And the next year, the activity and the capital will flow towards different markets and different assets. And over a long period of time, the whole portfolio gets the uplift that we see that -- I pointed to there, I think it was on Slide 4, around the uplift in towers over a long period of time. That's the portfolio effect. But if you were to graph any 1 tower, it'd be a lot choppier than the smoothness that you see even on Page 4.

27198,1673293107,2349576,"Crown Castle International Corp. (REIT), Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2021",2021-07-22,"Earnings Calls","Crown Castle Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ben, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call this morning. As you saw from our second quarter results and increased full year outlook, we continue to generate significant growth in cash flows and dividends from the deployment of 5G in",2165,"Thanks, Ben, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call this morning. As you saw from our second quarter results and increased full year outlook, we continue to generate significant growth in cash flows and dividends from the deployment of 5G in the U.S. We are experiencing the highest level of tower activity in our history, resulting in a year of outsized growth as we now anticipate 12% growth in AFFO per share for full year 2021, meaningfully above our long-term annual target of 7% to 8%.  
Our current 7% to 8% growth target was established in 2017 when we expanded our fiber and small cell strategy through the completion of our largest acquisition. This 7% to 8% growth target was an increase of 100 basis points from our prior target since we expected a diverse portfolio to increase our ability to consistently drive long-term growth. Since that time, the strategy has worked better than expected as we have grown our dividend per share at a compounded annual growth rate of 9%, with some years being driven by outsized growth in our fiber and small cell business like last year, and other years like this one being driven by higher growth in our tower business.  
This record level of activity is tied to the existing wireless carriers increasing their spend to add more equipment to tower sites and DISH starting to build a new nationwide 5G network from scratch. We expect this elevated level of activity to continue beyond this year and support future growth on our towers. 
While driving strong growth in our tower business this year, the initial focus by our customers on towers has also led to some delays in our small cell deployment, shifting the timing of when we expect to complete the nearly 30,000 small cells contractually committed in our backlog. When combined with zoning and permitting challenges as well as the previously disclosed Sprint cancellation, we now expect to deploy approximately 5,000 small cells in each of this year and next year with the remaining nearly $20,000 from our current backlog completed beyond 2022.   
This delay has not impacted our view of long-term attractiveness of small cells since the fundamental need for small cells continues and the unit economics remain in line with our expectation. With more than 50,000 small cells on air, we have already seen how important small cells are as a key tool used by the carriers to add network capacity by reusing their spectrum over shorter and shorter distances. We believe small cells will be an even more important tool going forward as the nature of wireless networks requires continued cell site densification to meet the increasing demand for data, especially as 5G networks are deployed.  
As a result, we believe these timing factors will not alter our long-term returns on our investments or our ability to deliver on our growth objectives. Dan is going to discuss our second quarter results and our expectations for the balance of 2021 in a bit more detail, so I want to focus my comments this morning on our strategy to deliver the highest risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. 
One of the core principles of our strategy is to focus on the U.S. market because we believe it is the best market for communications infrastructure ownership, with the most attractive growth profile and the lowest risk. With that view in mind, we've invested nearly $40 billion in shared infrastructure assets that we believe are mission-critical for today's wireless networks and sit in front of what is expected to be a massive decade-long investment by our customers to deploy 5G in the U.S.  
As you can see on Slide 4, our tower and fiber investments are at 2 different stages of development and maturity. Our tower investment began more than 20 years ago at an approximately 3% yield, when we built and acquired assets that we could share across multiple customers. By providing a lower cost to each customer, we have leased up those assets over the years and generated compelling returns for our shareholders.  
As we have proven out the value proposition for our customers over time, our tower assets now generate a yield on invested capital of 11% with meaningful capacity to support additional growth. As we realize the wireless network architecture would need to evolve with 4G, requiring a network of cell sites that would be much denser and closer to end users, we expanded our shared infrastructure offering beyond towers, establishing the industry-leading small cell business in the U.S. It's encouraging that the business is already generating a current yield on invested capital of more than 7%, given the relative immaturity of these investments.  
To provide additional visibility into how our investments are progressing, we've updated our analysis of the cohort of 5 markets we introduced a year ago. Looking at a collective view of how these 5 markets have performed over the last year on Slide 5, growth from both small cells and fiber solutions has contributed to an incremental yield of 7% on the approximately $200 million of incremental net capital investment. Adjusted for the timing impacts associated with the large in-process small cell project, where capital investment has occurred in advance of the corresponding revenue and cash flows, the incremental yield is approximately 8%. This incremental yield resulted in a modest decline in the combined cash yield from 9.2% a year ago to 9% currently. This is in line with our expectations as we have invested in new small cells at a 6% to 7% initial yield that we expect to grow over time as we lease up those assets to additional customers.  
During the last year in these markets, we have added more than 500 route miles of new high-capacity fiber to support the deployment of approximately 2,000 small cells. Importantly, approximately 40% of the small cells deployed were co-located on existing fiber with the balance representing new anchor builds in attractive areas of these markets where we expect to capture future small cell and fiber solutions demand. 
We believe each of the markets shown on Slide 6 provides a helpful representation of how our overall strategy is performing over time, given how different these markets are when it comes to the average life of the investment, the density of small cell nodes per mile of fiber and the degree of contribution from both small cells and fiber solutions.  
Generally speaking, we would expect markets that have a longer average investment life to have higher returns than those with less mature assets. This is true because we have more time to add customers to existing assets, which is consistent with our historical experience with towers, where we have, on average, added about 1 tenant -- 1 new tenant every 10 years.  
Similar to our experience with the movements in yield and tower investments over time, as we showed back on Page 4, sometimes the steady climb of yields on legacy investment is less obvious as we invest in less mature assets that bring down the overall market yield. This is certainly true of some of the cohort. Very much related to the average life of the investment is the density of small cells per route mile of fiber since, as in the tower business, the co-location of additional nodes on existing fiber is what drives the yields up over time.  Consequently, we typically see a higher percentage of nodes co-located on existing fiber as the density of nodes increases. 
On the third characteristic, we believe the markets with both small cells and fiber solutions will ultimately have higher yields than those with only 1 of the 2 revenue streams. 
With this setup as a backdrop, I want to share a few observations that I think are important to highlight as we assess this data set on Page 6.  
Looking across the markets, you can see the longer average investment lives tend to correspond to higher yield. Denver has the least mature capital base and the lowest market yield, while Orlando has one of the most mature capital bases and the highest yields. In addition, the higher density of nodes per mile, which is generally correlated with the longer investment life and higher percentage of co-located nodes generates higher market yield. The financial benefit associated with co-locating nodes is apparent when looking at the incremental yield in Los Angeles and Phoenix.  
In the last year, about half of the small cells deployed across those 2 markets were co-located on existing fiber, resulting in a strong incremental yield. Meanwhile, Denver does not fit neatly into this framework, featuring the highest node density but the lowest yield. Part of the explanation is that Denver is a market where we spent more than we originally budgeted on our initial build activity, which weighed down the starting yield.  
Importantly, during the last 12 months, we achieved strong yields on incremental invested capital in Denver, increasing the market yield by 70 basis points. This is consistent with our experience more broadly in the small cell business as co-located nodes on existing fiber come at high incremental yields, driving attractive returns over time. And finally, looking at the financial benefit of having both small cells and fiber solutions leveraging the same asset base, you can see the markets with a meaningful contribution from both offerings are generally performing better. The best example to point to here is Philadelphia, where despite having a less mature capital base and lower node density than Phoenix, it is generating a similar yield on invested capital of nearly 10% due primarily to the higher contribution from fiber solutions.  
Our experience in Philadelphia also highlights another important point when assessing the performance of a portfolio of assets. Similar to what we've seen throughout our long history of towers, when you zoom in on a particular set of assets and focus on a short time period, the picture may not always be perfect. Over the last year, the market yield in Philadelphia has contracted by 60 basis points due to a combination of a lack of small cell activity as this was not a priority market for our customers and more muted growth from fiber solutions.  
Despite this, Philadelphia is still generating a very attractive yield on invested capital, and we believe our dense fiber footprint in this top market is positioned well to capture future small cell and fiber solutions growth. 
In summary, the combined performance of this cohort of market provides another point of validation for our strategy, with small cells and fiber solutions growth contributing to attractive incremental yields while we continue to make discretionary investments in new assets that will expand the long-term growth opportunity.  
Turning back now to our overall strategy. As has been obvious to all of us over the last 18 months, connectivity is vital to our economy and how we live and interact with one another. Our strategy is to provide profitable solutions to connect communities and people to each other. Our business is also inherently sustainable. Our shared infrastructure solutions limit the proliferation of infrastructure and minimize the use of natural resources.  Our solutions help address societal challenges like the digital divide in underserved communities by advancing access to education and technology. 
As you've seen in our last 2 sustainability reports, we've enhanced our focus on ESG, which we believe will drive increased revenue opportunities from things like smart cities and broadband for all and lower operating costs in areas like tower lighting, electric vehicles and interest savings, which Dan will discuss in just a minute.  
Importantly, none of this is possible without a team at Crown Castle that embraces diversity and inclusion, ensuring that our employees and our business partners are empowered to help us serve our customers, connect our communities and build the future of communications infrastructure in the U.S. 
So to wrap up, we expect to deliver outsized AFFO per share growth of 12% this year as we capitalize on the highest tower activity levels in our history with our customers deploying 5G at scale.  
We expect this elevated level of tower activity to continue beyond this year. Our diversified strategy of towers and small cells has driven higher growth than expected as we have grown our dividend at a compounded annual growth rate of 9% since we expanded our strategy in 2017. And looking forward, I believe our strategy to offer a combination of towers, small cells and fiber solutions, which are all critical components needed to develop 5G will extend our opportunity to deliver dividend per share growth of 7% to 8% per year. And when I consider the durability of the underlying demand trends we see in the U.S. that provides significant visibility into the future growth for our business, I believe Crown Castle stands out as a unique investment that we believe will generate compelling returns over time.  
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dan."

(REIT), Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2021",2021-07-22,"Earnings Calls","Crown Castle Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jay, and good morning, everyone.

As Jay mentioned, 2021 is shaping up to be a great year of growth for Crown Castle as our customers deploy 5G nationwide. The elevated tower activity drove strong second quarter financial results and another increase to our full year outlook, which now includes an expected 12% growth in AFFO per share.  
Turning to second quarter results on Slide 7. Site rental revenue increased 8%, including 5.3% growth in organic contribution to site rental revenue. This growth included 8.6% growth from new leasing activity and contracted escalators net of 3.3% from nonrenewal. The higher activity levels also drove a $40 million increase in contribution from services when compared to second quarter 2020, leading to 15% growth in adjusted EBITDA and 18% growth in AFFO per share.  
Turning to Slide 8. With the strong second quarter and continued momentum, we have again increased our full year outlook, highlighted by a $30 million increase to adjusted EBITDA and a $20 million increase to AFFO. The higher activity in towers drove the majority of these changes to our outlook including an additional $15 million in straight-line revenue, a $45 million increase to the expected contribution from services and $15 million of additional labor costs. 
The lower expected volume of small cells deployed this year that Jay discussed earlier results in a $10 million reduction in organic contribution to site rental revenue, which translates to a 20 basis point reduction in the expected full year growth in consolidated organic contribution to site rental revenue to 5.7%. Our expectations for the contribution to full year growth from towers and fiber solutions remains unchanged at approximately 6% for towers and 3% for fiber solutions, with small cell growth now expected to be approximately 10% compared to our previous outlook of approximately 13% growth. 
Moving to investment activities. During the second quarter, capital expenditures totaled $308 million, including $19 million of sustaining expenditures, $60 million of discretionary capital expenditures for our tower segment and $223 million of discretionary capital expenditures for our fiber segment. Our full year expectation for capital expenditures has reduced to $1.3 billion from our prior expectation of $1.5 billion, primarily attributed to the reduction in small cells we expect to deploy this year. 
Turning to our balance sheet. We exited the second quarter with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of approximately 5x, which is in line with our target leverage. Consistent with our overall focus on delivering the highest risk-adjusted return for shareholders, we have methodically reduced risk across our balance sheet over the last 5 years by reducing our exposure to variable rate debt in extending the maturity profile of our borrowings to better align the duration of our assets and liabilities. Specifically, since our first investment-grade bond offering in early 2016, we have increased the weighted average maturity from just over 5 years to nearly 10 years, increased our mix of fixed rate debt from just under 70% to more than 90% and reduced our weighted average borrowing rate from 3.8% to 3.2%. 
Consistent with that focus, we issued $750 million of 10-year senior unsecured notes in June at 2.5% to refinance outstanding notes maturing in 2022 and to repay outstanding borrowings on our commercial paper program. Additionally, in June, we amended our existing credit facility, extending the maturity date to June 2026 and incorporating sustainability targets that resulted in lower interest rates in the facility as we achieve specified sustainability metrics over the next 5 years. We believe this was the first time sustainability targets had been incorporated in a credit facility for tower company. 
Adding quantifiable sustainability metrics to our inherently sustainable business model that Jay outlined earlier highlights our commitment to delivering value to all our stakeholders. 
Stepping back and to wrap things up, we are excited about the record levels of tower activity as our customers deploy 5G at scale. We are capitalizing on those positive fundamentals and expect to deliver a great year of growth with AFFO now expected to grow 12% for the full year 2021, meaningfully above our long-term annual target of 7% to 8%. Our diverse portfolio of assets and customer solutions has performed better than expected since we meaningfully augmented our fiber footprint with a large acquisition in 2017 as we have grown our dividend per share at a compound annual growth rate of 9% over that time. 
Importantly, in some years like last year, our fiber and small cell business has driven that outperformance, while in other years like this one, our tower business is the driver. We continue to invest in new assets that we believe will allow us to grow our dividend per share at 7% to 8% per year going forward. This growth provides a very attractive total return opportunity when combined with our current approximately 3% dividend yield, and we believe our investments in new assets will extend this opportunity into the future. 
With that, Cody, I'd like to open the call to questions."

And then just a follow-up question.

As we highlighted, there's 3 primary components of our decision to push out some of this activity beyond 2022. There's the customer prioritization, which we highlighted, the Sprint cancellation and then also the zoning and permitting challenges. 
Breaking that out by years, I would put the customer prioritization and some of the zoning and planning challenges as hitting us in 2021. And then the Sprint cancellation in '22 is the biggest impact there, along with some of the timing of the new nodes and those going out in years beyond 2022. 
Big picture, if I go back up to kind of what drives that and why are we seeing it, I would go back to past experiences as we've gone through technology cycles and upgrades, the network went from 2G to 3G, 3 to 4. And now we're in the middle of this move from 4G to 5G. And the carriers go through a process of really prioritizing the sites that they're already on and upgrading those sites with the new technology and in this case, it's a combination of new technology and upgrading those sites with the new spectrum bands that they've acquired. 
And so what we've seen in these early stages of 5G is a real focus on getting those new spectrum bands out on macro sites. So there's been a reprioritization of the capital spend here in calendar year 2021 of moving towards getting those macros upgraded for 5G and be prioritizing in the near term some of those small cells. So we think it's just timing, as I mentioned earlier, that they're just pushing out to the right. 
And obviously, when you look at our results and our outlook, we're seeing the push on that is going towards towers. So meaningful uplift on the services side and the tower activity and a level of elevated activity we really, frankly, on the macro tower side, have never seen in our company's history. And we think that's going to continue into 2022 as the carriers over allocate towards macro sites not only this year, but then next year. And then we think it probably comes back to a more balanced activity level as we get into 2023."

As we've discussed before, those straight line increases happened a couple of ways. On the first-time install, you can see it where we get a 10-year contract, and that includes some straight-line impact but -- or on an amendment where we go and add additional equipment on existing sites. We actually extend the term of the contracts or the leases at that point. We get additional straight line for both of those things. 
So what I would say is the increase in activity that Jay just talked about across both first-time installs and across the new amendment is causing a lot more activity and then more straight line to hit our numbers this year. And some of that is also having the impact you're talking about of extending the contracts both within the large 3 national carriers, but also outside of that as other companies are increasing their activity, especially like we've talked about with DISH starting to deploy nationwide 5G network going forward. So all of those things will add into both straight line and the extension of the contract life over time."

So in some cases, those applications are related to going on towers they're not previously on, then in some cases, those applications would be for amendments on sites that they're already co-located on. So we mean it collectively in terms of total applications. 
I don't want to get specifically into which carriers we're getting the benefit from, but we're seeing it across the board on the tower side. Obviously, from the 4 carriers that everybody thinks about as well as the carriers that Dan was referencing that are outside of the large nationwide carriers, we're seeing activity increase there. And 2021 represents a pretty meaningful step-up from anything that we saw in the years prior to 2021. And as I mentioned before, we think that activity is going to continue into 2022 and will be reflected in our results. 
Obviously, big picture, as I spoke to the longer term, this diversification, I think, has really helped us. Last year, as we went into 2020, we saw  an allocation away from towers and towards small cells. And small cells and towers really helped us as we looked at our growth rate last year. And this year, moving the other direction and an allocation more towards towers and one that we think continues into '22 as the carriers focus on upgrading their macro sites. 
And I think -- and maybe this is kind of at the heart of your question around the activity. The carriers, it's very common for them in the -- through past technological upgrade cycles, and we think this will be true in 5G, they'll go back to the sites that they're already on and upgrade those sites for the new technology. That will drive activity. And then as they move towards densification activities, then we'll see more of that focused on small cells and then also some on the macro sites as they go on towers that they're not on currently. But we're in the cycle of the long cycle of upgrading to 5G, those early stages. They're focused on upgrading the sites that they're already on."

On your first question, I don't see it as a risk to small cells. One of the things that we have been a hallmark of the way we thought about capital investment has been a rigorous process where we consider how we invest capital. And that process that we go through analyzes where we think demand is going to be not in the near term, but over the long term for a particular asset. As we're investing in assets like on the small cell side, where we're putting assets in at an initial yield of 6% to 7%, we have to depend on and count on future lease-up of those assets over a long period of time. 
And so we analyzed the opportunity to invest in those assets based on what do we believe the long-term prospects for lease-up against those assets will ultimately be. There are plenty of places around the U.S. where I think small cells will be built that our analysis will point to an answer that says that doesn't make sense for us to invest our capital there. 
We've tried to allocate our capital to the places that have the highest return and the lowest risk against that potential lease-up. And as we talk about the cohort and look at these markets, they have a lot of similar characteristics in terms of what's driving that co-location. And obviously, given the amount of co-location that we've seen, even in just those cohorts that we were talking about this morning, have a lot of data around what leads to that co-location. And so we're trying to make sure we allocate capital based on the lessons that we've learned thus far and where we think the future demand is going to be. 
Now that's going to leave a lot of opportunities for somebody else to build small cells where based on our rigorous analysis, it's just not going to clear our return threshold. And so I believe the carriers will build some of that. They may find other third parties to help build some of that. I think, in general, we have talked about publicly and I saw a public research report a few weeks ago that pointed to about half of the overall demand for small cells, we've constructed or built that. And the other half has been split between other third parties and the wireless carrier. 
I think as the market continues to grow, we're not so much focused on what is our percent share of the total market, but how are we doing in the particular markets where we're investing capital or have invested capital and are we seeing co-location that's going to drive long-term yield against those assets over the long term. So it doesn't concern me. In fact, I think it points to the reality that there's going to be a lot of need for these small cells and there are going to be certain locations where it just doesn't hit our return threshold, and therefore, we won't invest capital there. 
On your second question around the 2022 guidance, I'm going to mostly beg off on that other than to make the point that we try to make in our prepared remarks. I think there are -- the large portion of our business is our tower business. We're at an elevated level of activity in calendar year 2021. We think that continues into 2022. And as we assess kind of our long-term target of growing the AFFO per share at 7% to 8%, we feel good about where that target is set. We feel like we'll be able to meet that as we go into 2022. And the specific numbers about where that is and where it lands, we'll get into that next quarter when we give you guidance for 2022."

And obviously, they've done that in past cycles, as we mentioned. I think we were a bit surprised by how much -- how quickly it moved and how they reallocated as quickly as they did. So we got close to the final stages on a lot of these nodes, and there was a capital allocation decision on their part to invest in the equipment around macro sites over some of these small cells. 
So again, I mean, we said it a couple of different ways, but we think it's just timing and doesn't have any impact on the long-term returns. So a little bit surprised, but I probably would have said the same answer last year if you asked me about the macro tower business, a little bit surprised about how allocated they went towards  fiber and small cells. 
And the movement in any given year in the moment, I guess, maybe could surprise us a little bit. But longer term, when I look at the underlying returns of the business and the unit economics and where the activity is, I think we're on track for what we overall would have expected. 
With regards to -- are we looking for better returns in the fiber business, on the fiber solutions side, obviously, we're looking to grow all the revenue streams. And so to the extent there's an opportunity there that materializes, we'll pursue it. And our sales team, I think, has done a good job coming out of the pandemic as the economy starts to open back up, we've seen good activity on that front, and they've done a really nice job as companies are starting to return to the office and seeing some opportunities there."

On your first question, yes, typically, our build cycle is about 24 to 36 months. And when you think about where is the world going, it's an interesting year on the small cell side because while we're talking about the contraction of how many nodes we're actually going to put on this year, we signed the largest commitment of new nodes in the company's history just a few months ago. 
So when the carriers think about their deployment plans, they're not just thinking about them on a 12- or an 18-month cycle. They're thinking about it over a much longer-term basis. So the 15,000 nodes that we contracted to build just a few months ago, that's in the backlog, and we're working with the customers around identifying exactly where those locations are and where they're going to be. 
And against that backdrop, I think we're still, as Dan and I both spoke to, the macro environment is very healthy today for macro towers, but the need for densification remains. And as we look at the 50,000 small cell nodes that we put in place, during 4G and see how those benefited the overall network, we think those dynamics are going to be at play in 5G, if not to a greater degree. And so the environment and where it goes, I mean, we'll give you guidance on '22 next quarter. And as we get into years beyond that, we'll give more guidance as we get to it. But I think the macro environment would suggest that the fundamental view that we had about the need for small cells, complementing the macro sites that provide coverage in the market, those tenets of our strategy are intact. And that haven't seen anything that dissuades us from that longer-term view of where capital allocation will go from the carriers, the way networks will be deployed and then where good returns will be achieved by balancing the capital investment that we have between both towers and small cells. 
On your second question around staffing, yes, the majority of that cost is coming as we scale up for this elevated level of services. And much of that would be outsourced activity and costs in order to perform that work. There are components where we staff up internally.  And then we need to scale that based on the level of activity. So if we were to see the revenues from the services business come down, then we bring back down the costs associated with it that are scaling up."

Jeff, I think -- I'm going to be careful because I don't want to get too far into really giving specific guidance around 2022. But as the tone and the activity would suggest that this elevated level of activity that we're seeing currently is going to continue into 2022. We have not spoken about what we think it will continue -- whether or not it will continue beyond 2022. 
I think big picture, if you look at the last decade, 2 decades of activity is there's a baseline level of activity that we have seen consistently in and out of cycles of deployment of new technologies that, in many ways, it's almost like maintenance CapEx that the carriers continually invest in their assets and that drives our top line revenue growth number from new organic leasing activity. And that has happened at the beginning of cycles, middle and towards the end of technology cycles. And I think that will continue. It underlines our long-term forecast of believing that we can grow the dividend 7% to 8% per year on a compounded annual basis for a long period of time. 
And everything we see in the environment today, as 5G is getting deployed suggests that, that long-term view is intact, and we feel really good about it. So how long it will last? We'll just have to wait and see as we get into 2022, we'll start to give you a view for '23 at that point. But elevated levels, certainly this year and next year compared to what we've seen over the last 3 to 5 years."

(REIT), Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2021",2021-07-22,"Earnings Calls","Crown Castle Inc.","Executives","Historically, it's been a combination of both.  The best times to be in the infrastructure business over our history have been time when the carriers had a combination of new spectrum that they had gained either through acquisitions or through auctions at",540,"Historically, it's been a combination of both.  The best times to be in the infrastructure business over our history have been time when the carriers had a combination of new spectrum that they had gained either through acquisitions or through auctions at the FCC, new technology changes and enough cash flow or cash on hand on the balance sheet to be able to deploy that. And we're sitting at a period of time where those factors -- all 3 of those factors are true. They have fallow spectrum that needs to be deployed. They're engaging in new technologies that are going to lower their overall costs and bring more products to us as consumers. And at the same time, they have sufficient cash flows to pay for those deployments. So that's the -- those are the best of days to be in the infrastructure business. And we have multiple well-capitalized carriers who are in exactly that position with spectrum, technology and an ability to deploy it. 
And I think that points to why we've seen these elevated levels. You paused on your second question, and I would just circle back. I think it's a fair question to ask around what is the timing of activity in the business. And one of the things that has held true for me, a truism about this industry is that you just can't predict with a lot of precision exactly when activity on a particular asset is going to see that lease-up activity. We often colloquially talk about the fact that a tower adds about 1 tenant every 10 years. Well, in reality, that means that, that 1 theoretical tower adds a tenant in a year, and the other 9 years, it doesn't add a tenant. And so looking at any short period of time can really mask what happens over a long period of time. The assets that we own, whether it's fiber or towers are located in places that we believe there's going to be a lot of need for the upgrade, both for densification and for coverage reasons. And these new technologies are driving the demand on those assets. 
And if we look out -- rather than looking at kind of a shorter period of time of a 1- or a 2-year period of time and look out over 10 years or 20 years, ultimately, that's how we achieve our returns. It's stacking years upon years of good growth, consistent growth in that 7% to 8% that drive towards a larger overall total return and yield across all of the assets. 
And the portfolio nature of the assets means that in certain markets, we'll see activity, in certain assets, we'll see activity in a given year. And the next year, the activity and the capital will flow towards different markets and different assets. And over a long period of time, the whole portfolio gets the uplift that we see that -- I pointed to there, I think it was on Slide 4, around the uplift in towers over a long period of time. That's the portfolio effect. But if you were to graph any 1 tower, it'd be a lot choppier than the smoothness that you see even on Page 4."

As you saw from our results yesterday, we remain on track to generate an anticipated 12% growth in AFFO per share this year. We expect to be at the high end of our long-term growth target in 2022, with 8% AFFO per share growth being driven in large part by our expectation that tower core leasing activity will be approximately 50% higher in 2022 than our trailing 5-year average. 
And we increased our annualized common stock dividend by approximately 11% to $5.88 per share, marking the second consecutive year of dividend growth that meaningfully exceeds our long-term target. Given that our dividend payout ratio has remained largely unchanged since 2014, our dividend remains the best indicator of how we are performing, both financially and operationally. 
Our significant outperformance in 2021 combined with our forecast for 2022 enabled us to raise our dividend 11%, well above our stated goal for the second year in a row. In essence, we've achieved 3 years of targeted dividend growth in just 2 years. Since we established our common stock dividend in 2014, we have grown dividends per share at a compounded annual growth rate of 9%, with growth ranging from 7% to 11% in each year. 
Before adding a little more detail to my summary points from the earnings release, I wanted to comment on the other press release we issued yesterday, where we announced our goal to be carbon neutral by 2025. We aim to provide profitable solutions to connect communities and people, and our carbon neutral goal builds on our commitment to deploy our strategy sustainably. 
Our business model is inherently sustainable as shared solutions limit infrastructure in the communities in which we operate and minimize the use of natural resources. Further to the point, our core value proposition since we began operating more than 25 years ago has centered around our ability to provide our customers with access to mission-critical infrastructure at a lower cost because we can share that infrastructure across multiple operators. 
In addition, our solutions help address societal challenges like the digital divide in underserved communities by advancing access to education and technology. To date, we have invested nearly $10 billion in towers, small cells and fiber assets located in low-income areas. 
As a way of quantifying how our business model minimizes the use of natural resources, our business emits just 1 ton of CO2 per $1 billion of enterprise value, which is 90x more efficient than the average company in the S&P 500 based on industry estimates. Although we are proud of our limited environmental impact, we are focused on making even more strides by reducing our energy consumption and sourcing renewable energy to help us achieve our goal of carbon neutrality by 2025. We are excited about this announcement and look forward to continuing to find ways to help our communities and planet while driving significant returns to our shareholders. 
Turning back to our 2022 outlook. We are benefiting from record levels of activity in our Tower business with our customers upgrading thousands of existing cell sites as a part of their first phase of 5G build-out. Adding to the opportunity, we are seeing the highest level of tower co-location activity in our history with DISH building a nationwide 5G network from scratch. 
I believe our strategy and unmatched portfolio of more than 40,000 towers and approximately 80,000 route miles of fiber concentrated in the top U.S. markets have positioned Crown Castle to capitalize both on the current environment and to grow our cash flows and dividends per share in the near term and for years to come. We are focused on generating this growth while delivering the highest risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders by investing in shared infrastructure assets that lowered the implementation and operating costs for our customers while generating solid returns for our shareholders. 
To execute on this strategy, we are providing our customers with access to our 40,000 towers and 80,000 route miles of fiber to help them build out their 5G wireless networks. We are investing in new small cell and fiber assets that meet our disciplined and rigorous underwriting standards to expand our long-term addressable market. And we are identifying where wireless networks are going and investing early to position the company to capitalize on future opportunities as we have done with small cells, edge computing and CBRS. 
One of the core principles underpinning our strategy is to focus on the U.S. market because we believe it represents the best market in the world for wireless infrastructure ownership since it has the most attractive growth profile and the lowest risk. And we believe this dynamic of higher growth and lower risk will continue into the future, which is why we expect our U.S.-based strategy will drive significant returns for shareholders. 
With that in mind, we have invested nearly $40 billion in towers, small cells and fiber assets in the top markets that are all foundational for the development of future 5G networks. We believe our unique strategy, portfolio of infrastructure assets and proactive identification of future opportunities provide a platform for sustained long-term dividend growth as wireless network architecture evolves and our customers' priority shift over time. 
Today, our customers are primarily focusing their investment on macro sites as towers remain the most cost-effective way to deploy spectrum at scale and establish broad network coverage. With our high-quality towers concentrated in the top markets, we are clearly benefiting from this focus with an expected 6% organic growth for our Tower segment in 2021 and an expected 20% increase in tower core leasing activity next year when compared to these 2021 levels. 
With history as a guide, we believe the deployment of additional spectrum on existing cell sites will not be enough to keep pace with the persistent 30%-plus annual growth in mobile data traffic. As a result, we expect cell site densification to remain a critical tool for carriers to respond to the continued growth in mobile data demand as it enables our customers to get the most out of their spectrum assets by reusing the spectrum over shorter and shorter distances. 
When the current cell site upgrade phase shifts the densification phase, we believe the comprehensive offering of towers, small cells and fiber will be critical for our customers and provide us with an opportunity to further extend the runway of growth in our business. While we expect the densification phase of build-out will drive additional leasing on our tower assets for years to come, we believe small cells will play an even greater role as the coverage area of cell sites will continue to shrink due to the density of people and therefore, the density of wireless data demand. 
With more than 80,000 small cells on air or committed in our backlog, high-capacity fiber assets in the vast majority of the top 30 markets in the U.S. and industry-leading capabilities, we believe we are well positioned to deliver value to our customers as their priorities evolve, driving meaningful growth in our small cell business. Bigger picture, when I consider the durability of the underlying demand trends we see in the U.S., how well we are positioned to consistently deliver growth through all phases of the 5G build-out with significant potential upside in our comprehensive asset base as wireless networks continue to evolve, our proven ability to proactively identify where wireless network architecture is heading and to be an early investor in solutions to help future networks, the deliberate decisions we have made to reduce risks associated with our strategy and our history of steady execution, I believe that Crown Castle stands out as a unique investment that will generate compelling returns over time. 
In the near term, as I mentioned before, we expect to deliver outsized AFFO per share growth of 12% in 2021. We expect to generate 8% growth in AFFO per share in 2022 at the high end of our long-term growth target and supported by an expected 20% increase in tower core leasing activity. And we increased our common stock dividend by 11% for the second consecutive year. 
Longer term, we believe Crown Castle provides an exciting opportunity for shareholders to invest in the development of 5G in the U.S., which we believe is the best market for communications infrastructure ownership. Importantly, we provide access to such attractive industry dynamics while providing a compelling total return opportunity, comprised of a high-quality dividend that currently yields 3.5% with expected growth in net dividend of 7% to 8% annually. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dan."

Good morning, everyone. As Jay discussed, we delivered another great quarter of results in the third quarter. We remain on track to grow AFFO per share by an anticipated 12% this year. We expect to be at the high end of our growth target in 2",986,"Thanks, Jay. Good morning, everyone. As Jay discussed, we delivered another great quarter of results in the third quarter. We remain on track to grow AFFO per share by an anticipated 12% this year. We expect to be at the high end of our growth target in 2022 with 8% AFFO per share growth. And we increased our quarterly common stock dividend by 11% for the second consecutive year, meaningfully above our long-term target growth rate while maintaining a consistent payout ratio. 
We are excited about the outsized growth we are experiencing in the early stages of 5G. And we continue to believe our portfolio of towers, small cells and fiber provides unmatched exposure to what we believe will be a decade-long build-out by our customers. 
Turning to Slide 4 of the presentation. Our third quarter results were highlighted by 8% growth in site rental revenues, 11% growth in adjusted EBITDA and 13% growth in AFFO per share when compared to the same period last year. Record tower activity level supported this strong growth, generating organic tower growth of 6.3% and higher services contribution when compared to the same period in 2020. 
Looking at our full year outlook for 2021 and 2022 on Slide 5. We are maintaining our 2021 outlook with site rental revenues, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO growing 7%, 11% and 14%, respectively. For full year 2022, we expect continuing investments in 5G to drive another very good year for us with 5% site rental revenue growth, 6% growth in adjusted EBITDA and 8% AFFO growth. 
Turning now to Slide 6. The full year 2022 outlook includes an expected organic contribution to site rental revenues of $245 million to $285 million or 5%, consisting of approximately 5.5% growth from towers, 5% growth from small cells and 3% growth from fiber solutions. 
As you likely saw in our press release, when we refer to new leasing activity, we include the change in amortization of prepaid rent, consistent with how we have discussed activity in the past. To address feedback we've received to provide more detail around our expectations for future -- for leasing activity, we have introduced a new concept of core leasing activity, which excludes the impact of changes in prepaid rent amortization. 
Core leasing activity is more indicative of current period activity, whereas changes in prepaid rent amortization also include activity from prior periods as prepaid rent received in those prior periods eventually amortizes to 0 over the life of the associated contract. Although we have consistently provided disclosure on prepaid rent amortization by segment in our supplemental earnings materials, we hope this new presentation format provides a cleaner way for investors to analyze our performance. 
With that definition in mind, we expect 2022 core leasing activity of $340 million at the midpoint or $350 million inclusive of the year-over-year change in prepaid rent amortization. The 2022 expected core leasing activity includes $160 million in towers, representing a 20% increase when compared to our 2021 outlook and an approximately 50% increase when compared to our 5-year trailing average; $30 million in small cells compared to $45 million in 2021; and $150 million in fiber solutions compared to $165 million expected this year. 
Turning to Slide 7. You can see we expect approximately 90% of the organic site rental revenue growth to flow through to AFFO growth, highlighting the strong operating leverage in our business. As we discussed in July, we expect to deploy an additional 5,000 small cells in 2022, which is the same number we expect to build in 2021. 
We expect discretionary CapEx to be approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion in 2022, including approximately $300 million for towers and $800 million to $900 million for fiber, similar to what we expect in 2021. This translates to $700 million to $800 million of net CapEx when factoring in the $400 million of prepaid rent contribution we expect to receive in 2022. 
The full year 2022 outlook for CapEx represents an expected 30% reduction in discretionary CapEx for our Fiber segment relative to full year 2022 when we deployed approximately 10,000 small cells. Based on the expected growth in cash flows for full year 2022 and consistent with our investment-grade credit profile, we expect to fund our discretionary CapEx with free cash flow and incremental debt capacity without the need for new equity for the fourth consecutive year. 
In addition, we believe our business and balance sheet are well positioned to support consistent AFFO growth through various economic cycles, including during periods of higher inflation and interest rates. Our cost structure is largely fixed in nature, as you can see, with nearly 90% of the full year 2022 expected organic site rental revenue growth to flow through to AFFO growth as I referenced earlier. 
And we have taken steps to further strengthen our investment-grade balance sheet that now has more than 90% fixed rate debt, a weighted average maturity of more than 9 years and a weighted average interest rate of 3.1%. 
In conclusion, we are excited about the outsized growth we are generating as a result of the initial 5G build-out by our customers, which is translating into back-to-back years of 11% growth in our quarterly common stock dividend. This dividend currently equates to an approximate 3.5% yield, which we believe is a compelling valuation given our expectation of growing the dividend 7% to 8% per year, combined with our high-quality, predictable and stable cash flows. 
Looking further out, we believe our unique ability to offer towers, small cells and fiber solutions, which are all integral components of communications networks, provides significant optionality to capitalize on the long-term positive industry trends of network improvement and densification and gives us the best opportunity to consistently deliver growth as wireless network architecture continues to evolve and our customers' priorities shift over time. 
With that, April, I'd like to open the call to questions."

I'll take the big picture question, and Dan can walk through how it flow into the income statement. One of the things that we made the comment, I made the comment in the prepared remarks and was also in the press release. The amount of leasing activity we're seeing in the business is just unprecedented. 50% above our historical 5-year average in terms of core activity is just remarkable. A business that rarely has inflection points, to see that kind of uplift in activity is just really unique. 
And it's been 20 years since we've seen this kind of level of activity. And I think largely that is occurring because of the backdrop that we have with the wireless carriers. Among Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile, all 3 of them are at a place where they're deploying network at scale, both new sites as well as upgrading existing sites to 5G. So that's a very healthy dynamic to have all of the existing carriers spending at a pretty healthy rate. 
And just as an aside, I would say it's also really encouraging to us based on the commentary that they've made and the CapEx dollars that they've allocated towards this, this is going to be a multiyear activity. It's not as though the activity is just sort of going to wind down in calendar year '22. So we feel like the backdrop for those 3 carriers is really good and likely to stay for an extended period of time. 
And then on top of that, as you referenced with DISH on top of the 3 carriers, the legacy carriers deploying 5G, we also have this new entrant who is deploying a network from scratch. And that activity is beginning in earnest in 2022. 
So obviously, we signed the agreement with them last year. They made a large commitment to us, 20,000 sites. And it's been impressive to watch as they've stood up that organization and gotten them themselves in a place where they can deploy network at scale and at speed. 
And so I know our team, employees listening to this call this morning. A lot of them are very, very busy standing up this new nationwide network for DISH. And so that is causing some of the other revenues in the mix to tick up a little bit. 
I would also point out, in addition to kind of the -- what you would think of as traditional wireless carriers, there are also a number of new business models that any one of them are not having a meaningful uplift on tower leasing activity. But as a combined group of others, there are lots of businesses that are trying to figure out ways to deploy wireless network, and they're using spectrum bands outside of the spectrum bands that are owned by the wireless carriers. And that's contributing to our revenue growth, and we think that will continue over time."

Mike, I'll try to address the other part of your question, which is the activity levels versus what flows through into the income statement going into 2022. 
As you pointed out, there's always a bit of a lag time between activity and when we can see the revenue. We don't start recognizing revenue until a lease has begun, and that means that the site is up and running and able to produce -- and able to deploy the spectrum. 
And what that can do at times is delink for a period of time activity from when we see the improvement in our income statement. But what I'll say is that when we look at 2022, we're really excited by how that's going because as Jay had mentioned, the increase in activity is flowing through both in 2021, which has a 30% increase in core leasing tower activity over 2020 and then again, in 2022, where we're increasing again by 20%. 
And as Jay mentioned, those are huge numbers when you're talking about our business. So it is flowing through our income statement even with those delays or delays in -- from activity to when we actually turn on a lease. 
And the last thing I would point out is as we've made this point before, but with -- specifically with DISH, even though we signed a long-term contract with them, we won't recognize revenue until we have a lease, which means we have a site that is capable of deploying spectrum and propagating that spectrum. So there will be time between the activity levels and when that leasing activity hits our income statement as well, but that's reflected in our 2022 outlook."

The majority of that incremental $20 million of churn is related to Sprint sites. And it would be consistent with what our disclosure has been in our supplemental earnings materials over time of what those sites look like and what could be at risk for 2022. 
So we do think that's going to happen, which is why we have it in the outlook. I wouldn't say it's conservative or aggressive. It's just our belief of how that's going to play out. And with respect to the rest of the churn, you can see that we are going to have

I don't have anything to report on this front. Obviously, they've been clear about the need to achieve some synergies in their network as they go through the process of combining with Sprint and rationalizing some sites. We think those are most likely to come on the sites that we refer to as dual residency, meaning sites where both T-Mobile and Sprint are co-located on the same site. 
And we'll work with them as they go through that process of achieving those synergies. At the same time, they need to port the spectrum on to other sites and onto the legacy T-Mobile assets. And so there's a large coordination work with them, both in terms of achieving the synergies and also standing their network up and getting it ready for 5G. 
And so we're actively engaged in that. I think we still have the view that over the long term, the growth opportunities there are going to exceed that of any churn that we'll realize.

You've made the point that there tends to be a lag between when you sign business and when it shows up on your P&L. And I think it's also pretty true with regards to your CapEx, particularly in the small cell business, there can be a pretty big lag between when you're deploying that fiber and when you're actually getting the leasing activity. 
So with this being the sort of second consecutive year where your discretionary CapEx is at a lower run rate predominantly because of what's going on, I believe, predominantly because of what's going on with the node deployment, is this deployment run rate of about 5,000 that you're seeing this year probably what you're going to get next year until we get visibility into CapEx moving higher? So that would be the first question. 
And then the second is why did you decide to go ahead and once again raised dividend by more than the rate of growth in AFFO per share? It certainly seems like you could also consider doing buybacks in years where you think you have a little excess capacity. And I was hoping you can maybe give some insight in terms of how you're thinking about outsized dividend growth versus other forms of capital returns."

On your first question, I think you correctly characterized the nature of the CapEx. As it's coming down, we're putting less nodes on air, small cell nodes on air in 2021, similar level in 2022. So naturally, the amount of CapEx would come dow",731,"Absolutely. On your first question, I think you correctly characterized the nature of the CapEx. As it's coming down, we're putting less nodes on air, small cell nodes on air in 2021, similar level in 2022. So naturally, the amount of CapEx would come down. 
There is CapEx in those numbers related to nodes going into future periods. We've had a lot of bookings in 2021. On the small cell side, we'll be well north of 15,000 of new bookings in calendar year 2021, and we're getting started on building those nodes. While they won't come on until in all likelihood 2023 and beyond, we've already begun work on that. So there is a bit of a lag there. 
In terms of CapEx per node and unit economics, all of that has basically stayed in line with what we've seen historically. So as we get through the soft cost of getting these nodes permitted, et cetera, then we'll have a better sense of when they'll come on air, and then the bulk of the CapEx is incurred in the last few months prior to installation of the nodes. In the earlier months, we incur the CapEx associated with more soft costs around zoning and planning that we go down the process of. 
So I think we would expect to see some uplift in CapEx as we get into 2023. And the total number of nodes that we're deploying moved north of where we're going to see it in this calendar year and in 2022. 
On the dividend question, the reason why we raised it 11% this year is a combination of both the outsized growth that we saw in calendar year 2021 and then where we think the guidance will be for 2022. So our philosophy around the dividend has been basically to hold the payout ratio. Think of that as a percentage of AFFO per share, to hold that payout ratio in that 75% to 80% of AFFO per share and to pay that out in the form of a dividend. 
So in essence, the dividend raise this year is a combination of the outperformance that we've seen in 2021 and raising the dividend to bring it back in line associated with that outperformance in the calendar year and then what we think the performance will be in 2022 in the operating business. So that's our goal and how we think about sizing it is just looking at AFFO per share for the next year and then sizing the dividend appropriately for that. 
With regards to the last part of your question around how do we think about share purchases, we're coming right in line here based on the growth with where we'll be at our targeted amount of leverage of about 5x debt to EBITDA. And we certainly, as we have done historically, want to put the capital to work at its highest and best use. And highest and best use to us is a risk-adjusted return based on what we think the long-term dividend per share will be. 
And recently, most recently, the answer to that question has been answered largely by what we believe the benefit of small cells will be to the business long term of growing that dividend over the long term and maximizing the dividend per share. To the extent that as we move to a place where we're at our targeted level of leverage, and we're creating additional leverage capacity and investment capacity, we'll continue to do that same analysis and rigorously look at what we think maximizes the return and uses up the capital that we have available to us. 
Historically, we've done a lot of share purchases with that excess capital and leverage capacity, and that's absolutely what we test the returns against. So we'll have to see as we get into the future years around what's the opportunity around small cells. Is there an opportunity to invest there that meets that hurdle of highest and best use for the capital, and test that always against the opportunity to buy back shares. 
So you should certainly expect at points in time in the future that we will be buyers of our shares because that will be the highest and best use. And we'll use some of the capacity that we have to go into the market and buy back our shares."

On your first question around the activity by carrier, I don't want to speak to kind of the specific deployment plans of our customers. As I mentioned in the question, I think, that Mike asked, the activity across all of the carriers is elevated. 
We're going to see -- we think we'll see in 2022 about a 20% increased activity as compared to 2021. And that's really coming across the board. So we're seeing elevated levels of activity from all of the carriers. 
With regards to whether the year is back-end loaded, we're going into this year with a lot of activity that currently underway. And given the nature of the business where we signed a lot of leases in the current year and the next year, we get the benefit of having all 12 months of leasing in that year. We're going up the ramp as we go through 2021. 
So I think you'll see a similar ramping as we go through calendar year 2022, but maybe not quite as back-end loaded as what we've seen in past years because a lot of that uplift in actual activity applications that will drive that leasing activity that we're going to see in terms of the numbers that Dan was walking through earlier and impact the income statement. A lot of that actual application and leasing activity is actually occurring in this calendar year in 2021. 
So we've either got signed leases or we have a lot of visibility to it, which would indicate that it's not a back-end loaded here. We're not counting on a big uplift in the second half of next year."

In terms of nodes committed, there's no change in the number of nodes. So all it did was slide those nodes into years '23 and '24.

In terms of what we're going to put on air, meaning go through the operational process of building them and turning them up, we think we'll do about 5,000 this year, calendar year 2021 and turn another 5,000 on in calendar year 2022. Those will be that we put on air. 
In terms of bookings, which would refer to a node that a carrier makes a commitment to us, they sign a contract, commit to a node, and then we'll build it in future periods. Our bookings in calendar year 2021 will be well in excess of 15,000 nodes that we do in terms of bookings this calendar year. And those will come on in future years. 
As we get into calendar year 2022, we'll give you an update on where we think bookings will be at that point. But for calendar year '21, we think the number will be well in excess of 15,000, which is by far the highest bookings year we've ever had in our history on the small cell side. 
And I think it's interesting. I think it just points to the conversation I was having a few minutes ago around the landscape that we have with the carriers. This is a healthy environment with the carriers as we've ever seen, long-term commitments on the capital side, committed amounts by each of the legacy carriers and the build-out of a brand-new network. 
And at the moment, the mix that they have is heavily weighted towards macro sites. But I think over time, as we have seen in the past, I think there will be some shift of that mix of total capital spend where a portion of it will go towards small cells, and there will be less focus on macro sites. 
I think you can see that in the commitments that the carriers are making to us by over 15,000 small cell bookings this year that they're thinking about in future periods. That's going to take a significant chunk of their CapEx in those future years that we would think would move away from macro sites and towards small cells. 
And it may look more like what it did 2 or 3 years ago when we saw a real slowdown on the macro site side, and we're benefiting from an allocation of that capital towards small cells. So I think that's the benefit that we have in terms of our strategy of providing wireless networks to the carriers, and we'll benefit if they're focused on small cells or we'll benefit if they're focused on macro sites. And over time, both are just critically important to the way networks are going to be developed."

And the zoning and planning process really unchanged. But depends on the type of activity. If it's amendments, we're probably getting close to in that 6 to 9 months range. If it's a brand-new installation on an existing site, we're probably closer to 12 months."

The first one is maybe, Dan, when looking at the kind of core leasing macro tower revenue increment, $155 million to $165 million, there's a lot of interest in kind of making sure we understood the percentage of that, that is kind of locked in within holistic MLA guardrails and the percentage that could conceivably maybe be a little bit better than what your kind of initial expectation is depending on what we learn about carrier activity levels as we go into 2022. 
The second question was I want to make sure I understand, Jay, some of the comments you're making in your -- at the end of last year, we had 50,000 small cells on air and 30,000 in the committed backlog. That's 80,000. 
In your opening remarks, you said you still have 80,000 on air are committed. But then you said there's 15,000 that we've billed and when you build -- or sorry, that you've booked this year, which makes me think that, that 80,000 should actually be 95,000. Am I wrong about that?"

I do think based on zooming out a little bit and thinking about this from a bigger picture standpoint, the second part of your question there, I would affirm that as we get further into this year and into next year, we would expect there to be more bookings. The carriers are focused at the moment on macro sites and building those out, but they're -- we're also having significant conversations with them about the requirements that they're going to have around cell site density. And we think that will drive a lot of activity towards small cells. 
So in periods beyond 2023 and beyond, I think we will see an uplift to the total of number of nodes that both we have in bookings and then ultimately that we're putting on air as a need that they have in the network once they've done this initial overlay of putting it all on macro sites."

So Dave, I'll take that first question around our core leasing on the towers, how much is MLAs. When we look out into future periods like 2022, we obviously take into account the agreements we have with our customers. And as I think you're implying in the question, we have those with several of our customers at this point. 
But even within those agreements, we have upside. They're not necessarily capped. And therefore, what we try to do is come up with an estimate of what we think the activity will be from each of our customers based off of what we know today have already been signed, what we have a really good line of sight into going into next year and then what we think will happen in next year. 
And when we come up with that -- when we came up with the $155 million to $165 million. That's our best guess at what we think that activity will look like and how it will be monetized within our agreements. But I would say that there's always going to be some ability for that to be better or worse than what we expect if the activity is going to be better or worse than what we expect. 
And as Jay has mentioned a few times, we're really excited about the level of activity going into next year. That $155 million to $165 million is an increase over a really good 2021. So we're excited. We feel good about what that activity level looks like. And we'll see how it plays out in terms of when our customers come to us and want to put more equipment on towers."

We think that the fiber solutions business is going to operate at around a 3% annual growth rate. And that's what we're seeing in calendar year '21. I think we'll see a similar level in '22. 
There was some impact during COVID, particularly in the early months of 2021 and late 2020 associated with offices being closed. But honestly, our business was -- because of the nature of large enterprises, universities and government, which make up the bulk of the fiber solutions revenue that we do, we were not impacted nearly to the extent that fiber companies who are more focused on small and medium enterprises saw an impact. 
So we didn't see a falloff as many of them did. And then conversely, as the economy started to open back up, we just did not see as much of an uplift. So I would say, similar business environment to what we've seen the last couple of years, maybe a little bit better. But I think the growth is basically in line with what we've seen of about 3%. 
Churn is down. We think it will be down. This is an area that I know our team has focused really hard on. A part of it is making sure that we're being thoughtful about the kind of customers that we pursue on the front end. And then also, as we manage the relationship as we get close to a contract renewal, being thoughtful about how we handle those contract renewals. 
And I think the team has done a really nice job, and we've seen some benefit from some of their work. And we think we'll see more of that in '22 as we go through the process of managing the renewals in the end of term on some of those contracts. 
On your second question around small cell nodes and firm dates, we talked a little bit, I think, Nick, about this on the last quarterly call. We made a -- and it should be viewed this way, we made an affirmative choice to work with our customers on pushing out these nodes into future periods. 
Our contractual rights, I think, would have given us the ability to really push to turn these nodes to the point where we could have handed them over and charge rent to the carriers. But we made the affirmative decision -- given the volume that was coming our way and the reallocation of the dollars from the small cells to the macro sites, we made the affirmative decision to work with them and give them an ability to push out those dates. 
So there may be circumstances that arise in the future where we would not be willing to do that. But this was an affirmative decision that we made based on managing the customer relationship and maximizing what we thought was the return. 
The volume, as I said before, the volume and the revenues and cash flows all end up at the same place. But if we could maximize early some of the macro site revenues and work with the customers to give them an extension on when we turn the small cells on, we thought that made good business sense, and that's why we did it. But contractually, we would have a right to do something a little different."

CBRS is helping. Cable is helping. There's broadcast that is helping. There are a number of areas that we're seeing leasing demand for macro sites. And we think that will continue into the future. 
I wouldn't call it out as a material impact to our 2021 or 2022 leasing results. But at the margin, it does help and does drive the incremental growth that we're talking about in site rental revenues. I think given the amount of spectrum that there is outside of the hands of the carriers and the capital that is in some of those sectors in order to deploy wireless network, I think on the longer-term model, if you take a 5- or a 10-year view, I think there is some meaningful leasing activity that's going to happen outside of what you think of as the legacy or traditional wireless carriers that will benefit macro and small -- macro sites as well as small cells over time. And as we start to see that, we'll give you more details around what those impacts are going to be. 
On your second question around supply chain constraints, obviously, I think the whole world is feeling the impacts of that, and much has been written about it. We've worked really closely with our customers on when they expect to receive equipment and the timing of that and then trying to make sure we line up sites to be ready for them based on when the equipment is received. 
I think they've done a nice job of working with their supply chains and having equipment available to get 5G networks launched in the time frame that they expected. So it's a coordination activity, certainly a communication activity that our teams are having with their team. And thus far, that dialogue has proven to be a predictable indicator of when actual activity does happen on our sites. So we're watching it, paying attention to it, but feel pretty good about the fact that our outlook does assume the environment of constraints that are out there and our leasing expectations are a function of the coordination and communication we're having with our carriers on when equipment will be available."

And as I made comments earlier, the most efficient way to deploy spectrum and deploy network is to share it. And so our offering of infrastructure, shared infrastructure, lowers their cost and speeds their time to deployment. And so we certainly would expect to benefit indirectly as those federal funds become available and broadband for all becomes built out."

But like when you talk to Verizon or AT&T, it seems like -- or even T-Mobile, it seems that the macro focus and that the C-band plans even in terms of upgrading to massive MIMO is a 2- to 3-year process. So I'm just curious kind of in your thoughts when do you think there will kind of be this pivot back to the small cells where we'll see some actual growth there?"

I think some of it you can see in just their activity with us. The commitment that they made of 15,000 small cell nodes is an indication that they're thinking about it in the near-term planning horizon of what's going to be required in their network as they're going through the process of working on macro sites and then working on -- and then starting to infill and densify the network. 
And this is a pattern that's followed -- we saw this occur with 3G. We saw it occur with 4G, where -- and now we're seeing it with 5G, where the first step of deployment in the network is the carriers go and touch all of the assets that they're already on and upgrade those sites to the new technology. And then once they get that overlay done, then they come back, and they really focus heavily on densification. 
So when we look at the way the networks are performing, both on terms of the sites that have already been upgraded and the usage -- the data usage on those sites, from a technical standpoint, the capacity starts to get reached. And therefore, they've got to the term that's been historically used, they've got a cell split. They've got to reuse that spectrum over more sites. 
And the dynamic that we've seen in the market, and I think this is reflective of the nodes that we're booking now, there's not other macro sites that they can use to self split that spectrum. They're already on those macro sites. And so they've got to figure out a way to densify the network and reuse the spectrum in places that are not sort of the traditional macro sites. 
And we think that's where we get the real benefit on the small cell side. I think as we get into calendar years '23 and beyond, I think we'll really see that movement, probably similar to what we saw at 4G. Like we got to the point where in 4G, we had added 4G to all of the towers, and then we saw significant activity on the small cell side as they upgraded sites to improve the network and densified 4G using small cells. We think we'll see a similar thing on the 5G side to an even greater extent given the types of spectrum bands that are being used and the amount of increase in data traffic is just going to require more than macro sites can deliver.

As you saw from our results yesterday, we remain on track to generate an anticipated 12% growth in AFFO per share this year. We expect to be at the high end of our long-term growth target in 2022, with 8% AFFO per share growth being driven in large part by our expectation that tower core leasing activity will be approximately 50% higher in 2022 than our trailing 5-year average. 
And we increased our annualized common stock dividend by approximately 11% to $5.88 per share, marking the second consecutive year of dividend growth that meaningfully exceeds our long-term target. Given that our dividend payout ratio has remained largely unchanged since 2014, our dividend remains the best indicator of how we are performing, both financially and operationally. 
Our significant outperformance in 2021 combined with our forecast for 2022 enabled us to raise our dividend 11%, well above our stated goal for the second year in a row. In essence, we've achieved 3 years of targeted dividend growth in just 2 years. Since we established our common stock dividend in 2014, we have grown dividends per share at a compounded annual growth rate of 9%, with growth ranging from 7% to 11% in each year. 
Before adding a little more detail to my summary points from the earnings release, I wanted to comment on the other press release we issued yesterday, where we announced our goal to be carbon neutral by 2025. We aim to provide profitable solutions to connect communities and people, and our carbon neutral goal builds on our commitment to deploy our strategy sustainably. 
Our business model is inherently sustainable as shared solutions limit infrastructure in the communities in which we operate and minimize the use of natural resources. Further to the point, our core value proposition since we began operating more than 25 years ago has centered around our ability to provide our customers with access to mission-critical infrastructure at a lower cost because we can share that infrastructure across multiple operators. 
In addition, our solutions help address societal challenges like the digital divide in underserved communities by advancing access to education and technology. To date, we have invested nearly $10 billion in towers, small cells and fiber assets located in low-income areas. 
As a way of quantifying how our business model minimizes the use of natural resources, our business emits just 1 ton of CO2 per $1 billion of enterprise value, which is 90x more efficient than the average company in the S&P 500 based on industry estimates. Although we are proud of our limited environmental impact, we are focused on making even more strides by reducing our energy consumption and sourcing renewable energy to help us achieve our goal of carbon neutrality by 2025. We are excited about this announcement and look forward to continuing to find ways to help our communities and planet while driving significant returns to our shareholders. 
Turning back to our 2022 outlook. We are benefiting from record levels of activity in our Tower business with our customers upgrading thousands of existing cell sites as a part of their first phase of 5G build-out. Adding to the opportunity, we are seeing the highest level of tower co-location activity in our history with DISH building a nationwide 5G network from scratch. 
I believe our strategy and unmatched portfolio of more than 40,000 towers and approximately 80,000 route miles of fiber concentrated in the top U.S. markets have positioned Crown Castle to capitalize both on the current environment and to grow our cash flows and dividends per share in the near term and for years to come. We are focused on generating this growth while delivering the highest risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders by investing in shared infrastructure assets that lowered the implementation and operating costs for our customers while generating solid returns for our shareholders. 
To execute on this strategy, we are providing our customers with access to our 40,000 towers and 80,000 route miles of fiber to help them build out their 5G wireless networks. We are investing in new small cell and fiber assets that meet our disciplined and rigorous underwriting standards to expand our long-term addressable market. And we are identifying where wireless networks are going and investing early to position the company to capitalize on future opportunities as we have done with small cells, edge computing and CBRS. 
One of the core principles underpinning our strategy is to focus on the U.S. market because we believe it represents the best market in the world for wireless infrastructure ownership since it has the most attractive growth profile and the lowest risk. And we believe this dynamic of higher growth and lower risk will continue into the future, which is why we expect our U.S.-based strategy will drive significant returns for shareholders. 
With that in mind, we have invested nearly $40 billion in towers, small cells and fiber assets in the top markets that are all foundational for the development of future 5G networks. We believe our unique strategy, portfolio of infrastructure assets and proactive identification of future opportunities provide a platform for sustained long-term dividend growth as wireless network architecture evolves and our customers' priority shift over time. 
Today, our customers are primarily focusing their investment on macro sites as towers remain the most cost-effective way to deploy spectrum at scale and establish broad network coverage. With our high-quality towers concentrated in the top markets, we are clearly benefiting from this focus with an expected 6% organic growth for our Tower segment in 2021 and an expected 20% increase in tower core leasing activity next year when compared to these 2021 levels. 
With history as a guide, we believe the deployment of additional spectrum on existing cell sites will not be enough to keep pace with the persistent 30%-plus annual growth in mobile data traffic. As a result, we expect cell site densification to remain a critical tool for carriers to respond to the continued growth in mobile data demand as it enables our customers to get the most out of their spectrum assets by reusing the spectrum over shorter and shorter distances. 
When the current cell site upgrade phase shifts the densification phase, we believe the comprehensive offering of towers, small cells and fiber will be critical for our customers and provide us with an opportunity to further extend the runway of growth in our business. While we expect the densification phase of build-out will drive additional leasing on our tower assets for years to come, we believe small cells will play an even greater role as the coverage area of cell sites will continue to shrink due to the density of people and therefore, the density of wireless data demand. 
With more than 80,000 small cells on air or committed in our backlog, high-capacity fiber assets in the vast majority of the top 30 markets in the U.S. and industry-leading capabilities, we believe we are well positioned to deliver value to our customers as their priorities evolve, driving meaningful growth in our small cell business. Bigger picture, when I consider the durability of the underlying demand trends we see in the U.S., how well we are positioned to consistently deliver growth through all phases of the 5G build-out with significant potential upside in our comprehensive asset base as wireless networks continue to evolve, our proven ability to proactively identify where wireless network architecture is heading and to be an early investor in solutions to help future networks, the deliberate decisions we have made to reduce risks associated with our strategy and our history of steady execution, I believe that Crown Castle stands out as a unique investment that will generate compelling returns over time. 
In the near term, as I mentioned before, we expect to deliver outsized AFFO per share growth of 12% in 2021. We expect to generate 8% growth in AFFO per share in 2022 at the high end of our long-term growth target and supported by an expected 20% increase in tower core leasing activity. And we increased our common stock dividend by 11% for the second consecutive year. 
Longer term, we believe Crown Castle provides an exciting opportunity for shareholders to invest in the development of 5G in the U.S., which we believe is the best market for communications infrastructure ownership. Importantly, we provide access to such attractive industry dynamics while providing a compelling total return opportunity, comprised of a high-quality dividend that currently yields 3.5% with expected growth in net dividend of 7% to 8% annually. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dan."

Good morning, everyone. As Jay discussed, we delivered another great quarter of results in the third quarter. We remain on track to grow AFFO per share by an anticipated 12% this year.

We remain on track to grow AFFO per share by an anticipated 12% this year. We expect to be at the high end of our growth target in 2022 with 8% AFFO per share growth. And we increased our quarterly common stock dividend by 11% for the second consecutive year, meaningfully above our long-term target growth rate while maintaining a consistent payout ratio. 
We are excited about the outsized growth we are experiencing in the early stages of 5G. And we continue to believe our portfolio of towers, small cells and fiber provides unmatched exposure to what we believe will be a decade-long build-out by our customers. 
Turning to Slide 4 of the presentation. Our third quarter results were highlighted by 8% growth in site rental revenues, 11% growth in adjusted EBITDA and 13% growth in AFFO per share when compared to the same period last year. Record tower activity level supported this strong growth, generating organic tower growth of 6.3% and higher services contribution when compared to the same period in 2020. 
Looking at our full year outlook for 2021 and 2022 on Slide 5. We are maintaining our 2021 outlook with site rental revenues, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO growing 7%, 11% and 14%, respectively. For full year 2022, we expect continuing investments in 5G to drive another very good year for us with 5% site rental revenue growth, 6% growth in adjusted EBITDA and 8% AFFO growth. 
Turning now to Slide 6. The full year 2022 outlook includes an expected organic contribution to site rental revenues of $245 million to $285 million or 5%, consisting of approximately 5.5% growth from towers, 5% growth from small cells and 3% growth from fiber solutions. 
As you likely saw in our press release, when we refer to new leasing activity, we include the change in amortization of prepaid rent, consistent with how we have discussed activity in the past. To address feedback we've received to provide more detail around our expectations for future -- for leasing activity, we have introduced a new concept of core leasing activity, which excludes the impact of changes in prepaid rent amortization. 
Core leasing activity is more indicative of current period activity, whereas changes in prepaid rent amortization also include activity from prior periods as prepaid rent received in those prior periods eventually amortizes to 0 over the life of the associated contract. Although we have consistently provided disclosure on prepaid rent amortization by segment in our supplemental earnings materials, we hope this new presentation format provides a cleaner way for investors to analyze our performance. 
With that definition in mind, we expect 2022 core leasing activity of $340 million at the midpoint or $350 million inclusive of the year-over-year change in prepaid rent amortization. The 2022 expected core leasing activity includes $160 million in towers, representing a 20% increase when compared to our 2021 outlook and an approximately 50% increase when compared to our 5-year trailing average; $30 million in small cells compared to $45 million in 2021; and $150 million in fiber solutions compared to $165 million expected this year. 
Turning to Slide 7. You can see we expect approximately 90% of the organic site rental revenue growth to flow through to AFFO growth, highlighting the strong operating leverage in our business. As we discussed in July, we expect to deploy an additional 5,000 small cells in 2022, which is the same number we expect to build in 2021. 
We expect discretionary CapEx to be approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion in 2022, including approximately $300 million for towers and $800 million to $900 million for fiber, similar to what we expect in 2021. This translates to $700 million to $800 million of net CapEx when factoring in the $400 million of prepaid rent contribution we expect to receive in 2022. 
The full year 2022 outlook for CapEx represents an expected 30% reduction in discretionary CapEx for our Fiber segment relative to full year 2022 when we deployed approximately 10,000 small cells. Based on the expected growth in cash flows for full year 2022 and consistent with our investment-grade credit profile, we expect to fund our discretionary CapEx with free cash flow and incremental debt capacity without the need for new equity for the fourth consecutive year. 
In addition, we believe our business and balance sheet are well positioned to support consistent AFFO growth through various economic cycles, including during periods of higher inflation and interest rates. Our cost structure is largely fixed in nature, as you can see, with nearly 90% of the full year 2022 expected organic site rental revenue growth to flow through to AFFO growth as I referenced earlier. 
And we have taken steps to further strengthen our investment-grade balance sheet that now has more than 90% fixed rate debt, a weighted average maturity of more than 9 years and a weighted average interest rate of 3.1%. 
In conclusion, we are excited about the outsized growth we are generating as a result of the initial 5G build-out by our customers, which is translating into back-to-back years of 11% growth in our quarterly common stock dividend. This dividend currently equates to an approximate 3.5% yield, which we believe is a compelling valuation given our expectation of growing the dividend 7% to 8% per year, combined with our high-quality, predictable and stable cash flows. 
Looking further out, we believe our unique ability to offer towers, small cells and fiber solutions, which are all integral components of communications networks, provides significant optionality to capitalize on the long-term positive industry trends of network improvement and densification and gives us the best opportunity to consistently deliver growth as wireless network architecture continues to evolve and our customers' priorities shift over time. 
With that, April, I'd like to open the call to questions."

I'll take the big picture question, and Dan can walk through how it flow into the income statement. One of the things that we made the comment, I made the comment in the prepared remarks and was also in the press release. The amount of leasing activity we're seeing in the business is just unprecedented. 50% above our historical 5-year average in terms of core activity is just remarkable. A business that rarely has inflection points, to see that kind of uplift in activity is just really unique. 
And it's been 20 years since we've seen this kind of level of activity. And I think largely that is occurring because of the backdrop that we have with the wireless carriers. Among Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile, all 3 of them are at a place where they're deploying network at scale, both new sites as well as upgrading existing sites to 5G. So that's a very healthy dynamic to have all of the existing carriers spending at a pretty healthy rate. 
And just as an aside, I would say it's also really encouraging to us based on the commentary that they've made and the CapEx dollars that they've allocated towards this, this is going to be a multiyear activity. It's not as though the activity is just sort of going to wind down in calendar year '22. So we feel like the backdrop for those 3 carriers is really good and likely to stay for an extended period of time. 
And then on top of that, as you referenced with DISH on top of the 3 carriers, the legacy carriers deploying 5G, we also have this new entrant who is deploying a network from scratch. And that activity is beginning in earnest in 2022. 
So obviously, we signed the agreement with them last year. They made a large commitment to us, 20,000 sites. And it's been impressive to watch as they've stood up that organization and gotten them themselves in a place where they can deploy network at scale and at speed. 
And so I know our team, employees listening to this call this morning. A lot of them are very, very busy standing up this new nationwide network for DISH. And so that is causing some of the other revenues in the mix to tick up a little bit. 
I would also point out, in addition to kind of the -- what you would think of as traditional wireless carriers, there are also a number of new business models that any one of them are not having a meaningful uplift on tower leasing activity. But as a combined group of others, there are lots of businesses that are trying to figure out ways to deploy wireless network, and they're using spectrum bands outside of the spectrum bands that are owned by the wireless carriers. And that's contributing to our revenue growth, and we think that will continue over time."

Mike, I'll try to address the other part of your question, which is the activity levels versus what flows through into the income statement going into 2022. 
As you pointed out, there's always a bit of a lag time between activity and when we can see the revenue. We don't start recognizing revenue until a lease has begun, and that means that the site is up and running and able to produce -- and able to deploy the spectrum. 
And what that can do at times is delink for a period of time activity from when we see the improvement in our income statement. But what I'll say is that when we look at 2022, we're really excited by how that's going because as Jay had mentioned, the increase in activity is flowing through both in 2021, which has a 30% increase in core leasing tower activity over 2020 and then again, in 2022, where we're increasing again by 20%. 
And as Jay mentioned, those are huge numbers when you're talking about our business. So it is flowing through our income statement even with those delays or delays in -- from activity to when we actually turn on a lease. 
And the last thing I would point out is as we've made this point before, but with -- specifically with DISH, even though we signed a long-term contract with them, we won't recognize revenue until we have a lease, which means we have a site that is capable of deploying spectrum and propagating that spectrum. So there will be time between the activity levels and when that leasing activity hits our income statement as well, but that's reflected in our 2022 outlook."

So we do think that's going to happen, which is why we have it in the outlook. I wouldn't say it's conservative or aggressive. It's just our belief of how that's going to play out. And with respect to the rest of the churn, you can see that we are going to have churn on our fiber solutions business a bit down year-over-year from 2021 to 2022. But we also have a corresponding reduction in a new leasing activity on our fiber solutions business. So we think that business will continue to grow around 3%. That's how we're thinking about churn going into 2022."

I don't have anything to report on this front. Obviously, they've been clear about the need to achieve some synergies in their network as they go through the process of combining with Sprint and rationalizing some sites. We think those are most likely to come on the sites that we refer to as dual residency, meaning sites where both T-Mobile and Sprint are co-located on the same site. 
And we'll work with them as they go through that process of achieving those synergies. At the same time, they need to port the spectrum on to other sites and onto the legacy T-Mobile assets. And so there's a large coordination work with them, both in terms of achieving the synergies and also standing their network up and getting it ready for 5G. 
And so we're actively engaged in that. I think we still have the view that over the long term, the growth opportunities there are going to exceed that of any churn that we'll realize. And then obviously, to help investors understand kind of the bookends, we've provided details in the supplement so that you can see both the amount of future leases as they come up for renewal and the dates of those renewals.

You've made the point that there tends to be a lag between when you sign business and when it shows up on your P&L. And I think it's also pretty true with regards to your CapEx, particularly in the small cell business, there can be a pretty big lag between when you're deploying that fiber and when you're actually getting the leasing activity. 
So with this being the sort of second consecutive year where your discretionary CapEx is at a lower run rate predominantly because of what's going on, I believe, predominantly because of what's going on with the node deployment, is this deployment run rate of about 5,000 that you're seeing this year probably what you're going to get next year until we get visibility into CapEx moving higher? So that would be the first question. 
And then the second is why did you decide to go ahead and once again raised dividend by more than the rate of growth in AFFO per share? It certainly seems like you could also consider doing buybacks in years where you think you have a little excess capacity. And I was hoping you can maybe give some insight in terms of how you're thinking about outsized dividend growth versus other forms of capital returns."

On your first question, I think you correctly characterized the nature of the CapEx. As it's coming down, we're putting less nodes on air, small cell nodes on air in 2021, similar level in 2022. So naturally, the amount of CapEx would come dow",731,"Absolutely. On your first question, I think you correctly characterized the nature of the CapEx. As it's coming down, we're putting less nodes on air, small cell nodes on air in 2021, similar level in 2022. So naturally, the amount of CapEx would come down. 
There is CapEx in those numbers related to nodes going into future periods. We've had a lot of bookings in 2021. On the small cell side, we'll be well north of 15,000 of new bookings in calendar year 2021, and we're getting started on building those nodes. While they won't come on until in all likelihood 2023 and beyond, we've already begun work on that. So there is a bit of a lag there. 
In terms of CapEx per node and unit economics, all of that has basically stayed in line with what we've seen historically. So as we get through the soft cost of getting these nodes permitted, et cetera, then we'll have a better sense of when they'll come on air, and then the bulk of the CapEx is incurred in the last few months prior to installation of the nodes. In the earlier months, we incur the CapEx associated with more soft costs around zoning and planning that we go down the process of. 
So I think we would expect to see some uplift in CapEx as we get into 2023. And the total number of nodes that we're deploying moved north of where we're going to see it in this calendar year and in 2022. 
On the dividend question, the reason why we raised it 11% this year is a combination of both the outsized growth that we saw in calendar year 2021 and then where we think the guidance will be for 2022. So our philosophy around the dividend has been basically to hold the payout ratio. Think of that as a percentage of AFFO per share, to hold that payout ratio in that 75% to 80% of AFFO per share and to pay that out in the form of a dividend. 
So in essence, the dividend raise this year is a combination of the outperformance that we've seen in 2021 and raising the dividend to bring it back in line associated with that outperformance in the calendar year and then what we think the performance will be in 2022 in the operating business. So that's our goal and how we think about sizing it is just looking at AFFO per share for the next year and then sizing the dividend appropriately for that. 
With regards to the last part of your question around how do we think about share purchases, we're coming right in line here based on the growth with where we'll be at our targeted amount of leverage of about 5x debt to EBITDA. And we certainly, as we have done historically, want to put the capital to work at its highest and best use. And highest and best use to us is a risk-adjusted return based on what we think the long-term dividend per share will be. 
And recently, most recently, the answer to that question has been answered largely by what we believe the benefit of small cells will be to the business long term of growing that dividend over the long term and maximizing the dividend per share. To the extent that as we move to a place where we're at our targeted level of leverage, and we're creating additional leverage capacity and investment capacity, we'll continue to do that same analysis and rigorously look at what we think maximizes the return and uses up the capital that we have available to us. 
Historically, we've done a lot of share purchases with that excess capital and leverage capacity, and that's absolutely what we test the returns against. So we'll have to see as we get into the future years around what's the opportunity around small cells. Is there an opportunity to invest there that meets that hurdle of highest and best use for the capital, and test that always against the opportunity to buy back shares. 
So you should certainly expect at points in time in the future that we will be buyers of our shares because that will be the highest and best use. And we'll use some of the capacity that we have to go into the market and buy back our shares."

On your first question around the activity by carrier, I don't want to speak to kind of the specific deployment plans of our customers. As I mentioned in the question, I think, that Mike asked, the activity across all of the carriers is elevated. 
We're going to see -- we think we'll see in 2022 about a 20% increased activity as compared to 2021. And that's really coming across the board. So we're seeing elevated levels of activity from all of the carriers. 
With regards to whether the year is back-end loaded, we're going into this year with a lot of activity that currently underway. And given the nature of the business where we signed a lot of leases in the current year and the next year, we get the benefit of having all 12 months of leasing in that year. We're going up the ramp as we go through 2021. 
So I think you'll see a similar ramping as we go through calendar year 2022, but maybe not quite as back-end loaded as what we've seen in past years because a lot of that uplift in actual activity applications that will drive that leasing activity that we're going to see in terms of the numbers that Dan was walking through earlier and impact the income statement. A lot of that actual application and leasing activity is actually occurring in this calendar year in 2021. 
So we've either got signed leases or we have a lot of visibility to it, which would indicate that it's not a back-end loaded here. We're not counting on a big uplift in the second half of next year."

Certainly, as we talked about big picture the number of nodes, we talked about this some last quarter. The reason why we lowered the number of nodes that we're going to put on air in '21 and '22 was the decision that the carriers made around where to put their CapEx dollars on equipment. And they focused those dollars towards macro sites and pushed to the right the delivery timing on small cells. And so we're reflecting that in our outlook. 
In terms of nodes committed, there's no change in the number of nodes. So all it did was slide those nodes into years '23 and '24. And so we've got some work that we've gotten done that are ready to install those nodes once equipment is delivered, and we'll see the benefit of that in '23 and '24.

Are there any other items that are worth flagging that we should be mindful of going 3Q to 4Q that would take AFFO down to effectively get you to that midpoint for 2021? 
And then secondly, just as a follow-up to the question that was just asked, is it fair to assume that you would anticipate seeing leasing of around 15,000 small cells again this year and really what we need to be sensitive to is really just how that rolls in?

In terms of what we're going to put on air, meaning go through the operational process of building them and turning them up, we think we'll do about 5,000 this year, calendar year 2021 and turn another 5,000 on in calendar year 2022. Those will be that we put on air. 
In terms of bookings, which would refer to a node that a carrier makes a commitment to us, they sign a contract, commit to a node, and then we'll build it in future periods. Our bookings in calendar year 2021 will be well in excess of 15,000 nodes that we do in terms of bookings this calendar year. And those will come on in future years. 
As we get into calendar year 2022, we'll give you an update on where we think bookings will be at that point. But for calendar year '21, we think the number will be well in excess of 15,000, which is by far the highest bookings year we've ever had in our history on the small cell side. 
And I think it's interesting. I think it just points to the conversation I was having a few minutes ago around the landscape that we have with the carriers. This is a healthy environment with the carriers as we've ever seen, long-term commitments on the capital side, committed amounts by each of the legacy carriers and the build-out of a brand-new network. 
And at the moment, the mix that they have is heavily weighted towards macro sites. But I think over time, as we have seen in the past, I think there will be some shift of that mix of total capital spend where a portion of it will go towards small cells, and there will be less focus on macro sites. 
I think you can see that in the commitments that the carriers are making to us by over 15,000 small cell bookings this year that they're thinking about in future periods. That's going to take a significant chunk of their CapEx in those future years that we would think would move away from macro sites and towards small cells. 
And it may look more like what it did 2 or 3 years ago when we saw a real slowdown on the macro site side, and we're benefiting from an allocation of that capital towards small cells. So I think that's the benefit that we have in terms of our strategy of providing wireless networks to the carriers, and we'll benefit if they're focused on small cells or we'll benefit if they're focused on macro sites. And over time, both are just critically important to the way networks are going to be developed."

I do think based on zooming out a little bit and thinking about this from a bigger picture standpoint, the second part of your question there, I would affirm that as we get further into this year and into next year, we would expect there to be more bookings. The carriers are focused at the moment on macro sites and building those out, but they're -- we're also having significant conversations with them about the requirements that they're going to have around cell site density. And we think that will drive a lot of activity towards small cells. 
So in periods beyond 2023 and beyond, I think we will see an uplift to the total of number of nodes that both we have in bookings and then ultimately that we're putting on air as a need that they have in the network once they've done this initial overlay of putting it all on macro sites."

So Dave, I'll take that first question around our core leasing on the towers, how much is MLAs. When we look out into future periods like 2022, we obviously take into account the agreements we have with our customers. And as I think you're implying in the question, we have those with several of our customers at this point. 
But even within those agreements, we have upside. They're not necessarily capped. And therefore, what we try to do is come up with an estimate of what we think the activity will be from each of our customers based off of what we know today have already been signed, what we have a really good line of sight into going into next year and then what we think will happen in next year. 
And when we come up with that -- when we came up with the $155 million to $165 million. That's our best guess at what we think that activity will look like and how it will be monetized within our agreements. But I would say that there's always going to be some ability for that to be better or worse than what we expect if the activity is going to be better or worse than what we expect. 
And as Jay has mentioned a few times, we're really excited about the level of activity going into next year. That $155 million to $165 million is an increase over a really good 2021. So we're excited. We feel good about what that activity level looks like. And we'll see how it plays out in terms of when our customers come to us and want to put more equipment on towers."

And then on the small cell front, as we think about the potential timing for installing what you have in the backlog over the next few years, do all those nodes have firm dates by which the carriers need to start paying you for them?

We think that the fiber solutions business is going to operate at around a 3% annual growth rate. And that's what we're seeing in calendar year '21. I think we'll see a similar level in '22. 
There was some impact during COVID, particularly in the early months of 2021 and late 2020 associated with offices being closed. But honestly, our business was -- because of the nature of large enterprises, universities and government, which make up the bulk of the fiber solutions revenue that we do, we were not impacted nearly to the extent that fiber companies who are more focused on small and medium enterprises saw an impact. 
So we didn't see a falloff as many of them did. And then conversely, as the economy started to open back up, we just did not see as much of an uplift. So I would say, similar business environment to what we've seen the last couple of years, maybe a little bit better. But I think the growth is basically in line with what we've seen of about 3%. 
Churn is down. We think it will be down. This is an area that I know our team has focused really hard on. A part of it is making sure that we're being thoughtful about the kind of customers that we pursue on the front end. And then also, as we manage the relationship as we get close to a contract renewal, being thoughtful about how we handle those contract renewals. 
And I think the team has done a really nice job, and we've seen some benefit from some of their work. And we think we'll see more of that in '22 as we go through the process of managing the renewals in the end of term on some of those contracts. 
On your second question around small cell nodes and firm dates, we talked a little bit, I think, Nick, about this on the last quarterly call. We made a -- and it should be viewed this way, we made an affirmative choice to work with our customers on pushing out these nodes into future periods. 
Our contractual rights, I think, would have given us the ability to really push to turn these nodes to the point where we could have handed them over and charge rent to the carriers. But we made the affirmative decision -- given the volume that was coming our way and the reallocation of the dollars from the small cells to the macro sites, we made the affirmative decision to work with them and give them an ability to push out those dates. 
So there may be circumstances that arise in the future where we would not be willing to do that. But this was an affirmative decision that we made based on managing the customer relationship and maximizing what we thought was the return. 
The volume, as I said before, the volume and the revenues and cash flows all end up at the same place. But if we could maximize early some of the macro site revenues and work with the customers to give them an extension on when we turn the small cells on, we thought that made good business sense, and that's why we did it. But contractually, we would have a right to do something a little different."

CBRS is helping. Cable is helping. There's broadcast that is helping. There are a number of areas that we're seeing leasing demand for macro sites. And we think that will continue into the future. 
I wouldn't call it out as a material impact to our 2021 or 2022 leasing results. But at the margin, it does help and does drive the incremental growth that we're talking about in site rental revenues. I think given the amount of spectrum that there is outside of the hands of the carriers and the capital that is in some of those sectors in order to deploy wireless network, I think on the longer-term model, if you take a 5- or a 10-year view, I think there is some meaningful leasing activity that's going to happen outside of what you think of as the legacy or traditional wireless carriers that will benefit macro and small -- macro sites as well as small cells over time. And as we start to see that, we'll give you more details around what those impacts are going to be. 
On your second question around supply chain constraints, obviously, I think the whole world is feeling the impacts of that, and much has been written about it. We've worked really closely with our customers on when they expect to receive equipment and the timing of that and then trying to make sure we line up sites to be ready for them based on when the equipment is received. 
I think they've done a nice job of working with their supply chains and having equipment available to get 5G networks launched in the time frame that they expected. So it's a coordination activity, certainly a communication activity that our teams are having with their team. And thus far, that dialogue has proven to be a predictable indicator of when actual activity does happen on our sites. So we're watching it, paying attention to it, but feel pretty good about the fact that our outlook does assume the environment of constraints that are out there and our leasing expectations are a function of the coordination and communication we're having with our carriers on when equipment will be available."

I think some of it you can see in just their activity with us. The commitment that they made of 15,000 small cell nodes is an indication that they're thinking about it in the near-term planning horizon of what's going to be required in their network as they're going through the process of working on macro sites and then working on -- and then starting to infill and densify the network. 
And this is a pattern that's followed -- we saw this occur with 3G. We saw it occur with 4G, where -- and now we're seeing it with 5G, where the first step of deployment in the network is the carriers go and touch all of the assets that they're already on and upgrade those sites to the new technology. And then once they get that overlay done, then they come back, and they really focus heavily on densification. 
So when we look at the way the networks are performing, both on terms of the sites that have already been upgraded and the usage -- the data usage on those sites, from a technical standpoint, the capacity starts to get reached. And therefore, they've got to the term that's been historically used, they've got a cell split. They've got to reuse that spectrum over more sites. 
And the dynamic that we've seen in the market, and I think this is reflective of the nodes that we're booking now, there's not other macro sites that they can use to self split that spectrum. They're already on those macro sites. And so they've got to figure out a way to densify the network and reuse the spectrum in places that are not sort of the traditional macro sites. 
And we think that's where we get the real benefit on the small cell side. I think as we get into calendar years '23 and beyond, I think we'll really see that movement, probably similar to what we saw at 4G. Like we got to the point where in 4G, we had added 4G to all of the towers, and then we saw significant activity on the small cell side as they upgraded sites to improve the network and densified 4G using small cells. We think we'll see a similar thing on the 5G side to an even greater extent given the types of spectrum bands that are being used and the amount of increase in data traffic is just going to require more than macro sites can deliver.

As you saw from our results yesterday, we remain on track to generate an anticipated 12% growth in AFFO per share this year. We expect to be at the high end of our long-term growth target in 2022, with 8% AFFO per share growth being driven in large part by our expectation that tower core leasing activity will be approximately 50% higher in 2022 than our trailing 5-year average.  
And we increased our annualized common stock dividend by approximately 11% to $5.88 per share, marking the second consecutive year of dividend growth that meaningfully exceeds our long-term target. Given that our dividend payout ratio has remained largely unchanged since 2014, our dividend remains the best indicator of how we are performing, both financially and operationally.  
Our significant outperformance in 2021 combined with our forecast for 2022 enabled us to raise our dividend 11%, well above our stated goal for the second year in a row. In essence, we've achieved 3 years of targeted dividend growth in just 2 years. Since we established our common stock dividend in 2014, we have grown dividends per share at a compounded annual growth rate of 9%, with growth ranging from 7% to 11% in each year.  
Before adding a little more detail to my summary points from the earnings release, I wanted to comment on the other press release we issued yesterday, where we announced our goal to be carbon neutral by 2025. We aim to provide profitable solutions to connect communities and people, and our carbon neutral goal builds on our commitments to deploy our strategy sustainably.  
Our business model is inherently sustainable as shared solutions limit infrastructure in the communities in which we operate and minimize the use of natural resources. Further to the point, our core value proposition, since we began operating more than 25 years ago, has centered around our ability to provide our customers with access to mission-critical infrastructure at a lower cost because we can share that infrastructure across multiple operators.  
In addition, our solutions help address societal challenges, like the digital divide, in underserved communities by advancing access to education and technology. To date, we have invested nearly $10 billion in towers, small cells and fiber assets located in low-income areas.  
As a way of quantifying how our business model minimizes the use of natural resources, our business emits just 1 ton of CO2 per $1 billion of enterprise value, which is 90x more efficient than the average company in the S&P 500 based on industry estimates. Although we are proud of our limited environmental impact, we are focused on making even more strides by reducing our energy consumption and sourcing renewable energy to help us achieve our goal of carbon neutrality by 2025. We are excited about this announcement and look forward to continuing to find ways to help our communities and planet while driving significant returns to our shareholders.  
Turning back to our 2022 outlook. We are benefiting from record levels of activity in our tower business with our customers upgrading thousands of existing cell sites as a part of their first phase of 5G build-out. Adding to the opportunity, we are seeing the highest level of tower co-location activity in our history with DISH building a nationwide 5G network from scratch.  
I believe our strategy and unmatched portfolio of more than 40,000 towers and approximately 80,000 route miles of fiber concentrated in the top U.S. markets have positioned Crown Castle to capitalize both on the current environment and to grow our cash flows and dividends per share in the near term and for years to come. 
We are focused on generating this growth while delivering the highest risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders by investing in shared infrastructure assets that lowered the implementation and operating costs for our customers while generating solid returns for our shareholders.  
To execute on this strategy, we are providing our customers with access to our 40,000 towers and 80,000 route miles of fiber to help them build out their 5G wireless networks. We are investing in new small cell and fiber assets that meet our disciplined and rigorous underwriting standards to expand our long-term addressable market. And we are identifying where wireless networks are going and investing early to position the company to capitalize on future opportunities as we have done with small cells, edge computing and CBRS.  
One of the core principles underpinning our strategy is to focus on the U.S. market because we believe it represents the best market in the world for wireless infrastructure ownership since it has the most attractive growth profile and the lowest risk. And we believe this dynamic of higher growth and lower risk will continue into the future, which is why we expect our U.S.-based strategy will drive significant returns for shareholders.  
With that in mind, we have invested nearly $40 billion in towers, small cells and fiber assets in the top markets that are all foundational for the development of future 5G networks. We believe our unique strategy, portfolio of infrastructure assets and proactive identification of future opportunities provide a platform for sustained long-term dividend growth as wireless network architecture evolves and our customers' priority shift over time.  
Today, our customers are primarily focusing their investment on macro sites as towers remain the most cost-effective way to deploy spectrum at scale and establish broad network coverage. With our high-quality towers concentrated in the top markets, we are clearly benefiting from this focus with an expected 6% organic growth for our tower segment in 2021 and an expected 20% increase in tower core leasing activity next year when compared to these 2021 levels.  
With history as a guide, we believe the deployment of additional spectrum on existing cell sites will not be enough to keep pace with the persistent 30%-plus annual growth in mobile data traffic. As a result, we expect cell site densification to remain a critical tool for carriers to respond to the continued growth in mobile data demand as it enables our customers to get the most out of their spectrum assets by reusing the spectrum over shorter and shorter distances.  
When the current cell site upgrade phase shifts the densification phase, we believe the comprehensive offering of towers, small cells and fiber will be critical for our customers and provide us with an opportunity to further extend the runway of growth in our business. While we expect the densification phase of build-out will drive additional leasing on our tower assets for years to come, we believe small cells will play an even greater role as the coverage area of cell sites will continue to shrink due to the density of people, and therefore, the density of wireless data demand.  
With more than 80,000 small cells on air are committed in our backlog, high-capacity fiber assets in the vast majority of the top 30 markets in the U.S. and industry-leading capabilities, we believe we are well positioned to deliver value to our customers as their priorities evolve, driving meaningful growth in our small cell business. 
Bigger picture, when I consider the durability of the underlying demand trends we see in the U.S. how well we are positioned to consistently deliver growth through all phases of the 5G build-out with significant potential upside in our comprehensive asset base as wireless networks continue to evolve. Our proven ability to proactively identify where wireless network architecture is heading and to be an early investor in solutions to help future networks, the deliberate decisions we have made to reduce risks associated with our strategy and our history of steady execution. I believe that Crown Castle stands out as a unique investment that will generate compelling returns over time.  
In the near term, as I mentioned before, we expect to deliver outsized AFFO per share growth of 12% in 2021. We expect to generate 8% growth in AFFO per share in 2022 at the high end of our long-term growth target and supported by an expected 20% increase in tower core leasing activity. And we increased our common stock dividend by 11% for the second consecutive year.  
Longer term, we believe Crown Castle provides an exciting opportunity for shareholders to invest in the development of 5G in the U.S., which we believe is the best market for communications infrastructure ownership. Importantly, we provide access to such attractive industry dynamics while providing a compelling total return opportunity, comprised of a high-quality dividend that currently yields 3.5% with expected growth in net dividend of 7% to 8% annually.  
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dan."

Good morning, everyone. As Jay discussed, we delivered another great quarter of results in the third quarter. We remain on track to grow AFFO per share by an anticipated 12% this year.

We remain on track to grow AFFO per share by an anticipated 12% this year. We expect to be at the high end of our growth target in 2022 with 8% AFFO per share growth. And we increased our quarterly common stock dividend by 11% for the second consecutive year, meaningfully above our long-term target growth rate while maintaining a consistent payout ratio.  
We are excited about the outsized growth we are experiencing in the early stages of 5G. And we continue to believe our portfolio of towers, small cells and fiber provides unmatched exposure to what we believe will be a decade-long build-out by our customers.  
Turning to Slide 4 of the presentation. Our third quarter results were highlighted by 8% growth in site rental revenues, 11% growth in adjusted EBITDA and 13% growth in AFFO per share when compared to the same period last year. Record tower activity level supported this strong growth, generating organic tower growth of 6.3% and higher services contribution when compared to the same period in 2020.  
Looking at our full year outlook for 2021 and 2022 on Slide 5. We are maintaining our 2021 outlook with site rental revenues, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO growing 7%, 11% and 14%, respectively. For full year 2022, we expect continuing investments in 5G to drive another very good year for us with 5% site rental revenue growth, 6% growth in adjusted EBITDA and 8% AFFO growth.  
Turning now to Slide 6. The full year 2022 outlook includes an expected organic contribution to site rental revenues of $245 million to $285 million or 5%, consisting of approximately 5.5% growth from towers, 5% growth from small cells and 3% growth from fiber solutions.  
As you likely saw in our press release, when we refer to new leasing activity, we include the change in amortization of prepaid rent, consistent with how we have discussed activity in the past. To address feedback we've received to provide more detail around our expectations for future -- for leasing activity, we have introduced a new concept of core leasing activity, which excludes the impact of changes in prepaid rent amortization.  
Core leasing activity is more indicative of current period activity, whereas changes in prepaid rent amortization also include activity from prior periods as prepaid rent received in those prior periods eventually amortizes to 0 over the life of the associated contract. Although we have consistently provided disclosure on prepaid rent amortization by segment in our supplemental earnings materials, we hope this new presentation format provides a cleaner way for investors to analyze our performance.  
With that definition in mind, we expect 2022 core leasing activity of $340 million at the midpoint or $350 million inclusive of the year-over-year change in prepaid rent amortization. The 2022 expected core leasing activity includes $160 million in towers, representing a 20% increase when compared to our 2021 outlook and an approximately 50% increase when compared to our 5-year trailing average; $30 million in small cells compared to $45 million in 2021; and a $150 million in fiber solutions compared to $165 million expected this year.  
Turning to Slide 7. You can see we expect approximately 90% of the organic site rental revenue growth to flow through to AFFO growth, highlighting the strong operating leverage in our business. As we discussed in July, we expect to deploy an additional 5,000 small cells in 2022, which is the same number we expect to build in 2021.  
We expect discretionary CapEx to be approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion in 2022, including approximately $300 million for towers and $800 million to $900 million for fiber, similar to what we expect in 2021. This translates to $700 million to $800 million of net CapEx when factoring in the $400 million of prepaid rent contribution we expect to receive in 2022.  
The full year 2022 outlook for CapEx represents an expected 30% reduction in discretionary CapEx for our fiber segment relative to full year 2022 when we deployed approximately 10,000 small cells. Based on the expected growth in cash flows for full year 2022 and consistent with our investment-grade credit profile, we expect to fund our discretionary CapEx with free cash flow and incremental debt capacity without the need for new equity for the fourth consecutive year.  
In addition, we believe our business and balance sheet are well positioned to support consistent AFFO growth through various economic cycles, including during periods of higher inflation and interest rates. Our cost structure is largely fixed in nature, as you can see, with nearly 90% of the full year 2022 expected organic site rental revenue growth to flow through to AFFO growth as I referenced earlier.  
And we have taken steps to further strengthen our investment-grade balance sheet that now has more than 90% fixed rate debt, a weighted average maturity of more than 9 years and a weighted average interest rate of 3.1%.  
In conclusion, we are excited about the outsized growth we are generating as a result of the initial 5G build-out by our customers, which is translating into back-to-back years of 11% growth in our quarterly common stock dividend. This dividend currently equates to an approximate 3.5% yield, which we believe is a compelling valuation given our expectation of growing the dividend 7% to 8% per year, combined with our high-quality, predictable and stable cash flows.  
Looking further out, we believe our unique ability to offer towers, small cells and fiber solutions, which are all integral components of communications networks, provides significant optionality to capitalize on the long-term positive industry trends of network improvement and densification and gives us the best opportunity to consistently deliver growth as wireless network architecture continues to evolve and our customers' priorities shift over time.  
With that, April, I'd like to open the call to questions."

I'll take the big picture question, and Dan can walk through how it flow into the income statement. One of the things that we made the comment, I made the comment in the prepared remarks and was also in the press release. The amount of leasing activity we're seeing in the business is just unprecedented, 50% above our historical 5-year average in terms of core activity is just remarkable. A business that rarely has inflection points, to see that kind of uplift in activity is just really unique.  
And it's been 20 years since we've seen this kind of level of activity. And I think largely that is occurring because of the backdrop that we have with the wireless carriers. Among Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile, all 3 of them are at a place where they're deploying network at scale, both new sites as well as upgrading existing sites to 5G. So that's a very healthy dynamic to have all of the existing carriers spending at a pretty healthy rate.  
And just as an aside, I would say it's also really encouraging to us based on the commentary that they've made and the CapEx dollars that they've allocated towards this, this is going to be a multiyear activity. It's not as though the activity is just sort of going to wind down in calendar year '22. So we feel like the backdrop for those 3 carriers is really good and likely to stay for an extended period of time.  
And then on top of that, as you referenced with DISH on top of the 3 carriers, the legacy carriers deploying 5G, we also have this new entrant who is deploying a network from scratch. And that activity is beginning in earnest in 2022. So obviously, we signed the agreement with them last year. They made a large commitment to us for 20,000 sites. And it's been impressive to watch as they've stood up that organization and gotten themselves in a place where they can deploy network at scale and at speed.  
And so I know our team, employees listening to this call this morning, a lot of them are very, very busy standing up this new nationwide network for DISH. And so that is causing some of the other revenues in the mix to tick up a little bit.  
I would also point out, in addition to kind of the -- what you would think of as traditional wireless carriers, there are also a number of new business models that any one of them are not having a meaningful uplift on tower leasing activity. But as a combined group of others, there are lots of businesses that are trying to figure out ways to deploy wireless network, and they're using spectrum bands outside of the spectrum bands that are owned by the wireless carriers. And that's contributing to our revenue growth, and we think that will continue over time."

Mike, I'll try to address the other part of your question, which is the activity levels versus what flows through into the income statement going into 2022.  
As you pointed out, there's always a bit of a lag time between activity and when we can see the revenue. We don't start recognizing revenue until a lease has begun, and that means that the site is up and running and able to produce -- and able to deploy the spectrum.  
And what that can do at times is delink for a period of time activity from when we see the improvement in our income statement. But what I'll say is that when we look at 2022, we're really excited by how that's going because as Jay had mentioned, the increase in activity is flowing through both in 2021, which has a 30% increase in core leasing tower activity over 2020 and then again, in 2022, where we're increasing again by 20%.  
And as Jay mentioned, those are huge numbers when you're talking about our business. So it is flowing through our income statement even with those delays or delays in -- from activity to when we actually turn on a lease.  
And the last thing I would point out is as we've made this point before, but with -- specifically with DISH, even though we signed a long-term contract with them, we won't recognize revenue until we have a lease, which means we have a site that is capable of deploying spectrum and propagating that spectrum. So there will be time between the activity levels and when that leasing activity hits our income statement as well, but that's reflected in our 2022 outlook."

With respect to the churn in 2022, as you pointed out, it is up a bit. It's -- part of that increase is we expect to be on the low end of our churn in 2021, which is around 1% or around $40 million or so in 2021 in our tower business going to about $60 million or 1.5% in 2022.  
The majority of that incremental $20 million of churn is related to Sprint sites. And it would be consistent with what our disclosure has been in our supplemental earnings materials over time of what those sites look like and what could be at risk for 2022.  
So we do think that's going to happen, which is why we have it in the outlook. I wouldn't say it's conservative or aggressive. It's just our belief of how that's going to play out. And with respect to the rest of the churn, you can see that we are going to have churn on our fiber solutions business is a bit down year-over-year from 2021 to 2022. But we also have a corresponding reduction in new leasing activity on our fiber solutions business. So we think that business will continue to grow around 3%.

I don't have anything to report on this front. Obviously, they've been clear about the need to achieve some synergies in their network as they go through the process of combining with Sprint and rationalizing some sites. We think those are most likely to come on the sites that we refer to as dual residency, meaning sites where both T-Mobile and Sprint are co-located on the same site.  
And we'll work with them as they go through that process of achieving those synergies. At the same time, they need to port the spectrum on to other sites and onto the legacy T-Mobile assets. And so there's a large coordination work with them, both in terms of achieving their synergies and also standing their network up and getting it ready for 5G.  
And so we're actively engaged in that. I think we still have the view that over the long term, the growth opportunities there are going to exceed that of any churn that we'll realize. And then obviously, to help investors understand kind of the bookends, we've provided details in the supplement so that you can see we had both the amount of future leases as they come up for renewal and the dates of those renewals.

And I think it's also pretty true with regards to your CapEx, particularly in the small cell business, there can be a pretty big lag between when you're deploying that fiber and when you're actually getting the leasing activity.  
So with this being the sort of second consecutive year where your discretionary CapEx is at a lower run rate predominantly because of what's going on, I believe, predominantly because of what's going on with the node deployment, is this deployment run rate of about 5,000 that you're seeing this year probably what you're going to get next year until we get visibility into CapEx moving higher? So that would be the first question.  
And then the second is, why did you decide to go ahead and once again raised dividend by more than the rate of growth in AFFO per share? It certainly seems like you could also consider doing buybacks in years where you think you have excess capacity. And I was hoping you can maybe give some insight in terms of how you're thinking about outsized dividend growth versus other forms of capital returns."

On your first question, I think you correctly characterized the nature of the CapEx. As it's coming down, we're putting less nodes on air, small cell nodes on air in 2021, similar level in 2022. So naturally, the amount of CapEx would come dow",728,"Absolutely. On your first question, I think you correctly characterized the nature of the CapEx. As it's coming down, we're putting less nodes on air, small cell nodes on air in 2021, similar level in 2022. So naturally, the amount of CapEx would come down.  
There is CapEx in those numbers related to nodes going into future periods. We've had a lot of bookings in 2021. On the small cell side, we'll be well north of 15,000 of new bookings in calendar year 2021, and we're getting started on building those nodes while they won't come on until in all likelihood 2023 and beyond, we've already begun work on that. So there is a bit of a lag there.  
In terms of CapEx per node and unit economics, all of that has basically stayed in line with what we've seen historically. So as we get through the soft cost of getting these nodes permitted, et cetera, then we'll have a better sense of when they'll come on air, and then the bulk of the CapEx is incurred in the last few months prior to installation of the nodes. In the earlier months, we incur the CapEx associated with more soft costs around zoning and planning that we go down the process of.  
So I think we would expect to see some uplift in CapEx as we get into 2023. And the total number of nodes that we're deploying moved north of where we're going to see it in this calendar year and in 2022.  
On the dividend question, the reason why we raised it 11% this year is a combination of both the outsized growth that we saw in calendar year 2021 and then where we think the guidance will be for 2022. So our philosophy around the dividend has been basically to hold the payout ratio. Think of that as a percentage of AFFO per share, to hold that payout ratio in that 75% to 80% of AFFO per share and to pay that out in the form of a dividend.  
So in essence, the dividend raise this year is a combination of the outperformance that we've seen in 2021 and raising the dividend to bring it back in line associated with that outperformance in the calendar year and then what we think the performance will be in 2022 in the operating business. So that's our goal and how we think about sizing it is just looking at AFFO per share for the next year and then sizing the dividend appropriately for that.  
With regards to the last part of your question around how do we think about share purchases, we're coming right in line here based on the growth with where we'll be at our targeted amount of leverage of about 5x debt-to-EBITDA. And we certainly, as we have done historically, want to put the capital to work at its highest and best use. And highest and best use to us is a risk-adjusted return based on what we think the long-term dividend per share will be.  
And recently -- most recently, the answer to that question has been answered largely by what we believe the benefit of small cells will be to the business long-term of growing that dividend over the long-term and maximizing the dividend per share. To the extent that as we move to a place where we're at our targeted level of leverage, and we're creating additional leverage capacity and investment capacity, we'll continue to do that same analysis and rigorously look at what we think maximizes the return and uses up the capital that we have available to us.  
Historically, we've done a lot of share purchases with that excess capital and leverage capacity, and that's absolutely what we test the returns against. So we'll have to see as we get into the future years around what's the opportunity around small cells. Is there an opportunity to invest there that meets that hurdle of highest and best use for the capital, and test that always against the opportunity to buy back shares.  
So you should certainly expect at points in time in the future that we will be buyers of our shares because that will be the highest and best use. And we'll use some of the capacity that we have to go into the market and buy back our shares."

On your first question around the activity by carrier, I don't want to speak to kind of the specific deployment plans of our customers. As I mentioned in the question, I think, that Mike asked, the activity across all of the carriers is elevated. We're going to see -- we think we'll see in 2022 about a 20% increased activity as compared to 2021. And that's really coming across the board. So we're seeing elevated levels of activity from all of the carriers.  
With regards to whether the year is back-end loaded. We're going into this year with a lot of activity that's currently underway. And given the nature of the business where we signed a lot of leases in the current year and the next year, we get the benefit of having all 12 months of leasing in that year. We're going up the ramp as we go through 2021.  
So I think you'll see a similar ramping as we go through calendar year 2022, but maybe not quite as back-end loaded as what we've seen in past years because a lot of that uplift in actual activity applications that will drive that leasing activity that we're going to see in terms of the numbers that Dan was walking through earlier and impact the income statement. A lot of that actual application and leasing activity is actually occurring in this calendar year in 2021.  
So we've either got signed leases or we have a lot of visibility to it, which would indicate that it's not a back-end loaded here. We're not counting on a big uplift in the second half of next year."

Certainly, as we talked about big picture the number of nodes, we talked about this some last quarter. The reason why we lowered the number of nodes that we're going to put on air in '21 and '22 was the decision that the carriers made around where to put their CapEx dollars on equipment. And they focused those dollars towards macro sites and pushed to the right the delivery timing on small cells. And so we're reflecting that in our outlook.  
In terms of nodes committed, there's no change in the number of nodes. So all it did was slide those nodes into years '23 and '24. And so we've got some work that we've gotten done that are ready to install those nodes once equipment is delivered, and we'll see the benefit of that in '23 and '24.

I appreciate that I think sustaining CapEx will go up. But even if you go to the higher end of your range, which you maintained, it doesn't quite get you, quite frankly, low enough on AFFO to get that number low enough to get to that effectively 8% for next year.

And then secondly, just as a follow-up to the question that was just asked.

In terms of what we're going to put on air, meaning go through the operational process of building them and turning them up, we think we'll do about 5,000 this year, calendar year 2021 and turn another 5,000 on in calendar year 2022. Those will be that we put on air.  
In terms of bookings, which would refer to a node that a carrier makes a commitment to us, they sign a contract, commit to a node, and then we'll build it in future periods. Our bookings in calendar year 2021 will be well in excess of 15,000 nodes that we do in terms of bookings this calendar year. And those will come on in future years.  
As we get into calendar year 2022, we'll give you an update on where we think bookings will be at that point. But for calendar year '21, we think the number will be well in excess of 15,000, which is by far the highest bookings year we've ever had in our history on the small cell side.  
And I think it's interesting. I think it just points to the conversation I was having a few minutes ago around the landscape that we have with the carriers. This is as healthy in environment with the carriers as we've ever seen, long-term commitments on the capital side, committed amounts by each of the legacy carriers and the build-out of a brand-new network.  
And at the moment, the mix that they have is heavily weighted towards macro sites. But I think over time, as we have seen in the past, I think there will be some shift of that mix of total capital spend where a portion of it will go towards small cells, and there will be less focused on macro sites.  
I think you can see that in the commitments that the carriers are making to us by over 15,000 small cell bookings this year that they're thinking about in future periods. That's going to take a significant chunk of their CapEx in those future years that we would think would move away from macro sites and towards small cells.  
And it may look more like what it did 2 or 3 years ago when we saw a real slowdown on the macro site side, and we're benefiting from an allocation of that capital towards small cells. So I think that's the benefit that we have in terms of our strategy of providing wireless networks to the carriers, and we'll benefit if they're focused on small cells or we'll benefit if they're focused on macro sites. And over time, both are just critically important to the way networks are going to be developed."

And we think that will drive a lot of activity towards small cells.

But even within those agreements, we have upside. They're not necessarily capped. And therefore, what we try to do is come up with an estimate of what we think the activity will be from each of our customers based off of what we know today have already been signed, what we have a really good line of sight into going into next year and then what we think will happen in next year.  
And when we come up with that -- when we came up with the $155 million to $165 million, that's our best guess of what we think that activity will look like and how it will be monetized within our agreements. But I would say that there's always going to be some ability for that to be better or worse than what we expect if the activity is going to be better or worse than what we expect.  
And as Jay has mentioned a few times, we're really excited about the level of activity going into next year. That $155 million to $165 million is an increase over a really good 2021.

A part of it is making sure that we're being thoughtful about the kind of customers that we pursue on the front end. And then also, as we manage the relationship as we get close to a contract renewal, being thoughtful about how we handle those contract renewals. And I think the team has done a really nice job, and we've seen some benefit from some of their work. And we think we'll see more of that in '22 as we go through the process of managing the renewals in the end of term on some of those contracts.  
On your second question around small cell nodes and firm dates, we talked a little bit, I think, Nick, about this on the last quarterly call. We made a -- and it should be viewed this way, we made an affirmative choice to work with our customers on pushing out these nodes into future periods.  
Our contractual rights, I think, would have given us the ability to really push to turn these nodes to the point where we could have handed them over and charge rent to the carriers. But we made the affirmative decision -- given the volume that was coming our way and the reallocation of the dollars from the small cells to the macro sites, we made the affirmative decision to work with them and give them an ability to push out those dates.  
So there may be circumstances that arise in the future where we would not be willing to do that. But this was an affirmative decision that we made based on managing the customer relationship and maximizing what we thought was the return. 
The volume, as I said before, the volume and the revenues and cash flows all end up at the same place. But if we could maximize early some of the macro site revenues and work with the customers to give them an extension on when we turn the small cells on, we thought that made good business sense, and that's why we did it. But contractually, we would have a right to do something a little different."

First, maybe going back to a question that was asked earlier on the call. In terms of new entrants or maybe newer contributors, to what extent are you seeing or maybe anticipating contributions from either new CBRS deployments from cable or via fixed wireless broadband deployments from some newer entrants?  
And then secondly, on the topic of supply chain constraints. I'm just wondering, has that to any extent impacted customer behavior, either to date or have you embedded any more conservatism that some of these constraints may have in terms of customer activity next year?"

CBRS is helping. Cable is helping. There's broadcast that is helping. There are a number of areas that we're seeing leasing demand for macro sites. And we think that will continue into the future.  
I wouldn't call it out as a material impact to our 2021 or 2022 leasing results. But at the margin, it does help and does drive the incremental growth that we're talking about in site rental revenues. I think given the amount of spectrum that there is outside of the hands of the carriers and the capital that is in some of those sectors in order to deploy wireless network, I think on the longer term model, if you take a 5- or a 10-year view, I think there is some meaningful leasing activity that's going to happen outside of what you think of as the legacy or traditional wireless carriers that will benefit macro and small -- macro sites as well as small cells over time. And as we start to see that, we'll give you more details around what those impacts are going to be.  
On your second question around supply chain constraints, obviously, I think the whole world is feeling the impacts of that, and much has been written about it. We've worked really closely with our customers on when they expect to receive equipment and the timing of that and then trying to make sure we line up sites to be ready for them based on when the equipment is received.  
I think they've done a nice job of working with their supply chains and having equipment available to get 5G networks launched in the time frame that they expected. So it's a coordination activity, certainly a communication activity that our teams are having with their team. And thus far, that dialogue has proven to be a predictable indicator of when actual activity does happen on our sites. 
So we're watching it, paying attention to it, but feel pretty good about the fact that our outlook does assume the environment of constraints that are out there and our leasing expectations are a function of the coordination and communication we're having with our carriers on when equipment will be available."

I think some of it you can see in just their activity with us. The commitment that they made of 15,000 small cell nodes is an indication that they're thinking about it in the near-term planning horizon of what's going to be required in their network as they're going through the process of working on macro sites and then working on -- and then starting to infill and densify the network.  
And this is a pattern that's followed. We saw this occur with 3G. We saw it occur with 4G, where -- and now we're seeing it with 5G, where the first step of deployment in the network is the carriers go and touch all of the assets that they're already on and upgrade those sites to the new technology. And then once they get that overlay done, then they come back, and they really focus heavily on densification.  
So when we look at the way the networks are performing, both on terms of the sites that have already been upgraded and the usage -- the data usage on those sites, from a technical standpoint, the capacity starts to get reached. And therefore, they've got to the term that's been historically used, they've got a cell split. They've got to reuse that spectrum over more sites.  
And the dynamic that we've seen in the market, and I think this is reflective of the nodes that we're booking now, there's not other macro sites that they can use to self split that spectrum. They're already on those macro sites. And so they've got to figure out a way to densify the network and reuse the spectrum in places that are not sort of the traditional macro sites.  
And we think that's where we get the real benefit on the small cell side. I think as we get into calendar years '23 and beyond, I think we'll really see that movement, probably similar to what we saw at 4G. Like we got to the point where in 4G, we had added 4G to all of the towers, and then we saw significant activity on the small cell side as they upgraded sites to improve the network and densified 4G using small cells. We think we'll see a similar thing on the 5G side to an even greater extent given the types of spectrum bands that are being used and the amount of increase in data traffic is just going to require more than macro sites can deliver.

Thanks for joining us on the call.
As you saw from our first quarter results and increased full year outlook, our consistent execution is delivering outstanding results as we support our customers' growth initiatives with their deployment of nationwide 5G in the U.S. Following a period of building excitement and anticipation, we have seen a significant increase in activity as our customers have started to upgrade their networks to 5G at scale. We expect this elevated level of activity to result in a year of outsized growth for Crown Castle as we now anticipate 11% growth in AFFO per share for the full year 2021, meaningfully above our long-term annual target of 7% to 8%.
Beyond 2021, I believe our strategy and unmatched portfolio of more than 40,000 towers, approximately 80,000 small cells on air or committed in backlog and 80,000 route miles of fiber concentrated in the top U.S. markets have positioned Crown Castle to generate growth in cash flows and dividends per share for years to come.
Our strategy is to deliver the highest risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders by growing our dividend and investing in assets that will drive future growth. That focus has led us to invest in towers, small cells and fiber assets that are all foundational for the development of 5G networks in the U.S. We believe the series of strategic agreements that we have announced in recent months further highlights the synergistic value our shared infrastructure provides to our customers.
Building on the momentum from our recent 15-year agreement with DISH to support our nationwide 5G build-out and our recent long-term 5G small cell agreement with Verizon to support their network deployment, we are excited to once again expand our strategic relationship with Verizon through a recent long-term tower leasing agreement. We believe this agreement will deliver significant value for both parties as it establishes terms for leasing additional capacity on existing tower sites with a structure that is intended to make it easier to expedite the deployment of C-Band equipment over the next several years. The agreement also resulted in an increase in the average remaining current contracted lease term under our Verizon site leases to approximately 10 years. Dan will discuss the expected financial impact of this agreement later in the call.
Turning back to our focus on generating superior long-term returns, one of our core principles of our strategy is to remain U.S. only, because we believe it represents the best market for wireless infrastructure ownership since it has the most attractive growth profile and the lowest risk. And we believe this dynamic of higher growth and lower risk will continue into the future which is why we expect our U.S.-based strategy to drive significant returns for our shareholders.
Starting with the higher growth we see in the U.S., the demand for our shared infrastructure offering across towers, small cells and fiber is tied to the robust demand for mobile data in the U.S. which continues to increase by more than 30% annually. Because the outlook is so compelling, the U.S. wireless market continues to attract a disproportionate amount of global capital investment. This is likely due in part to the fact that the durability and scale of wireless data growth in the U.S. has repeatedly outperformed expectations.
I remember fielding questions from investors and analysts nearly a decade ago trying to understand why we were not expanding our tower business into less established international markets that offered the promise of outsized growth to compensate for the outsized risk. The core set of assumptions underpinning that line of questioning included a view by many that it was inevitable that U.S. growth rates would slow, leading to a desire to augment that growth by investing in international wireless markets that, hopefully, would develop the same key set of fundamentals over time that has made the U.S. market so successful for decades.
We didn't buy into that argument at the time, and sitting here today, on the doorsteps of 5G, we reached a similar conclusion that the U.S. is still among the highest growth markets for wireless infrastructure. Importantly, in a shared infrastructure business with long-term investment horizons, we have benefited from these superior growth rates while avoiding the risks associated with investment opportunities in less established international wireless market.
These risks can have a meaningful impact on long-term returns, and many have materialized in recent years, including the outsized churn due to less favorable industry dynamics relative to the U.S., sustained foreign currency devaluation that results in revenue churn and disruptive social or governmental environments in less developed countries.
Because we believe the U.S. has both greater potential for growth and lower risk, we are focused on growing cash flows on our 40,000 towers by providing access to existing and new customers that are building 5G wireless network.
We are investing in new small cell and fiber assets that our customers need for their wireless networks which we believe increases our ability to capitalize on the 5G growth trends in the U.S. And we are developing new capabilities and offerings that will leverage our existing assets to drive innovation and we believe will further extend our growth opportunity, such as CBRS and edge computing.
I believe that Crown Castle offers shareholders an unmatched opportunity to benefit from the launch of 5G wireless networks in the U.S. In the near to medium term, we expect to deliver outsized AFFO per share growth of 11% this year as we translate this increasing 5G activity into very attractive bottom line growth.
We expect to once again deliver the highest tower revenue growth rate in the U.S. among our public tower peers in 2021. And our customers are affirming the value we bring with our comprehensive portfolio of shared wireless infrastructure assets by entering into long-term agreements to access those assets.
Longer term, we believe Crown Castle provides an exciting opportunity for shareholders to potentially compound double-digit total returns over a long period of time with a high-quality dividend that currently yields 3%, and that we expect to be able to grow 7% to 8% annually.
When I consider the durability of the underlying demand trends we see in the U.S. that provide significant visibility into the future growth for our business, the deliberate decisions we have made to reduce the risks associated with our strategy and our history of steady execution, I believe that Crown Castle stands out as a unique investment that will generate compelling returns over time.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dan."

Good morning, everyone. As Jay mentioned, we are excited to see our customers beginning to deploy 5G at scale. We have seen a significant increase in activity levels, leading to solid first quarter results that exceeded our expectations and s",801,"Thanks, Jay. Good morning, everyone. As Jay mentioned, we are excited to see our customers beginning to deploy 5G at scale. We have seen a significant increase in activity levels, leading to solid first quarter results that exceeded our expectations and support our increased full year guidance.
Turning to Slide 4 of our earnings presentation. You can see our strong top line results were driven by more than 6% growth and organic contribution to site rental revenue. This growth included more than 9% growth from new leasing activity and contracted escalators, net of approximately 3% from nonrenewals.
We also generated a $23 million increase in contribution from services when compared to the first quarter 2020, culminating in 10% growth in adjusted EBITDA and 20% growth in AFFO per share on a year-over-year basis.
Turning to Slide 5. We increased our full year AFFO guidance by $40 million, reflecting a $25 million increase in expected services contribution as a result of higher-than-expected tower activity levels, and a $30 million reduction to interest expense following our successful recent refinancing activities, partially offset by $15 million of additional labor-related costs associated with the higher activity levels.
Additionally, as Jay discussed, we entered into a long-term tower leasing agreement with Verizon that resulted in increasing the average current lease term of our Verizon tower site leases to approximately 10 years and adding straight-line revenue of approximately $140 million in 2021.
Taking these changes into account, we now expect our adjusted EBITDA to be $150 million higher than our previously provided 2021 outlook. Our expectation for site rental revenue growth has increased to approximately 7%, inclusive of the expected organic contribution to site rental revenues of 6%, which remains unchanged. 
Our expectation for growth -- organic growth across towers, small cells and fiber solutions, also remain consistent, with approximately 6% growth from towers, approximately 15% growth from small cells and approximately 3% growth from fiber solutions.
Focusing on investment activities, during the first quarter, capital expenditures totaled $302 million, including $17 million of sustaining capital expenditures, $49 million of discretionary capital expenditures for our tower segment and $225 million of discretionary capital expenditures for our fiber segment.
Our full year expectation for capital expenditures remains unchanged at approximately $1.5 billion or less than $1 billion after customer cash flow contributions. And we continue to expect to fund our discretionary investments this year with free cash flow and incremental borrowings.
Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the first quarter at approximately 5.5x net debt-to-EBITDA and expect to exit 2021 at our target leverage of approximately 5x based on the anticipated growth and cash flows through the balance of the year.
As Jay discussed, in addition to driving significant dividend growth, a key part of our strategy is to reduce the overall risk profile of the business to further enhance the value created for shareholders over time. Along with focusing on what we believe is the highest-growth and lowest-risk market in the world for wireless infrastructure ownership, we have methodically reduced the risk profile of our balance sheet with the same goal of maximizing long-term shareholder value. With that in mind, we were able to opportunistically access the bond market during the first quarter to refinance upcoming maturities, reduce our debt costs and extend our maturity profile.
Looking back 5 years to when we achieved our initial investment grade credit rating, and inclusive of our recent refinancing transaction, we have increased our debt -- average debt maturity to nearly 10 years from just over 5 years, reduced our average borrowing cost to 3.1% from 3.8%, increased our mix of fixed-rate debt to more than 90% from just under 70% and reduced our reliance on secured debt to just 15% from nearly 50%. With limited upcoming debt maturities in the near term and more than $4 billion of undrawn capacity on our revolving credit facility, we believe the balance sheet is positioned well to support our growth initiatives.
Turning back to the growth side of the value equation and to wrap things up, we are excited about the increasing level of activity we are seeing as our customers begin to deploy 5G at scale. Our customers continue to recognize the differentiated value our comprehensive shared infrastructure offering brings, leading them to sign significant long-term agreements with us.
We expect to once again generate industry-leading U.S. tower revenue growth this year. And we expect to generate 11% growth in AFFO per share in 2021, which provides a very attractive total return opportunity when combined with the current 3% dividend yield. Importantly, we are generating these returns while making strategic investments in new small cell and fiber assets that we believe will add to our long-term growth opportunity.
And with that, Vicki, I'd like to open the call to questions."

We're not surprised by the urgency that our customers are showing in deploying 5G. The level of commitment that they showed during the C-Band auction was really a clear sign that they're going to invest heavily in 5G. And so the activity we're seeing, I think, just flows from that. We're seeing that turn into actions as they're deploying significant amounts of 5G networks. And we're really encouraged by the activity that we're seeing.
When we think about that activity translating towards revenue growth, we obviously saw a big step up towards the end of last year and that's continued into this first quarter.
And as it relates to the services activity, obviously, most of that activity is either in the nature of preconstruction work that we're doing for carriers and then some portion of it carries over to work that we're doing as we actually install them on the site.
So the elevated activity that we saw, the step-up we think sort of continues through the balance of this year and is a direct result of the overall encouraging level of activity that we're seeing from the carriers."

I think it provides significant value and certainty to Verizon as well as to ourselves. And I think the significance of that agreement is obviously evidenced by the impact that it has on our 2021 outlook and the step-up that we put into that outlook last night in the press release.
This really went through the same thought process that we've gone through over the last several years as we've done large transactions with the carriers on the MLA side, and have similar components to it, we're trying to meet the customers' needs, particularly with regards to certainty of price and then lowering or reducing the amount of time that it takes to go through the paper portion of getting them on to our site. So it's designed to facilitate their ability to go back to sites that they're already on and speed up that process of them being able to do upgrades. And obviously, they've been specific about the desire to do that with regards to C-Band.
And then on our side of it, we're trying to make sure that we price the economics of that transaction appropriately. And I think we've seen over multiple of those kinds of transactions with customers, multiple customers and multiple transactions over time, an ability to do that well, to both get the right economics on the site and then provide our customers with the right access and speed to get there.
So we did something similar, it has a lot of components to things that we've done in the past and thought about it in a similar way. We get the 10-year extension on the leases that they're already on which moves the maturity out from about 4 years to about 10 years on those sites. And then over the next several years, gives them an opportunity on those sites that they're already on to upgrade their equipment to handle new spectrum bands and to get that where they want it to be from a 5G standpoint.
We still maintain the upside on new leasing and other activities associated with that. And then once we get past sort of this initial push into 5G, then obviously the opportunity is there for us to see greater growth over time.
So excited about the agreement there and excited about what it means in terms of total activity. And as I said before in the prepared remarks, I think right on the doorsteps of seeing 5G deployments at scale enables us to be able to be responsive to Verizon's desires to get there."

So a little bit of timing changes kind of -- which is naturally going to happen as we go through the construction phase of small cells, it's going to have some quarter-to-quarter movements that may not tie out exactly to the full year outlook.
But as we look at the full year outlook, still think small cell growth year-over-year is in the 15% range, that mid-teens that we've talked about for a long time. We think on the fiber solutions side will be around 3% for the full year. And then towers right there at around 6%, as we previously expected.
So I don't see anything, Matt, in terms of those numbers in the quarter that are indicative of anything happening in the underlying business that I would point to. I think it's just the timing differences quarter-to-quarter. And as we look at the full year, I think that's more indicative of the actual activity, what we're seeing from the carriers and how we expect those businesses to perform.
On the services side and the cadence there, look, we're at a level of elevated activity. So we probably had a better first quarter in terms of services than we would in many years, where we often talk about years being back -- heavily back-end loaded to the second half or even towards the fourth quarter. And we saw a step-up in activity going into the end of last year. And that level of elevated activity just carried right into the first quarter.
So we saw a real nice contribution from services in the first quarter and expect, basically, our full year assumption to be pretty similar to where we were previously with that adjustment for the first quarter."

And then secondly, as it relates to the Verizon MLA, you talked about making it easier to deploy. And I guess one of the bigger questions people are trying to get a sense -- investors are trying to get a sense on, is whether or not the agreement includes just some standardized pricing to make it easier for them to move quicker or whether or not there's actually some type of financial benefit where you allow them to go to x amount of sites over x amount of period, shorter than that 10-year period, to kind of move quickly. And if that's the case, I would assume that there's some type of cash benefit, yet we didn't really see the AFFO change for that in particular.

On the first question around organic tower growth, a couple of things I would put in front of you on that.
One is there's a pretty good lead time or lag time from the time that we see revenue start to turn on, start to get the applications from the customers to when we actually see the revenues start to turn on. That's about 6 to 9 months. So the increased level of activity that we've been talking about for 2021 is something we did see all the way back into the fourth quarter of 2020. We started to see the application step up then, and that informed our increase in the overall activity.
I was sort of curious to this point the other day and just looks back to kind of our organic revenue growth over the last 2017 through 2020. And the organic revenue growth in '21 is in our outlook is a step-up of a little over 25% of that average over those previous 4 years. So it's a meaningful increase in the activity, and we bake that into our outlook when we gave 2021.
So what we're seeing now in terms of that activity is pretty consistent with what we had expected. But it's always good to see it materialized and then not just the expectations as where we were back in the October time frame.
The other thing that I would mention about this is, as we look at this activity, we're encouraged and think that there's the opportunity for it to stay at this level of elevated activity for a period of time.
So I think in the business, oftentimes people start to look for inflection points or points where it's going to be the highest and then expect it to kind of fall off. And our prior experience would tell us that those inflection points are relatively rare, that you see the carrier step up level of activities and hold at a plus or minus a certain amount for a long period of time. So when we look at that activity, really encouraged by what we're seeing and not -- and, frankly, not surprised.
To the broader point on, as we look at revenue growth and activity, the way that we create value for shareholders is by stacking years of good growth one on top of another. And what is happening in the business right now is a tremendous year of growth, of growing that AFFO at 11% year-over-year on a per share basis and just stacking another year of great growth on top of what was a good base. And our goal is to consistently deliver that growth, like we've talked about over the long term, 7% to 8%. And what we're seeing at the top line certainly indicates our ability to achieve that longer-term goal.
On your second question around the Verizon MLA, we try to stay away from getting too specific about the terms of the agreement that we do with our customers. We'll let them speak to how they think about their deployment plans and why they structured certain agreements with us.
But I would tell you that there are components of both parts of your question in the agreement. It certainly does include certainty of pricing for them and if -- depending on levels of activity, then it will drive an answer for us in terms of top line growth over a long period of time. So it does provide pricing with them. And then there's also a component of committed activity that's in it where we have certainty of some revenues associated with activity as they deploy C-Band over the next several years.
So there's components of both of those in the agreement. And as we go forward, we'll see more consolidated, rather than specific to a customer relationship, the contribution of cash revenues beyond what Dan spoke to in terms of the impact of the GAAP financial statements this year and years to come."

(REIT), Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2021",2021-04-22,"Earnings Calls","Crown Castle Inc.","Executives","Yes, Phil, thanks for the questions. On -- around CapEx, we spent some time, I think, over the last couple of quarters talking about our expectation for this year's CapEx, which on a net basis is down about $400 million from the levels that we saw in 2019",720,"Yes, Phil, thanks for the questions. On -- around CapEx, we spent some time, I think, over the last couple of quarters talking about our expectation for this year's CapEx, which on a net basis is down about $400 million from the levels that we saw in 2019. That was largely related to the fiber acquisitions that we made. Those companies had committed to a number of large enterprise and government buildouts that were built specifically for kind of those kind of activities, enterprise and government broadband services. And post those acquisitions, we just haven't signed up those kind of agreements at any kind of scale like those prior companies had done.
And as a result of that and our strategic focus around small cells, the CapEx has come down as we've built out those really long lead-time contracts. Many times, they were 3 to 5 years of build-out and commitment.
So those have basically rolled off. And now as we think about capital spending, it's strategically focused on what we believe is the long-term value driver of the business around small cells and the opportunity to kind of build these networks for carriers as they build 5G networks.
I don't want to get too much into what we think in '22 and beyond. We've given guidance this year that our net CapEx will be a little less than $1 billion. For the longer term, the driver of CapEx will be what are the opportunities mostly around small cells. And those will go through the same rigorous process that we put all of our CapEx processes through, understanding what the return is. 
We look to see a 6% to 7% initial yield on invested capital. And then we want to make sure that we believe there's good opportunity for additional lease-up beyond that, that can drive that yield into the double digits and higher returns on capital over time as we see more lease-up. 
So in the future, we'll just have to evaluate what the opportunities are, and then we'll give you an update on CapEx as we get later in the year. In October, we would plan to give our 2022 outlook as we typically do. 
With regards to DISH, I'll probably beg off most of that and let DISH and Amazon speak to how their agreements between the 2 of them are going to drive activity. But obviously, DISH has made a significant commitment to us recently in terms of the deployment of their network, and our operating team is incredibly busy and focused on delivering for them based on their expectations. The team has done a great job out of the gate and I believe delivering for them what they had hoped. And we're ready to support DISH in any way possible as they work on building out their 5G network.
Your last question around edge computing. We think, today, a lot of this -- a lot of the edge computing activity is around traffic management and potentially reducing costs. But as wireless networks move into 5G, I think the opportunity is going to expand well beyond that to really delivering solutions to customers and increasing the applications as innovation occurs. And we think tower sites are uniquely positioned to be able to provide the real estate, the connectivity as well as power that enables edge computing. So it's a foundation of long-term innovation and our [ combination with fiber, ] I think really uniquely position us to be able to capture that. 
I know we've highlighted that component of both fiber and towers in the DISH agreement. It was something that was really important to them as they designed and decided to anchor their network around our sites. And I think it's another example of kind of the combination of our assets sets us up for opportunities for growth that are frankly beyond what we put into our forecast.
When we talk about being able to grow the dividend 7% to 8% over a long period of time, things like edge computing and CBRS are really not in our forecast. So we view that as unmodeled upside and opportunity and believe the type of assets we've acquired and where those assets are located really gives us the optionality to benefit from that over the long term."

And then on the small cells, it does seem, as I think you alluded to in the script and elsewhere, that you have some structural advantages as we get to the infill and densification part of C-Band and other mid-band frequencies. I just wondered if you're starting to see that in the pipeline yet. I realize the revenues might be a little ways off, but are there active discussions at this point? Or is that more on the come?
And then finally, one of the C-Band licensees talked earlier this morning about supply chain constraints that they're seeing. On the other hand, another one put out a press release talking about how second quarter they're already kind of starting to deploy C-Band. And as you kind of consider all those data points around what the carriers are saying, I wondered how that affects your expectation around second half and what type of ramp you might see."

And as we'",477,"On your second question around small cells, we believe that we do have a structural advantage around the assets that we've acquired, as Dan mentioned in his earlier comments. We were intentional about acquiring highcapacity dense, urban, fiber. And as we've seen kind of in the later stages of 4G and now as we enter into 5G, there is a disproportionate amount of traffic in dense urban and suburban areas in the United States. And in order to solve that increased traffic, small cells are absolutely necessary.
They're a critical component of their network. And I think the locations that we've acquired fiber in and where we've built fiber and then where we started to build small cells sets us up really nicely as we get into 5G and we start to see network densification. And that fiber that we have existing, I think we'll see additional co-location on, driving up the yields and the returns of those assets.
And as has happened in prior cycles of going from 2 to 2.5G and then to 3G and then to 4G and now into 5G, we would expect there will be innovation that will further drive demand, wireless traffic demand. And that increased traffic, again, [indiscernible] to kind of the benefit of those assets. 
So we think we've got great assets in the right location and think that we're going to see a really strong tailwind in the business over a long period of time.
And you're right to point out the impact directly to site rental revenues is not going to happen overnight. It will happen over time. But the conversations and the discussions that we're having with carriers and the activity, and I would point to the Verizon commitment of 15,000 small cells that we talked about in the last quarter, those are all early indications that these assets are of the critical nature necessary to deploy wireless carrier networks, and we're really excited about where we're positioned.
On your last question around C-Band spectrum and constraints and supply chain, et cetera, we haven't seen anything at this point that would suggest to us that the numbers that we have out there are not going to be achievable. If we start to see something, obviously, we'll update you on our expectations.
But normally in the business, sort of the quarter-to-quarter changes and timing are not that impactful to our overall results, as I spoke to earlier, in terms of the lead time and the commitment of revenues. We have a pretty long lead time.
So we have a lot of visibility into what we'll do in 2021 and feel good about where the forecast is. And if that changes, we'll update you. But I think the supply chains will resolve themselves over time, and don't expect that to have an impact in terms of our growth."

So we did -- thanks for mentioning the disclosure. We did add some additional disclosure to the supplement. We have gotten some questions, we thought it would be helpful to give you a little more granularity.
It's not intended to be a forecast. So that's -- what's in the supplement is not our forecast of actual churn, but just the actual numbers so you can separate locations where the legacy Sprint and T-Mobile were on the same sites and sites where legacy Sprint was stand-alone on the site and not co-located with T-Mobile.
We're always open to considering a new structure or an agreement with a customer, but there's not any need per se to do that. We were intentional a number of years ago about extending the terms. So if you look back in that disclosure, we've got a lot of term remaining on those leases. And it's provided a lot of -- which was the goal when we did it, of extending those Sprint leases, we were trying to make sure that we had a lot of flexibility through the -- if there was consolidation. So pleased about where we are there. 
And I would look at what we've been historically. We're always open to, as I mentioned earlier, of working with the carriers to help them facilitate what they need. And whether that's achieving synergies or increasing speed of deployment of network, we're happy to work with carriers on that basis and, at the same time, making sure we maintain and protect the economics of both the agreements that we have in place as well as the economics of the site and driving the right return on the asset.
So we'll hold that in balance as we usually do and make sure we do the right thing for both shareholders and for our customers.
I would just point out this, which I think is helpful as we think about entering 2023 and beyond, the next big date of 2028, where we have some exposure to leases potentially being terminated from the T-Mobile acquisition. In past carrier consolidation, we've been able to grow AFFO and dividend right through those periods of time. And the other reality is that consolidations have actually led to increased spending.
So we've had this view for a long period of time that, ultimately, the combination of T-Mobile and Sprint will be a good thing for the tower industry and, net-net, will end up with more activity and more leasing than we would have otherwise. And so I certainly expect that at some point in time, we'll see some -- the benefit to T-Mobile of some synergies of taking down some sites.
But I think the overall investment and activity that they will do in -- with regards to 5G will far exceed the deducts that we may see from synergies that they try to achieve in taking down some sites. 
So net-net, back to the earlier comments, feel really good about the activity we're going to see in 5G. And we'll work through the consolidation when the time comes several years from now."

So I think our view would be, over a longer period of time, that, that activity will increase beyond those levels. But in the near term, I think that, that's a pretty good gauge.
The carriers and the activity and the discussions and their public comments around the necessity of small cells I think really sets the environment for the opportunity for us to capture a larger portion of it.

We don't see the 18 to 36 months changing all that much. But if we got a lot more bookings, we could put a lot more on air than just 10,000 in a year.
So 10,000 is a good point to look at for the next few years just because -- or next couple of years because of where we are with the bookings that we've had recently.
But as Jay pointed out, there's nothing that would stop us with greater bookings to speed up that deployment, and we would anticipate that to be the case as the necessity of small cells continues to get clearer for the deployment of 5G and networks overall."

So I think there's an opportunity to expand the density of the network for the wireless carriers into buildings to reach places that are very difficult to do from the outside. So I think there's opportunities there.
I think there's also going to be some opportunities in the macro environment in certain settings where CBRS may be used by a content provider or others who want access to spectrum. So being able to use some of the unlicensed spectrum components of CBRS is an opportunity to do that in more macro environment.
I think there are probably also some opportunities around campus-specific activities, whether that's universities or other locations where someone controls a large portion of land and has a discrete user use for CBRS that could be interesting as a share provider.
So I think there are a number of opportunities. And it's not in guidance yet because it's not large enough to beyond -- to be beyond a rounding here. But I certainly think, over time, as we see 5G develop, the need for this to be -- for wireless opportunities to be ubiquitous, I think will drive uses for CBRS.
And I think the other component of it is, obviously, everyone is trying to figure out how to get more spectrum into the hands of the wireless operators, and CBRS is another way to do that. And I think that spectrum will be utilized over time. And I think we stand to benefit from that as that spectrum is deployed."

Nick, this has been a focus of ours for about 15, 18 years, something like that, where we've been specifically focused on extending the maturity of our ground leases. When we started that activity, I think we were in the neighborhood of about 17 or 18 years of remaining term on average. And we had in the neighborhood of about 20% or a little less than 20% of the land that was owned. And we've increased -- over the last 15 to 18 years, we've increased the percentage of land owned to about 1/3, a little over 1/3 of our overall ground leases. And in addition to that, we've taken the average maturity to longer than 30 years.
So there's been a concerted effort for us to get well ahead of any date at which a landlord would have a termination right or gain leverage from a financial standpoint over what those extension terms would be. And the team has just done a phenomenal job over a long period of time of consistently improving the quality of the assets and reducing the risks, albeit relatively small in an individual tower basis.
Cumulatively, I think I would put that in the category, as Dan was talking about, balance sheet risk. That's another risk that we've methodically eliminated in the business and really excited about where we are today. It's an ongoing activity. As long as we're in the business, we're going to continue to be there.
So we are constantly working on buying out land that makes sense, that we can acquire at the appropriate multiple. And at the same time, working on extending ground leases. And some component of the ground leases, I think, will always be in that maintenance mode, where we're extending and working to extend it.
So some of the activity coming down is just a result of terrific execution over a long period of time and the natural evolution of -- once we get 80, 100 years on a ground lease or we acquire it, then that comes off the board and there's no longer any work to do on that site. So it'll probably, in terms of quantity or number, continue to come down over time, and we'll continue to kind of make the right financial decision around buying or extending the leases."

And maybe one on the small cell front. I'm sure you guys have pretty good intelligence for where the carriers are self-building small cells and, in some cases, maybe why they went in-house versus using the vendor like you.
What are the factors that you've been observing as kind of most correlated to carriers choosing to deploy on their own for particular builds versus leasing? Is it proximity to their own wireline assets or some local market attribute or something else?"

I think there's probably 2 factors. You mentioned 1 of them, proximity to existing plants that they have is certainly a reason why they would self-perform and use their existing plant to do it.
The other reason, frankly, is that there are places where we're not interested in putting the capital because we don't see the lease-up opportunity. So there are limited number of providers of third-party capital building these small cells. Obviously, ourselves and then inside of the digital colony portfolio, as they're delivering that as a offering to customers. But beyond that, there just aren't anybody -- there isn't anybody else who's doing that at scale.
So we're selective in terms of the opportunities in places where we want to invest the capital and put the capital. It's got to not only meet that kind of initial return, but we've also got to be comfortable that there's going to be big demand over time for other carriers to need it. And in places where we would look at it and evaluate the nodes as not meeting the return thresholds by virtue of either the cost to build them or the lack of certainty of lease-up, then those would be locations where we would pass and decide not to invest the capital and the carrier would self-perform.
So it's a combination of those 2 would lead to the vast majority of the reasons why they would self-perform.
We've talked about this some in the past, but our view of the number of small cells that is going to be needed in the market, aligns pretty closely with a number of the comments that the carriers have made where they've indicated there's going to be more than 1 million small cells in the U.S. We certainly don't anticipate building all of those.
And so I think as long as the business is around and we're building small cell nodes, I think we're going to continue to see the wireless carriers self-perform. And our opportunity for value creation is to be rigorous and disciplined in our approach to evaluating those markets that have the best potential for lease-up and then making sure that we're really thoughtful about which ones we pick and then how we build those sites on cost and on time. And those are sort of the value opportunities that we're looking for.
And then there will be lots of small cells, I think, that will exist in the U.S. that are going to be self-performed by the carriers. And I would look at that as -- overall activity as just a trajectory that I think aligns well with our strategy."

Meaning there's a lot of opportunity for the carriers to deploy beyond the first 45 markets should they choose to do so. And I was interested if you had any color as to whether you have some insight into whether that may or may not be happening.
And then the second question would be, again with respect to the idea that the carriers are mostly looking at C-Band as a macro [indiscernible] start primarily because of the [indiscernible] and backhaul that they have on existing sites.
Are you seeing or expecting that the kind of incumbent tower carriers are going to be gaining the lion's share of the demand here? Or are you seeing the kind of interlopers, the new tower companies, the Unitis, the Tillmans of the world, are they getting a super normal share of -- or the supernormal part of the conversation at the margin as we think about this new deployment?"

It's probably just a little too specific for us to make those kind of comments or indications. We're obviously -- as I mentioned in my earlier comments, we're seeing a lot of C-Band activity is driving a lot of leasing activity. And I think, over time, the driver of our business is, as I mentioned before, kind of stacking years of growth. And it's going to take multiple years for C-Band to be deployed, and we think it's going to be great for us for an extended period of time.
But specificity beyond that, I'll let the carriers speak to kind of their own plans and initiatives.
On the second component of your question around where does the activity go? History, I think, is a really helpful indication of where the carriers are going to deploy this 5G network and how they'll think about the C-Band spectrum. It is always most cost-effective to deploy the spectrum on locations where they have existing infrastructure.
They've already got connectivity there. They've already got power. They've got the basic infrastructure there to be able to add additional spectrum bands. So at least initially, I think the vast, vast majority of the activity will end up on sites where they are already located on. So the existing owners of towers where these carriers are co-located on those sites I think will see the preponderance of activity for some extended period of time.
As it gets built out and then as the spectrum begins to be used, then step 2 is the densification activity. And then that activity is likely to go, frankly, again, on existing sites where the carrier is not yet co-located. The opportunity for new and upcoming tower companies is generally pretty limited to places that are outside the core areas where the big -- at least the 3 big public tower companies own their assets, into places where new housing developments, the extension of suburbia, the sprawl, those kind of areas. Those companies that you mentioned are often building towers in those locations and putting their capital up to meet that need.
But that's the sort of second, third kind of level of activity. I think the vast majority of the activities in early days and even -- maybe even in the medium term is on existing sites."

I think that's generally referred to in the industry as it used be. And I'm curious, historically speaking, how long is the contracted committed new leasing portion of the contract lasted when you signed these agreements previously? How does it trend over time? And can you help us think about the value you ascribed to the use fee relative to the term extension? That would be great. 
Then second question around T-Mobile churn, the disclosures are super helpful. Can you provide what the churn was this quarter? And then out of the 700 million or so of co-location and other Sprint sites that you have, what would be a good number as you look out over time for you to retain?"

There's a little more specificity than we would get into on our customer contracts, as I mentioned to Colby earlier. There's a component of that, that's related to giving them knowledge of what the actual pricing is going to be for new activity. There's a commitment on their part in terms of activity on existing sites. And then there's obviously the extension of the existing sites to 10 years. And we priced that and negotiated that with the economics of the sites in mind and the right returns.
But beyond that, I think that's just too specific and not in our best interest or that of our customers to get into that level of detail.
On the second part of the question, around Sprint churn in the quarter, it was negligible. Longer term and what you should assume, frankly, it's really early. As we laid out that schedule, we have our first meaningful amount of churn not until 2023. And then after that, I think in each year, it's less than $20 million all the way out to 2028, which is the bulk here of the thereafter that's included in the table.
So we're a long way away from kind of needing to have that conversation and too early to predict ultimately what the outcome is. 
Big picture, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, I think the net investment by T-Mobile in building out 5G will far exceed any of the synergies that they achieve. I think that's consistent with the public comments that they've made and their desire to build out 5G networks.
And when we get to a place where we have a better view, whether that's because of contract or just because of the activity that we're seeing, we'll certainly come back and take just the disclosure and turn that into more of a forecasted view of what we actually think will start to impact the numbers. But it's a long way out. And at this point, not really ready to provide a specific forecast on timing or amount.
I appreciate everybody joining this morning, and I just want to end the call by thanking our team who has done a tremendous job delivering for our customers over the last year and navigating through COVID.
