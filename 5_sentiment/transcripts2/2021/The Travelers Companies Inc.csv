Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.Before I address our fourth quarter and full year results, a quick comment on current affairs.

Before I address our fourth quarter and full year results, a quick comment on current affairs. Yesterday, we witnessed the most American of events. The peaceful transfer of power from 1 democratically-elected administration to the next. It's not a political statement, but a patriotic one to say that we want to see this next administration succeed. We have significant challenges to overcome: a pandemic threatening the health and safety of our locums and neighbors; a distressed economy in pairing the lives and livelihoods of millions; and a deeply divided society, which undermines our collective sense of security and well-being. Let's hope yesterday marks the beginning of our political leaders, on both sides of the aisle, taking a constructive approach to addressing these challenges.
So with that, I'll turn to results. We're pleased to report a very strong finish to the year, with fourth quarter core income of $1.3 billion or $4.91 per diluted share and core return on equity of 20.5%, each up meaningfully from the prior year quarter. We're also pleased to report full year core income of $2.7 billion, generating core return on equity of 11.3%, a substantial margin over the risk-free rate and our cost of equity. Our ability to deliver these results in the face of a historic pandemic, a record high number of PCS catastrophe events and record low interest rates is a testament to the strength of our franchise, more specifically to our talented and committed workforce, the value of our hard-to-replicate competitive advantages and our expertise in balancing risk and reward to achieve industry meeting returns over time.
The principal driver of the higher level of core income for the quarter was very strong underlying underwriting income, resulting from a record net earned premium of $7.5 billion and an underlying combined ratio that improved 3.4 points to an excellent 88.7%. We're pleased with the underwriting results in all 3 segments. We once again recorded a sub-30 consolidated expense ratio for the quarter and the full year, demonstrating that our strategic investments and improving productivity and efficiency continue to pay off.
Turning to investments. This quarter, our high-quality investment portfolio performed well, generating net investment income of $572 million after tax, as the non-fixed income portfolio continued to recover from the pandemic-related impacts earlier in the year. Our operating results, together with our strong balance sheet, enabled us to grow adjusted book value per share by 7% during the year after returning $1.5 billion of excess capital to shareholders, including $672 million of share repurchases which we resumed in the fourth quarter.
Turning to production. Notwithstanding the challenges in the economy, we continue to successfully execute on our marketplace strategies to generate growth in the top line. Net written premiums in the quarter grew by 3%, driven by strong renewal rate change strongly across the book and continued strong retention in all 3 segments. Given the headwinds facing the industry, we expect the favorable pricing environment to continue for some time.
In Business Insurance in our core middle market business, renewal rate change was a record 9.1%, up 4.5 points over the prior year and about 1 point sequentially while retention remains strong. Segmentation in pricing is key in this business and to that end, the quality of the execution underneath the headline production numbers was excellent. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net written premiums increased by 12% as renewal premium change in our domestic management liability business achieved a record 10.9%, driven by record renewal rate change, while retention remains strong. In Personal Insurance, net written premiums increased by 7%, driven by strong renewal premium change in our Agency Homeowners business and strong retention and new business in both Agency Auto and Agency Homeowners. Fourth quarter production contributed to full year record net written premiums of almost $30 billion, up 2% compared to last year. Adjusting for the premium refund we offered to our Personal Insurance auto customers, net written premiums were up 3%, a strong top line result in the context of this year's difficult economic environment.
Taking a step back, let me direct your attention to Slide 18 of the webcast presentation and put this year's results into a broader context. I've shared before our belief that any commitment to delivering industry-leading return on equity over time requires a strategy to grow over time. To that end, a few years ago, we laid out a strategy to achieve profitable growth in the context of the forces of change we have previously identified as impacting the industry. As you can see on the slide, despite the challenging economic and operating environment, 2020 was another successful year of the execution of that strategy. Since 2016, we have grown net written premiums at a 4.5% compound annual rate, substantially outpacing both GDP growth over the same period and our growth rate over the prior years in the decade. We accomplished that while maintaining a stable underlying underwriting margin. In other words, we haven't grown by underpricing the product or changing our risk profile. The growth has come organically from customer segments, products, geographies and producers that we know well. Over that same period, through our ongoing and relentless focus on optimizing productivity and efficiency, we've also improved our expense ratio by about 2 points compared to the run rate from earlier in the decade.
As you can also see on the slide, the result of all that is significantly higher underlying underwriting income, meaningfully higher cash flow from operations and double-digit growth in invested assets. Those results have contributed to our ultimate objective of creating shareholder value through industry-leading return on equity over time. Our core return on equity has increased in each of the last 3 years and averaged 11% over that period. And that 11% is after bearing the impacts of significant cat and non-cat weather activity in meaningful recent social inflation, historically low interest rates and the global pandemic. In short, our performance this year and over recent years is the result of sound strategy and the successful achievement of our strategic objectives. Looking forward from here, thanks to our team, our strategy, our capabilities and our strong track record of innovation and execution, we feel very well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities ahead as the economy continues to recover and beyond.
Before I turn the call over to Dan, I want to acknowledge and thank my 30,000 colleagues, many of whom are listening this morning, for their tireless efforts to serve in this past year. Notwithstanding concerns for their own safety and responsibilities for taking care of loved ones and educating their children, they never waver from our purpose of taking care of the people we're privileged to serve or our mission of creating shareholder value. I couldn't be more proud of this team. I also want to acknowledge and thank all those who have been involved in the extraordinary effort of developing and manufacturing COVID vaccines in record time, from the scientists to the regulators, to those who volunteer to participate in trials. It's a remarkable feat. The side of those vaccines rolling off the line inspires optimism for the coming year, and the sheer human will and ingenuity behind the effort inspire hope for the future.
And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan."

Core income for the fourth quarter was $1.262 billion, up from $867 million in the prior year quarter, and core return on equity was 20.5%, up from 14.8%.

Core income for the fourth quarter was $1.262 billion, up from $867 million in the prior year quarter, and core return on equity was 20.5%, up from 14.8%. The improvement in both measures was the result of very strong underlying underwriting results. Our fourth quarter results include $29 million of pretax cat losses compared to $85 million of pretax cat losses in last year's fourth quarter. Recall that last year's fourth quarter cat losses included a $101 million benefit from recoveries under the underlying aggregate cat treaty. Whereas in 2020, we exhausted the cat treaty in the third quarter, so there were no recoveries under the treaty in this year's fourth quarter. This quarter's cat results include about $40 million of favorable development in our loss estimates for events that occurred earlier in the year.
PYD in the current quarter, for which I'll provide more detail shortly, was net favorable $180 million pretax. The underlying combined ratio of 88.7%, which excludes the impacts of cats and PYD, improved by 3.4 points from the prior year quarter. Our pretax underlying underwriting gain of $804 million increased by nearly 50% over the prior year quarter, reflecting the benefit of higher levels of earned premium and higher margins driven by earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trend and continued favorability in personal auto loss experience.
For the quarter, losses directly related to COVID-19 totaled a modest $31 million pretax, split about evenly between Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty insurance. More than offsetting those losses were lower levels of auto claims in both Personal Insurance and Business Insurance. The net impact of the COVID environment on the consolidated underlying combined ratio amounted to a benefit of about 2.5 points, mostly in Personal Insurance. We continue to take a cautious approach in estimating the net impact of COVID-related losses given the ongoing uncertainty in this environment. As has been the case throughout the year, the majority of direct coded losses that we've booked for year-end remains in IBNR.
Looking at the full year net impact of COVID costs and benefits, including the impact of premium refunds to policyholders, our consolidated underlying combined ratio benefited by about 1 point. The fourth quarter expense ratio of 29.4% brings the full year expense ratio of 29.9%. While throughout the year we continue to make the investments necessary to fuel our continued success, our ongoing focus on productivity and efficiency once again resulted in a sub-30 expense ratio despite the downward pressure on earned premiums from the impact of the soft economy on insured exposures and the premium refunds we issued to our personal auto customers. We continue to be comfortable with the consolidated expense ratio of around 30%. After-tax net investment income improved by 9% from the prior year quarter to $572 million, the strong returns in the non-fixed income portfolio and a higher level of invested assets were partially offset by the expected decline in fixed income yields. Looking forward to 2021, we expect that after tax fixed income NII, including earnings from short-term securities, will be between $420 million and $430 million per quarter, as we project that the benefit of higher average levels of invested assets will be more than offset by a lower average yield on the portfolio given the lower interest rate environment.
Turning to reserves. Net favorable prior year reserve development occurred in all 3 segments and totaled $180 million pretax in the fourth quarter. In Business Insurance, net favorable PYD of $124 million was driven by better-than-expected loss experience in workers' comp, primarily from accident years 2017 and prior, partially offset by an increase to reserves related to very old years in our runoff book. In Bond & Specialty, net favorable PYD of $32 million resulted primarily from better-than-expected loss development in the surety book. And in Personal Insurance, net favorable PYD of $24 million was driven by the automobile line. When our combined 2020 Schedule P is filed early in the second quarter, the line of business analysis will provide more detail on the loss trends we've noted in our commentary throughout the year, with favorability in workers' comp, commercial property and the personal lines coverages and some strengthening in the commercial liability lines, much of which was in very old accident years relating to our runoff book.
Page 19 of the earnings presentation provides information about our January 1 cat treaty renewals. Our long-standing corporate cat XOL treaty renewed on terms in line with the expiring treaty and continues to provide coverage for both single cat events and the aggregation of losses from multiple cat events. Regarding the underlying property aggregate catastrophe XOL treaty we first purchased for 2019, we have renewed the treaty again for 2021. While the treaty will continue to address qualifying PCS-designated events in North America for which we incur losses of $5 million or more, the 2021 renewal includes a $5 million deductible per event. In prior years PCS-designated events that cost us more than $5 million counted towards the treaty from on dollar more.
The treaty provides aggregate coverage of $350 million part of $500 million of losses above our aggregate retention of $1.9 billion. The aggregate retention for 2021 increased from 2020's $1.55 billion, largely reflecting recent years' experience and anticipated growth in our property book. Hurricane and earthquake events once again have a $250 million per occurrence cap. And for 2021, wildfires are also capped at $250 million per event. Incorporating our assumptions about and non-cat weather for 2021, we expect the full year impact of the treaty on our underlying combined ratio to be roughly 0.5 point, and we anticipate only a minimal impact on the total combined ratio. Both of those impacts are consistent with the assumptions we had in each of the past 2 years.
Turning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of $1.9 billion were again very strong. All our capital ratios were at or better than target levels. And we ended the quarter withholding company liquidity of approximately $1.7 billion. For the full year, operating cash flow exceeded $6 billion for the first time ever and reflected the benefit of continued increases in premium volume, subrogation recoveries from PG&E related to the 2017 and 2018 California wildfires and lower overall claim payouts as courtroom and other settlement activity slowed throughout the year due to COVID-related shutdowns. Higher levels of cash flow give us the flexibility to continue to make important investments in our business, return excess capital to our shareholders and grow our investment portfolio.
Interest yields decreased modestly as credit spreads tightened during the fourth quarter. And accordingly, our net unrealized investment gain increased from $3.8 billion after-tax as of September 30 to $4.1 billion after-tax at year-end. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes unrealized investment gains and losses, was $99.54 at year-end, a 7% increase from a year ago. We returned $419 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter, comprising dividends of $218 million and share repurchases of $201 million. For the year, we returned $1.5 billion of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Finally, on a financial modeling note, let me turn your attention to Slide 20 of the webcast presentation. As we enter 2021, we again thought it would be helpful to highlight the seasonality of our cat losses over the prior decade. As shown in the data, the second quarter has regularly and noticeably been our largest cat quarter. Cat losses in the second quarter have been about twice as much as any other quarter on average, and the second quarter has been our largest cat quarter in 7 of the past 10 years. To wrap it up, we are very pleased with the quarter and full year results, especially given the challenging circumstances.
And now I'll turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of business insurance."
392856,698319970,2177828,"The Travelers Companies, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2021",2021-01-21,"Earnings Calls","The Travelers Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dan. For the fourth quarter, business insurance produced $713 million of segment income, an increase of almost 60% over the fourth quarter of 2019.

For the fourth quarter, business insurance produced $713 million of segment income, an increase of almost 60% over the fourth quarter of 2019. Higher net favorable prior year reserve development, underlying underwriting income and net investment income as well as lower cap losses all contributed to the favorable year-over-year increase. We're pleased with the underlying combined ratio of 93.6%, which improved by 2.8 points from the prior year quarter. We benefited again from earned pricing that exceeded loss trend, with an impact this quarter of a little more than 1.5 points. There is also 1.5 points of improvement due to the favorable comparison to the fourth quarter of 2019, which was elevated due to the reestimation of losses for prior quarters.
Turning to the top line. In light of the ongoing macroeconomic challenges, we remain pleased with the resilience of our business. Net written premiums were only slightly lower than the prior year quarter, with strong rate and high retentions mostly offsetting modestly lower levels of insured exposures as well as lower new business. The lower insured exposures reflect lower levels of economic activity as well as impacts from our active management of terms and conditions and deal structures, including deductibles, attachment points and limits.
Turning to domestic production. We achieved a record renewal rate change of 8.4%, up almost 4 points from the fourth quarter of last year, while retention remained high at 83%. This quarter marks the eighth consecutive quarter in which renewal rate change was higher than the corresponding prior year quarter. We continue to achieve higher rate levels broadly across our book as rate increases in all lines other than workers' compensation were meaningfully higher during the quarter as compared to the prior year. Importantly, we continue to feel great about our deliberate and granular execution in terms of rate and retention on an account-by-account and class-by-class basis. The segmentation beneath the headline numbers was once again excellent.
Also, one other thing that's not apparent in the headline numbers is the contribution to margins from the active management terms, conditions and deal structure that I mentioned a minute ago. We're doing this broadly across the book, but most notably in our national property business. The tighter terms tend to persist beyond the rate cycle.
New business of $440 million was down $35 million from the prior year quarter. Given the lower levels of economic activity and given the hardening market conditions, there is a higher proportion of distressed business in the market. Our new business production reflects our disciplined approach to that business. Risk selection is particularly important during circumstances like these.
As for the individual businesses, in select, renewal REIT change increased to 4.2%, up more than 2 points from the fourth quarter of 2019 and more than 1 point from the third quarter of this year. Retention of 77% was down from recent periods, a result of deliberate execution as we pursue improved returns in certain segments of the business. As I mentioned above, we're pleased with the segmented execution underneath the aggregate result. Importantly, we have not slowed down on our commitment to invest in product development and ease of doing business, which position us well for long-term profitable growth in this business.
In middle market, renewal rate change increased to 9.1%, while retention remained strong at 86%. Renewal rate change was up 4.5 points from the fourth quarter of 2019 and almost 1 point from the third quarter of this year. Additionally, we achieved positive rate on more than 80% of our accounts this quarter, a more than 10-point increase from the fourth quarter of last year.
To sum up, we feel terrific about our results and execution, especially given some of the unusual economic challenges related to the pandemic. We continue to improve the profitability of the book while investing strategically for the future. These investments include enhancing the experiences for our customers and distribution partners, developing new insights for our underwriters, digitizing the underwriting transaction and creating efficiencies. Examples of capabilities released this year include rollout of our completely redesigned BOT 2.0 small commercial product, which includes industry-leading segmentation and a fast, easy quoting experience. This new product is now available in 23 states and performing consistently with our expectations. Advancement of our industry-leading strategic work intake initiatives, which allow for automated receipt of submissions from the various technology solutions our agent partner views and the seamless routing of those submissions, which improves the experience for our distribution partners and is more efficient for us. Enhancing our MyTravelers customer self-service application and lastly, our simply business and insurance platforms continue to advance their digital capabilities and offerings in the alternative platform space. We're as confident as ever that strategic investments like these, together with our meaningful competitive advantages, position us well for long-term profitable growth.
Concluding, I would like to acknowledge and thank our employees, agents and brokers for their partnership as we seamlessly delivered virtual solutions for the benefit of our combined customers.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom."

Bond & Specialty delivered strong returns and double-digit growth in the quarter despite the ongoing headwinds of COVID-19. Segment income was $164 million, nearly flat with the prior year quarter as the benefit of higher business volumes and a higher level of net favorable prior year reserve development were offset by an underlying combined ratio, which, while still strong at 85%, was higher than the prior year quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 3.7 points, driven by the impact of higher loss estimates for management liability coverages primarily losses attributable to COVID-19-related economic conditions.
As we discussed last quarter, the products that we write in this segment are susceptible to elevated loss levels in times of severe economic downturn. We experienced that during the financial crisis, and again, in recent quarters due to the impacts of the pandemic. Nonetheless, with the strong rate levels we're achieving, we expect that the underlying combined ratio in 2021 will improve a little bit from the roughly 87% in the second half of 2020.
Turning to top line. Net written premiums grew an outstanding 12% in the quarter, reflecting continued improved pricing in our management liability business with nearly flat surety production despite the continued economic impact of COVID-19 on public project procurement and related bond demand. In our domestic management liability business, we're pleased that renewal premium change increased to a record 10.9%, driven by record high renewal rate change, while retention of 89% remained near historical highs. These production results demonstrate the successful execution of our strategy to pursue rate in light of elevated loss activity while maintaining strong retention levels in our high-quality portfolio. We will continue to pursue rate increases where warranted.
Domestic management liability new business for the quarter increased $13 million, primarily reflecting our thoughtful underwriting in this elevated risk environment. Consistent with last quarter, submissions are up, while quote activity is down. Our Bond & Specialty results were again strong despite the challenges brought on by COVID-19.
Beyond the numbers, notwithstanding our focus on managing through the challenging environment, we continue to invest in differentiating our businesses in the eyes of our customers and agents and broker partners while positioning ourselves for continued profitability and competitiveness in the future. Some highlights from 2020 include continuing investments in our surety business to help our contractor clients more effectively manage risk while providing insights that will enable them to more profitably manage their business, piloting digital platforms that will improve the speed and convenience of accessing management liability and small surety products for our agents and brokers and investing in a new sales management platform that will enhance productivity, optimize workflow management and increase sales.
Lastly, I'd like to thank our employees and distribution partners for their commitment to creatively and effectively addressing the needs of our customers in these most unusual times.
And now I'll turn it over to Michael to discuss Personal Insurance."
392856,698319970,2177828,"The Travelers Companies, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2021",2021-01-21,"Earnings Calls","The Travelers Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. In Personal Insurance, we're very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results. For the fourth quarter, segment income increased to $457 million, and our combined ratio improved to 84.1%. Full year segment",754,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. In Personal Insurance, we're very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results. For the fourth quarter, segment income increased to $457 million, and our combined ratio improved to 84.1%. Full year segment income was $1.2 billion, and the combined ratio was 89.7%. The significant improvement for both periods compared to the prior year is primarily driven by lower frequency of automobile losses as well as the benefit to underwriting income from higher business volumes. In addition, the full year results include higher net favorable prior year reserve development and elevated catastrophe losses.
Net written premium growth for the fourth quarter and full year was 7% and 5%, respectively, with continued strong retention and higher levels of new business, resulting in record net written premiums of more than $11.3 billion for the year. Agency Automobile profitability was very strong with a combined ratio of 86.5% for the fourth quarter. The underlying combined ratio for the quarter improved 12 points, continuing to reflect favorable frequency levels. Approximately 1/3 of the improvement in the quarter is from favorable reestimates of activity for prior quarters in 2020. We continue to observe lower claim frequency as a result of fewer miles driven, reflecting the ongoing impact from the pandemic. We will continue to analyze and incorporate current trends into our state-specific underwriting and pricing decisions as we balance business volumes and profitability.
In Agency Homeowners and other, the fourth quarter combined ratio of 81.9% increased relative to the prior year quarter, driven by a higher underlying combined ratio and an increase in catastrophe losses. The fourth quarter included 1 catastrophe, Hurricane Beta, with no recoveries from the catastrophe aggregate reinsurance treaty. The underlying combined ratio of 78.5% was 5 points higher than the prior year quarter due to higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses and to a lesser degree, increases in other losses, specifically elevated fire losses. The full year combined ratio of 93% was comparable to the prior year, with increased favorable prior year reserve development and improved underlying results, offset by elevated catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio of 82.9% was almost 3 points better than last year, driven by lower non-catastrophe weather-related losses. This improvement demonstrates the success of our continuing efforts to improve returns in property while growing the business.
Turning to quarterly production. Overall results were again very strong. We're pleased with our momentum in Agency Automobile. Retention was 84% and new business increased 12%, contributing to the 3% year-over-year growth in policies in force. Renewal premium changes were lower given our pricing actions in response to the favorable loss environment. We continue to see growth in this profitable line. Agency Homeowners and other delivered another excellent quarter with retention of 85% and a 21% increase in new business, while renewal premium change again exceeded 8%. Policies in force were up 8% from a year ago. These results reflect our continued efforts to grow while improving profitability.
Looking back, 2020 was both a challenging and successful year for personal insurance. We achieved record levels of segment income, net written premium and policies in force. Our continued success reflects the execution of our strategy to meet customers where they are, give them what they need and serve them how they want. Examples include: nearing completion of our Quantum Home 2.0 rollout, which is now available in over 40 states; increasing the take-up of Intellidrive by enhancing our auto telematics offering in 17 states and just this week, we introduced Intellidrive in Canada as well; improving our customer self-service capabilities with our new MyT mobile app, which will be rolled out more broadly throughout the first quarter of 2021; planting an additional 500,000 trees for customer enrollment and paperless billing, bringing the total number of trees planted through our partnership with American Forest to 1.5 million; and just recently, announcing the acquisition of Insurer Match, an innovative digital online platform that allows customers to compare offerings from more than 40 carriers across the United States. We expect to complete the acquisition in the first quarter of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions.
Before I wrap up, I'd like to add my thanks to our team and our distribution partners for continuing to deliver value to our customers despite a challenging and uncertain environment. We have strong momentum going into 2021 and are well-positioned to deliver profitable growth while investing in capabilities that will continue to enhance the value of our franchise.

And I think the point Greg made in his prepared remarks about the benefit of tightening terms and conditions and weathers, so all that's really important. And from here, I think this plays out for a while, and it's a function of rates. All the drivers are environmental, so primarily loss activity, think about social inflation, think about weathers, think about wildfires. You got interest rates that appear to be lower for longer, cost and availability of reinsurance, academic losses impacting the industry. And I suspect, for some markets, maybe still reckoning with social inflation.

And even this year, plus 3% when you adjust for the Personal Insurance auto refunds that we made, the comments that we made a year or so ago would still hold true. I think to the degree that the top line grows, that's going to require us to hold more capital because everything that requires capital grows with it. Reserve balances grow, your investment portfolio grows.
And the only point we were really trying to make when we made those comments a year or so ago was -- don't think about us perpetually being able to return 100% of earnings in the form of dividends and buybacks, we're going to have to hold some of that for growth. So that would still be true.

Let me just give you a little bit of color on how we see or thinking about the workers' comp loss activity. So first of all, the COVID related claim rate is relatively low relative to the infection rate and lower than we might have expected, and the",261,"Yes. Let me just give you a little bit of color on how we see or thinking about the workers' comp loss activity. So first of all, the COVID related claim rate is relatively low relative to the infection rate and lower than we might have expected, and the severity on COVID-related workers' comp is also coming in a little better than we had thought. There is -- there continues to be some benefit from non-COVID-related frequency as people are working from home. But there still is, in our minds, a degree of uncertainty to your point about how COVID related workers' comp claims are going to play out over time. So we've been pretty cautious in the way that we've been booking for workers' comp losses to make sure that we don't get surprised by that.
Now historically, putting COVID aside, historically, in a recession, you get sort of offsetting forces in workers' comp. You got people who want to stay on the job, so they're less inclined to go out, and so frequency is down a little bit. But severity goes up a little bit because once people go out, they tend to stay out longer on workers' comp. Historically, for us, in recessionary periods, the net of those 2 things have been a little bit of a positive. I mean every circumstance is different and so hard to know for sure, but that's generally what we've seen in the past. And so I think that's sort of the landscape as we see it on workers' comp loss activity."

So I guess I'd point you to the net investment income slide in the webcast presentation, and I'd point you to Page 6. So we gave you some outlook in terms of what we think the run rate looks like for the fixed income portfolio. The variability that we've seen in the last 3 quarters has really been in the non-fixed income portfolio. And so if you look at the bottom right-hand quadrant of that chart, it shows non-fixed income over the last 8 quarters or so. And what you could see is, sort of pre-COVID, that was -- the last 3 quarters pre-COVID had been $70 million or so of non-fixed income, and you see a big dip in the second quarter. And remember, at that time, we talked about that was the impact of the disruption to the equity markets that happened in the first quarter coming through our results on a lagging basis in Q2. And then as markets have come back, we've seen some of that rebound come through our numbers.
And so what you see in Q3 and Q4 are very strong results in a non-fixed income portfolio. But if you just look at that chart, you should get the sense that part of that is the bounce back from the big dip we saw in the second quarter, and so I wouldn't take that as indicative of a new run rate on the non-fixed income piece."

Then as months and quarters go by, losses actually emerge. So it's a little bit of a moving target. The variances have been significant. I wouldn't put a tremendous amount of stock and the difference of what came through the loss ratio in 1 quarter versus the next. I think, as Michael probably indicated and as you would not be surprised by on a go-forward basis, we wouldn't expect margins to continue to be that strong in auto, and you see that reflected in our pricing actions in the most recent quarters.
So I'd step back more and think about the year in aggregate, which has definitely had a benefit from the COVID environment. And recall that in response to that, we've also returned more than $200 million of premiums to policyholders. I don't know I can give you any more specific answer than that."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before I address our fourth quarter and full year results, a quick comment on current affairs.

Before I address our fourth quarter and full year results, a quick comment on current affairs. Yesterday, we witnessed the most American of events. The peaceful transfer of power from one democratically elected administration to the next. It's not a political statement but a patriotic one to say that we want to see this next administration succeed. We have significant challenges to overcome: a pandemic threatening the health and safety of our loved ones and neighbors; a distressed economy impairing the lives and livelihoods of millions; and a deeply divided society, which undermines our collective sense of security and well-being. Let's hope yesterday marks the beginning of our political leaders on both sides of the aisle, taking a constructive approach to addressing these challenges.
And with that, I'll turn to results. We're pleased to report a very strong finish to the year, with fourth quarter core income of $1.3 billion or $4.91 per diluted share and core return on equity of 20.5%, each up meaningfully from the prior year quarter. We're also pleased to report full year core income of $2.7 billion, generating core return on equity of 11.3%, a substantial margin over the risk-free rate and our cost of equity. Our ability to deliver these results in the face of a historic pandemic, a record high number of PCS catastrophe events and record low interest rates is a testament to the strength of our franchise, more specifically to our talented and committed workforce, the value of our hard-to-replicate, competitive advantages and our expertise in balancing risk and reward to achieve industry-leading returns over time.
The principal driver of the higher level of core income for the quarter was very strong underlying underwriting income, resulting from a record net earned premium of $7.5 billion and an underlying combined ratio that improved 3.4 points to an excellent 88.7%. We're pleased with the underwriting results in all 3 segments. We once again recorded a sub-30% consolidated expense ratio for the quarter and the full year, demonstrating that our strategic investments in improving productivity and efficiency continue to pay off.
Turning to investments. This quarter, our high-quality investment portfolio performed well, generating net investment income of $572 million after tax as the non-fixed income portfolio continued to recover from the pandemic-related impacts earlier in the year. Our operating results, together with our strong balance sheet, enabled us to grow adjusted book value per share by 7% during the year after returning $1.5 billion of excess capital to shareholders, including $672 million of share repurchases, which we resumed in the fourth quarter.
Turning to production. Notwithstanding the challenges in the economy, we continue to successfully execute on our marketplace strategies to generate growth in the top line. Net written premiums in the quarter grew by 3% driven by strong renewal rate change broadly across the book and continued strong retention in all 3 segments. Given the headwinds facing the industry, we expect the favorable pricing environment to continue for some time.
In Business Insurance, in our core Middle Market business, renewal rate change was a record 9.1%, up 4.5 points over the prior year and about 1 point sequentially, while retention remains strong. Segmentation in pricing is key in this business. And to that end, the quality of the execution underneath the headline production numbers was excellent.
In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net written premiums increased by 12% as renewal premium change in our domestic management liability business achieved a record 10.9%, driven by record renewal rate change, while retention remained strong.
In Personal Insurance, net written premiums increased by 7%, driven by stronger renewal premium change in our Agency Homeowners business and strong retention and new business in both Agency Auto and Agency Homeowners.
Fourth quarter production contributed to full year record net written premiums of almost $30 billion, up 2% compared to last year. Adjusting for the premium refund we offered to our Personal Insurance auto customers, net written premiums were up 3%, a strong top line result in the context of this year's difficult economic environment.
Taking a step back, let me direct your attention to Slide 18 of the webcast presentation and put this year's results into a broader context. I've shared before our belief that any commitment to delivering industry-leading return on equity over time requires a strategy to grow over time.
To that end, a few years ago, we laid out a strategy to achieve profitable growth in the context of the forces of change we have previously identified as impacting the industry. As you can see on the slide, despite the challenging economic and operating environment, 2020 was another successful year of the execution of that strategy. Since 2016, we have grown net written premiums at a 4.5% compound annual rate, substantially outpacing both GDP growth over the same period and our growth rate over the prior years in the decade. We accomplished that while maintaining a stable underlying underwriting margin. In other words, we haven't grown by underpricing the product or changing our risk profile. The growth has come organically from customer segments, products, geographies and producers that we know well. Over that same period, through our ongoing and relentless focus on optimizing productivity and efficiency, we've also improved our expense ratio by about 2 points compared to the run rate from earlier in the decade. As you can also see on the slide, the result of all that is significantly higher underlying underwriting income, meaningfully higher cash flow from operations and double-digit growth in invested assets.
Those results have contributed to our ultimate objective of creating shareholder value through industry-leading return on equity over time. Our core return on equity has increased in each of the last 3 years and averaged 11% over that period. And that 11% is after bearing the impacts of significant cat and non-cat weather activity, a meaningful increase in social inflation, historically low interest rates and the global pandemic. In short, our performance this year and over recent years is the result of a sound strategy and the successful achievement of our strategic objectives. Looking forward from here, thanks to our team, our strategy, our capabilities and our strong track record of innovation and execution, we feel very well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities ahead as the economy continues to recover and beyond.
Before I turn the call over to Dan, I want to acknowledge and thank my 30,000 colleagues, many of whom are listening this morning, for their tireless efforts over this past year. Notwithstanding concerns for their own safety and responsibilities for taking care of loved ones and educating their children, they never waver from our purpose of taking care of the people with privilege to serve or our mission of creating shareholder value. I couldn't be more proud of this team.
I also want to acknowledge and thank all those who have been involved in the extraordinary effort of developing and manufacturing COVID vaccines in record time. From the scientists to the regulators, to those who volunteer to participate in trials, it's a remarkable feat. The sight of those vaccines rolling off the line inspires optimism for the coming year, and the sheer human will and ingenuity behind the effort inspire hope for the future.
And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan."

Core income for the fourth quarter was $1.2.62 billion (sic) [ $1.262 billion, ] up from $867 million in the prior year quarter, and core ROE was 20.5%, up from 14.8%.

Core income for the fourth quarter was $1.2.62 billion (sic) [ $1.262 billion, ] up from $867 million in the prior year quarter, and core ROE was 20.5%, up from 14.8%. The improvement in both measures was the result of very strong underlying underwriting results. Our fourth quarter results include $29 million of pretax cat losses compared to $85 million of pretax cat losses in last year's fourth quarter. Recall that last year's fourth quarter cat losses included a $101 million benefit from recoveries under the underlying aggregate cat treaty, whereas in 2020, we exhausted the cat treaty in the third quarter, so there were no recoveries under the treaty in this year's fourth quarter. This quarter's cat results include about $40 million of favorable development in our loss estimates for events that occurred earlier in the year.
PYD in the current quarter, for which I'll provide more detail shortly, was net favorable $180 million pretax. The underlying combined ratio of 88.7%, which excludes the impacts of cats and PYD, improved by 3.4 points from the prior year quarter. Our pretax underlying underwriting gain of $804 million increased by nearly 50% over the prior year quarter, reflecting the benefit of higher levels of earned premium and higher margins, driven by earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trend and continued favorability in personal auto loss experience.
For the quarter, losses directly related to COVID-19 totaled a modest $31 million pretax, split about evenly between Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance. More than offsetting those losses were lower levels of auto claims in both Personal Insurance and Business Insurance.
The net impact of the COVID environment on the consolidated underlying combined ratio amounted to a benefit of about 2.5 points, mostly in Personal Insurance. We continue to take a cautious approach in estimating the net impact of COVID-related losses given the ongoing uncertainty in this environment. As has been the case throughout the year, the majority of direct COVID losses that we've booked through year-end remains in IBNR.
Looking at the full year net impact of COVID costs and benefits, including the impact of premium refunds to policyholders, our consolidated underlying combined ratio benefited by about 1 point. The fourth quarter expense ratio of 29.4% brings the full year expense ratio to 29.9%. While throughout the year we continue to make the investments necessary to fuel our continued success, our ongoing focus on productivity and efficiency once again resulted in a sub-30% expense ratio despite the downward pressure on earned premiums from the impact of the soft economy on insured exposures and the premium refunds we issued to our personal auto customers. We continue to be comfortable with the consolidated expense ratio of around 30%.
After-tax net investment income improved by 9% from the prior year quarter to $572 million. The strong returns in the non-fixed income portfolio and a higher level of invested assets were partially offset by the expected decline in fixed income yields. Looking forward to 2021, we expect that after-tax fixed income NII, including earnings from short-term securities, will be between $420 million and $430 million per quarter as we project that the benefit of higher average levels of invested assets will be more than offset by a lower average yield on the portfolio given the lower interest rate environment.
Turning to reserves. Net favorable prior year reserve development occurred in all 3 segments and totaled $180 million pretax in the fourth quarter. In Business Insurance, net favorable PYD of $124 million was driven by better-than-expected loss experience in workers' comp, primarily from accident years 2017 and prior, partially offset by an increase to reserves related to very old years in our runoff book. In Bond & Specialty, net favorable PYD of $32 million resulted primarily from better-than-expected loss development in the surety book, and in Personal Insurance, net favorable PYD of $24 million was driven by the automobile line. When our combined 2020 Schedule P is filed early in the second quarter, the line of business analysis will provide more detail on the loss trends we've noted in our commentary throughout the year, with favorability in workers' comp, commercial property and the personal lines coverages and some strengthening in the commercial liability lines, much of which was in very old accident years relating to our runoff book.
Page 19 of the earnings presentation provides information about our January 1 cat treaty renewals. Our long-standing corporate cat XOL treaty renewed on terms in line with the expiring treaty and continues to provide coverage for both single cat events and the aggregation of losses from multiple cat events.
Regarding the underlying property aggregate catastrophe XOL treaty we first purchased for 2019, we have renewed the treaty again for 2021. While the treaty will continue to address qualifying PCS-designated events in North America for which we incur losses of $5 million or more, the 2021 renewal includes a $5 million deductible per event. In prior years, PCS-designated events that cost us more than $5 million counted towards the treaty from dollar one. The treaty provides aggregate coverage of $350 million, part of $500 million of losses above our aggregate retention of $1.9 billion. The aggregate retention for 2021 increased from 2020's $1.55 billion, largely reflecting recent years' experience and anticipated growth in our property book. Hurricane and earthquake events once again have a $250 million per occurrence cap. And for 2021, wildfires are also capped at $250 million per event.
Incorporating our assumptions about cat and non-cat weather for 2021, we expect the full year impact of the treaty on our underlying combined ratio to be roughly 0.5 point, and we anticipate only a minimal impact on the total combined ratio. Both of those impacts are consistent with the assumptions we had in each of the past 2 years.
Turning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of $1.9 billion were again very strong. All our capital ratios were at or better than target levels. And we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.7 billion. For the full year, operating cash flow exceeded $6 billion for the first time ever and reflected the benefit of continued increases in premium volume, subrogation recoveries from PG&E related to the 2017 and 2018 California wildfires and lower overall claim payouts as courtroom and other settlement activity slowed throughout the year due to COVID-related shutdowns. Higher levels of cash flow give us the flexibility to continue to make important investments in our business, return excess capital to our shareholders and grow our investment portfolio.
Interest yields decreased modestly as credit spreads tightened during the fourth quarter. And accordingly, our net unrealized investment gain increased from $3.8 billion after tax as of September 30 to $4.1 billion after tax at year-end. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes unrealized investment gains and losses, was $99.54 at year-end, a 7% increase from a year ago.
We returned $419 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter, comprising dividends of $218 million and share repurchases of $201 million. For the year, we returned $1.5 billion of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Finally, on a financial modeling note, let me turn your attention to Slide 20 of the webcast presentation. As we enter 2021, we again thought it would be helpful to highlight the seasonality of our cat losses over the prior decade. As shown in the data, the second quarter has regularly and noticeably been our largest cat quarter. Cat losses in the second quarter have been about twice as much as any other quarter on average, and the second quarter has been our largest cat quarter in 7 of the past 10 years. To wrap it up, we are very pleased with the quarter and full year results, especially given the challenging circumstances.
And now I'll turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of business insurance."
392856,698319970,2177991,"The Travelers Companies, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2021",2021-01-21,"Earnings Calls","The Travelers Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dan. For the fourth quarter, Business Insurance produced $713 million of segment income, an increase of almost 60% over the fourth quarter of 2019.

For the fourth quarter, Business Insurance produced $713 million of segment income, an increase of almost 60% over the fourth quarter of 2019. Higher net favorable prior year reserve development, underlying underwriting income and net investment income as well as lower cat losses all contributed to the favorable year-over-year increase.
We're pleased with the underlying combined ratio of 93.6%, which improved by 2.8 points from the prior year quarter. We benefited again from earned pricing that exceeded loss trend, with an impact this quarter of a little more than 1.5 points. There is also 1.5 points of improvement due to the favorable comparison to the fourth quarter of 2019, which was elevated due to the reestimation of losses for prior quarters.
Turning to the top line. In light of the ongoing macroeconomic challenges, we remain pleased with the resilience of our business. Net written premiums were only slightly lower than the prior year quarter, with strong rate and high retentions, mostly offsetting modestly lower levels of insured exposures as well as lower new business. The lower insured exposures reflect lower levels of economic activity as well as impacts from our active management of terms and conditions and deal structures, including deductibles, attachment points and limits.
Turning to domestic production. We achieved a record renewal rate change of 8.4%, up almost 4 points from the fourth quarter of last year, while retention remained high at 83%. This quarter marks the eighth consecutive quarter in which renewal rate change was higher than the corresponding prior year quarter. We continue to achieve higher rate levels broadly across our book as rate increases in all lines other than workers' compensation were meaningfully higher during the quarter as compared to the prior year. Importantly, we continue to feel great about our deliberate and granular execution in terms of rate and retention on an account-by-account and class-by-class basis. The segmentation beneath the headline numbers was once again excellent.
Also, one other thing that's not apparent in the headline numbers is the contribution to margins from the active management of terms, conditions and deal structure that I mentioned a minute ago. We're doing this broadly across the book but most mainly in our national property business. The tighter terms tend to persist beyond the rate cycle.
New business of $440 million was down $35 million from the prior year quarter. Given the lower levels of economic activity and given the hardening market conditions, there's a higher proportion of distressed business in the market. Our new business production reflects our disciplined approach to that business. Risk selection is particularly important during circumstances like these.
As for the individual businesses, in Select, renewal rate change increased to 4.2%, up more than 2 points from the fourth quarter of 2019 and more than 1 point from the third quarter of this year. Retention of 77% was down from recent periods, a result of deliberate execution as we pursue improved returns in certain segments of the business.
As I mentioned above, we're pleased with the segmented execution underneath the aggregate result. Importantly, we have not slowed down on our commitment to invest in product development and ease of doing business, which positions us well for long-term profitable growth in this business.
In Middle Market, renewal rate change increased to 9.1%, while retention remained strong at 86%. Renewal rate change was up 4.5 points from the fourth quarter of 2019 and almost 1 point from the third quarter of this year. Additionally, we achieved positive rate on more than 80% of our accounts this quarter, a more than 10-point increase from the fourth quarter of last year.
To sum up, we feel terrific about our results and execution, especially given some of the unusual economic challenges related to the pandemic. We continue to improve the profitability of the book while investing strategically for the future. These investments include enhancing the experiences for our customers and distribution partners, developing new insights for our underwriters, digitizing the underwriting transaction and creating efficiencies.
Examples of capabilities released this year include: rollout of our completely redesigned BOP 2.0 small commercial product, which includes industry-leading segmentation and a fast, easy quoting experience, this new product is now available in 23 states and performing consistently with our expectations; advancement of our industry-leading strategic work intake initiatives, which allow for automated receipt of submissions from the various technology solutions our agent partner views and the seamless routing of those submissions, which improves the experience for our distribution partners and is more efficient for us; enhancing our MyTravelers customer self-service application; and lastly, our Simply Business and Zensurance platforms continue to advance their digital capabilities and offerings in the alternative platform space. We're as confident as ever that strategic investments like these, together with our meaningful competitive advantages, position us well for long-term profitable growth.
Concluding, I would like to acknowledge and thank our employees, agents and brokers for their partnership as we seamlessly delivered virtual solutions for the benefit of our combined customers.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom."

Bond & Specialty delivered strong returns and double-digit growth in the quarter despite the ongoing headwinds of COVID-19. Segment income was $164 million, nearly flat with the prior year quarter as the benefit of higher business volumes and a higher level of net favorable prior year reserve development were offset by an underlying combined ratio, which, while still strong at 85%, was higher than the prior year quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 3.7 points, driven by the impact of higher loss estimates for management and liability coverages, primarily losses attributable to COVID-19-related economic conditions. As we discussed last quarter, the products that we write in this segment are susceptible to elevated loss levels in times of severe economic downturn. We experienced that during the financial crisis and again, in recent quarters due to the impacts of the pandemic. Nonetheless, with the strong rate levels we're achieving, we expect that the underlying combined ratio in 2021 will improve a little bit from the roughly 87% in the second half of 2020.
Turning to top line. Net written premiums grew an outstanding 12% in the quarter, reflecting continued improved pricing in our management liability business, with nearly flat surety production despite the continued economic impact of COVID-19 on public project procurement and related bond demand.
In our domestic management liability business, we're pleased that renewal premium change increased to a record 10.9%, driven by record high renewal rate change, while retention of 89% remained near historical highs. These production results demonstrate the successful execution of our strategy to pursue rate in light of elevated loss activity while maintaining strong retention levels in our high-quality portfolio. We will continue to pursue rate increases where warranted.
Domestic management liability new business for the quarter increased $13 million primarily reflecting our thoughtful underwriting in this elevated risk environment. Consistent with last quarter, submissions are up, while quote activity is down.
So Bond & Specialty results were again strong despite the challenges brought on by COVID-19. Beyond the numbers, notwithstanding our focus on managing through the challenging environment, we continue to invest in differentiating our businesses in the eyes of our customers and agents and broker partners while positioning ourselves for continued profitability and competitiveness in the future. Some highlights from 2020 include: continuing investments in our surety business to help our contractor clients more effectively manage risk while providing insights that will enable them to more profitably manage their business; piloting digital platforms that will improve the speed and convenience of accessing management liability and small surety products for our agents and brokers; and investing in a new sales management platform that will enhance productivity, optimize workflow management and increase sales. Lastly, I'd like to thank our employees and distribution partners for their commitment to creatively and effectively addressing the needs of our customers in these most unusual times.
And now I'll turn it over to Michael to discuss Personal Insurance."

In Personal Insurance, we're very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results. For the fourth quarter, segment income increased to $457 million, and our combined ratio improved to 84.1%. Full year segment",755,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. In Personal Insurance, we're very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results. For the fourth quarter, segment income increased to $457 million, and our combined ratio improved to 84.1%. Full year segment income was $1.2 billion, and the combined ratio was 89.7%. The significant improvement for both periods compared to the prior year is primarily driven by lower frequency of automobile losses as well as the benefit to underwriting income from higher business volumes. In addition, the full year results include higher net favorable prior year reserve development and elevated catastrophe losses.
Net written premium growth for the fourth quarter and full year was 7% and 5%, respectively, with continued strong retention and higher levels of new business, resulting in record net written premiums of more than $11.3 billion for the year. Agency Automobile profitability was very strong with a combined ratio of 86.5% for the fourth quarter. The underlying combined ratio for the quarter improved 12 points, continuing to reflect favorable frequency levels. Approximately 1/3 of the improvement in the quarter is from favorable reestimates of activity for prior quarters in 2020. We continue to observe lower claim frequency as a result of fewer miles driven, reflecting the ongoing impact from the pandemic. We will continue to analyze and incorporate current trends into our state-specific underwriting and pricing decisions as we balance business volumes and profitability.
In Agency Homeowners and Other, the fourth quarter combined ratio of 81.9% increased relative to the prior year quarter driven by a higher underlying combined ratio and an increase in catastrophe losses. The fourth quarter included 1 catastrophe, Hurricane Zeta, with no recoveries from the catastrophe aggregate reinsurance treaty. The underlying combined ratio of 78.5% was 5 points higher than the prior year quarter due to higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses and, to a lesser degree, increases in other losses, specifically elevated fire losses.
The full year combined ratio of 93% was comparable to the prior year, with increased favorable prior year reserve development and improved underlying results, offset by elevated catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio of 82.9% was almost 3 points better than last year driven by lower non-catastrophe weather-related losses. This improvement demonstrates the success of our continuing efforts to improve returns in property while growing the business.
Turning to quarterly production. Overall results were again very strong. We're pleased with our momentum in Agency Automobile. Retention was 84% and new business increased 12%, contributing to the 3% year-over-year growth in policies in force. Renewal premium changes were lower given our pricing actions in response to the favorable loss environment. We continue to see growth in this profitable line.
Agency Homeowners and Other delivered another excellent quarter, with retention of 85% and a 21% increase in new business, while renewal premium change again exceeded 8%. Policies in force were up 8% from a year ago. These results reflect our continued efforts to grow while improving profitability.
Looking back, 2020 was both a challenging and a successful year for Personal Insurance. We achieved record levels of segment income, net written premium and policies in force. Our continued success reflects the execution of our strategy to meet customers where they are, give them what they need and serve them how they want. Examples include: nearing completion of our Quantum Home 2.0 rollout, which is now available in over 40 states; increasing the take-up of IntelliDrive by enhancing our auto telematics offering in 17 states and just this week, we introduced IntelliDrive in Canada as well; improving our customer self-service capabilities with our new MyT mobile app, which will be rolled out more broadly throughout the first quarter of 2021; planting an additional 500,000 trees for customer enrollment and paperless billing, bringing the total number of trees planted, through our partnership with American Forests, to 1.5 million; and just recently, announcing the acquisition of InsuraMatch, an innovative digital online platform that allows customers to compare offerings from more than 40 carriers across the United States. We expect to complete the acquisition in the first quarter of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions.
Before I wrap up, I'd like to add my thanks to our team and our distribution partners for continuing to deliver value to our customers despite a challenging and uncertain environment. We have strong momentum going into 2021 and are well positioned to deliver profitable growth while investing in capabilities that will continue to enhance the value of our franchise.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Abbe."

Also on the historical numbers, the segmentation is really important and, I think, the point Greg made in his prepared remarks about the benefit of tightening terms and conditions and weathers, so all that's really important.
And from here, I think this plays out for a while, and it's a function of rate outputs. All the drivers are environmental, so primarily loss activity, think about social inflation, think about weathers, think about wildfires. You got interest rates that appear to be lower for longer, cost and availability of reinsurance, pandemic losses impacting the industry and, I suspect, for some markets, maybe still reckoning with social inflation. So I expect the favorable rate environment to continue and to persist at levels that will result in expanding margins for a while."

To the degree that, as Alan commented, we have experienced and been able to generate more top line growth in recent years than we had historically, the current COVID environment sort of notwithstanding, that's something that we look to do on a go-forward basis. And even this year, plus 3%, when you adjust for the Personal Insurance auto refunds that we made, the comments that we made a year or so ago would still hold true. I think to the degree that the top line grows, that's going to require us to hold more capital because everything that requires capital grows with it. Reserve balances grow, your investment portfolio grows.
And the only point we were really trying to make when we made those comments a year or so ago was don't think about us perpetually being able to return 100% of earnings in the form of dividends and buybacks. We're going to have to hold some of that for growth. So that would still be true. The amount by which we would have had to increase capital this year might be slightly less than we would have expected coming into the year because COVID had a little bit of a dampening effect on the top line.

Let me just give you a little bit of color on how we see or thinking about the workers' comp loss activity. So first of all, the COVID-related claim rate is relatively low relative to the infection rate and lower than we might have expected, and the severity on COVID-related workers' comp is also coming in a little better than we had thought. There is -- there continues to be some benefit from non-COVID-related frequency as people are working from home. But there still is, in our minds, a degree of uncertainty to your point about how COVID-related workers' comp claims are going to play out over time. So we've been pretty cautious in the way that we've been booking for workers' comp losses to make sure that we don't get surprised by that.
Now historically, putting COVID aside, historically, in a recession, you get sort of offsetting forces in workers' comp. You got people who want to stay on the job, so they're less inclined to go out, and so frequency is down a little bit. But severity goes up a little bit because once people go out, they tend to stay out longer on workers' comp.
Historically, for us, in recessionary periods, the net of those 2 things have been a little bit of a positive. I mean every circumstance is different and so hard to know for sure, but that's generally what we've seen in the past. And so I think that's sort of the landscape as we see it on workers' comp loss activity."

I'll jump in here on this one because on the exposure front, we've said, when exposure is positive, that a portion of exposure behaves like rate and therefore can be helpful to margins. It's not necessarily the case that when exposures are modestly negative as they are here that the same holds true on the inverse. Here, what you're seeing is generally lower levels of insured exposures, fewer employees, lower levels of cash register sales, things that drive GL-type exposure. Unless you actually got to the point where, say, there was a wage deflation and the price per risk was going down, you don't, at least at this point, have the same kind of adverse impact on margins from negative exposures that should do help to margins when exposures are running positive."

And what you could see is, sort of pre-COVID, that was -- the last 3 quarters pre-COVID had been $70 million or so of non-fixed income, and you see a big dip in the second quarter. And remember, at that time, we talked about that was the impact of the disruption to the equity markets that happened in the first quarter coming through our results on a lagging basis in Q2. And then as markets have come back, we've seen some of that rebound come through our numbers.
And so what you see in Q3 and Q4 are very strong results in a non-fixed income portfolio. But if you just look at that chart, you should get the sense that part of that is the bounce back from the big dip we saw in the second quarter, and so I wouldn't take that as indicative of a new run rate on the non-fixed income piece."

What do we expect to see for losses? Then as months and quarters go by, losses actually emerge. So it's a little bit of a moving target.
The variances have been significant. I wouldn't put a tremendous amount of stock and the difference of what came through the loss ratio in 1 quarter versus the next. I think, as Michael probably indicated and as you would not be surprised by on a go-forward basis, we wouldn't expect margins to continue to be that strong in auto, and you see that reflected in our pricing actions in the most recent quarters.
So I'd step back more and think about the year in aggregate, which has definitely had a benefit from the COVID environment. And recall that in response to that, we've also returned more than $200 million of premiums to policyholders. I don't know I can give you any more specific answer than that."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before I address our fourth quarter and full year results, a quick comment on current affairs.

Before I address our fourth quarter and full year results, a quick comment on current affairs. Yesterday, we witnessed the most American of events. The peaceful transfer of power from one democratically elected administration to the next. It's not a political statement but a patriotic one to say that we want to see this next administration succeed. We have significant challenges to overcome: a pandemic threatening the health and safety of our loved ones and neighbors; a distressed economy impairing the lives and livelihoods of millions; and a deeply divided society, which undermines our collective sense of security and well-being. Let's hope yesterday marks the beginning of our political leaders on both sides of the aisle, taking a constructive approach to addressing these challenges.
And with that, I'll turn to results. We're pleased to report a very strong finish to the year, with fourth quarter core income of $1.3 billion or $4.91 per diluted share and core return on equity of 20.5%, each up meaningfully from the prior year quarter. We're also pleased to report full year core income of $2.7 billion, generating core return on equity of 11.3%, a substantial margin over the risk-free rate and our cost of equity. Our ability to deliver these results in the face of a historic pandemic, a record high number of PCS catastrophe events and record low interest rates is a testament to the strength of our franchise, more specifically to our talented and committed workforce, the value of our hard-to-replicate, competitive advantages and our expertise in balancing risk and reward to achieve industry-leading returns over time.
The principal driver of the higher level of core income for the quarter was very strong underlying underwriting income, resulting from a record net earned premium of $7.5 billion and an underlying combined ratio that improved 3.4 points to an excellent 88.7%. We're pleased with the underwriting results in all 3 segments. We once again recorded a sub-30% consolidated expense ratio for the quarter and the full year, demonstrating that our strategic investments in improving productivity and efficiency continue to pay off.
Turning to investments. This quarter, our high-quality investment portfolio performed well, generating net investment income of $572 million after tax as the non-fixed income portfolio continued to recover from the pandemic-related impacts earlier in the year. Our operating results, together with our strong balance sheet, enabled us to grow adjusted book value per share by 7% during the year after returning $1.5 billion of excess capital to shareholders, including $672 million of share repurchases, which we resumed in the fourth quarter.
Turning to production. Notwithstanding the challenges in the economy, we continue to successfully execute on our marketplace strategies to generate growth in the top line. Net written premiums in the quarter grew by 3% driven by strong renewal rate change broadly across the book and continued strong retention in all 3 segments. Given the headwinds facing the industry, we expect the favorable pricing environment to continue for some time.
In Business Insurance, in our core Middle Market business, renewal rate change was a record 9.1%, up 4.5 points over the prior year and about 1 point sequentially, while retention remains strong. Segmentation in pricing is key in this business. And to that end, the quality of the execution underneath the headline production numbers was excellent.
In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net written premiums increased by 12% as renewal premium change in our domestic management liability business achieved a record 10.9%, driven by record renewal rate change, while retention remained strong.
In Personal Insurance, net written premiums increased by 7%, driven by stronger renewal premium change in our Agency Homeowners business and strong retention and new business in both Agency Auto and Agency Homeowners.
Fourth quarter production contributed to full year record net written premiums of almost $30 billion, up 2% compared to last year. Adjusting for the premium refund we offered to our Personal Insurance auto customers, net written premiums were up 3%, a strong top line result in the context of this year's difficult economic environment.
Taking a step back, let me direct your attention to Slide 18 of the webcast presentation and put this year's results into a broader context. I've shared before our belief that any commitment to delivering industry-leading return on equity over time requires a strategy to grow over time.
To that end, a few years ago, we laid out a strategy to achieve profitable growth in the context of the forces of change we have previously identified as impacting the industry. As you can see on the slide, despite the challenging economic and operating environment, 2020 was another successful year of the execution of that strategy. Since 2016, we have grown net written premiums at a 4.5% compound annual rate, substantially outpacing both GDP growth over the same period and our growth rate over the prior years in the decade. We accomplished that while maintaining a stable underlying underwriting margin. In other words, we haven't grown by underpricing the product or changing our risk profile. The growth has come organically from customer segments, products, geographies and producers that we know well. Over that same period, through our ongoing and relentless focus on optimizing productivity and efficiency, we've also improved our expense ratio by about 2 points compared to the run rate from earlier in the decade. As you can also see on the slide, the result of all that is significantly higher underlying underwriting income, meaningfully higher cash flow from operations and double-digit growth in invested assets.
Those results have contributed to our ultimate objective of creating shareholder value through industry-leading return on equity over time. Our core return on equity has increased in each of the last 3 years and averaged 11% over that period. And that 11% is after bearing the impacts of significant cat and non-cat weather activity, a meaningful increase in social inflation, historically low interest rates and the global pandemic. In short, our performance this year and over recent years is the result of a sound strategy and the successful achievement of our strategic objectives. Looking forward from here, thanks to our team, our strategy, our capabilities and our strong track record of innovation and execution, we feel very well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities ahead as the economy continues to recover and beyond.
Before I turn the call over to Dan, I want to acknowledge and thank my 30,000 colleagues, many of whom are listening this morning, for their tireless efforts over this past year. Notwithstanding concerns for their own safety and responsibilities for taking care of loved ones and educating their children, they never waver from our purpose of taking care of the people with privilege to serve or our mission of creating shareholder value. I couldn't be more proud of this team.
I also want to acknowledge and thank all those who have been involved in the extraordinary effort of developing and manufacturing COVID vaccines in record time. From the scientists to the regulators, to those who volunteer to participate in trials, it's a remarkable feat. The sight of those vaccines rolling off the line inspires optimism for the coming year, and the sheer human will and ingenuity behind the effort inspire hope for the future.
And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan."

Core income for the fourth quarter was $1.2.62 billion (sic) [ $1.262 billion, ] up from $867 million in the prior year quarter, and core ROE was 20.5%, up from 14.8%.

Core income for the fourth quarter was $1.2.62 billion (sic) [ $1.262 billion, ] up from $867 million in the prior year quarter, and core ROE was 20.5%, up from 14.8%. The improvement in both measures was the result of very strong underlying underwriting results. Our fourth quarter results include $29 million of pretax cat losses compared to $85 million of pretax cat losses in last year's fourth quarter. Recall that last year's fourth quarter cat losses included a $101 million benefit from recoveries under the underlying aggregate cat treaty, whereas in 2020, we exhausted the cat treaty in the third quarter, so there were no recoveries under the treaty in this year's fourth quarter. This quarter's cat results include about $40 million of favorable development in our loss estimates for events that occurred earlier in the year.
PYD in the current quarter, for which I'll provide more detail shortly, was net favorable $180 million pretax. The underlying combined ratio of 88.7%, which excludes the impacts of cats and PYD, improved by 3.4 points from the prior year quarter. Our pretax underlying underwriting gain of $804 million increased by nearly 50% over the prior year quarter, reflecting the benefit of higher levels of earned premium and higher margins, driven by earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trend and continued favorability in personal auto loss experience.
For the quarter, losses directly related to COVID-19 totaled a modest $31 million pretax, split about evenly between Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance. More than offsetting those losses were lower levels of auto claims in both Personal Insurance and Business Insurance.
The net impact of the COVID environment on the consolidated underlying combined ratio amounted to a benefit of about 2.5 points, mostly in Personal Insurance. We continue to take a cautious approach in estimating the net impact of COVID-related losses given the ongoing uncertainty in this environment. As has been the case throughout the year, the majority of direct COVID losses that we've booked through year-end remains in IBNR.
Looking at the full year net impact of COVID costs and benefits, including the impact of premium refunds to policyholders, our consolidated underlying combined ratio benefited by about 1 point. The fourth quarter expense ratio of 29.4% brings the full year expense ratio to 29.9%. While throughout the year we continue to make the investments necessary to fuel our continued success, our ongoing focus on productivity and efficiency once again resulted in a sub-30% expense ratio despite the downward pressure on earned premiums from the impact of the soft economy on insured exposures and the premium refunds we issued to our personal auto customers. We continue to be comfortable with the consolidated expense ratio of around 30%.
After-tax net investment income improved by 9% from the prior year quarter to $572 million. The strong returns in the non-fixed income portfolio and a higher level of invested assets were partially offset by the expected decline in fixed income yields. Looking forward to 2021, we expect that after-tax fixed income NII, including earnings from short-term securities, will be between $420 million and $430 million per quarter as we project that the benefit of higher average levels of invested assets will be more than offset by a lower average yield on the portfolio given the lower interest rate environment.
Turning to reserves. Net favorable prior year reserve development occurred in all 3 segments and totaled $180 million pretax in the fourth quarter. In Business Insurance, net favorable PYD of $124 million was driven by better-than-expected loss experience in workers' comp, primarily from accident years 2017 and prior, partially offset by an increase to reserves related to very old years in our runoff book. In Bond & Specialty, net favorable PYD of $32 million resulted primarily from better-than-expected loss development in the surety book, and in Personal Insurance, net favorable PYD of $24 million was driven by the automobile line. When our combined 2020 Schedule P is filed early in the second quarter, the line of business analysis will provide more detail on the loss trends we've noted in our commentary throughout the year, with favorability in workers' comp, commercial property and the personal lines coverages and some strengthening in the commercial liability lines, much of which was in very old accident years relating to our runoff book.
Page 19 of the earnings presentation provides information about our January 1 cat treaty renewals. Our long-standing corporate cat XOL treaty renewed on terms in line with the expiring treaty and continues to provide coverage for both single cat events and the aggregation of losses from multiple cat events.
Regarding the underlying property aggregate catastrophe XOL treaty we first purchased for 2019, we have renewed the treaty again for 2021. While the treaty will continue to address qualifying PCS-designated events in North America for which we incur losses of $5 million or more, the 2021 renewal includes a $5 million deductible per event. In prior years, PCS-designated events that cost us more than $5 million counted towards the treaty from dollar one. The treaty provides aggregate coverage of $350 million, part of $500 million of losses above our aggregate retention of $1.9 billion. The aggregate retention for 2021 increased from 2020's $1.55 billion, largely reflecting recent years' experience and anticipated growth in our property book. Hurricane and earthquake events once again have a $250 million per occurrence cap. And for 2021, wildfires are also capped at $250 million per event.
Incorporating our assumptions about cat and non-cat weather for 2021, we expect the full year impact of the treaty on our underlying combined ratio to be roughly 0.5 point, and we anticipate only a minimal impact on the total combined ratio. Both of those impacts are consistent with the assumptions we had in each of the past 2 years.
Turning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of $1.9 billion were again very strong. All our capital ratios were at or better than target levels. And we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.7 billion. For the full year, operating cash flow exceeded $6 billion for the first time ever and reflected the benefit of continued increases in premium volume, subrogation recoveries from PG&E related to the 2017 and 2018 California wildfires and lower overall claim payouts as courtroom and other settlement activity slowed throughout the year due to COVID-related shutdowns. Higher levels of cash flow give us the flexibility to continue to make important investments in our business, return excess capital to our shareholders and grow our investment portfolio.
Interest yields decreased modestly as credit spreads tightened during the fourth quarter. And accordingly, our net unrealized investment gain increased from $3.8 billion after tax as of September 30 to $4.1 billion after tax at year-end. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes unrealized investment gains and losses, was $99.54 at year-end, a 7% increase from a year ago.
We returned $419 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter, comprising dividends of $218 million and share repurchases of $201 million. For the year, we returned $1.5 billion of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Finally, on a financial modeling note, let me turn your attention to Slide 20 of the webcast presentation. As we enter 2021, we again thought it would be helpful to highlight the seasonality of our cat losses over the prior decade. As shown in the data, the second quarter has regularly and noticeably been our largest cat quarter. Cat losses in the second quarter have been about twice as much as any other quarter on average, and the second quarter has been our largest cat quarter in 7 of the past 10 years. To wrap it up, we are very pleased with the quarter and full year results, especially given the challenging circumstances.
And now I'll turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of business insurance."
392856,698319970,2250511,"The Travelers Companies, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2021",2021-01-21,"Earnings Calls","The Travelers Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dan. For the fourth quarter, Business Insurance produced $713 million of segment income, an increase of almost 60% over the fourth quarter of 2019.

For the fourth quarter, Business Insurance produced $713 million of segment income, an increase of almost 60% over the fourth quarter of 2019. Higher net favorable prior year reserve development, underlying underwriting income and net investment income as well as lower cat losses all contributed to the favorable year-over-year increase.
We're pleased with the underlying combined ratio of 93.6%, which improved by 2.8 points from the prior year quarter. We benefited again from earned pricing that exceeded loss trend, with an impact this quarter of a little more than 1.5 points. There is also 1.5 points of improvement due to the favorable comparison to the fourth quarter of 2019, which was elevated due to the reestimation of losses for prior quarters.
Turning to the top line. In light of the ongoing macroeconomic challenges, we remain pleased with the resilience of our business. Net written premiums were only slightly lower than the prior year quarter, with strong rate and high retentions, mostly offsetting modestly lower levels of insured exposures as well as lower new business. The lower insured exposures reflect lower levels of economic activity as well as impacts from our active management of terms and conditions and deal structures, including deductibles, attachment points and limits.
Turning to domestic production. We achieved a record renewal rate change of 8.4%, up almost 4 points from the fourth quarter of last year, while retention remained high at 83%. This quarter marks the eighth consecutive quarter in which renewal rate change was higher than the corresponding prior year quarter. We continue to achieve higher rate levels broadly across our book as rate increases in all lines other than workers' compensation were meaningfully higher during the quarter as compared to the prior year. Importantly, we continue to feel great about our deliberate and granular execution in terms of rate and retention on an account-by-account and class-by-class basis. The segmentation beneath the headline numbers was once again excellent.
Also, one other thing that's not apparent in the headline numbers is the contribution to margins from the active management of terms, conditions and deal structure that I mentioned a minute ago. We're doing this broadly across the book but most mainly in our national property business. The tighter terms tend to persist beyond the rate cycle.
New business of $440 million was down $35 million from the prior year quarter. Given the lower levels of economic activity and given the hardening market conditions, there's a higher proportion of distressed business in the market. Our new business production reflects our disciplined approach to that business. Risk selection is particularly important during circumstances like these.
As for the individual businesses, in Select, renewal rate change increased to 4.2%, up more than 2 points from the fourth quarter of 2019 and more than 1 point from the third quarter of this year. Retention of 77% was down from recent periods, a result of deliberate execution as we pursue improved returns in certain segments of the business.
As I mentioned above, we're pleased with the segmented execution underneath the aggregate result. Importantly, we have not slowed down on our commitment to invest in product development and ease of doing business, which positions us well for long-term profitable growth in this business.
In Middle Market, renewal rate change increased to 9.1%, while retention remained strong at 86%. Renewal rate change was up 4.5 points from the fourth quarter of 2019 and almost 1 point from the third quarter of this year. Additionally, we achieved positive rate on more than 80% of our accounts this quarter, a more than 10-point increase from the fourth quarter of last year.
To sum up, we feel terrific about our results and execution, especially given some of the unusual economic challenges related to the pandemic. We continue to improve the profitability of the book while investing strategically for the future. These investments include enhancing the experiences for our customers and distribution partners, developing new insights for our underwriters, digitizing the underwriting transaction and creating efficiencies.
Examples of capabilities released this year include: rollout of our completely redesigned BOP 2.0 small commercial product, which includes industry-leading segmentation and a fast, easy quoting experience, this new product is now available in 23 states and performing consistently with our expectations; advancement of our industry-leading strategic work intake initiatives, which allow for automated receipt of submissions from the various technology solutions our agent partner views and the seamless routing of those submissions, which improves the experience for our distribution partners and is more efficient for us; enhancing our MyTravelers customer self-service application; and lastly, our Simply Business and Zensurance platforms continue to advance their digital capabilities and offerings in the alternative platform space. We're as confident as ever that strategic investments like these, together with our meaningful competitive advantages, position us well for long-term profitable growth.
Concluding, I would like to acknowledge and thank our employees, agents and brokers for their partnership as we seamlessly delivered virtual solutions for the benefit of our combined customers.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom."

Bond & Specialty delivered strong returns and double-digit growth in the quarter despite the ongoing headwinds of COVID-19. Segment income was $164 million, nearly flat with the prior year quarter as the benefit of higher business volumes and a higher level of net favorable prior year reserve development were offset by an underlying combined ratio, which, while still strong at 85%, was higher than the prior year quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 3.7 points, driven by the impact of higher loss estimates for management and liability coverages, primarily losses attributable to COVID-19-related economic conditions. As we discussed last quarter, the products that we write in this segment are susceptible to elevated loss levels in times of severe economic downturn. We experienced that during the financial crisis and again, in recent quarters due to the impacts of the pandemic. Nonetheless, with the strong rate levels we're achieving, we expect that the underlying combined ratio in 2021 will improve a little bit from the roughly 87% in the second half of 2020.
Turning to top line. Net written premiums grew an outstanding 12% in the quarter, reflecting continued improved pricing in our management liability business, with nearly flat surety production despite the continued economic impact of COVID-19 on public project procurement and related bond demand.
In our domestic management liability business, we're pleased that renewal premium change increased to a record 10.9%, driven by record high renewal rate change, while retention of 89% remained near historical highs. These production results demonstrate the successful execution of our strategy to pursue rate in light of elevated loss activity while maintaining strong retention levels in our high-quality portfolio. We will continue to pursue rate increases where warranted.
Domestic management liability new business for the quarter increased $13 million primarily reflecting our thoughtful underwriting in this elevated risk environment. Consistent with last quarter, submissions are up, while quote activity is down.
So Bond & Specialty results were again strong despite the challenges brought on by COVID-19. Beyond the numbers, notwithstanding our focus on managing through the challenging environment, we continue to invest in differentiating our businesses in the eyes of our customers and agents and broker partners while positioning ourselves for continued profitability and competitiveness in the future. Some highlights from 2020 include: continuing investments in our surety business to help our contractor clients more effectively manage risk while providing insights that will enable them to more profitably manage their business; piloting digital platforms that will improve the speed and convenience of accessing management liability and small surety products for our agents and brokers; and investing in a new sales management platform that will enhance productivity, optimize workflow management and increase sales. Lastly, I'd like to thank our employees and distribution partners for their commitment to creatively and effectively addressing the needs of our customers in these most unusual times.
And now I'll turn it over to Michael to discuss Personal Insurance."
392856,698319970,2250511,"The Travelers Companies, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2021",2021-01-21,"Earnings Calls","The Travelers Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. In Personal Insurance, we're very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results. For the fourth quarter, segment income increased to $457 million, and our combined ratio improved to 84.1%. Full year segment",755,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. In Personal Insurance, we're very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results. For the fourth quarter, segment income increased to $457 million, and our combined ratio improved to 84.1%. Full year segment income was $1.2 billion, and the combined ratio was 89.7%. The significant improvement for both periods compared to the prior year is primarily driven by lower frequency of automobile losses as well as the benefit to underwriting income from higher business volumes. In addition, the full year results include higher net favorable prior year reserve development and elevated catastrophe losses.
Net written premium growth for the fourth quarter and full year was 7% and 5%, respectively, with continued strong retention and higher levels of new business, resulting in record net written premiums of more than $11.3 billion for the year. Agency Automobile profitability was very strong with a combined ratio of 86.5% for the fourth quarter. The underlying combined ratio for the quarter improved 12 points, continuing to reflect favorable frequency levels. Approximately 1/3 of the improvement in the quarter is from favorable reestimates of activity for prior quarters in 2020. We continue to observe lower claim frequency as a result of fewer miles driven, reflecting the ongoing impact from the pandemic. We will continue to analyze and incorporate current trends into our state-specific underwriting and pricing decisions as we balance business volumes and profitability.
In Agency Homeowners and Other, the fourth quarter combined ratio of 81.9% increased relative to the prior year quarter driven by a higher underlying combined ratio and an increase in catastrophe losses. The fourth quarter included 1 catastrophe, Hurricane Zeta, with no recoveries from the catastrophe aggregate reinsurance treaty. The underlying combined ratio of 78.5% was 5 points higher than the prior year quarter due to higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses and, to a lesser degree, increases in other losses, specifically elevated fire losses.
The full year combined ratio of 93% was comparable to the prior year, with increased favorable prior year reserve development and improved underlying results, offset by elevated catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio of 82.9% was almost 3 points better than last year driven by lower non-catastrophe weather-related losses. This improvement demonstrates the success of our continuing efforts to improve returns in property while growing the business.
Turning to quarterly production. Overall results were again very strong. We're pleased with our momentum in Agency Automobile. Retention was 84% and new business increased 12%, contributing to the 3% year-over-year growth in policies in force. Renewal premium changes were lower given our pricing actions in response to the favorable loss environment. We continue to see growth in this profitable line.
Agency Homeowners and Other delivered another excellent quarter, with retention of 85% and a 21% increase in new business, while renewal premium change again exceeded 8%. Policies in force were up 8% from a year ago. These results reflect our continued efforts to grow while improving profitability.
Looking back, 2020 was both a challenging and a successful year for Personal Insurance. We achieved record levels of segment income, net written premium and policies in force. Our continued success reflects the execution of our strategy to meet customers where they are, give them what they need and serve them how they want. Examples include: nearing completion of our Quantum Home 2.0 rollout, which is now available in over 40 states; increasing the take-up of IntelliDrive by enhancing our auto telematics offering in 17 states and just this week, we introduced IntelliDrive in Canada as well; improving our customer self-service capabilities with our new MyT mobile app, which will be rolled out more broadly throughout the first quarter of 2021; planting an additional 500,000 trees for customer enrollment and paperless billing, bringing the total number of trees planted, through our partnership with American Forests, to 1.5 million; and just recently, announcing the acquisition of InsuraMatch, an innovative digital online platform that allows customers to compare offerings from more than 40 carriers across the United States. We expect to complete the acquisition in the first quarter of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions.
Before I wrap up, I'd like to add my thanks to our team and our distribution partners for continuing to deliver value to our customers despite a challenging and uncertain environment. We have strong momentum going into 2021 and are well positioned to deliver profitable growth while investing in capabilities that will continue to enhance the value of our franchise.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Abbe."

And from here, the outlook is positive. Also on the historical numbers, the segmentation is really important and, I think, the point Greg made in his prepared remarks about the benefit of tightening terms and conditions and weathers, so all that's really important.
And from here, I think this plays out for a while, and it's a function of rate outputs. All the drivers are environmental, so primarily loss activity, think about social inflation, think about weathers, think about wildfires. You got interest rates that appear to be lower for longer, cost and availability of reinsurance, pandemic losses impacting the industry and, I suspect, for some markets, maybe still reckoning with social inflation. So I expect the favorable rate environment to continue and to persist at levels that will result in expanding margins for a while."

I think to your second point, we are looking at the data as it comes in now and not assuming that, that's the new normal. We assume that what we're seeing is slower levels of claim payments that won't necessarily ultimately be lower levels of claim payments. So we've stuck with our more normal long-term view that we think those loss costs are higher. But having said that, where rates are now, we think rates had a loss trend."

And even this year, plus 3%, when you adjust for the Personal Insurance auto refunds that we made, the comments that we made a year or so ago would still hold true. I think to the degree that the top line grows, that's going to require us to hold more capital because everything that requires capital grows with it. Reserve balances grow, your investment portfolio grows.
And the only point we were really trying to make when we made those comments a year or so ago was don't think about us perpetually being able to return 100% of earnings in the form of dividends and buybacks. We're going to have to hold some of that for growth. So that would still be true.

Let me just give you a little bit of color on how we see or thinking about the workers' comp loss activity. So first of all, the COVID-related claim rate is relatively low relative to the infection rate and lower than we might have expected, and the severity on COVID-related workers' comp is also coming in a little better than we had thought. There is -- there continues to be some benefit from non-COVID-related frequency as people are working from home. But there still is, in our minds, a degree of uncertainty to your point about how COVID-related workers' comp claims are going to play out over time. So we've been pretty cautious in the way that we've been booking for workers' comp losses to make sure that we don't get surprised by that.
Now historically, putting COVID aside, historically, in a recession, you get sort of offsetting forces in workers' comp. You got people who want to stay on the job, so they're less inclined to go out, and so frequency is down a little bit. But severity goes up a little bit because once people go out, they tend to stay out longer on workers' comp.
Historically, for us, in recessionary periods, the net of those 2 things have been a little bit of a positive. I mean every circumstance is different and so hard to know for sure, but that's generally what we've seen in the past.

I just think, given the way things have played out, that's probably likely to happen. But there are a couple of things that still help. One, there have been a number of states, I think, more than 30 states that, in one form or another, have taken some kind of action to provide some COVID liability protection. At the federal level, we've got a more right-leaning bench today than we did 4 years ago certainly, so that helps a little bit. And then we can address it through things like rate and risk control and risk selection. And as I mentioned before, in some industry classes, we have started to put in communicable disease exclusions where we think that could be important.
So we're -- it's an exposure. It's out there. I think it's unfortunate because I think it's the plaintiffs' bar that benefits at the expense of economic recovery, but we'll manage through it just fine."

So mix will contribute, as you suggest, right? To the degree that there are different loss ratios and different parts of the book are growing at different paces, that's going to have an impact.
I'll jump in here on this one because on the exposure front, we've said, when exposure is positive, that a portion of exposure behaves like rate and therefore can be helpful to margins. It's not necessarily the case that when exposures are modestly negative as they are here that the same holds true on the inverse. Here, what you're seeing is generally lower levels of insured exposures, fewer employees, lower levels of cash register sales, things that drive GL-type exposure. Unless you actually got to the point where, say, there was a wage deflation and the price per risk was going down, you don't, at least at this point, have the same kind of adverse impact on margins from negative exposures that should do help to margins when exposures are running positive."

So we gave you some outlook in terms of what we think the run rate looks like for the fixed income portfolio. The variability that we've seen in the last 3 quarters has really been in the non-fixed income portfolio. And so if you look at the bottom right-hand quadrant of that chart, it shows non-fixed income over the last 8 quarters or so. And what you could see is, sort of pre-COVID, that was -- the last 3 quarters pre-COVID had been $70 million or so of non-fixed income, and you see a big dip in the second quarter. And remember, at that time, we talked about that was the impact of the disruption to the equity markets that happened in the first quarter coming through our results on a lagging basis in Q2. And then as markets have come back, we've seen some of that rebound come through our numbers.
And so what you see in Q3 and Q4 are very strong results in a non-fixed income portfolio. But if you just look at that chart, you should get the sense that part of that is the bounce back from the big dip we saw in the second quarter, and so I wouldn't take that as indicative of a new run rate on the non-fixed income piece."

What do we expect to see for losses? Then as months and quarters go by, losses actually emerge. So it's a little bit of a moving target.
The variances have been significant. I wouldn't put a tremendous amount of stock and the difference of what came through the loss ratio in 1 quarter versus the next. I think, as Michael probably indicated and as you would not be surprised by on a go-forward basis, we wouldn't expect margins to continue to be that strong in auto, and you see that reflected in our pricing actions in the most recent quarters.
So I'd step back more and think about the year in aggregate, which has definitely had a benefit from the COVID environment. And recall that in response to that, we've also returned more than $200 million of premiums to policyholders. I don't know I can give you any more specific answer than that."

It's not a political statement but a patriotic one to say that we want to see this next administration succeed. We have significant challenges to overcome: a pandemic threatening the health and safety of our loved ones and neighbors; a distressed economy impairing the lives and livelihoods of millions; and a deeply divided society, which undermines our collective sense of security and well-being. Let's hope yesterday marks the beginning of our political leaders on both sides of the aisle, taking a constructive approach to addressing these challenges.
And with that, I'll turn to results. We're pleased to report a very strong finish to the year, with fourth quarter core income of $1.3 billion or $4.91 per diluted share and core return on equity of 20.5%, each up meaningfully from the prior year quarter. We're also pleased to report full year core income of $2.7 billion, generating core return on equity of 11.3%, a substantial margin over the risk-free rate and our cost of equity. Our ability to deliver these results in the face of a historic pandemic, a record high number of PCS catastrophe events and record low interest rates is a testament to the strength of our franchise, more specifically to our talented and committed workforce, the value of our hard-to-replicate, competitive advantages and our expertise in balancing risk and reward to achieve industry-leading returns over time.
The principal driver of the higher level of core income for the quarter was very strong underlying underwriting income, resulting from a record net earned premium of $7.5 billion and an underlying combined ratio that improved 3.4 points to an excellent 88.7%. We're pleased with the underwriting results in all 3 segments. We once again recorded a sub-30% consolidated expense ratio for the quarter and the full year, demonstrating that our strategic investments in improving productivity and efficiency continue to pay off.
Turning to investments. This quarter, our high-quality investment portfolio performed well, generating net investment income of $572 million after tax as the non-fixed income portfolio continued to recover from the pandemic-related impacts earlier in the year. Our operating results, together with our strong balance sheet, enabled us to grow adjusted book value per share by 7% during the year after returning $1.5 billion of excess capital to shareholders, including $672 million of share repurchases, which we resumed in the fourth quarter.
Turning to production. Notwithstanding the challenges in the economy, we continue to successfully execute on our marketplace strategies to generate growth in the top line. Net written premiums in the quarter grew by 3% driven by strong renewal rate change broadly across the book and continued strong retention in all 3 segments. Given the headwinds facing the industry, we expect the favorable pricing environment to continue for some time.
In Business Insurance, in our core Middle Market business, renewal rate change was a record 9.1%, up 4.5 points over the prior year and about 1 point sequentially, while retention remains strong. Segmentation in pricing is key in this business. And to that end, the quality of the execution underneath the headline production numbers was excellent.
In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net written premiums increased by 12% as renewal premium change in our domestic management liability business achieved a record 10.9%, driven by record renewal rate change, while retention remained strong.
In Personal Insurance, net written premiums increased by 7%, driven by stronger renewal premium change in our Agency Homeowners business and strong retention and new business in both Agency Auto and Agency Homeowners.
Fourth quarter production contributed to full year record net written premiums of almost $30 billion, up 2% compared to last year. Adjusting for the premium refund we offered to our Personal Insurance auto customers, net written premiums were up 3%, a strong top line result in the context of this year's difficult economic environment.
Taking a step back, let me direct your attention to Slide 18 of the webcast presentation and put this year's results into a broader context. I've shared before our belief that any commitment to delivering industry-leading return on equity over time requires a strategy to grow over time.
To that end, a few years ago, we laid out a strategy to achieve profitable growth in the context of the forces of change we have previously identified as impacting the industry. As you can see on the slide, despite the challenging economic and operating environment, 2020 was another successful year of the execution of that strategy. Since 2016, we have grown net written premiums at a 4.5% compound annual rate, substantially outpacing both GDP growth over the same period and our growth rate over the prior years in the decade. We accomplished that while maintaining a stable underlying underwriting margin. In other words, we haven't grown by underpricing the product or changing our risk profile. The growth has come organically from customer segments, products, geographies and producers that we know well. Over that same period, through our ongoing and relentless focus on optimizing productivity and efficiency, we've also improved our expense ratio by about 2 points compared to the run rate from earlier in the decade. As you can also see on the slide, the result of all that is significantly higher underlying underwriting income, meaningfully higher cash flow from operations and double-digit growth in invested assets.
Those results have contributed to our ultimate objective of creating shareholder value through industry-leading return on equity over time. Our core return on equity has increased in each of the last 3 years and averaged 11% over that period. And that 11% is after bearing the impacts of significant cat and non-cat weather activity, a meaningful increase in social inflation, historically low interest rates and the global pandemic. In short, our performance this year and over recent years is the result of a sound strategy and the successful achievement of our strategic objectives. Looking forward from here, thanks to our team, our strategy, our capabilities and our strong track record of innovation and execution, we feel very well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities ahead as the economy continues to recover and beyond.
Before I turn the call over to Dan, I want to acknowledge and thank my 30,000 colleagues, many of whom are listening this morning, for their tireless efforts over this past year. Notwithstanding concerns for their own safety and responsibilities for taking care of loved ones and educating their children, they never waver from our purpose of taking care of the people with privilege to serve or our mission of creating shareholder value. I couldn't be more proud of this team.
I also want to acknowledge and thank all those who have been involved in the extraordinary effort of developing and manufacturing COVID vaccines in record time. From the scientists to the regulators, to those who volunteer to participate in trials, it's a remarkable feat. The sight of those vaccines rolling off the line inspires optimism for the coming year, and the sheer human will and ingenuity behind the effort inspire hope for the future.
And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan."

Core income for the fourth quarter was $1.2.62 billion (sic) [ $1.262 billion, ] up from $867 million in the prior year quarter, and core ROE was 20.5%, up from 14.8%.

Core income for the fourth quarter was $1.2.62 billion (sic) [ $1.262 billion, ] up from $867 million in the prior year quarter, and core ROE was 20.5%, up from 14.8%. The improvement in both measures was the result of very strong underlying underwriting results. Our fourth quarter results include $29 million of pretax cat losses compared to $85 million of pretax cat losses in last year's fourth quarter. Recall that last year's fourth quarter cat losses included a $101 million benefit from recoveries under the underlying aggregate cat treaty, whereas in 2020, we exhausted the cat treaty in the third quarter, so there were no recoveries under the treaty in this year's fourth quarter. This quarter's cat results include about $40 million of favorable development in our loss estimates for events that occurred earlier in the year.
PYD in the current quarter, for which I'll provide more detail shortly, was net favorable $180 million pretax. The underlying combined ratio of 88.7%, which excludes the impacts of cats and PYD, improved by 3.4 points from the prior year quarter. Our pretax underlying underwriting gain of $804 million increased by nearly 50% over the prior year quarter, reflecting the benefit of higher levels of earned premium and higher margins, driven by earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trend and continued favorability in personal auto loss experience.
For the quarter, losses directly related to COVID-19 totaled a modest $31 million pretax, split about evenly between Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance. More than offsetting those losses were lower levels of auto claims in both Personal Insurance and Business Insurance.
The net impact of the COVID environment on the consolidated underlying combined ratio amounted to a benefit of about 2.5 points, mostly in Personal Insurance. We continue to take a cautious approach in estimating the net impact of COVID-related losses given the ongoing uncertainty in this environment. As has been the case throughout the year, the majority of direct COVID losses that we've booked through year-end remains in IBNR.
Looking at the full year net impact of COVID costs and benefits, including the impact of premium refunds to policyholders, our consolidated underlying combined ratio benefited by about 1 point. The fourth quarter expense ratio of 29.4% brings the full year expense ratio to 29.9%. While throughout the year we continue to make the investments necessary to fuel our continued success, our ongoing focus on productivity and efficiency once again resulted in a sub-30% expense ratio despite the downward pressure on earned premiums from the impact of the soft economy on insured exposures and the premium refunds we issued to our personal auto customers. We continue to be comfortable with the consolidated expense ratio of around 30%.
After-tax net investment income improved by 9% from the prior year quarter to $572 million. The strong returns in the non-fixed income portfolio and a higher level of invested assets were partially offset by the expected decline in fixed income yields. Looking forward to 2021, we expect that after-tax fixed income NII, including earnings from short-term securities, will be between $420 million and $430 million per quarter as we project that the benefit of higher average levels of invested assets will be more than offset by a lower average yield on the portfolio given the lower interest rate environment.
Turning to reserves. Net favorable prior year reserve development occurred in all 3 segments and totaled $180 million pretax in the fourth quarter. In Business Insurance, net favorable PYD of $124 million was driven by better-than-expected loss experience in workers' comp, primarily from accident years 2017 and prior, partially offset by an increase to reserves related to very old years in our runoff book. In Bond & Specialty, net favorable PYD of $32 million resulted primarily from better-than-expected loss development in the surety book, and in Personal Insurance, net favorable PYD of $24 million was driven by the automobile line. When our combined 2020 Schedule P is filed early in the second quarter, the line of business analysis will provide more detail on the loss trends we've noted in our commentary throughout the year, with favorability in workers' comp, commercial property and the personal lines coverages and some strengthening in the commercial liability lines, much of which was in very old accident years relating to our runoff book.
Page 19 of the earnings presentation provides information about our January 1 cat treaty renewals. Our long-standing corporate cat XOL treaty renewed on terms in line with the expiring treaty and continues to provide coverage for both single cat events and the aggregation of losses from multiple cat events.
Regarding the underlying property aggregate catastrophe XOL treaty we first purchased for 2019, we have renewed the treaty again for 2021. While the treaty will continue to address qualifying PCS-designated events in North America for which we incur losses of $5 million or more, the 2021 renewal includes a $5 million deductible per event. In prior years, PCS-designated events that cost us more than $5 million counted towards the treaty from dollar one. The treaty provides aggregate coverage of $350 million, part of $500 million of losses above our aggregate retention of $1.9 billion. The aggregate retention for 2021 increased from 2020's $1.55 billion, largely reflecting recent years' experience and anticipated growth in our property book. Hurricane and earthquake events once again have a $250 million per occurrence cap. And for 2021, wildfires are also capped at $250 million per event.
Incorporating our assumptions about cat and non-cat weather for 2021, we expect the full year impact of the treaty on our underlying combined ratio to be roughly 0.5 point, and we anticipate only a minimal impact on the total combined ratio. Both of those impacts are consistent with the assumptions we had in each of the past 2 years.
Turning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of $1.9 billion were again very strong. All our capital ratios were at or better than target levels. And we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.7 billion. For the full year, operating cash flow exceeded $6 billion for the first time ever and reflected the benefit of continued increases in premium volume, subrogation recoveries from PG&E related to the 2017 and 2018 California wildfires and lower overall claim payouts as courtroom and other settlement activity slowed throughout the year due to COVID-related shutdowns. Higher levels of cash flow give us the flexibility to continue to make important investments in our business, return excess capital to our shareholders and grow our investment portfolio.
Interest yields decreased modestly as credit spreads tightened during the fourth quarter. And accordingly, our net unrealized investment gain increased from $3.8 billion after tax as of September 30 to $4.1 billion after tax at year-end. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes unrealized investment gains and losses, was $99.54 at year-end, a 7% increase from a year ago.
We returned $419 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter, comprising dividends of $218 million and share repurchases of $201 million. For the year, we returned $1.5 billion of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Finally, on a financial modeling note, let me turn your attention to Slide 20 of the webcast presentation. As we enter 2021, we again thought it would be helpful to highlight the seasonality of our cat losses over the prior decade. As shown in the data, the second quarter has regularly and noticeably been our largest cat quarter. Cat losses in the second quarter have been about twice as much as any other quarter on average, and the second quarter has been our largest cat quarter in 7 of the past 10 years. To wrap it up, we are very pleased with the quarter and full year results, especially given the challenging circumstances.
And now I'll turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of business insurance."
392856,698319970,2250512,"The Travelers Companies, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2021",2021-01-21,"Earnings Calls","The Travelers Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dan. For the fourth quarter, Business Insurance produced $713 million of segment income, an increase of almost 60% over the fourth quarter of 2019.

For the fourth quarter, Business Insurance produced $713 million of segment income, an increase of almost 60% over the fourth quarter of 2019. Higher net favorable prior year reserve development, underlying underwriting income and net investment income as well as lower cat losses all contributed to the favorable year-over-year increase.
We're pleased with the underlying combined ratio of 93.6%, which improved by 2.8 points from the prior year quarter. We benefited again from earned pricing that exceeded loss trend, with an impact this quarter of a little more than 1.5 points. There is also 1.5 points of improvement due to the favorable comparison to the fourth quarter of 2019, which was elevated due to the reestimation of losses for prior quarters.
Turning to the top line. In light of the ongoing macroeconomic challenges, we remain pleased with the resilience of our business. Net written premiums were only slightly lower than the prior year quarter, with strong rate and high retentions, mostly offsetting modestly lower levels of insured exposures as well as lower new business. The lower insured exposures reflect lower levels of economic activity as well as impacts from our active management of terms and conditions and deal structures, including deductibles, attachment points and limits.
Turning to domestic production. We achieved a record renewal rate change of 8.4%, up almost 4 points from the fourth quarter of last year, while retention remained high at 83%. This quarter marks the eighth consecutive quarter in which renewal rate change was higher than the corresponding prior year quarter. We continue to achieve higher rate levels broadly across our book as rate increases in all lines other than workers' compensation were meaningfully higher during the quarter as compared to the prior year. Importantly, we continue to feel great about our deliberate and granular execution in terms of rate and retention on an account-by-account and class-by-class basis. The segmentation beneath the headline numbers was once again excellent.
Also, one other thing that's not apparent in the headline numbers is the contribution to margins from the active management of terms, conditions and deal structure that I mentioned a minute ago. We're doing this broadly across the book but most mainly in our national property business. The tighter terms tend to persist beyond the rate cycle.
New business of $440 million was down $35 million from the prior year quarter. Given the lower levels of economic activity and given the hardening market conditions, there's a higher proportion of distressed business in the market. Our new business production reflects our disciplined approach to that business. Risk selection is particularly important during circumstances like these.
As for the individual businesses, in Select, renewal rate change increased to 4.2%, up more than 2 points from the fourth quarter of 2019 and more than 1 point from the third quarter of this year. Retention of 77% was down from recent periods, a result of deliberate execution as we pursue improved returns in certain segments of the business.
As I mentioned above, we're pleased with the segmented execution underneath the aggregate result. Importantly, we have not slowed down on our commitment to invest in product development and ease of doing business, which positions us well for long-term profitable growth in this business.
In Middle Market, renewal rate change increased to 9.1%, while retention remained strong at 86%. Renewal rate change was up 4.5 points from the fourth quarter of 2019 and almost 1 point from the third quarter of this year. Additionally, we achieved positive rate on more than 80% of our accounts this quarter, a more than 10-point increase from the fourth quarter of last year.
To sum up, we feel terrific about our results and execution, especially given some of the unusual economic challenges related to the pandemic. We continue to improve the profitability of the book while investing strategically for the future. These investments include enhancing the experiences for our customers and distribution partners, developing new insights for our underwriters, digitizing the underwriting transaction and creating efficiencies.
Examples of capabilities released this year include: rollout of our completely redesigned BOP 2.0 small commercial product, which includes industry-leading segmentation and a fast, easy quoting experience, this new product is now available in 23 states and performing consistently with our expectations; advancement of our industry-leading strategic work intake initiatives, which allow for automated receipt of submissions from the various technology solutions our agent partner views and the seamless routing of those submissions, which improves the experience for our distribution partners and is more efficient for us; enhancing our MyTravelers customer self-service application; and lastly, our Simply Business and Zensurance platforms continue to advance their digital capabilities and offerings in the alternative platform space. We're as confident as ever that strategic investments like these, together with our meaningful competitive advantages, position us well for long-term profitable growth.
Concluding, I would like to acknowledge and thank our employees, agents and brokers for their partnership as we seamlessly delivered virtual solutions for the benefit of our combined customers.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom."

Bond & Specialty delivered strong returns and double-digit growth in the quarter despite the ongoing headwinds of COVID-19. Segment income was $164 million, nearly flat with the prior year quarter as the benefit of higher business volumes and a higher level of net favorable prior year reserve development were offset by an underlying combined ratio, which, while still strong at 85%, was higher than the prior year quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 3.7 points, driven by the impact of higher loss estimates for management and liability coverages, primarily losses attributable to COVID-19-related economic conditions. As we discussed last quarter, the products that we write in this segment are susceptible to elevated loss levels in times of severe economic downturn. We experienced that during the financial crisis and again, in recent quarters due to the impacts of the pandemic. Nonetheless, with the strong rate levels we're achieving, we expect that the underlying combined ratio in 2021 will improve a little bit from the roughly 87% in the second half of 2020.
Turning to top line. Net written premiums grew an outstanding 12% in the quarter, reflecting continued improved pricing in our management liability business, with nearly flat surety production despite the continued economic impact of COVID-19 on public project procurement and related bond demand.
In our domestic management liability business, we're pleased that renewal premium change increased to a record 10.9%, driven by record high renewal rate change, while retention of 89% remained near historical highs. These production results demonstrate the successful execution of our strategy to pursue rate in light of elevated loss activity while maintaining strong retention levels in our high-quality portfolio. We will continue to pursue rate increases where warranted.
Domestic management liability new business for the quarter increased $13 million primarily reflecting our thoughtful underwriting in this elevated risk environment. Consistent with last quarter, submissions are up, while quote activity is down.
So Bond & Specialty results were again strong despite the challenges brought on by COVID-19. Beyond the numbers, notwithstanding our focus on managing through the challenging environment, we continue to invest in differentiating our businesses in the eyes of our customers and agents and broker partners while positioning ourselves for continued profitability and competitiveness in the future. Some highlights from 2020 include: continuing investments in our surety business to help our contractor clients more effectively manage risk while providing insights that will enable them to more profitably manage their business; piloting digital platforms that will improve the speed and convenience of accessing management liability and small surety products for our agents and brokers; and investing in a new sales management platform that will enhance productivity, optimize workflow management and increase sales. Lastly, I'd like to thank our employees and distribution partners for their commitment to creatively and effectively addressing the needs of our customers in these most unusual times.
And now I'll turn it over to Michael to discuss Personal Insurance."

In Personal Insurance, we're very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results. For the fourth quarter, segment income increased to $457 million, and our combined ratio improved to 84.1%. Full year segment",755,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. In Personal Insurance, we're very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results. For the fourth quarter, segment income increased to $457 million, and our combined ratio improved to 84.1%. Full year segment income was $1.2 billion, and the combined ratio was 89.7%. The significant improvement for both periods compared to the prior year is primarily driven by lower frequency of automobile losses as well as the benefit to underwriting income from higher business volumes. In addition, the full year results include higher net favorable prior year reserve development and elevated catastrophe losses.
Net written premium growth for the fourth quarter and full year was 7% and 5%, respectively, with continued strong retention and higher levels of new business, resulting in record net written premiums of more than $11.3 billion for the year. Agency Automobile profitability was very strong with a combined ratio of 86.5% for the fourth quarter. The underlying combined ratio for the quarter improved 12 points, continuing to reflect favorable frequency levels. Approximately 1/3 of the improvement in the quarter is from favorable reestimates of activity for prior quarters in 2020. We continue to observe lower claim frequency as a result of fewer miles driven, reflecting the ongoing impact from the pandemic. We will continue to analyze and incorporate current trends into our state-specific underwriting and pricing decisions as we balance business volumes and profitability.
In Agency Homeowners and Other, the fourth quarter combined ratio of 81.9% increased relative to the prior year quarter driven by a higher underlying combined ratio and an increase in catastrophe losses. The fourth quarter included 1 catastrophe, Hurricane Zeta, with no recoveries from the catastrophe aggregate reinsurance treaty. The underlying combined ratio of 78.5% was 5 points higher than the prior year quarter due to higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses and, to a lesser degree, increases in other losses, specifically elevated fire losses.
The full year combined ratio of 93% was comparable to the prior year, with increased favorable prior year reserve development and improved underlying results, offset by elevated catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio of 82.9% was almost 3 points better than last year driven by lower non-catastrophe weather-related losses. This improvement demonstrates the success of our continuing efforts to improve returns in property while growing the business.
Turning to quarterly production. Overall results were again very strong. We're pleased with our momentum in Agency Automobile. Retention was 84% and new business increased 12%, contributing to the 3% year-over-year growth in policies in force. Renewal premium changes were lower given our pricing actions in response to the favorable loss environment. We continue to see growth in this profitable line.
Agency Homeowners and Other delivered another excellent quarter, with retention of 85% and a 21% increase in new business, while renewal premium change again exceeded 8%. Policies in force were up 8% from a year ago. These results reflect our continued efforts to grow while improving profitability.
Looking back, 2020 was both a challenging and a successful year for Personal Insurance. We achieved record levels of segment income, net written premium and policies in force. Our continued success reflects the execution of our strategy to meet customers where they are, give them what they need and serve them how they want. Examples include: nearing completion of our Quantum Home 2.0 rollout, which is now available in over 40 states; increasing the take-up of IntelliDrive by enhancing our auto telematics offering in 17 states and just this week, we introduced IntelliDrive in Canada as well; improving our customer self-service capabilities with our new MyT mobile app, which will be rolled out more broadly throughout the first quarter of 2021; planting an additional 500,000 trees for customer enrollment and paperless billing, bringing the total number of trees planted, through our partnership with American Forests, to 1.5 million; and just recently, announcing the acquisition of InsuraMatch, an innovative digital online platform that allows customers to compare offerings from more than 40 carriers across the United States. We expect to complete the acquisition in the first quarter of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions.
Before I wrap up, I'd like to add my thanks to our team and our distribution partners for continuing to deliver value to our customers despite a challenging and uncertain environment. We have strong momentum going into 2021 and are well positioned to deliver profitable growth while investing in capabilities that will continue to enhance the value of our franchise.

And from here, the outlook is positive. Also on the historical numbers, the segmentation is really important and, I think, the point Greg made in his prepared remarks about the benefit of tightening terms and conditions and weathers, so all that's really important.
And from here, I think this plays out for a while, and it's a function of rate outputs. All the drivers are environmental, so primarily loss activity, think about social inflation, think about weathers, think about wildfires. You got interest rates that appear to be lower for longer, cost and availability of reinsurance, pandemic losses impacting the industry and, I suspect, for some markets, maybe still reckoning with social inflation.

And even this year, plus 3%, when you adjust for the Personal Insurance auto refunds that we made, the comments that we made a year or so ago would still hold true. I think to the degree that the top line grows, that's going to require us to hold more capital because everything that requires capital grows with it. Reserve balances grow, your investment portfolio grows.
And the only point we were really trying to make when we made those comments a year or so ago was don't think about us perpetually being able to return 100% of earnings in the form of dividends and buybacks. We're going to have to hold some of that for growth. So that would still be true.

Let me just give you a little bit of color on how we see or thinking about the workers' comp loss activity. So first of all, the COVID-related claim rate is relatively low relative to the infection rate and lower than we might have expected, and the severity on COVID-related workers' comp is also coming in a little better than we had thought. There is -- there continues to be some benefit from non-COVID-related frequency as people are working from home. But there still is, in our minds, a degree of uncertainty to your point about how COVID-related workers' comp claims are going to play out over time. So we've been pretty cautious in the way that we've been booking for workers' comp losses to make sure that we don't get surprised by that.
Now historically, putting COVID aside, historically, in a recession, you get sort of offsetting forces in workers' comp. You got people who want to stay on the job, so they're less inclined to go out, and so frequency is down a little bit. But severity goes up a little bit because once people go out, they tend to stay out longer on workers' comp.
Historically, for us, in recessionary periods, the net of those 2 things have been a little bit of a positive. I mean every circumstance is different and so hard to know for sure, but that's generally what we've seen in the past.

I'll jump in here on this one because on the exposure front, we've said, when exposure is positive, that a portion of exposure behaves like rate and therefore can be helpful to margins. It's not necessarily the case that when exposures are modestly negative as they are here that the same holds true on the inverse. Here, what you're seeing is generally lower levels of insured exposures, fewer employees, lower levels of cash register sales, things that drive GL-type exposure.

And remember, at that time, we talked about that was the impact of the disruption to the equity markets that happened in the first quarter coming through our results on a lagging basis in Q2. And then as markets have come back, we've seen some of that rebound come through our numbers.
And so what you see in Q3 and Q4 are very strong results in a non-fixed income portfolio.

So yes, maybe we can take that off-line and figure out a way to do it, but probably right now is not the right venue.
I will say, we've said from the very beginning that we've got confidence in our policies and the way we think it would respond to business interruption. So far, in virtually every case we've had, we haven't had a bad outcome anyway. So I think I'll just reiterate our confidence in the language that we have and say that we don't feel any differently about our business interruption exposure and leave it at that for now, if that's okay."

The second follow-up for you, just looking at the underlying loss ratio in auto and trying to compare and contrast third quarter to fourth quarter results, it felt like we had the story of miles driven being down, auto accident frequency benefiting, but we're looking at a difference of 700 basis points, give or take, of underlying. How much of this is miles driven coming back? How much of this is potential short-term pricing actions that you're contemplating? How do we look at these 2 quarters to help us as a base for what the forward-COVID impact could be?"

I think we've looked at both of the last 2 quarters as extremely good results, and the third quarter was maybe an outsized good result. Remember, as we've gone throughout the year, we've been trying to set our expectation of when you look at miles driven, when we then filter that through, what are the specifics of our book? What do we expect to see for losses? Then as months and quarters go by, losses actually emerge. So it's a little bit of a moving target.
The variances have been significant. I wouldn't put a tremendous amount of stock and the difference of what came through the loss ratio in 1 quarter versus the next. I think, as Michael probably indicated and as you would not be surprised by on a go-forward basis, we wouldn't expect margins to continue to be that strong in auto, and you see that reflected in our pricing actions in the most recent quarters.
So I'd step back more and think about the year in aggregate, which has definitely had a benefit from the COVID environment. And recall that in response to that, we've also returned more than $200 million of premiums to policyholders. I don't know I can give you any more specific answer than that."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are very pleased to report first quarter core income of $699 million or $2.73 per diluted share, both up from the prior year quarter despite our highest ever level of first qu",1155,"Thank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are very pleased to report first quarter core income of $699 million or $2.73 per diluted share, both up from the prior year quarter despite our highest ever level of first quarter catastrophe losses. The higher level of core income for the quarter was driven by very strong underlying underwriting income. as well as higher levels of favorable prior year reserve development and net investment income, all of which more than offset the record level of catastrophe losses. Underlying underwriting income of $735 million pretax was nearly 25% higher than in the prior year quarter, driven by an increase in net earned premiums to $7.4 billion and an underlying combined ratio, which improved almost 2 points to an excellent 89.5%. 
We are particularly pleased with the strong underlying fundamentals in all 3 of our business segments. In Business Insurance, the underlying combined ratio improved by more than 3 points, which again included the benefit of earned pricing exceeded loss cost trends. On the Specialty Insurance and Personal Insurance, both benefited from higher earned premiums, with continued strong margins. 
Turning to investments. Our high-quality investment portfolio continued to perform well, generating net investment income of $590 million after tax for the quarter, up 14% from the prior year quarter. These results, together with our strong balance sheet, enabled us to grow adjusted book value per share by 9% over the past year, after making important investments in our business and returning excess capital to shareholders. 
During the quarter, we returned $613 million of excess capital to shareholders, including $397 million of share repurchases. In recognition of our strong financial position, confidence in our business, I'm pleased to share that our Board of Directors declared a 4% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.88 per share, marking 17 consecutive years of dividend increases with a compound annual growth rate of 9% over that period. Our Board also authorized an additional $5 billion of share repurchases. 
Turning to production. We remain pleased with the execution of our marketplace strategies. During the quarter, we grew net written premiums by 2% to $7.5 billion. Our premium growth once again reflects strong renewal premium change and retention in each of our 3 segments. In Business Insurance, renewal premium change increased to 9.2%, its highest level since 2013 and 4 points higher than the prior year quarter, while retention remains strong. 
In workers' compensation, pure renewal rate change was slightly negative but continued on an improving trend. Workers' comparable premium change, which includes exposure, was positive for the first time in a number of quarters. Both renewal rate change annual premium change and every other product line were near or above recent record highs. 
Net written premiums in Business Insurance were down a little bit year-over-year, driven overwhelmingly by the workers' comp product line, primarily reflecting the impact of the pandemic on payrolls as we're comparing a pandemic-impacted quarter in the current year to a largely pre-pandemic quarter in the prior year. 
Bond & Specialty Insurance net written premiums increased by 9%, driven by renewal premium change of nearly 11% in our management liability business, our retention remains strong. Across our commercial businesses, the pricing environment continues to be rational and favorable with written pricing well above estimated loss cost trends. Overall pricing levels continue to be near record levels. And while margins have improved, given the continued headwinds impacting returns for the industry, we expect pricing to continue to outpace loss trend for some time. 
Turning to Personal Insurance. Production was excellent in the quarter. Net written premiums increased by nearly 7%, driven by renewal premium change of almost 8% in our homeowners business, and strong retention and new business in both auto and home. New business for both auto and home combined was up 17% compared to the prior year quarter, which is the ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in new business. demonstrating the ongoing success of our product, distribution and customer initiatives. 
Before I turn the call over to Dan, given the elevated frequency and severity of catastrophes in recent years, including the recent severe winter weather, I'd like to take a minute and highlight the work we've done in terms of the strategic management of our catastrophe exposure. 
Some number of years ago and consistent with our approach generally of recognizing, assessing and addressing trends rapidly, we took decisive action in anticipation of continued weather volatility. 
Our efforts started with talent. We added experts in data science, metrology, geophysics and environmental engineering, among others, to our cat management organization. We also established dedicated teams for each catastrophe peril with the goal of developing industry-leading scientific and underwriting expertise. We have incorporated the results into our product development risk selection, pricing, capital allocation and claim response. The insights we have developed have enabled us to supplement standard vendor cat models with our own sophisticated peril-by-peril view. This gives us a refined granular view of cat risk, incorporating proprietary variables such as complex root characteristics, tree and density and location intelligence down to the parcel level. These variables are incorporated into our product development, enhancing segmentation. They are also integrated into proprietary algorithms that we use at the point of sale to inform risk selection and decisions about terms and conditions. 
In terms of our claim response, our data scientists and other experts have developed geospatial tools, artificial intelligence and analytic models to facilitate a more effective tailored deployment of claim resources. This has resulted in a more satisfying experience for our customers and a more efficient outcome for us. Taken together, these efforts have enabled us to more effectively manage our exposure to catastrophes. 
While there is always the potential for us to have outsized exposure to an event, over the past 5 years, our share of property catastrophe losses relative to total property catastrophe losses for the domestic P&C industry have declined significantly compared to the 5 years prior to that. Our property cat losses over the past 5 years have also been meaningfully lower than our corresponding market share. Advancing our understanding of the risk and reward of catastrophe underwriting is an ongoing effort for us. 
As a footnote, but importantly, we've made these and other strategic investments in our business while we improved our expense ratio. 
So to sum up, the strength of our underwriting and investment expertise enabled us to deliver strong profitability this quarter, notwithstanding the severe winter weather. As a result, we're off to a terrific start to the year. We are particularly pleased with the strong underlying fundamentals in all 3 of our business segments. Our proven strategy, strong track record of execution, leading analytics and talent advantage give us confidence that we are well positioned to capitalize on opportunities as the economy recovers. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan."

Core income for the first quarter was $699 million, up from $676 million in the prior year quarter, and core return on equity was 11.1%. Increase in core income resulted primarily from a higher level of net favorable prior year reserve development, improved underlying underwriting results and increased net investment income, largely offset by a much higher level of catastrophe losses. 
Our first quarter results include $835 million of pretax cat losses, an all-time high for our first quarter cats and an increase of $502 million compared to last year's first quarter. This quarter's cats include $703 million from the February winter storms, which impacted Texas and a number of other states. 
Prior year reserve development, for which I'll provide more detail shortly, was net favorable $317 million pretax in the quarter. Our pretax underlying underwriting gain of $735 million was 24% higher than in the prior year quarter, reflecting higher levels of earned premium and an underlying combined ratio, which improved by 1.8 points from a year ago to 89.5%. The improvement in the underlying combined ratio resulted largely from the continued impacts of earned pricing exceeding loss cost trends in our commercial businesses and continued favorable loss conditions in personal auto. These improvements were partially offset by the comparison of more typical non-cat weather this year to relatively benign non-cat weather in last year's first quarter. 
After-tax net investment income increased by 14% from the prior year quarter to $590 million as higher returns in our nonfixed income portfolio were partially offset by the impact of the expected decline in fixed income yields. Consistent with our comments on the fourth quarter earnings call and in our 10-K, we continue to expect that for the remainder of 2021, fixed income NII, including earnings from short-term securities, will be between $420 million and $430 million per quarter after tax. 
Turning to prior year reserve development. Total net favorability of $317 million pretax in the quarter, included a $72 million benefit from a subrogation settlement with Southern California Edison related to the Woolsey fire of 2018. $62 million of that benefit was recorded in Personal Insurance with the remainder recorded in Business Insurance. Beyond that subrogation benefit, net favorable PYD in Personal Insurance reflected both auto and property losses coming in better than expected for recent accident years. In Bond & Specialty, net favorable PYD was driven by better-than-expected results in the surety book. In Business Insurance, net favorable PYD was driven by better-than-expected loss experience in workers' comp partially offset by some adverse development on losses for environmental exposures in our runoff book. 
Regarding reinsurance, as discussed during our fourth quarter results call, We renewed our underlying property aggregate catastrophe XOL treaty for 2021, providing aggregate coverage of $350 million, part of $500 million of losses above an aggregate retention of $1.9 billion. Through March 31, we have accumulated $915 million of qualifying losses toward the aggregate retention. 
Turning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of $1.2 billion were again very strong. All our capital ratios were at or better than target levels, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.8 billion. Our net unrealized investment gain decreased from $4.1 billion after tax at year-end to $2.8 billion after tax at March 31 as interest rates rose during the quarter. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes unrealized investment gains and losses, was $101.21 at quarter end, up 2% from year-end and up 9% from a year ago. 
We returned $613 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter, comprising share repurchases of $397 million and dividends of $216 million. Following this quarter's share repurchase activity, we had a little more than $800 million remaining under the previously authorized repurchase program. In order to provide appropriate capital management flexibility and reflecting its confidence in our business, the Board authorized an additional $5 billion for share repurchases. And as Alan also mentioned, our Board authorized an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.88 per share. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of business insurance."

Business Insurance produced $317 million of segment income for the first quarter, a 10% increase over the first quarter of 2020, driven by higher levels of underlying underwriting income, net favorable prior year reserve development and net investment income, which more than offset higher catastrophe losses. We're particularly pleased with the underlying combined ratio of 93.7%, which improved by 3.6 points. A little less than 2 points of that resulted from earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends. The improvement also reflects the comparison to the net charge we took in the prior year quarter related to the pandemic. 
Turning to the top line. Net written premiums were down 2%, primarily due to lower net written premiums in the workers' compensation product line as a result of the impact of the pandemic on payrolls. Net written premium benefited from strong retention, higher renewal rate change and a return to positive exposure growth, reflecting an improving trend in our customers' outlook for their businesses. 
Turning to domestic production. Renewal rate change remained strong at 8.4%, up 2.5 points from the first quarter of last year, while retention remained high at 83%. The written pricing for some time now has been exceeding loss trend and is significantly improving the margins of our book. Importantly, we believe we have a high-quality book of business and seek to maintain high retention. With that in mind, we continue to execute deliberately and granularly on an account-by-account and class-by-class basis. We remain exceptionally pleased with our execution. 
As for the individual businesses, in Select, renewal rate change increased to 4.5%, up almost 3 points from the first quarter of 2020. Retention of 78% reflects deliberate execution as we pursue improved returns in certain segments of this business. As I mentioned above, we're pleased with the segmented execution underneath the aggregate result. 
New business of $95 million was down $24 million from the prior year quarter, also driven by our focus on improving profitability as we remain disciplined around risk selection, underwriting and pricing. Importantly, we have not slowed down our commitment to invest in product development and ease of doing business, which position us well for the long-term profitable growth in this business. As an example, in previous quarters, we've highlighted our completely redesigned BOP 2.0 small commercial product, which includes industry-leading segmentation and a fast, easy quoting experience. During the last 3 months, we rolled out the new product in additional 7 states, bringing the cumulative total to 30 states, representing approximately 60% of our CMP new business premium. We are encouraged with our agents' adoption of the new product as both flow and new business premium are meaningfully improved as compared to the legacy BOP product. 
In Middle Market, renewal rate change was strong at 9.1%, up almost 3 points from the first quarter of 2020, while retention remained high at 86%. Additionally, we achieved positive rate on more than 80% of our accounts this quarter, a 10-point increase from the first quarter of last year. New business was down $12 million driven by certain business units and geographies where returns are not meeting our thresholds. To sum up, we're pleased with our execution and further improving the underlying margins in the book, and we continue to invest in the business for long-term profitable growth. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom."

Bond & Specialty posted strong returns and solid growth in the quarter despite the ongoing headwinds of COVID-19. Segment income was $137 million, an increase of 12% from the prior year quarter, driven by an improved underlying underwriting margin and higher business volumes. Elevated cat losses related to the Texas weather event were largely offset by favorable prior year reserve development. 
The underlying combined ratio of 84.2% improved by 1.5 points due to an improved expense ratio, primarily reflecting higher earned premiums. Earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trend was largely offset by the impact of COVID-19 and other loss activity. 
Turning to the top line. Net written premiums grew 9% in the quarter, primarily reflecting strong management liability production. Decreased demand for new construction surety bonds due to the economic impacts of COVID-19 were largely offset by strong commercial surety production. In our management liability business, we are pleased that the renewal premium change remained near historic highs of nearly 11% while retention was a strong 87%. Management liability new business for the quarter decreased [ to ] $8 million, primarily reflecting our disciplined underwriting in this elevated risk environment. 
Consistent with recent quarters, submissions were up while quote activity was down. These production results demonstrate the successful execution of our strategies to maintain underwriting discipline and pursue rate where needed, while maintaining strong retention levels in our high-quality portfolio. So Bond & Specialty results were again strong despite the challenges in the current environment. 
And now I'll turn it over to Michael to discuss Personal Insurance."

Segment income was $314 million, and net written premiums grew 7%. The combined ratio of 90.3% rose about 2 points from the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher levels of catastrophe losses, partially offset by higher net favorable prior year reserve development. On an underlying basis, the combined ratio was a strong 85.4%. 
Before I turn to product line results, let me remind you that we have updated the presentation of certain financial and statistical data for our automobile and homeowners and other product lines to include the results of direct-to-consumer and international. This new presentation provides a more comprehensive view of product line results. 
Automobile delivered another very strong quarter with a combined ratio of 81.8%, an improvement of more than 9 points compared to the first quarter of 2020. The improvement comprises 5 points of higher net prior year reserve development and an underlying combined ratio that is 4 points better than the prior year quarter. These results reflect the ongoing effects of the pandemic, namely lower claim frequency due to fewer miles driven. That said, we have begun to see miles driven moving back toward pre-pandemic levels as restrictions have eased and economic activity is picking up. We're actively monitoring current trends and incorporating them into our state-specific pricing decisions as we continue to balance business volumes and profitability. 
In homeowners and other, the first quarter combined ratio of 99.4% increased by 15 points relative to the prior year quarter, driven by catastrophe losses of 22 points, up over 11 points with most coming from the February winter storm and freeze events and an 8-point increase in the underlying combined ratio primarily due to a comparison to unusually mild winter weather in the prior year quarter, along with about 2 points of elevated fire losses, many of which relate to extreme winter weather, often resulting from the use of alternative heating sources. The increases were partially offset by 5 points of higher net favorable prior year reserve development, which included the subrogation benefits of the woolsey wildfire that Dan mentioned. 
Turning to domestic production. Automobile net written premiums grew 3%, with 14% growth in new business, while retention remained strong at 84%. Renewal premium change was about flat, consistent with our plan to align pricing with our loss experience in auto. We are very pleased with our ongoing balanced execution in this line, which has resulted in 4% year-over-year policies in force growth at attractive returns. 
Homeowners and other delivered another strong quarter with net written premium growth of 12%. New business was up 21% from the prior year quarter. Retention remained strong at 85%, and renewal premium change was 7.7%. 
As Alan mentioned, we have achieved double-digit new business growth across auto and home for each of the past 9 quarters. Our ongoing new business success is driven by a combination of strategic investments and initiatives, including Quantum Home 2.0, IntelliDrive and new and expanded partnerships and distribution relationships. 
In addition to delivering strong results for the quarter, we continue to roll out new and expanded capabilities to deliver value in the eyes of our customers. Recent examples include closing on the acquisition of Insure Match, our digital independent agency that expands our capabilities to serve customers and distribution partners; improving our customer self-service capabilities with the rollout of our new Travelers mobile application; continuing the rollout of our digital quote proposal to further enhance our agent digital capabilities; further expanding our new version of IntelliDrive into Canada in 8 additional states; and adding digital auto discount in 9 more states for customers who leverage paperless, telematics and mobile applications. 
In summary, we're off to a great start to the year and are well positioned to continue to deliver profitable growth. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Abbe."

We're now several years into compounding year-over-year improvement in rate and price. And the 3 sequential quarters prior to this one, I think, in Business Insurance anyway, all made record prices. So that's pretty good process -- progress. I'm sorry, pretty good progress. As a consequence, margins are improving. But having said that, the drivers of price change overall are environmental and still relevant. So we expect that overall pricing and pure rate for that matter will continue to be at levels that result in expanding margins for a while now. 
Whether prices in particular lines go up, down or sideways, I don't think we're going to try to predict that. But it's all pretty rational. It's all pretty relative to the rate where we need it. And again, there's always a lot of focus on that headline number because that's what we provide, but we're looking hard at the granular execution underneath that takes into account all the variables of account rate adequacy. So we feel great about this pricing level. We are near all-time highs in pricing. And we expect to continue the favorable vibe to continue for some time."

Does it reduce volatility and/or would it create shareholder value through some other important strategic benefit?

Doesn't feel that way anymore, but sort of moving into the fabric of the economy and overall results. That's one of the reasons that even going back to last year, we chose to leave everything related to COVID in our underlying combined ratio and why it's really not feasible to be able to specifically spike out what do we think the impact of COVID was in the quarter. 
Having said that, qualitatively, we have some idea. You heard Michael talk about the impact of COVID on miles driven in PI. Didn't get a mention in Business Insurance because we think it was pretty modest. There was again some level of direct charges related to COVID-specific losses in things like workers' comp but very modest and we'd say probably largely offset, if not slightly more than offset by related benefits in non-COVID frequency."

It's Dan again. So I think the numbers that we see coming through business insurance for rate versus trend aligned with what we've seen from written results over the last several quarters, if you just factor in what's earning its way through. So we did see a steadily increasing level of rate increase over last year, and we are seeing a steadily increasing level of improvement in terms of the earned impact of rate versus trend. It moves slowly and it moves in sort of tens of a point changes at a time. 
I guess the other thing I'd say to keep in mind is it's not just the simple math of if we got 8 points of rate versus 5 points of trend, that's 3 points of margin expansion, it's not. It's rate versus trend that's a 3 percentage point difference. But if you translate it into loss ratio points, when you consider, say, theoretically, a 60-ish loss ratio, that translates into a little less than 2 points of margin expansion. So being close to 2 points of margin expansion and expecting that number to increase maybe very slightly from here as the higher rates earned through is right where we thought we'd be."

And it was a big enough portion of the business, frankly, that leaving it to the side of the line breakout on the P&L didn't make sense, not that it moved the needle on those numbers that much, but it was an important part of the business that we thought it should be fully included in the P&L statistics and then in the domestic production statistics so that when we do make investments in, for example, marketing and advertising, that drive growth in direct-to-consumer, we want that to show up in the production results that you see.

And we're just trying to get away from giving outlook and prognosticating. But we feel great about what we achieved in terms of pricing this quarter, and we feel very good about the outlook for pricing. 
In terms of workers' comp, we said in recent quarters that it feels like we're pretty close to making a bottom and turning around, and we continue to feel that way. We saw progress in the quarter, both in terms of pure rate, which was slightly negative, but a steady improvement over the last several quarters. Renewal premium change, as I said, including exposure, was positive for the first time in a few quarters, which we think is really speaks to our customers' confidence. So that was a really good thing. So that's what we would -- that's what we'd share about that. 
I guess the other point I would say, Elyse, is it turns out that the workers' comp experience through COVID at least so far -- and we're being cautious about this. But at least so far, what we see in the data is that it's a little bit better than we expected. And that could impact pricing going forward. I don't -- I think the likely result of that is maybe instead of hitting the bottom and inflecting positively, it hits the bottom and bounces around there a little bit before making the term positive. But again, not a bad sign. It's reflective of the profitability of the line, which has been very strong. And we continue to think we're making a bottom and moving towards a turn north."

And I think that continues. And I think we'll probably take a while to work through what could be the backlog there. So what we've done in terms of both our view of current accident year and prior accident year reserve adequacy is to assume that nothing really has changed. So the data might tell you that things look a little bit favorable, we're not really going to react to that. Our assumption is that once things do get back to normal, ultimately, what we're going to see is social inflation at the levels and the trends that we've seen it before, loss cost trend at the elevated rate that we talked about even in the second quarter of last year. And then ultimately, these things will all settle out in reflection of of those levels. 
So to the degree that we talked about some favorability last year and we had some favorability in prior year reserve development this year, a lot of that is frequency driven where the losses themselves have simply not emerged. But from a severity perspective, we're still going to take the view that we think that severity pressure has not really gone away, and that's one of the reasons that you see us continuing to pursue rate and business insurance to the degree that we are."

But broadly speaking, I would say, we remain in contact and conversation with the Department of Insurance, including California, and are working to be responsive to, again, request for information and/or request for rate level adjustments, et cetera.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are very pleased to report first quarter core income of $699 million or $2.73 per diluted share, both up from the prior year quarter despite our highest ever level of first qu",1157,"Thank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are very pleased to report first quarter core income of $699 million or $2.73 per diluted share, both up from the prior year quarter despite our highest ever level of first quarter catastrophe losses. The higher level of core income for the quarter was driven by very strong underlying underwriting income as well as higher levels of favorable prior year reserve development and net investment income, all of which more than offset the record level of catastrophe losses. Underlying underwriting income of $735 million pretax was nearly 25% higher than in the prior year quarter, driven by an increase in net earned premiums to $7.4 billion and an underlying combined ratio, which improved almost 2 points to an excellent 89.5%.  
We are particularly pleased with the strong underlying fundamentals in all 3 of our business segments. In Business Insurance, the underlying combined ratio improved by more than 3 points, which again included the benefit of earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends. On the Specialty Insurance and Personal Insurance, both benefited from higher earned premiums, with continued strong margins.  
Turning to investments. Our high-quality investment portfolio continued to perform well, generating net investment income of $590 million after tax for the quarter, up 14% from the prior year quarter. These results, together with our strong balance sheet, enabled us to grow adjusted book value per share by 9% over the past year, after making important investments in our business and returning excess capital to shareholders.  
During the quarter, we returned $613 million of excess capital to shareholders, including $397 million of share repurchases. In recognition of our strong financial position, confidence in our business, I'm pleased to share that our Board of Directors declared a 4% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.88 per share, marking 17 consecutive years of dividend increases with a compound annual growth rate of 9% over that period. Our Board also authorized an additional $5 billion of share repurchases.  
Turning to production. We remain pleased with the execution of our marketplace strategies. During the quarter, we grew net written premiums by 2% to $7.5 billion. Our premium growth once again reflects strong renewal premium change and retention in each of our 3 segments. In Business Insurance, renewal premium change increased to 9.2%, its highest level since 2013 and 4 points higher than the prior year quarter, while retention remains strong.  
In workers' compensation, pure renewal rate change was slightly negative but continued on an improving trend. Workers' comparable premium change, which includes exposure, was positive for the first time in a number of quarters. Both renewal rate change, annual premium change in every other product line were near or above recent record highs.  
Net written premiums in Business Insurance were down a little bit year-over-year, driven overwhelmingly by the workers' comp product line, primarily reflecting the impact of the pandemic on payrolls as we're comparing a pandemic-impacted quarter in the current year to a largely pre-pandemic quarter in the prior year.  
Bond & Specialty Insurance net written premiums increased by 9%, driven by renewal premium change of nearly 11% in our management liability business, our retention remains strong. Across our commercial businesses, the pricing environment continues to be rational and favorable with written pricing well above estimated loss cost trends. Overall pricing levels continue to be near record levels. And while margins have improved, given the continued headwinds impacting returns for the industry, we expect pricing to continue to outpace loss trend for some time.  
Turning to Personal Insurance. Production was excellent in the quarter. Net written premiums increased by nearly 7%, driven by renewal premium change of almost 8% in our homeowners business, and strong retention and new business in both auto and home. New business for both auto and home combined was up 17% compared to the prior year quarter, which is the ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in new business, demonstrating the ongoing success of our product, distribution and customer initiatives. 
Before I turn the call over to Dan, given the elevated frequency and severity of catastrophes in recent years, including the recent severe winter weather, I'd like to take a minute and highlight the work we've done in terms of the strategic management of our catastrophe exposure.  
Some number of years ago and consistent with our approach generally of recognizing, assessing and addressing trends rapidly, we took decisive action in anticipation of continued weather volatility. Our efforts started with talent. We added experts in data science, meteorology, geophysics and environmental engineering, among others, to our cat management organization. We also established dedicated teams for each catastrophe peril with the goal of developing industry-leading scientific and underwriting expertise. We have incorporated the results into our product development, risk selection, pricing, capital allocation and claim response. 
The insights we have developed have enabled us to supplement standard vendor cat models with our own sophisticated peril-by-peril view. This gives us a refined granular view of cat risk, incorporating proprietary variables such as complex roof characteristics, tree and brush density and location intelligence down to the parcel level. These variables are incorporated into our product development, enhancing segmentation. They are also integrated into proprietary algorithms that we use at the point of sale to inform risk selection and decisions about terms and conditions.  
In terms of our claim response, our data scientists and other experts have developed geospatial tools, artificial intelligence and analytic models to facilitate a more effective tailored deployment of claim resources. This has resulted in a more satisfying experience for our customers and a more efficient outcome for us. Taken together, these efforts have enabled us to more effectively manage our exposure to catastrophes. 
While there is always the potential for us to have outsized exposure to an event, over the past 5 years, our share of property catastrophe losses relative to total property catastrophe losses for the domestic P&C industry have declined significantly compared to the 5 years prior to that. Our property cat losses over the past 5 years have also been meaningfully lower than our corresponding market share. Advancing our understanding of the risk and reward of catastrophe underwriting is an ongoing effort for us. As a footnote, but importantly, we've made these and other strategic investments in our business, while we improved our expense ratio.  
So to sum up, the strength of our underwriting and investment expertise enabled us to deliver strong profitability this quarter, notwithstanding the severe winter weather. As a result, we're off to a terrific start to the year. We are particularly pleased with the strong underlying fundamentals in all 3 of our business segments. Our proven strategy, strong track record of execution, leading analytics and talent advantage give us confidence that we are well positioned to capitalize on opportunities as the economy recovers. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan."

Core income for the first quarter was $699 million, up from $676 million in the prior year quarter, and core return on equity was 11.1%.

Core income for the first quarter was $699 million, up from $676 million in the prior year quarter, and core return on equity was 11.1%. The increase in core income resulted primarily from a higher level of net favorable prior year reserve development, improved underlying underwriting results and increased net investment income, largely offset by a much higher level of catastrophe losses.  
Our first quarter results include $835 million of pretax cat losses, an all-time high for our first quarter cats, and an increase of $502 million compared to last year's first quarter. This quarter's cats include $703 million from the February winter storms, which impacted Texas and a number of other states.  
Prior year reserve development, for which I'll provide more detail shortly, was net favorable $317 million pretax in the quarter. Our pretax underlying underwriting gain of $735 million was 24% higher than in the prior year quarter, reflecting higher levels of earned premium and an underlying combined ratio, which improved by 1.8 points from a year ago to 89.5%. The improvement in the underlying combined ratio resulted largely from the continued impacts of earned pricing exceeding loss cost trends in our commercial businesses and continued favorable loss conditions in personal auto. These improvements were partially offset by the comparison of more typical non-cat weather this year to relatively benign non-cat weather in last year's first quarter.  
After-tax net investment income increased by 14% from the prior year quarter to $590 million as higher returns in our non-fixed income portfolio were partially offset by the impact of the expected decline in fixed income yields. Consistent with our comments on the fourth quarter earnings call and in our 10-K, we continue to expect that for the remainder of 2021, fixed income NII, including earnings from short-term securities, will be between $420 million and $430 million per quarter after tax.  
Turning to prior year reserve development. Total net favorability of $317 million pretax in the quarter included a $72 million benefit from a subrogation settlement with Southern California Edison related to the Woolsey fire of 2018. $62 million of that benefit was recorded in Personal Insurance with the remainder recorded in Business Insurance. Beyond that subrogation benefit, net favorable PYD in Personal Insurance reflected both auto and property losses coming in better than expected for recent accident years. In Bond & Specialty, net favorable PYD was driven by better-than-expected results in the surety book. In Business Insurance, net favorable PYD was driven by better-than-expected loss experience in workers' comp, partially offset by some adverse development on losses for environmental exposures in our runoff book.  
Regarding reinsurance, as discussed during our fourth quarter results call, we renewed our underlying property aggregate catastrophe XOL treaty for 2021, providing aggregate coverage of $350 million, part of $500 million of losses above an aggregate retention of $1.9 billion. Through March 31, we have accumulated $915 million of qualifying losses toward the aggregate retention.  
Turning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of $1.2 billion were again very strong. All our capital ratios were at or better than target levels, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.8 billion. Our net unrealized investment gain decreased from $4.1 billion after tax at year-end to $2.8 billion after tax at March 31 as interest rates rose during the quarter. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes unrealized investment gains and losses, was $101.21 at quarter end, up 2% from year-end and up 9% from a year ago.  
We returned $613 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter, comprising share repurchases of $397 million and dividends of $216 million. Following this quarter's share repurchase activity, we had a little more than $800 million remaining under the previously authorized repurchase program. In order to provide appropriate capital management flexibility and reflecting its confidence in our business, the Board authorized an additional $5 billion for share repurchases. And as Alan also mentioned, our Board authorized an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.88 per share.  
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of Business Insurance."
392856,707438755,2253910,"The Travelers Companies, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2021",2021-04-20,"Earnings Calls","The Travelers Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dan. Business Insurance produced $317 million of segment income for the first quarter, a 10% increase over the first quarter of 2020, driven by higher levels of underlying underwriting income, net favorable prior year reserve development and net i",562,"Thanks, Dan. Business Insurance produced $317 million of segment income for the first quarter, a 10% increase over the first quarter of 2020, driven by higher levels of underlying underwriting income, net favorable prior year reserve development and net investment income, which more than offset higher catastrophe losses. We're particularly pleased with the underlying combined ratio of 93.7%, which improved by 3.6 points. A little less than 2 points of that resulted from earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends. The improvement also reflects the comparison to the net charge we took in the prior year quarter related to the pandemic.  
Turning to the top line. Net written premiums were down 2%, primarily due to lower net written premiums in the workers' compensation product line as a result of the impact of the pandemic on payrolls. Net written premium benefited from strong retention, higher renewal rate change and a return to positive exposure growth, reflecting an improving trend in our customers' outlook for their businesses.  
Turning to domestic production. Renewal rate change remained strong at 8.4%, up 2.5 points from the first quarter of last year, while retention remained high at 83%. Written pricing for some time now has been exceeding loss trend and is significantly improving the margins of our book. Importantly, we believe we have a high-quality book of business and seek to maintain high retention. With that in mind, we continue to execute deliberately and granularly on an account-by-account and class-by-class basis. We remain exceptionally pleased with our execution.  
As for the individual businesses, in Select, renewal rate change increased to 4.5%, up almost 3 points from the first quarter of 2020. Retention of 78% reflects deliberate execution as we pursue improved returns in certain segments of this business. As I mentioned above, we're pleased with the segmented execution underneath the aggregate result.  
New business of $95 million was down $24 million from the prior year quarter, also driven by our focus on improving profitability as we remain disciplined around risk selection, underwriting and pricing. Importantly, we have not slowed down our commitment to invest in product development and ease of doing business, which position us well for the long-term profitable growth in this business. As an example, in previous quarters, we've highlighted our completely redesigned BOP 2.0 small commercial product, which includes industry-leading segmentation and a fast, easy quoting experience. During the last 3 months, we rolled out the new product in an additional 7 states, bringing the cumulative total to 30 states, representing approximately 60% of our CMP new business premium. We are encouraged with our agents' adoption of the new product as both flow and new business premium are meaningfully improved as compared to the legacy BOP product.  
In Middle Market, renewal rate change was strong at 9.1%, up almost 3 points from the first quarter of 2020, while retention remained high at 86%. Additionally, we achieved positive rate on more than 80% of our accounts this quarter, a 10-point increase from the first quarter of last year. New business was down $12 million driven by certain business units and geographies where returns are not meeting our thresholds. To sum up, we're pleased with our execution and further improving the underlying margins in the book, and we continue to invest in the business for long-term profitable growth.  
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom."

Bond & Specialty posted strong returns and solid growth in the quarter despite the ongoing headwinds of COVID-19. Segment income was $137 million, an increase of 12% from the prior year quarter, driven by an improved underlying underwriting margin and higher business volumes. Elevated cat losses related to the Texas weather event were largely offset by favorable prior year reserve development.  
The underlying combined ratio of 84.2% improved by 1.5 points due to an improved expense ratio, primarily reflecting higher earned premiums. Earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends was largely offset by the impact of COVID-19 and other loss activity.  
Turning to the top line. Net written premiums grew 9% in the quarter, primarily reflecting strong management liability production. Decreased demand for new construction surety bonds due to the economic impacts of COVID-19 were largely offset by strong commercial surety production. In our management liability business, we are pleased that the renewal premium change remained near historic highs of nearly 11%, while retention was a strong 87%.  
Management liability new business for the quarter decreased $8 million, primarily reflecting our disciplined underwriting in this elevated risk environment. Consistent with recent quarters, submissions were up while quote activity was down. These production results demonstrate the successful execution of our strategies to maintain underwriting discipline and pursue rate where needed, while maintaining strong retention levels in our high-quality portfolio. So Bond & Specialty results were again strong despite the challenges in the current environment.  
And now I'll turn it over to Michael to discuss Personal Insurance."

Segment income was $314 million, and net written premiums grew 7%. The combined ratio of 90.3% rose about 2 points from the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher levels of catastrophe losses, partially offset by higher net favorable prior year reserve development. On an underlying basis, the combined ratio was a strong 85.4%. 
Before I turn to product line results, let me remind you that we have updated the presentation of certain financial and statistical data for our automobile and homeowners and other product lines to include the results of direct-to-consumer and international. This new presentation provides a more comprehensive view of product line results. 
Automobile delivered another very strong quarter with a combined ratio of 81.8%, an improvement of more than 9 points compared to the first quarter of 2020. The improvement comprises 5 points of higher net prior year reserve development and an underlying combined ratio that is 4 points better than the prior year quarter. These results reflect the ongoing effects of the pandemic, namely lower claim frequency due to fewer miles driven. That said, we have begun to see miles driven moving back toward pre-pandemic levels as restrictions have eased and economic activity is picking up. We're actively monitoring current trends and incorporating them into our state-specific pricing decisions as we continue to balance business volumes and profitability. 
In homeowners and other, the first quarter combined ratio of 99.4% increased by 15 points relative to the prior year quarter, driven by catastrophe losses of 22 points, up over 11 points with most coming from the February winter storm and freeze events and an 8-point increase in the underlying combined ratio, primarily due to a comparison to unusually mild winter weather in the prior year quarter, along with about 2 points of elevated fire losses, many of which relate to extreme winter weather, often resulting from the use of alternative heating sources. The increases were partially offset by 5 points of higher net favorable prior year reserve development, which included the subrogation benefits of the Woolsey wildfire that Dan mentioned.
Turning to domestic production. Automobile net written premiums grew 3%, with 14% growth in new business, while retention remained strong at 84%. Renewal premium change was about flat, consistent with our plan to align pricing with our loss experience in auto. We are very pleased with our ongoing balanced execution in this line, which has resulted in a 4% year-over-year policies-in-force growth at attractive returns. 
Homeowners and other delivered another strong quarter with net written premium growth of 12%. New business was up 21% from the prior year quarter. Retention remained strong at 85%, and renewal premium change was 7.7%. 
As Alan mentioned, we have achieved double-digit new business growth across auto and home for each of the past 9 quarters. Our ongoing new business success is driven by a combination of strategic investments and initiatives, including Quantum Home 2.0, IntelliDrive and new and expanded partnerships and distribution relationships. 
In addition to delivering strong results for the quarter, we continue to rollout new and expanded capabilities to deliver value in the eyes of our customers. Recent examples include closing on the acquisition of InsuraMatch, our digital independent agency, that expands our capabilities to serve customers and distribution partners; improving our customer self-service capabilities with the rollout of our new MyTravelers mobile application; continuing the rollout of our digital quote proposal to further enhance our agents' digital capabilities; further expanding our new version of IntelliDrive into Canada and 8 additional states; and adding digital auto discount in 9 more states for customers who leverage paperless, telematics and mobile applications. 
In summary, we're off to a great start to the year and are well positioned to continue to deliver profitable growth. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Abbe."

We're now several years into compounding year-over-year improvement in rate and price. And the 3 sequential quarters prior to this one, I think, in Business Insurance anyway, all made record prices. So that's pretty good process -- progress, I'm sorry, pretty good progress. As a consequence, margins are improving. But having said that, the drivers of price change overall are environmental and still relevant. So we expect that overall pricing and pure rate for that matter will continue to be at levels that result in expanding margins for a while now. 
Whether prices in particular lines go up, down or sideways, I don't think we're going to try to predict that. But it's all pretty rational. It's all pretty relative to the rate where we need it. And again, there's always a lot of focus on that headline number because that's what we provide, but we're looking hard at the granular execution underneath that takes into account all the variables of account rate adequacy. So we feel great about this pricing level. We are near all-time highs in pricing. And we expect to continue the favorable environment to continue for some time."

Doesn't feel that way anymore, it's sort of woven into the fabric of the economy and overall results. That's one of the reasons that even going back to last year, we chose to leave everything related to COVID in our underlying combined ratio and why it's really not feasible to be able to specifically spike out what do we think the impact of COVID was in the quarter. 
Having said that, qualitatively, we have some idea. You heard Michael talk about the impact of COVID on miles driven in PI. Didn't get a mention in Business Insurance because we think it was pretty modest. There was again some level of direct charges related to COVID-specific losses in things like workers' comp but very modest, and we'd say probably largely offset, if not slightly more than offset by related benefits in non-COVID frequency."

It's Dan again. So I think the numbers that we see coming through business insurance for rate versus trend aligned with what we've seen from written results over the last several quarters, if you just factor in what's earning its way through. So we did see a steadily increasing level of rate increase over last year, and we are seeing a steadily increasing level of improvement in terms of the earned impact of rate versus trend. It moves slowly and it moves in sort of tenths of a point changes at a time. 
I guess the other thing I'd say to keep in mind is, it's not just the simple math of if we got 8 points of rate versus 5 points of trend, that's 3 points of margin expansion, it's not. It's rate versus trend, that's a 3 percentage point difference. But if you translate it into loss ratio points, when you consider, say, theoretically, a 60-ish loss ratio, that translates into a little less than 2 points of margin expansion. So being close to 2 points of margin expansion and expecting that number to increase maybe very slightly from here as the higher rates earned through is right where we thought we'd be."

I would say, very specifically, the restatement of the financials doesn't say anything about our commitment to direct-to-consumer one way or the other. It's still an important capability for us, still a segment of the business we're investing in. Frankly, it got to the point where, and you can see it in the restatement that we gave you, it was north of $400 million worth of revenue as of the end of last year. And it was a big enough portion of the business, frankly, that leaving it to the side of the line breakout on the P&L didn't make sense. Not that it moved the needle on those numbers that much, but it was an important part of the business that we thought it should be fully included in the P&L statistics and then in the domestic production statistics so that when we do make investments in, for example, marketing and advertising, that drives growth in direct-to-consumer, we want that to show up in the production results that you see. 
So I would say it doesn't indicate a change in our emphasis. And if anything, I would say, it reinforces the importance of that business to us both as a business segment and as essentially a place to continue to build and test and learn and build capability."

Elyse, on the go-forward view of rate, we actually didn't give a view of direction other than to say we expect it to continue to be at levels that will continue to contribute to margin expansion. And we're just trying to get away from giving outlook and prognosticating. But we feel great about what we achieved in terms of pricing this quarter, and we feel very good about the outlook for pricing. 
In terms of workers' comp, we've said in recent quarters that it feels like we're pretty close to making a bottom and turning around, and we continue to feel that way. We saw progress in the quarter, both in terms of pure rate, which was slightly negative, but a steady improvement over the last several quarters. Renewal premium change, as I said, including exposure, was positive for the first time in a few quarters, which we think is -- really speaks to our customers' confidence. So that was a really good thing. So that's what we would -- that's what we'd share about that. 
I guess the other point I would say, Elyse, is, it turns out that the workers' comp experience through COVID at least so far, and we're being cautious about this, but at least so far, what we see in the data is that it's a little bit better than we expected. And that could impact pricing going forward. I don't -- I think the likely result of that is maybe instead of hitting the bottom and inflecting positively, it hits the bottom and bounces around there a little bit before making the term positive. But again, not a bad sign. It's reflective of the profitability of the line, which has been very strong. And we continue to think we're making a bottom and moving towards a turn north."

We talked about it last year in terms of, there's definitely a change in the data from the fact that courts were closed for a long time and other settlement venues have been less active. And I think that continues. And I think will probably take a while to work through what could be the backlog there. So what we've done in terms of both our view of current accident year and prior accident year reserve adequacy is to assume that nothing really has changed. So the data might tell you that things look a little bit favorable, we're not really going to react to that. Our assumption is that once things do get back to normal, ultimately, what we're going to see is social inflation at the levels and the trends that we've seen it before, loss cost trend at the elevated rate that we talked about even in the second quarter of last year. And then ultimately, these things will all settle out in reflection of those levels. 
So to the degree that we talked about some favorability last year and we had some favorability in prior year reserve development this year, a lot of that is frequency driven, where the losses themselves have simply not emerged. But from a severity perspective, we're still going to take the view that we think that severity pressure has not really gone away, and that's one of the reasons that you see us continuing to pursue rate in Business Insurance to the degree that we are."

But since the onset of the pandemic, we've actually now filed decreases in about 20 states across the country. California doesn't happen to be one of those. You may recall in the latter half of 2020, we actually provided an additional premium refund to California policyholders, partly in response to the ongoing dialogue with the state of California. 
But broadly speaking, I would say, we remain in contact and conversation with the departments of insurance, including California, and are working to be responsive to, again, requests for information and/or requests for rate level adjustments, et cetera.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are very pleased to report excellent underwriting and investment results for the second quarter and first half of the year.Core income for the quarter was $879 million or $3",820,"Thank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are very pleased to report excellent underwriting and investment results for the second quarter and first half of the year.
Core income for the quarter was $879 million or $3.45 per diluted share, generating a full return on equity of 13.7%. In terms of underwriting results, higher underlying underwriting income and net favorable prior year reserve development as well as a lower level of catastrophe losses, all contributed to higher core income. Underlying underwriting income was 8% higher than in the prior year quarter, driven by record net earned premiums of $7.6 billion and an excellent underlying combined ratio of 91.4%.  We are particularly pleased with the continued strong underlying fundamentals in each of our 3 business segments. 
In Business Insurance, net earned premiums were higher and the underlying combined ratio improved by 3.7 points. In Specialty Insurance and Personal Insurance, both delivered meaningful increases in net earned premiums and continued strong margins.
Turning to investments. Our high-quality investment portfolio generated net investment income of $682 million after tax, reflecting very strong returns in our non-fixed income portfolio. These excellent results, together with our strong balance sheet, enabled us to grow adjusted book value per share by 13% over the past year, after making important investments for the future and returning significant excess capital to our shareholders. During the quarter, we returned $625 million of excess capital to shareholders, including $401 million of share repurchases.
Turning to the top line. The combination of the strong franchise value we offer to our customers and distribution partners, together with excellent execution by our field organization, produced terrific results. During the quarter, we grew net written premiums to $8.1 billion, an increase of 11% or 8% after adjusting for the auto premium refunds in the prior year quarter. Each of our 3 segments contributed meaningfully to the top line growth.
In Business Insurance, net written premiums grew by 5%, driven by retention, which ticked up almost 1 point, renewal premium change at a near record high of 9.5% and 9% growth in new business. Combination of strong pricing and higher retention reflects continuing strength in the pricing environment.
Inside renewal premium change, pure renewal rate change was a strong 7.1%. Greg will share more detail about the texture underneath renewal rate change in a few minutes. Renewal premium change also included the highest exposure growth we've seen in 9 quarters, an encouraging sign of improvement in U.S. economic activity.
In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net written premiums increased by 16%, driven by a record renewal premium change of 12.7% in our management liability business, while retention remains strong.
In our commercial businesses, written pricing continues to comfortably outpace estimated loss trend, which will continue to benefit margins as it earns in. Continuing strong pricing and retentions reflect the industry's clear eye view the ongoing headwinds impacting returns for the industry, including weather volatility, low interest rates and social inflation. Weak pricing continued to outpace loss trends for some time.
Turning to Personal Insurance. Production was, again, excellent this quarter. Net written premiums increased 8% after adjusting for the auto premium refunds in the prior year quarter. Policies in force in both auto and homeowners are at record levels, driven by continuing strong retention and growth in new business.
While the impact of the pandemic on claim frequency seems to be attracting a lot of the tension when it comes to personal auto, we've been equally focused on applying our company-wide perform and transform mandate to this business. We are very pleased with the results. We've accelerated our domestic auto policies in force growth from 1% to 4% over the last 6 quarters, bringing PIF count to a record high. This demonstrates the ongoing success of our 3-pronged strategy in personal insurance to meet customers where they are, serve them how they want and get them what they need. Going forward, we will continue to invest in advanced segmentation, multichannel distribution and providing great experiences to continue to deliver profitable growth. Mike will share more detail in a few minutes.
Our excellent top and bottom line results this quarter for the first half of the year demonstrate the continued successful execution of our strategy to grow the top line at attractive returns as well as the effectiveness of our well-defined and content investment philosophy. Our focused and well-executed innovation agenda has been an important contributor to the growth and profitability we have achieved. We will continue to relentlessly pursue our priorities of extending our lead in risk expertise, providing great experiences to our customers, distribution partners and employees and improving productivity and efficiency. With the momentum we have and the best talents in the industry, we are well positioned to continue to create meaningful shareholder value over time. 
And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan."
392856,718231742,2348037,"The Travelers Companies, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2021",2021-07-20,"Earnings Calls","The Travelers Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Alan.

Core income for the second quarter was $879 million compared to a core loss of $50 million in the prior year quarter. The significant improvement was the result of positive factors across the business, including a lower level of catastrophe losses, improved results in our non-fixed income investment portfolio, more favorable prior year reserve development and increased underlying underwriting income.
Our second quarter results include $475 million of pretax cat losses compared to $854 million in last year's second quarter. This quarter's cats were somewhat below what we would have assumed for a typical second quarter, but year-to-date cat losses are still above what we would have assumed, given the high level of losses in the first quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we have accumulated about $1.5 billion of qualifying losses toward the aggregate retention of $1.9 billion on our property aggregate catastrophe ex-oil treaty. The treaty provides $350 million of coverage on the first $500 million of losses above the aggregate retention amount. Underlying underwriting income increased 8% to $617 million pretax, reflecting a higher level of earned premium in each of our segments and a strong underlying combined ratio of 91.4% consistent with the prior year. As you'll hear from Greg, Tom and Michael improvements in the underlying combined ratio in both Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty were offset by an increase in the underlying combined ratio in Personal Insurance. Some of the increase in Personal Insurance was expected given that last year's quarter benefited from unusually low auto losses as a result of the pandemic.
The underlying loss ratio came in at 61.7%, up 1.3 points from last year's second quarter as the beneficial impact of earned pricing in excess of loss trend was more than offset by the comparison to a very low endemic-related personal auto loss ratio in the year ago quarter. Expense ratio of 29.7% is 1.3 points lower than the prior year quarter as last year's result was elevated primarily due to the premium refunds we provided to our personal auto customers.
Turning to prior year reserve development. In Personal Insurance, both auto and property losses came in better than expected for recent accident years, resulting in $65 million of pretax net favorable PYD. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, $44 million of pretax net favorable PYD was driven by favorable loss experience in surety and fidelity related to recent accident years. In Business Insurance, net favorable prior year reserve development of $73 million was driven by better-than-expected loss experience in workers' comp across multiple accident years, partially offset by reserve strengthening in our runoff book.
Net investment income improved to $682 million after tax this quarter. Our non-fixed income portfolio turned in particularly strong results this quarter, reflecting performance in the equity markets, contributing $265 million after tax. Consistent with our expectations, fixed income returns were down slightly from the prior year quarter as the benefit from higher levels of invested assets was more than offset by a decline in yields. For the remainder of 2021, we expect fixed income NII, including earnings from short-term securities, of between $425 million and $435 million after tax per quarter.
Turning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of $1.8 billion were again very strong. All our capital ratios were at or better than target levels, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $2.4 billion.
During the second quarter, we took advantage of favorable market conditions and raised $750 million to help fund future growth with a 30-year debt issuance at 3.05%, representing our second lowest 30-year coupon ever and achieving one of the tightest spreads ever for a 30-year note issued by an insurance company. The market value of the bonds in our portfolio generally rose as U.S. treasury yields declined and credit spreads tightened during the second quarter. And accordingly, our after-tax net unrealized investment gain increased from $2.8 billion as of March 31 to $3.2 billion at June 30. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes net realized investment gains and losses, was $103.88 at quarter end, up 4% since year-end and up 13% year-over-year.
We returned $625 million of capital to our shareholders during the second quarter, with $224 million of dividends and $401 million in share repurchases.
Coming back to reinsurance for a moment, let me direct your attention to Slide 20 of the webcast presentation for a summary of our July 1 renewals. The structure of our main cat reinsurance program is generally consistent with the prior year. We renewed our Northeast cat treaty effective July 1 with substantially similar terms and pricing that was up only slightly on an exposure-adjusted basis. Our cat bond, Long Point Re III, is now in the final year of its 4-year term. In the annual reset for the 2021 hurricane season, the attachment point was adjusted from $1.87 billion to $1.98 billion, while the total cost of the program was flat year-over-year. A more complete description of our cat reinsurance coverage, including our general cat aggregate XOL treaty that covers an accumulation of certain property losses arising from multiple occurrences, is included in our 10-Q, which we filed earlier today and in our 2020 Form 10-K.
Before turning the call over to Greg, I'd like to make a few comments about inflation as the consumer price index has gotten a lot of attention lately. We are relatively less leveraged to overall CPI type inflation as compared to, say, medical inflation and social inflation. One place CPI-type inflation can impact us is in our short tail lines. 
Notwithstanding our strong profitability in PI, as you'll hear from Michael, we are experiencing a degree of elevated severity. However, relatively short payout periods in short tail lines limit the impact of that exposure. And although it takes time to earn in over the policy period, we can price for those increases reasonably quickly.
Additionally, it's important to remember that we have some natural hedges in our business that mitigate the effects of inflation. First, higher inflation is often associated with stronger economic activity as well as higher wages and asset values, all of which contribute to higher insured exposures. And as we've discussed before, higher exposure contributes to improved margins.
Second, although we're not seeing it at the moment, to the extent interest rates are correlated to inflation, we would benefit from higher returns in our investment portfolio as inflation increases.
Finally, let me reiterate that we are conscious of the inflation environment and the uncertainties surrounding it when we establish our loss picks and our balance sheet reserves.
And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of Business Insurance."

Business Insurance had a great quarter with strong financial results and terrific execution in the marketplace.

Business Insurance had a great quarter with strong financial results and terrific execution in the marketplace. Segment income was $643 million for the quarter compared to a loss of $58 million in the prior year quarter. Higher net investment income, lower catastrophe losses, higher underlying underwriting income and favorable prior year reserve development, all contributed to the year-over-year improvement.
We're particularly pleased with the underlying combined ratio of 93.3%, which improved by 3.7 points for the second quarter of 2020, primarily attributable to 3 things. First, about 2 points of the improvement resulted from earned pricing exceeding loss cost trends, another 0.5 point or so resulted from lower non-cat weather, and third, the improvement also reflects the comparison to the modest net charge we took in the prior year quarter related to the pandemic.
In terms of non-cat weather, while the year-over-year improvement was about 0.5 point favorable, as I just mentioned, this quarter's result was about 1.5 points better than what we assumed for the quarter.
Turning to the top line. Net written premiums were up 5%, benefiting from strong renewal premium change, including both strong renewal rate and exposure levels that are trending back to pre-pandemic levels and higher year-over-year new business volume. As for domestic production, renewal premium change was 9.5%, but historically high results and up almost 4 points from the second quarter of last year. Underlying the RTC, we achieved strong renewal rate change of 7.1% and healthy exposure growth that reflects an improving trend in our customers' outlook for their businesses. As Alan said, our ability to continue to achieve historically high pricing with improved retention speaks to the stability of pricing in the market. New business was up more than 9% with both select and middle market contributing. I'll discuss those results in more detail in a moment when I get to the individual businesses.
We are very pleased with these aggregate production results and our marketplace execution. We've generated written pricing that has been in excess of estimated loss trend for some time now, resulting in significant improvement in the profitability of our bond. While this quarter's renewal rate change of 7.1% remains well in excess of loss rent, it was a little lower sequentially. Let me provide a little more context around that.
A substantial majority of the decrease is attributable to a rational moderating of rate in our 2 specialty business units: excess casualty, which is inside middle market and national property. The moderation comes after 3 years of very strong compounding rate increases in these 2 businesses. So the tempering of rate is appropriate considering the improved return profile.
Also, while renewal retains was down sequentially for those businesses, rate increases were still in double digits. More broadly, the rate increases we are seeing across business insurance continue to be stable and widespread across both our lines of business and our distribution of accounts.
As illustrated on Slide 12, in our middle market and national property businesses, we achieved rate increases on 84% of the accounts that renewed in the second quarter, up from 81% in last year's second quarter. Given persistent loss pressures and low fixed income yields, we will continue to see great to further improve our margins. We will also continue to focus on all of the non-rate levers to improve the risk profile and profitability across our portfolio.
For example, in our National Property business, our underwriters continue to focus on improving terms and conditions, transaction by transaction. Changes in terms, like increased deductibles, management of sublimit and reinsurance optimization, are meaningful tools in enhancing our profitability and our underwriters continue to be active in utilizing all those levers.
As for the individual businesses, in Select, renewal rate change was 4.3%, more than 2 points higher than the second quarter of 2020, while retention was 80%. These results reflect deliberate execution as we pursue improved returns in certain segments of the business, and we're pleased with the progress we're making in this regard. Exposure growth was up over 4% for the quarter, which is an encouraging sign as the economy reopens.
Lastly, new business was up 6% over the prior year quarter, driven by the continued success of our new BOP 2.0 product, which is now live in 31 states. This daily BOP product includes industry-leading segmentation and a fast, easy quoting experience. We are encouraged with our agents adoption of the new products as both submissions and new policies are up.
In middle market, renewal premium change of over 9% and retention of 87% were both historically high. Renewal rate change at 7.4% remains strong and well in excess of loss trend. Finally, new business was up 16% over the prior year quarter, driven by success with larger accounts as well as some improvement in the quality of the flow in the market. As always, we remain disciplined around risk selection and underwriting.
To sum up, Business Insurance had a terrific quarter by all measures. We're pleased with our execution in further improving the underlying margins in the book, and we continue to invest in the business for long-term profitable growth.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom."

Turning to the top line. Net written premiums grew an exceptional 16% in the quarter, with solid contributions from all our businesses. In management liability, renewal premium change was a record 12.7%, driven by near record rate. Retention remained strong at 86%.

Journey also grew for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic, and international again posted meaningful growth, including strong retention and rate.

392856,718231742,2348037,"The Travelers Companies, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2021",2021-07-20,"Earnings Calls","The Travelers Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone.

We're very pleased with our second quarter Personal Insurance results. Segment income of $121 million was up $111 million from the prior year quarter, benefiting from lower catastrophes, higher net investment income and higher net favorable prior year reserve development. Partially offsetting these improvements was a lower underlying underwriting gain, which I will discuss in more detail in a moment.
Our second quarter combined ratio improved from the prior year quarter by about 1.5 points to 99.7%. Net written premiums grew 16%. Recall that in the prior year quarter, we provided $216 million of premium refunds to automobile customers in response to the impacts of the pandemic. Adjusting for these premium refunds, net written premiums grew a very strong 8%, with domestic homeowners up 12% and domestic automobile up 4%. 
Automobile delivered another excellent quarter with a combined ratio of 91.6%. The underlying combined ratio was an impressive 92%, although up 6 points from a prior year quarter, which reflected low loss activity during the initial months of the pandemic.
The current quarter results reflect the benefits of modestly lower claim frequency compared to pre-pandemic levels. As we exited the quarter, claim frequency was closer to pre-pandemic levels, and we would expect that trend to continue into the third quarter. Our strong current quarter profitability also reflects increased severity, particularly in collision and third-party physical damage claims, driven primarily by higher costs of used vehicles in. An auto loss experience approaches pre-pandemic levels, we plan to begin filing for rate increases in selected states later this year as we continue to balance business volumes and profitability. While it will take some time for future rate actions to earn into our results, we are well positioned to continue to be profitably grow in auto.
In Homeownes and Other, the second quarter combined ratio of 108.3% was 6 points lower than the prior year quarter, driven by a 13.5 point reduction in catastrophe losses. Partially offsetting the catastrophe favorability was an 8-point increase in the underlying combined ratio. Approximately 1/3 of this increase reflects non-catastrophe weather losses, which were in line with our expectations, but elevated over a less active prior year quarter.
The remainder of the increase reflects continued elevated frequency and severity of fire and non-weather water losses. The increased severity we saw in the second quarter includes higher repair costs due to a combination of labor and material increases. We continue to see rate increases in response to these trends, and we'll continue to actively monitor inflation and loss cost trend changes and factor them into our pricing and underwriting decisions.
Turning to quarterly production. Domestic automobile retention was up slightly to a strong 85%, new business increased by 19% and policies in force grew 4%. Domestic Homeowners and Other delivered another excellent quarter with retention remaining strong at 85%. Renewal premium change increasing to 8.2% and new business growth of 28%, reflective of increased quote activity and increase in average premium, along with the ongoing successful rollout of Quantum Home 2.0. Policies in force grew 7%. 
As Alan mentioned, our policies in force growth across both auto and homeowners are at record levels. Actually, our policies in force across both auto and homeowners are at record levels, reflecting our ongoing efforts to perform and transform in Personal Insurance. When we launched Quantum Auto 2.0, we designed it with a modular product structure to give customers what they need and to deliver long-term performance. This has enabled us to seamlessly introduce new rating variables such as vehicle history, prior insurance history and telematics, allowing us to continually improve our pricing segmentation.
Regarding telematics, we've seen take-up rates for IntelliDrive increased by 30% since the launch of our second-generation offering, which features a fully redesigned mobile experience, monitors distracted driving and improves our ability to match price to driving behavior. Our momentum in auto aligns very well with our goal of providing total account solutions for customers. The Quantum Home 2.0 product is now available in over 40 states, generating consistent growth in policies in force. Both distributors and customers continue to devalue in our combined auto and property offerings.
Our multichannel PI distribution strategy allows us to meet our customers where they are. As a result of the success of our new products, our existing relationships continue to perform well. Additionally, we've seen more demand for agent appointments, which is contributing meaningfully to our growth.
In order to serve customers how they want to be served, we are also investing in our digital capabilities. With advancements in our My Travelers mobile app, we continue to digitize the customer journey with over 600,000 customers already downloading the app since its launched earlier this year. Going forward, we will continue to invest in solutions that meet customers where they are, give them what they need and serve them how they want, while working with our distribution partners to deliver profitable growth.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Abbe."

As bittersweet as it is, we have one last piece of business this morning before we turn to Q&A.
I want to acknowledge and thank our partner and friend, Tom Kunkel, who will be retiring in September after a spectacular 37-year career at Travelers. Tom's impact as the leader of our very successful surety and management liability businesses has been profound.
In addition to delivering exceptional financial results over many years, Tom and his leadership team have fostered a culture of care, community and excellence that extends throughout our Bond & Specialty organization and throughout Travelers. It's one of the many reasons why I'm so pleased that Jeff Klink, currently a member of Tom's leadership team and head of our Management Liability business, will succeed Tom. Jeff has been at Travelers for more than 20 years. He's a proven leader and a perfect candidate to take the reigns from Tom. You'll hear from Jeff in October on our third quarter earnings call. Tom, we're all going to miss you personally and professionally.
And with that, we're happy to take your questions."

Frequency benefits for you seems to be lasting a little bit longer than some of your peers. Maybe that's a mix of business issue that you might have a little more preferred. Maybe you can confirm that? But what's driving -- if frequency is starting to come back to pre-pandemic levels and you expect that to continue, I guess, why not take rate now? Why wait till later in the year? And what's driving that need for rate? It's not frequency, maybe it is, is it more of the severity? So kind of a couple of pronged questions there, but more on the timing of the rate why now and then really kind of what's driving? Is it more of the frequency or severity that's driving your need for rate?"

Thanks for the question. Really, the timing is really just a function of the process. We're actively putting together filing packages and engage in conversations with state insurance departments as we speak. So it's not a question of waiting to get rate, it's just a function of the process of working with regulators to get rate increases filed and approved.
And to your question about frequency and severity, Again, I think in my comments about the quarter, in particular, we're seeing frequency coming out of the quarter, returning more towards prepandemic levels, and we are seeing severity pressure.
I spiked out some of the physical damage pressures. And I can give you just a quick example there, right? You've all seen the news about used car prices being up 50%, that particularly impacts us in the case of total losses, where the average cash value of that total loss is up pretty significantly. There's a little bit of an offsetting good guide there because we get more for the salvage recovery on that total vehicle. But net-net, that's putting upward pressure on severity. And that's one example. Total cost to repair vehicles is up. Both injury severity has also got upward pressure on it. So we're responding really to both frequency and severity to answer your question on the drivers."

And so we're in conversations with them about how to weight historical experience versus prospective views of trend. And also state-by-state experience varies. And our starting point varies by state.
We've talked in prior quarters about the fact that we did take rate reductions in over 20 states across the country. And so those are certainly some of the places we're looking initially to see if we should take some of that rate back, which is a different conversation maybe than in the state where we didn't file a rate decrease historically.

It's a great question, Ryan. I would say a couple of things.

It's a great question, Ryan. I would say a couple of things. First, in my remarks, I did talk about frequency and severity in particularly -- frequency and severity of fire and non-weather water losses driving some of that underlying deterioration. So clearly, the lumber prices are a severity item, not a frequency item. And we are seeing -- we did see upticks in the quarter in both. 
I would take just a quick step back as we're talking about auto and property, though, and just make a couple of observations and then come back and finish the answer to your question. If you take a step back and you look at the segment combined ratio on both an overall and an underlying basis, it's very consistent with the long run average for this business.
And when you look at the auto combined ratio, not surprisingly in the quarter, it still ran below the long-term average. And in property, in the quarter, the combined ratio is, call it, 4 to 6 points above those long-term averages on a total on an underlying basis. So that just sort of gives you a little bit of an order of the magnitude of what we're talking about here.
I'd also remind you that property -- in property, the combined ratio, the highest combined ratio we see in the year is in the second quarter. So you got to sort of put the second quarter into context. But that said, the severity pressure we saw in the quarter was a combination of labor and materials.
So certainly, the 50-plus percent increases in lumber are in there. Double-digit increase in roofing materials is in there. High single-digit to low double-digit increases in labor is in there. And when we look at our property loss cost mix, it's really labor, followed by content, followed by materials.
So even if -- the short answer to the question, I think, is even if lumber prices come back down, that's still a relatively small component of the loss cost. But we do see period-to-period volatility in frequency and severity in the attritional loss on properties. So again, that's part of why I give you that long-run view of where the quarter was relative to history.
And at the end of the day, we take a step back and we look at the renewal premium change we're driving in property, and our focus really is to continue to drive rate and property to address some of those pressures."

And are you trending off that elevated starting point? Or is your experience you're seeing or the experience we're seeing in this quarter an anomaly? 
I think if I broke apart frequency and severity for you, I'd say, again, we continue to see the frequency trending towards prepandemic levels, that's continuing. How much of the auto materials costs, physical damage, cost inflation is transitory or not is a key question. And there's a lot of varying opinions around that, and we'll factor our best estimate into that assessment as we factor in what we think we need for rate on a go-forward basis."

That said, we feel comfortable with the pricing levels that we've been putting business on the books. I mentioned IntelliDrive as a key driver of some of our growth. Distribution expansion has been a driver of some of our growth. There's a lot of things that you can point to, including elevated quote activity, that are drivers of growth in auto. We've seen some slight improvement in close rate in auto over the past few months as we've maintained RPC essentially flat.

There are some interesting aspects of the reinsurance business. They've got really thoughtful risk management tools. They're really thoughtful with risk and reward. So there's the potential for us to learn something in terms of managing our own cat portfolio.
And I will point out why it hasn't been, and I don't expect it to be any significant focus for us, we do write a little bit of reinsurance where it's complementary to our core business. So for example, we've got a boiler re business. So it's not completely formed to us. It's a very, very, very small part of what we do. It -- no change in strategic focus, but it's not alarming to us.

It really is a continuation of the conversation that we've been having it. With the way we've been managing it. I think -- we've talked a lot about California, in particular, in the context of wildfires, but certainly, the apparel is apparel that exposes us across more states in the west than just California.
So one specific development I would point you to in 2021 is we've extended our agreement with Wildfire Defense Systems to apply to Colorado, in addition to California. So we've got that sort of risk prevention partnership extending across an additional state in the West, which we think on the margin is helpful.
And then maybe just an update on our progress in California, in addition to the launch of the new product, which we successfully got in market in 2020, we're now converting California policies to that new product. So I think new pricing segmentation, think new rate level, think new eligibility as respect to wildfire exposure. And just last month, we got an additional 6.9% rate increase approved on the property product in the state. So we continue to manage through rate eligibility terms and conditions.
And we do continue to work our way through the nonrenewal activity subject to the lifting of the moratoriums as they expire, as another lever we're pulling. And again, a lot of those are specific California comments, but you can think about those in terms of, again, segmentation modeling, exposure management applying more broadly across the West."

392856,718231742,2348184,"The Travelers Companies, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2021",2021-07-20,"Earnings Calls","The Travelers Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are very pleased to report excellent underwriting and investment results for the second quarter and first half of the year.Core income for the quarter was $879 million or $3",819,"Thank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are very pleased to report excellent underwriting and investment results for the second quarter and first half of the year.
Core income for the quarter was $879 million or $3.45 per diluted share, generating a full return on equity of 13.7%. In terms of underwriting results, higher underlying underwriting income and net favorable prior year reserve development as well as a lower level of catastrophe losses, all contributed to higher core income. Underlying underwriting income was 8% higher than in the prior year quarter, driven by record net earned premiums of $7.6 billion and an excellent underlying combined ratio of 91.4%.  We are particularly pleased with a continued strong underlying fundamentals in each of our 3 business segments.
In Business Insurance, net earned premiums were higher and the underlying combined ratio improved by 3.7 points. On Specialty Insurance and Personal Insurance, both delivered meaningful increases in net earned premiums and continued strong margins.
Turning to investments. Our high-quality investment portfolio generated net investment income of $682 million after tax, reflecting very strong returns in our non-fixed income portfolio. These excellent results, together with our strong balance sheet, enabled us to grow adjusted book value per share by 13% over the past year, after making important investments for the future and returning significant excess capital to our shareholders.
During the quarter, we returned $625 million of excess capital to shareholders, including $401 million of share repurchases.
Turning to the topline. The combination of the strong franchise value we offer to our customers and distribution partners, together with excellent execution by our field organization, produced terrific results. During the quarter, we grew net written premiums to $8.1 billion, an increase of 11% or 8% after adjusting for the auto premium refunds in the prior year quarter. Each of our 3 segments contributed meaningfully to the topline growth.
In Business Insurance, net written premiums grew by 5%, driven by retention, which ticked up almost 1 point, renewal premium change at a near record high of 9.5% and 9% growth in new business. Combination of strong pricing and higher retention reflects continuing strength in the pricing environment.
Inside renewal premium change, pure renewal rate change was a strong 7.1%. Greg will share more detail about the texture underneath renewal rate change in a few minutes. Renewal premium change also included the highest exposure growth we've seen in 9 quarters, an encouraging sign of improvement in U.S. economic activity.
In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net written premiums increased by 16%, driven by a record renewal premium change of 12.7% in our management liability business, while retention remains strong.
In our commercial businesses, written pricing continues to comfortably outpace estimated loss trend, which will continue to benefit margins as it earns in. Continuing strong pricing and retentions reflect the industry's clear eye view of the ongoing headwinds impacting returns for the industry, including weather volatility, low interest rates and social inflation. We expect pricing to continue to outpace loss trends for some time.
Turning to Personal Insurance. Production was, again, excellent this quarter. Net written premiums increased 8% after adjusting for the auto premium refunds in the prior year quarter. Policies in force in both auto and homeowners are at record levels, driven by continuing strong retention and growth in new business.
While the impact of the pandemic on claim frequency seems to be attracting a lot of the tension when it comes to personal auto, we've been equally focused on applying our company-wide perform and transform mandate to this business. We are very pleased with the results. We've accelerated our domestic auto policies in-force growth from 1% to 4% over the last 6 quarters, bringing PIF count to a record high. This demonstrates the ongoing success of our 3-pronged strategy in personal insurance to meet customers where they are, serve them how they want and get them what they need. Going forward, we will continue to invest in advanced segmentation, multichannel distribution and providing great experiences to continue to deliver profitable growth. Mike will share more detail in a few minutes.
Our excellent top and bottom line results this quarter for the first half of the year demonstrate the continued successful execution of our strategy to grow the topline at attractive returns as well as the effectiveness of our well-defined and consistent investment philosophy.
Our focused and well-executed innovation agenda has been an important contributor to the growth and profitability we have achieved. We will continue to relentlessly pursue our priorities of extending our lead in risk expertise, providing great experiences to our customers, distribution partners and employees and improving productivity and efficiency. With the momentum we have and the best talents in the industry, we are well positioned to continue to create meaningful shareholder value over time.
And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan."
392856,718231742,2348184,"The Travelers Companies, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2021",2021-07-20,"Earnings Calls","The Travelers Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Alan. Core income for the second quarter was $879 million compared to a core loss of $50 million in the prior year quarter.

Core income for the second quarter was $879 million compared to a core loss of $50 million in the prior year quarter. The significant improvement was the result of positive factors across the business, including a lower level of catastrophe losses, improved results in our non-fixed income investment portfolio, more favorable prior year reserve development and increased underlying underwriting income.
Our second quarter results include $475 million of pretax cat losses compared to $854 million in last year's second quarter. This quarter's cats were somewhat below what we would have assumed for a typical second quarter, but year-to-date cat losses are still above what we would have assumed, given the high level of losses in the first quarter.
On a year-to-date basis, we have accumulated about $1.5 billion of qualifying losses toward the aggregate retention of $1.9 billion on our Property Aggregate Catastrophe XOL Treaty. The treaty provides $350 million of coverage on the first $500 million of losses above the aggregate retention amount. Underlying underwriting income increased 8% to $617 million pretax, reflecting a higher level of earned premium in each of our segments and a strong underlying combined ratio of 91.4% consistent with the prior year. As you'll hear from Greg, Tom and Michael improvements in the underlying combined ratio in both Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty were offset by an increase in the underlying combined ratio in Personal Insurance. Some of the increase in Personal Insurance was expected, given that last year's quarter benefited from unusually low auto losses as a result of the pandemic.
The underlying loss ratio came in at 61.7%, up 1.3 points from last year's second quarter as the beneficial impact of earned pricing in excess of loss trend was more than offset by the comparison to a very low pandemic-related personal auto loss ratio in the year ago quarter. Expense ratio of 29.7% is 1.3 points lower than the prior year quarter as last year's result was elevated primarily due to the premium refunds we provided to our personal auto customers.
Turning to prior year reserve development. In Personal Insurance, both auto and property losses came in better than expected for recent accident years, resulting in $65 million of pretax net favorable PYD. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, $44 million of pretax net favorable PYD was driven by favorable loss experience in surety and fidelity related to recent accident years. In Business Insurance, net favorable prior year reserve development of $73 million was driven by better-than-expected loss experience in workers' comp across multiple accident years, partially offset by reserve strengthening in our runoff book.
Net investment income improved to $682 million after tax this quarter. Our non-fixed income portfolio turned in particularly strong results this quarter, reflecting performance in the equity markets, contributing $265 million after tax. Consistent with our expectations, fixed income returns were down slightly from the prior year quarter as the benefit from higher levels of invested assets was more than offset by a decline in yields. For the remainder of 2021, we expect fixed income NII, including earnings from short-term securities, of between $425 million and $435 million after tax per quarter.
Turning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of $1.8 billion were again very strong. All our capital ratios were at or better than target levels, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $2.4 billion.
During the second quarter, we took advantage of favorable market conditions and raised $750 million to help fund future growth with a 30-year debt issuance at 3.05%, representing our second lowest 30-year coupon ever and achieving one of the tightest spreads ever for a 30-year note issued by an insurance company. The market value of the bonds in our portfolio generally rose as U.S. treasury yields declined and credit spreads tightened during the second quarter. And accordingly, our after-tax net unrealized investment gain increased from $2.8 billion as of March 31 to $3.2 billion at June 30. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses, was $103.88 at quarter end, up 4% since year-end and up 13% year-over-year.
We returned $625 million of capital to our shareholders during the second quarter, with $224 million of dividends and $401 million in share repurchases.
Coming back to reinsurance for a moment, let me direct your attention to Slide 20 of the webcast presentation for a summary of our July 1 renewals. The structure of our main cat reinsurance program is generally consistent with the prior year. We renewed our Northeast Cat Treaty effective July 1 with substantially similar terms and pricing that was up only slightly on an exposure-adjusted basis. Our Cat Bond, Long Point Re III, is now in the final year of its 4-year term. In the annual reset for the 2021 hurricane season, the attachment point was adjusted from $1.87 billion to $1.98 billion, while the total cost of the program was flat year-over-year. A more complete description of our cat reinsurance coverage, including our general cat aggregate XOL treaty that covers an accumulation of certain property losses arising from multiple occurrences, is included in our 10-Q, which we filed earlier today and in our 2020 Form 10-K.
Before turning the call over to Greg, I'd like to make a few comments about inflation as the consumer price index has got in a lot of tension lately. We are relatively less leveraged to overall CPI-type inflation as compared to, say, medical inflation and social inflation. One place CPI-type inflation can impact us is in our short tail lines.
Notwithstanding our strong profitability in PI, as you'll hear from Michael, we are experiencing a degree of elevated severity. However, relatively short payout periods in short tail lines limit the impact of that exposure. And although it takes time to earn in over the policy period, we can price for those increases reasonably quickly.
Additionally, it's important to remember that we have some natural hedges in our business that mitigate the effects of inflation. First, higher inflation is often associated with stronger economic activity as well as higher wages and asset values, all of which contribute to higher insured exposures. And as we've discussed before, higher exposure contributes to improved margins.
Second, although, we're not seeing it at the moment, to the extent interest rates are correlated to inflation, we would benefit from higher returns in our investment portfolio as inflation increases.
Finally, let me reiterate that we are conscious of the inflation environment and the uncertainties surrounding it when we establish our loss picks and our balance sheet reserves.
And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of Business Insurance."
392856,718231742,2348184,"The Travelers Companies, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2021",2021-07-20,"Earnings Calls","The Travelers Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dan. Business Insurance had a great quarter with strong financial results and terrific execution in the marketplace. Segment income was $643 million for the quarter compared to a loss of $58 million in the prior year quarter. Higher net investment",868,"Thanks, Dan. Business Insurance had a great quarter with strong financial results and terrific execution in the marketplace. Segment income was $643 million for the quarter compared to a loss of $58 million in the prior year quarter. Higher net investment income, lower catastrophe losses, higher underlying underwriting income and favorable prior year reserve development, all contributed to the year-over-year improvement.
We're particularly pleased with the underlying combined ratio of 93.3%, which improved by 3.7 points for the second quarter of 2020, primarily attributable to 3 things: First, about 2 points of the improvement resulted from earned pricing exceeding loss cost trends; another 0.5 point or so resulted from lower non-cat weather; and third, the improvement also reflects the comparison to the modest net charge we took in the prior year quarter related to the pandemic.
In terms of non-cat weather, while the year-over-year improvement was about 0.5 point favorable, as I just mentioned, this quarter's result was about 1.5 points better than what we assumed for the quarter.
Turning to the topline. Net written premiums were up 5%, benefiting from strong renewal premium change, including both strong renewal rate and exposure levels that are trending back to pre-pandemic levels and higher year-over-year new business volume. As for domestic production, renewal premium change was 9.5%, but historically high results and up almost 4 points from the second quarter of last year.
Underlying the Rtc, we achieved strong renewal rate change of 7.1% and healthy exposure growth that reflects an improving trends in our customers' outlook for their businesses. As Alan said, our ability to continue to achieve historically high pricing with improved retention speaks to the stability of pricing in the market. New business was up more than 9% with both Select and Middle Market contributing. I'll discuss those results in more detail in a moment when I get to the individual businesses.
We are very pleased with these aggregate production results and our marketplace execution. We've generated written pricing that has been in excess of estimated loss trend for some time now, resulting in significant improvement in the profitability of our bond. While this quarter's renewal rate change of 7.1% remains well in excess of loss trend, it was a little lower sequentially. Let me provide a little more context around that.
A substantial majority of the decrease is attributable to a rational moderating of rate in our 2 Specialty Business units: excess casualty, which is inside Middle Market and national property. The moderation comes after 3 years of very strong compounding rate increases in these 2 businesses. So the tempering of rate is appropriate considering the improved return profile.
Also, while renewal retains was down sequentially for those businesses, rate increases were still in double digits. More broadly, the rate increases we are seeing across business insurance continue to be stable and widespread across both our lines of business and our distribution of accounts.
As illustrated on Slide 12, in our Middle Market and National Property businesses, we achieved the rate increases on 84% of the accounts that renewed in the second quarter, up from 81% in last year's second quarter. Given persistent loss pressures and low fixed income yields, we will continue to see great to further improve our margins. We will also continue to focus on all of the non-rate levers to improve the risk profile and profitability across our portfolio.
For example, in our National Property business, our underwriters continue to focus on improving terms and conditions, transaction by transaction. Changes in terms, like increased deductibles, management of sublimit and reinsurance optimization, are meaningful tools in enhancing our profitability and our underwriters continue to be active in utilizing all those levers.
As for the individual businesses, in Select, renewal rate change was 4.3%, more than 2 points higher than the second quarter of 2020, while retention was 80%. These results reflect deliberate execution as we pursue improved returns in certain segments of the business, and we're pleased with the progress we're making in this regard. Exposure growth was up over 4% for the quarter, which is an encouraging sign as the economy reopens.
Lastly, new business was up 6% over the prior year quarter, driven by the continued success of our new BOP 2.0 product, which is now live in 31 states. This daily BOP product includes industry-leading segmentation and a fast, easy quoting experience. We are encouraged with our agents adoption of the new products as both submissions and new policies are up.
In Middle Market, renewal premium change of over 9% and retention of 87% were both historically high. Renewal rate change at 7.4% remains strong and well in excess of loss trend. Finally, new business was up 16% over the prior year quarter, driven by success with larger accounts as well as some improvement in the quality of the flow in the market. As always, we remain disciplined around risk selection and underwriting.
To sum up, Business Insurance had a terrific quarter by all measures. We're pleased with our execution in further improving the underlying margins in the book, and we continue to invest in the business for long-term profitable growth.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom."

Bond & Specialty posted excellent returns and growth in the quarter. Segment income was $187 million, considerably more than double the prior year quarter, driven by favorable prior year reserve development, a significantly improved underlying underwriting margin and higher business volumes. The underlying combined ratio of 83.4 improved by over 4.5 points from the prior year quarter as pricing that exceeded loss cost trends drove a lower underlying loss ratio.
Turning to the topline. Net written premiums grew an exceptional 16% in the quarter, with solid contributions from all our businesses. In management liability, renewal premium change was a record 12.7%, driven by near record rate. Retention remained strong at 86%. New business increased 6% from the second quarter of last year, our first quarterly increase since the beginning of the pandemic with strong new business pricing.
Journey also grew for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic, and international again posted meaningful growth, including strong retention and rate.
So Bond & Specialty results were excellent and reflect our ability to successfully manage this business through a variety of business and economic cycles.
And now I'll turn it over to Michael for Personal Insurance."
392856,718231742,2348184,"The Travelers Companies, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2021",2021-07-20,"Earnings Calls","The Travelers Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with our second quarter Personal Insurance results.

We're very pleased with our second quarter Personal Insurance results. Segment income of $121 million was up $111 million from the prior year quarter, benefiting from lower catastrophes, higher net investment income and higher net favorable prior year reserve development. Partially offsetting these improvements was a lower underlying underwriting gain, which I will discuss in more detail in a moment.
Our second quarter combined ratio improved from the prior year quarter by about 1.5 points to 99.7%. Net written premiums grew 16%. Recall that in the prior year quarter, we provided $216 million of premium refunds to automobile customers in response to the impacts of the pandemic. Adjusting for these premium refunds, net written premiums grew a very strong 8%, with domestic homeowners up 12% and domestic automobile up 4%.
Automobile delivered another excellent quarter with a combined ratio of 91.6%. The underlying combined ratio was an impressive 92%, although, up 6 points from a prior year quarter, which reflected low loss activity during the initial months of the pandemic.
The current quarter results reflect the benefits of modestly lower claim frequency compared to pre-pandemic levels. As we exited the quarter, claim frequency was closer to pre-pandemic levels, and we would expect that trend to continue into the third quarter. Our strong current quarter profitability also reflects increased severity, particularly in collision and third-party physical damage claims, driven primarily by higher costs of used vehicles and parts. As auto loss experience approaches pre-pandemic levels, we plan to begin filing for rate increases in selected states later this year as we continue to balance business volumes and profitability. While it will take some time for future rate actions to earn into our results, we are well positioned to continue to be profitably grow in auto.
In Homeowners and Other, the second quarter combined ratio of 108.3% was 6 points lower than the prior year quarter, driven by a 13.5 point reduction in catastrophe losses. Partially offsetting the catastrophe favorability was an 8-point increase in the underlying combined ratio. Approximately 1/3 of this increase reflects non-catastrophe weather losses, which were in line with our expectations, but elevated over a less active prior year quarter.
The remainder of the increase reflects continued elevated frequency and severity of fire and non-weather water losses. The increased severity we saw in the second quarter includes higher repair costs due to a combination of labor and material increases. We continue to seek rate increases in response to these trends, and we'll continue to actively monitor inflation and loss cost trend changes and factor them into our pricing and underwriting decisions.
Turning to quarterly production. Domestic automobile retention was up slightly to a strong 85%, new business increased by 19% and policies in-force grew 4%. Domestic Homeowners and Other delivered another excellent quarter with retention remaining strong at 85%. Renewal premium change increasing to 8.2% and new business growth of 28%, reflective of increased quote activity and increase in average premium, along with the ongoing successful rollout of Quantum Home 2.0. Policies in-force grew 7%.
As Alan mentioned, our policies in-force growth across both auto and homeowners are at record levels. Actually, our policies in-force across both auto and homeowners are at record levels, reflecting our ongoing efforts to perform and transform in Personal Insurance. When we launched Quantum Auto 2.0, we designed it with a modular product structure to give customers what they need and to deliver long-term performance. This has enabled us to seamlessly introduce new rating variables such as vehicle history, prior insurance history and telematics, allowing us to continually improve our pricing segmentation.
Regarding telematics, we've seen take-up rates for IntelliDrive increased by 30% since the launch of our second-generation offering, which features a fully redesigned mobile experience, monitors, distracted driving and improves our ability to match price to driving behavior. Our momentum in auto aligns very well with our goal of providing total account solutions for customers. The Quantum Home 2.0 product is now available in over 40 states, generating consistent growth in policies in-force. Both distributors and customers continue to see value in our combined auto and property offerings.
Our multichannel PI distribution strategy allows us to meet our customers where they are. As a result of the success of our new products, our existing relationships continue to perform well. Additionally, we've seen more demand for agent appointments, which is contributing meaningfully to our growth.
In order to serve customers how they want to be served, we are also investing in our digital capabilities. With advancements in our MyTravelers mobile app, we continue to digitize the customer journey with over 600,000 customers already downloading the app since its launched earlier this year. Going forward, we will continue to invest in solutions that meet customers where they are, give them what they need and serve them how they want, while working with our distribution partners to deliver profitable growth.

Question kind of centered around the timing of that.
Frequency benefits for you seems to be lasting a little bit longer than some of your peers. Maybe that's a mix of business issue that you might have a little more preferred. Maybe you can confirm that? 
But what's driving -- if frequency is starting to come back to pre-pandemic levels and you expect that to continue, I guess, why not take rate now? Why wait till later in the year? And what's driving that need for rate? If it's not frequency, maybe it is, is it more of the severity? So kind of a couple-pronged question here, but more on the timing of the rate why now and then really kind of what's driving?

Thanks for the question. Really, the timing is really just a function of the process. We're actively putting together filing packages and engaged in conversations with State Insurance Departments as we speak. So it's not a question of waiting to get rate, it's just a function of the process of working with regulators to get rate increases filed and approved.
And to your question about frequency and severity, Again, I think, in my comments about the quarter, in particular, we're seeing frequency coming out of the quarter, returning more towards pre-pandemic levels, and we are seeing severity pressure.
I spiked out some of the physical damage pressures. And I can give you just a quick example there, right? You've all seen the news about used car prices being up 50%, that particularly impacts us in the case of total losses, where the average cash value of that total loss is up pretty significantly. There's a little bit of an offsetting good guy there because we get more for the salvage recovery on that total vehicle. But net-net, that's putting upward pressure on severity. And that's one example. Total cost to repair vehicles is up. Injury severity has also got upward pressure on it. So we're responding really to both frequency and severity to answer your question on the drivers."

And so we're in conversations with them about how to weight historical experience versus prospective views of trend. And also state-by-state experience varies. And our starting point varies by state.
We've talked in prior quarters about the fact that we did take rate reductions in over 20 states across the country. And so those are certainly some of the places we're looking initially to see if we should take some of that rate back, which is a different conversation maybe than in the state where we didn't file a rate decrease historically.

It's a great question, Ryan. I would say a couple of things. First, in my remarks, I did talk about frequency and severity in particularly -- frequency and severity of fire and non-weather water losses driving some of that underlying deterioration.",419,"Sure. It's a great question, Ryan. I would say a couple of things. First, in my remarks, I did talk about frequency and severity in particularly -- frequency and severity of fire and non-weather water losses driving some of that underlying deterioration. So clearly, the lumber prices are a severity item, not a frequency item. And we are seeing -- we did see upticks in the quarter in both. 
I would take just a quick step back as we're talking about auto and property, though, and just make a couple of observations and then come back and finish the answer to your question. If you take a step back and you look at the segment combined ratio on both an overall and an underlying basis, it's very consistent with the long run average for this business.
And when you look at the auto combined ratio, not surprisingly in the quarter, it still ran below the long-term average. And in property, in the quarter, the combined ratio is, call it, 4 to 6 points above those long-term averages on a total on an underlying basis. So that just sort of gives you a little bit of an order of the magnitude of what we're talking about here.
I'd also remind you that property -- in property, the combined ratio, the highest combined ratio we see in the year is in the second quarter. So you got to sort of put the second quarter into context. But that said, the severity pressure we saw in the quarter was a combination of labor and materials.
So certainly, the 50-plus percent increases in lumber are in there. Double-digit increase in roofing materials is in there. High single-digit to low double-digit increases in labor is in there. And when we look at our property loss cost mix, it's really labor, followed by contents, followed by materials.
So even if -- the short answer to your question, I think, is even if lumber prices come back down, that's still a relatively small component of the loss cost. But we do see period-to-period volatility in frequency and severity in the attritional loss in properties. So again, that's part of why I give you that long-run view of where the quarter was relative to history.
And at the end of the day, we take a step back and we look at the renewal premium change we're driving in property, and our focus really is to continue to drive rate and property to address some of those pressures."

And are you trending off that elevated starting point? Or is your experience you're seeing or the experience we're seeing in this quarter an anomaly?
I think if I broke apart frequency and severity for you, I'd say, again, we continue to see the frequency trending towards pre-pandemic levels, that's continuing. How much of the auto materials costs, physical damage cost, inflation is transitory or not is a key question. And there's a lots of varying opinions around that, and we'll factor our best estimate into that assessment as we factor in what we think we need for rate on a go-forward basis."

We're actually not trying to forecast CPI or inflation generally, we're trying to forecast loss costs. And we do that by analyzing our own data and incorporating forecast from third-parties. And we do that on a very granular basis.
So take workers' comp, for example. We're not forecasting medical inflation, we're looking at components. So think prescription drug prices, durable medical equipment, et cetera. And we're doing that in the same mix that those loss costs contribute to our actual losses.
So it's hard -- I mean, obviously, we can't give you a single number, and it's hard to say, ""Gee, go look at this index or that index."" Because we're doing it on a very granular basis, in part by tumbling our own data, squaring triangles and by reference to third-party sources."

And the consequence of that is we can see it very quickly and react to it very quickly and contrast that to say social inflation, which was an issue for us a few years ago, where it takes a little bit longer for us, although I will say that I think as compared to many, we saw that very, very quickly. And there's not nearly as much leverage on the balance sheet. So there's not as much risk in the reserves, and we can price for it relatively quickly.

It really is a continuation of the conversation that we've been having with, in terms of the way we've been managing it, I think. We've talked a lot about California, in particular, in the context of wildfires, but certainly, the apparel is apparel that exposes us across more states in the west than just California.
So one specific development I would point you to in 2021 is we've extended our agreement with Wildfire Defense Systems to apply to Colorado, in addition to California. So we've got that sort of risk prevention partnership extending across an additional state in the West, which we think on the margin is helpful.
And then maybe just an update on our progress in California, in addition to the launch of the new product, which we successfully got in market in 2020, we're now converting California policies to that new product. So I think new pricing, segmentation, I think new rate level, I think new eligibility as respect to wildfire exposure. And just last month, we got an additional 6.9% rate increase approved on the property product in the state. So we continue to manage through rate eligibility terms and conditions.
And we do continue to work our way through the nonrenewal activity subject to the lifting of the moratoriums as they expire, as another lever we're pulling. And again, a lot of those are specific California comments, but you can think about those in terms of, again, segmentation modeling, exposure management applying more broadly across the West."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're pleased to report strong top and bottom line results for the quarter and the first 9 months of the year, including very strong underwriting profitability and healthy top li",1238,"Thank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're pleased to report strong top and bottom line results for the quarter and the first 9 months of the year, including very strong underwriting profitability and healthy top line growth. Core income year-to-date of $2.2 billion is about $800 million higher year-over-year, generating core return on equity of 11.6%. Core income for the quarter was $655 million or $2.60 per diluted share, generating core return on equity of 10.1% despite a high level of catastrophe losses. Our cat losses were well below our market share, well above the prior year quarter and the 10-year average for the quarter. Underlying underwriting income of $632 million pretax was 6% higher than in the prior year quarter, driven by record net earned premiums of $7.8 billion and a very strong underlying combined ratio of 91.4%. We are particularly pleased with the continued strong underlying fundamentals in our commercial businesses. The underlying combined ratio improved by almost 4 points in business insurance and more than 5 points in Bond & Specialty Insurance. 
As you'll hear in a few minutes from Michael, underlying results in Personal Insurance were impacted by auto frequency returning to pre-pandemic levels and elevated severity in both auto and property due to higher costs for labor and materials. Our consolidated results demonstrate the value of having a diversified group of businesses. 
Turning to investments. Our high-quality investment portfolio generated net investment income of $645 million after tax, reflecting reliable performance in our fixed income portfolio and very strong returns in our nonfixed income portfolio. These results, together with our strong balance sheet and cash flow enable us to grow adjusted book value per share by 10% over the past year after making important investments for the future and returning significant excess capital to our shareholders. During the quarter, we returned $821 million of excess capital to shareholders, including $601 million of share repurchases. 
Turning to the top line. Net written premiums grew 7% to a record $8.3 billion. Each of our 3 segments again contributed meaningfully to the top line growth. In Business Insurance, net written premiums grew by 5% with renewal premium change of 9.9%, up more than 200 basis points year-over-year and near an all-time high. Renewal premium change was driven by continued strong renewal rate change and higher exposure growth. Importantly, at the same time, retention was also higher. Our ability to continue to drive price change at historical highs, while increasing retention, reflects excellent marketplace execution and the stability of the pricing environment. 
In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net written premiums increased by 19%, driven by record renewal premium change of 13.6% in our management liability business and continued strong retention. We are also pleased to report strong production in our surety business. In our commercial businesses, written pricing continues to outpace estimated loss trend, which will continue to benefit margins as it earns in. Given social and other inflation, the frequency and severity of weather-related loss activity and the low interest rate environment, we expect the pricing environment to remain strong. 
In Personal Insurance, net written premiums increased by 7%. Policies in force in both auto and homeowners were at record levels, driven by continued strong retention and growth in new business. Before I wrap up on results, I'd like to spend a minute discussing how our leading data and analytics and risk expertise contributed to our relatively favorable loss experience with Hurricane IDA. As I shared in our first quarter earnings call, our share of the industry's property cat losses over the past 5 years have been meaningfully lower than our corresponding market share. And while there is always the potential for us to have outsized exposure to an event, it was no accident that we again outperformed in Hurricane Ida. Our leading underwriting expertise supported by cutting-edge data analytics are key to an effective assessment of risk and reward. For us, third-party models are a starting point for our more advanced proprietary cat modeling. At the portfolio level, the insights from our models warned us away from the coast to our item at landfall, given the impediments to achieving an appropriate risk-adjusted return. 
In the other states who are on Ida's path, we effectively managed risk selection, pricing and other terms and conditions by putting sophisticated data and analytics at the fingertips of our frontline underwriters. These include robust flood risk scoring, location intelligence down to the parcel level, hill dashboards and output from our risk control engineers. 
Within Personal Insurance, we continue to see the benefits from our highly segmented Quantum Home 2.0 product, which is now rolled out in more than 40 states. In the northeast, extreme rainfall from Ida resulted in significant claim activity for the industry, including from water and drainage backup, which is a coverage we provide in our QH 2.0 product. The model underneath the product leverages data and analytics to underwrite and price that coverage on a very granular basis. 
In addition to underwriting, data and analytics are increasingly informing our claims handling strategies. For example, our AI-assisted claim damage detection model  was a key part of our eye to claim response. This model uses AI and high-resolution aerial imagery to detect the extensive damage to individual properties as soon as a day after an event. 
Within 2 days of impact, we were collecting and analyzing aerial imagery of customer properties along IDA's path as it moved across 20 states. This enabled us to remotely identify which of our customers' properties had sustained exterior damage and effectively organize our claim response. 
In some cases, we can use this technology to adjust and pay total washes, before the customer has even been able to return to their homes. We also utilized other virtual abilities in our IDA response, such as image share and live video capture on a majority of claim with interior damage. These leading-edge capabilities enhance the claim experience for our customers by cutting significant time out of the claim process, expediting an accurate loss assessment and in many cases, eliminating the need for physical inspection. 
Again, with IDA, we've successfully closed 90% of all homeowners claims within 30 days. All of this also results in a more fine outcome for our shareholders. As strategic as the data and analytics are, maybe even more important is the culture that brings it all together, our collaborative approach to developing a holistic 360-degree view of risk incorporating underwriting team, actuarial, risk control, legal and regulatory input is an important differentiating factor in effectively managing risk and reward. That culture is decades in the making and very hard to replicate. 
Before I turn the call over to Dan, I'd like to welcome Jeff President of our Bond & Specialty Insurance segment to the call. As I shared last quarter, Jeff is a 22-year veteran of Travelers, most recently as a member of Tom Comp's leadership team and Head of our Management Liability business. Jeff succeeded Tom following his retirement last month. We're fortunate to have Jeff in the role, and you'll hear from him in a few minutes. 
To 
sum it up, we're pleased with our results for the quarter and year-to-date. Our significant and hard-to-replicate competitive advantages position us very well to continue to deliver meaningful shareholder value over time. 
And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan."

Core income for the third quarter was $655 million compared to $798 million in the prior year quarter. For the quarter, core return on equity was 10.1%. And on a year-to-date basis, core ROE was 11.6%. The decline in core income was drive",999,"Thank you, Alan. Core income for the third quarter was $655 million compared to $798 million in the prior year quarter. For the quarter, core return on equity was 10.1%. And on a year-to-date basis, core ROE was 11.6%. The decline in core income was driven by prior year reserve development and catastrophe losses. 
Recall that last year's PYD benefited by approximately $400 million of subrogation recoveries from PG&E. Most unfavorable year-over-year comparisons were partially offset by increased investment income and a higher level of underlying underwriting income. 
Underlying income increased 6% to $632 million pretax, reflecting a higher level of earned premium in all 3 segments and a strong underlying combined ratio of 91.4%. Improvements in the underlying combined ratio in both Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty were offset by an increase in the underlying combined ratio in Personal Insurance. 
Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty results both reflected the benefit of our pricing efforts as earned price continues to exceed loss trend. We expected a higher underlying combined ratio in Personal Insurance, given that last year's quarter benefited from unusually low auto losses related to the pandemic. As Alan mentioned, the underlying combined ratio in PI was further impacted by higher severity in both the auto and homeowners products. Greg, Jeff and Michael will provide more detail on each segment's results in a few minutes. 
On a consolidated basis, the underlying loss ratio for the quarter improved slightly to 62% compared with last year's 62.2%. The expense ratio of 29.4% was in line with the prior year quarter and in line with our expectations. We've improved the expense ratio by more than 2 points from where we were 5 years ago, having added roughly $7 billion to our annual net written premiums over that period while maintaining a focus on productivity and efficiency all while adding significantly to the level of strategic investment we're making to ensure our future success. 
Before turning to catastrophe losses, I wanted to point out that within our underlying combined ratio, non-cat weather was higher than we would have assumed for the quarter, although lower than the unusually high levels we experienced in last year's third quarter. 
Our third quarter cat losses were $501 million pretax compared to $397 million a year ago. Remember that in last year's third quarter, we had a full recovery under the property aggregate catastrophe XOL treaty. In this year's third quarter, we recognized a partial recovery of $95 million from the treatment, $83 million benefiting the cat line with $43 million in Business Insurance and $39 million in Personal Insurance and $12 million benefiting our underlying results with $3 million in business insurance and $9 million in Personal Insurance. That leaves us with $255 million of potential recovery in the fourth quarter, depending on the level of qualifying losses we actually experience. 
In terms of the level of cat losses relative to our assumptions, third quarter cats were elevated compared to what we would have assumed for a typical third quarter. Although our losses from Hurricane Ida are well below our relative market share, the sheer size of IDA on top of the other cat losses in the quarter resulted in overall cat losses that were higher than our assumption. 
Turning to prior year reserve development. In Personal Insurance, $30 million of pretax net favorable PYD resulted from better-than-expected experience from recent years in the property line. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, $22 million of pretax net favorable PYD was driven by favorable loss experience in the surety product line for recent accident years. In Business Insurance, net unfavorable PYD was $108 million pretax. Our annual asbestos review resulted in a charge of $225 million, as the level of claim activity did not decline as much as we had assumed in our previous estimate. 
Excluding the asbestos charge, Business Insurance had net favorable prior year reserve development of $117 million, driven primarily by better-than-expected loss experience in workers' comp across multiple accident years. Net investment income improved to $645 million after tax this quarter. Our non-fixed income portfolio delivered another strong result, contributing $224 million after tax. 
As you can see from the detail provided on Page 6 of the webcast presentation, our recent results in the non-fixed income portfolio have been unusually strong, and I would caution you that this level of returns is not likely to continue. 
Consistent with our expectations, fixed income returns were down slightly from the prior year quarter as the benefit from higher levels of invested assets was more than offset by a decline in yields. For the fourth quarter of 2021, we expect NII from the fixed income portfolio, including earnings from short-term securities of between $425 million and $435 million after tax. For 2022, we expect that figure to be between $420 million and $430 million per quarter. 
Turning to capital management. Operating cash flow for the quarter of $2.5 billion was an all-time record. All our capital ratios were at or better than target levels, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $2 billion. 
The market value of the bonds in our fixed income portfolio declined as U.S. treasury yields increased and credit spreads widened during the quarter. Accordingly, our after-tax net unrealized investment gain decreased from $3.2 billion as of June 30 to $2.7 billion at September 30. 
Adjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses, was $104.77 at quarter end, up 5% since year-end and up 10% since September 30 of last year. We returned $821 million of capital to our shareholders during the third quarter with $220 million of dividends and $601 million in share repurchases. Overall, a very good quarter for us with healthy top line growth, strong and improved underlying margins in our commercial businesses, excellent cash flows and a terrifically strong balance sheet. 
And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of Business Insurance."

Business Insurance had another great quarter with strong financial results and terrific execution in the marketplace. Segment income was $558 million for the quarter, up more than 50% from the prior year quarter. The improved year-over-year result was driven by higher underlying underwriting income, prior year reserve development and higher net investment income, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses. 
We're once again particularly pleased with the underlying combined ratio of 90.2%, which improved by 3.8 points from the third quarter of 2020, primarily attributable to 3 things. First, about 2 points of the improvement resulted from earned pricing that continued to exceed loss cost trends. The other nearly 2 points resulted from a combination of a favorable impact associated with the pandemic and a lower level of property losses. 
Turning to the top line. Net written premiums were up 5%, benefiting from strong renewal rate and exposure levels as well as high retentions. As for domestic production, renewal premium change was once again historically high at 9.9%, while retention increased to an exceptional 85%. The 9.9% renewal premium change was up more than 2 points from the third quarter of last year, with strong renewal rate change of 6.3% and continued improvement in our customers' exposure growth. 
In addition to our granular price execution, we've also focused on careful management of deductibles, attachment points, limits, sub-limits and exclusions, which can also contribute to an increase in the price per unit of risk. The business was down from the prior year quarter as we continue to be thoughtful about balancing risk and reward for new business in the marketplace. 
As for the individual businesses, in Select, renewal premium change was a strong 9.7% while retention improved from recent periods to 82%. Underneath RPC renewal rate change was 4.1%, up well over 1 point from the third quarter of 2020. We're also encouraged with the improving exposure, which was up about 3 points as the economy continues to reopen. 
New business was up a bit from the prior year, driven by the continued success of our new BOP 2.0 product, which is now live in 39 states. In middle market, renewal premium change of 9.5% and retention of 88% were both historically high. Renewal rate change of 6.2% remains strong. As always, we remain disciplined around risk selection and underwriting. 
To sum up, Business Insurance had another terrific quarter. We're pleased with our execution in further improving the underlying margins in the and we continue to invest in the business for long-term profitable growth. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to our new partner in the room, Jeff"

I'm very pleased to be here. We've built an industry-leading surety and management liability franchise, and we look forward to continuing to perform, innovate and transform to profitably grow these businesses into the future. 
Turning to the results. Bond & Specialty delivered excellent returns and growth in the quarter. Segment income was $174 million, up about 50% compared to the prior year quarter, driven by the impact of higher net earned premium, a significantly improved underlying underwriting margin and favorable prior year reserve development. 
The underlying combined ratio of 83.4% improved by 5.5 points from the prior year quarter, reflecting lower pandemic-related loss activity, earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends and a lower expense ratio. Turning to the top line. Net written premiums grew an exceptional 19% in the quarter, with strong contributions from all our businesses. 
In domestic management liability, renewal premium change was a record 13.6%, driven by record renewal rate change. Retention remained strong at 86%, consistent with recent quarters, but down a few points year-over-year as we continue to nonrenew cyber policies for accounts that don't meet our updated minimum requirements for cyber hygiene. Notably, research indicates that implementing affordable cyber risk mitigation controls, such as multifactor authentication, could prevent the vast majority of ransom attacks. 
Domestic surety also posted strong growth relative to the pandemic impact of prior year quarter. In addition, our international businesses again posted excellent growth, including strong management liability retention and rate. So both top and bottom line results for Bond & Specialty were terrific this quarter, demonstrating our thoughtful approach and strong execution across our businesses. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Michael."
392856,1681178884,2407390,"The Travelers Companies, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2021",2021-10-19,"Earnings Calls","The Travelers Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and welcome.

Segment income declin",715,"Thanks, Jeff, and welcome. Good morning, everyone. In Personal Insurance, bottom line results were impacted by weather or return to pre-pandemic claim frequency in auto and higher loss severity impacting both auto and home results. 
Segment income declined by $394 million from the prior year quarter, $262 million of that decline is attributable to lower favorable prior year reserve development as the prior year quarter benefited from the PG&E settlement Dan referenced. The remaining unfavorable variance was primarily driven by lower underlying underwriting results. Our underlying combined ratio increased by 6.5 points to 95.2%. We were pleased to see our top line momentum continue in the quarter with net written premiums up 7%. 
Automobile underwriting results reflected higher loss levels for the quarter. The combined ratio was 100% and included 3.4 points of catastrophe losses, mostly from Hurricane Ida. The underlying combined ratio was 97%, up approximately 15 points from a prior year quarter, which reflected unusually low loss activity due to the pandemic. 
The underlying combined ratio increased mainly due to claims frequency effectively returning to pre-pandemic levels in line with the trend we referenced in our prior quarter call. To a lesser degree, higher loss severity impacted the combined ratio as well as vehicle replacement and repair costs remained at elevated levels. We believe these profitability challenges are environmental. 
And in response, we are executing on our plan to file rate increases in about 40 days over the next 3 quarters. As we indicated last quarter, it will take time for future rate actions to earn into results, but we do expect to have higher rates in market in several states by year-end. 
In Homeowners and Other, the third quarter combined ratio increased by 16 points from the prior year quarter to 109.3%, driven by a 24-point reduction in net favorable prior year reserve development, primarily related to the PG&E recovery from last year. The combined ratio included 17.6 points of catastrophe losses, mostly from Hurricane Ida. Homeowners catastrophe losses were 4.7 points below a very active prior year quarter. 
The underlying combined ratio was 93.3%, an improvement of 3.5 points over the prior year quarter, which experienced a very high level of loss activity. That said, the underlying combined ratio was above our expectations, reflecting elevated non-catastrophe weather and nonweather loss activity, both of which included higher severity related to a combination of labor materials price increases. Again, we believe these trends are environmental, and we continue to see price increases in response. 
Before I shift to discussing production, I'll remind you that looking ahead to the fourth quarter, there tends to be a good amount of seasonality in our combined ratio results by line of business, with the fourth quarter auto losses typically higher and fourth quarter homeowners loss is typically lower than their annual average levels. 
Turning to production. We were very pleased to deliver another strong quarter in both auto and home. Automobile policies in force grew 5% to a record level, driven by strong retention at 85% and continued growth in new business, which increased by 8%. Renewal premium change was essentially flat, reflecting the continued impact of the rate increases we filed in response to the pandemic. 
Domestic Homeowners and Other delivered another excellent quarter with policies in force up 7%, also to a record level, driven by retention of 85% and new business growth of 5%. Renewal premium change increased to 8.8%. 
In the quarter, we continued to deliver solutions that meet customers where they are, give them what they need and serve them how they want. A couple of highlights from the quarter include: our new digital self-inspection process for property customers, which improves their onboarding experience and provides valuable information to our underwriters; and IntelliDrive, our proprietary auto telematics offering, which now has distracted driving as a rating variable in 40 U.S. markets and Ontario, Canada, providing valuable feedback to drivers and continuing to advance our sophisticated pricing segmentation in automobile. We will continue to invest in new capabilities like these for our customers and distribution partners. 
Despite a challenging third quarter on the bottom line, we remain pleased with our overall performance, and we are well positioned to profitably grow our business over time. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Abbe."

You're very narrowly, I think, focusing on rate versus loss trend. And by the way, there's still a margin there. And even if you look at pure rate over some long historical period, the week we continue to get is actually a pretty good number. But if you look at the overall pricing number, I mean, at 9.9, that's practically an all-time high, and there's a lot of margin in that exposure. So we continue to see a nice spread between written price and loss trend. I do think that's the right way to think about it. 
Nonetheless, as we -- we know what our product returns are. We know what headwinds are. We know what our objectives are in terms of our returns, and we know what we need to do. So I think that from here, pricing will continue to be strong. Now we've also been getting pretty good pricing for some time now, and it's been compounding for a while. And so you've got different lines in different places. Some need more help than others. 
And so from here, the rate of increase is going to be impacted by that. So some lines are -- the rate of increase will be higher. Some will go sideways. Some still be an increase, but the rate of increase may go down. But overall, we continue to expect pricing to remain strong. I'm not sure we're going to put much more dimension around it other than that. But hopefully, that gives you some color to the top."

So to dimensionalize that a little bit more for you, the auto underlying combined was up 15 points in the quarter. We'd say 3/4 of that was loss experience returning to pre-pandemic levels, and about 1/4 of out -- remaining 1/4 of that is -- the rent increased cost to repair and replace that we talked about last quarter that essentially continued into the quarter. 
In terms of how long it's going to last, I can point you to a little bit of external data that might help there. There's certainly pressure on the system, right? A lot of the costs relates to total losses and replacement cost values for total vehicles, which tracks pretty closely with used car prices. And inside the quarter, we were actually encouraged by the July and August data from places like the Moody's used car price index that looked like the peak had happened in May and June and was starting to decline in the first part of the quarter. Now that data ticked back up again in September. And I think it's kick back up reflects the pressure on the system. 
You had IDA occur in the quarter. Estimates are that over 200,000 vehicles were destroyed in that event at the same time that you have vehicle inventories in the U.S. at historic lows. And so I think we're going to see continued pressure on the cost of repair and replace related to supply chain, related to labor and related to used car parts and prices. But again, that was about 1/4 of the 15 points, and we will factor that into our underwriting pricing decisions as we move forward."

You're right in terms of the impact on Business Insurance from the pandemic. 
Last year, in the third quarter, we gave you that the favorable impact was about 0.5 point and that was the net of direct charges that we took related to COVID, things like workers' comp charges for COVID-19, somebody contracts the disease and that was more than offset by indirect impacts, things like lower frequency on commercial auto. 
This year, you've got a larger net impact, but it's really the impact of the absence of those direct charges. We're not seeing that anywhere near the same level we saw a year ago.

And before I address the question, I think I may have misspoken the in the script. I think I said that auto RPC was impacted by the rate increases we valued in response to the pandemic. Obviously, we didn't file rate increases in response to the pandemic. Those were rate decreases, which, by the way, I think, is relevant to your question, right? 
So as we are in the conversations with regulators, which are active and ongoing, as we speak, we're in conversations with them about that loss history. We're also in conversations with them about the actions we took in response, which included rate decreases in a variety of jurisdictions, which included premium refunds to customers in a variety of jurisdictions. And so we're having conversations with them around how we align pricing with loss costs over time and engage in discussions with them about how to view the 2020 loss experience in that context. 
If I take a step back and think about the process a little bit more broadly, what we would say about the process of getting rate is that it is an ongoing dialogue between us and the regulators. It's about an exchange of information to justify the pricing that you think you need on a go-forward basis. And generally speaking, what we have found is we've been able to get to a point where we can align price with loss cost over time. 
You'll have some challenging conversations in some jurisdictions and maybe less challenging conversations in others. To put a little bit of a point on the 40 jurisdictions, we do expect some of those increases to become effective in Q4 and actually a couple of them literally this month. So we're on the way to getting those increases filed and approved. And then as we've talked about, it will take time for them to get written and then earned into the book of business, but we're making progress."

We generally, I would say, are going to be impacted by commuting patterns that are more related to office jobs when you think about the general profile of our preferred book. I think the other dynamic you see in a preferred book though is newer vehicles with more technology. And so when you think about some of the cost pressures on repair and replacement costs, that's going to put upward pressure there. 
And I would say that while we saw, I think, some differences over the past 12 to 18 months that you could sort of point to in different parts of the country, different books of business in terms of how the pandemic impacted different segments differently, as we sit here today, the economy is broadly recovering. The country is broadly recovering. So you don't see quite as many differences, I don't think, geographically or by segment that are driving differences in loss experience across the segments of the industry. 
The other thing that's true of our book of business is it's heavily rounded. And so it's -- while we talk a lot about the individual lines of business, we certainly look at customers in the total portfolio as we look to manage it."

But mileage broadly, when you look at Department of Transportation data, again, our IntelliDrive data, MS2 sensor data is back to pre-pandemic levels as is frequency. So again, the mix looks a little bit different, but miles driven trips broadly are back sort of close to where they had been.

So there's a fairly long tail on the front end of any rate filing process up or down. And so we really wouldn't have expected any of those increases to take effect in the third quarter. As I mentioned, we've got 40 planned over the course of the next 3 quarters. And a couple -- 2 or 3 will likely take effect this month on several, call it, another handful of take effect probably before year-end, again, all subject to getting approvals from the states that we are working towards those effective dates with and then the remainder will be in the first or second quarter of next year. 
The few that we have likely to take effect in the back half of this year will represent 25%, 30% of the written premium volume we have across the country. So it's a relatively small number, but it should be impactful on a written basis. But again, I'll just caution you, it takes time for that to earn into the book.

Certainly, there are conversations that linked to 2. I guess I'd start by separating the 2, right? There are certainly conversations with state regulators and a handful, I would say, that are talking about and are actively pursuing the removal of credit scoring as a variable in pricing auto insurance. 
The 2 most notable are Washington and Colorado. Colorado has a bill that was approved by the state legislature that's in the rulemaking process around removing credit score in that state. In the State of Washington, again, pretty widely followed, but commission acquired here issued an emergency rule to ban the use of credit scoring in auto insurance. That emergency rule was actually just overturned by a judge in Washington earlier this month. We're in the process, and that -- the overturn by the judge is now being challenged by the commissioner. So there's a back and forth in Washington. Those are probably the 2 most widely viewed views on credit scoring. 
As respect to credit scoring and telematics, what we would say is, first of all, credit is a powerful variable in pricing auto insurance. It's very predictive of claim experience. And if you remove it then you have subsidization in your rate plan between higher risk drivers and lower risk drivers. And in fact, in the context of a telematics program, the credit score and the telematics data are powerful together. 
If you're in a situation where you don't have credit and can't use credit, telematics is very valuable, probably becomes increasingly valuable. And in that kind of a world, we're encouraged by the capability we've got, the tools we have, the success of our IntelliDrive program and the power that it has in segmenting loss experience and helping us segment pricing."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're pleased to report strong top and bottom line results for the quarter and the first 9 months of the year, including very strong underwriting profitability and healthy top li",1238,"Thank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're pleased to report strong top and bottom line results for the quarter and the first 9 months of the year, including very strong underwriting profitability and healthy top line growth. Core income year-to-date of $2.2 billion is about $800 million higher year-over-year, generating core return on equity of 11.6%. Core income for the quarter was $655 million or $2.60 per diluted share, generating core return on equity of 10.1% despite a high level of catastrophe losses. Our cat losses were well below our market share, well above the prior year quarter and the 10-year average for the quarter. Underlying underwriting income of $632 million pretax was 6% higher than in the prior year quarter, driven by record net earned premiums of $7.8 billion and a very strong underlying combined ratio of 91.4%. We are particularly pleased with the continued strong underlying fundamentals in our commercial businesses. The underlying combined ratio improved by almost 4 points in business insurance and more than 5 points in Bond & Specialty Insurance. 
As you'll hear in a few minutes from Michael, underlying results in Personal Insurance were impacted by auto frequency returning to pre-pandemic levels and elevated severity in both auto and property due to higher costs for labor and materials. Our consolidated results demonstrate the value of having a diversified group of businesses. 
Turning to investments. Our high-quality investment portfolio generated net investment income of $645 million after tax, reflecting reliable performance in our fixed income portfolio and very strong returns in our nonfixed income portfolio. These results, together with our strong balance sheet and cash flow enable us to grow adjusted book value per share by 10% over the past year after making important investments for the future and returning significant excess capital to our shareholders. During the quarter, we returned $821 million of excess capital to shareholders, including $601 million of share repurchases. 
Turning to the top line. Net written premiums grew 7% to a record $8.3 billion. Each of our 3 segments again contributed meaningfully to the top line growth. In Business Insurance, net written premiums grew by 5% with renewal premium change of 9.9%, up more than 200 basis points year-over-year and near an all-time high. Renewal premium change was driven by continued strong renewal rate change and higher exposure growth. Importantly, at the same time, retention was also higher. Our ability to continue to drive price change at historical highs, while increasing retention, reflects excellent marketplace execution and the stability of the pricing environment. 
In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net written premiums increased by 19%, driven by record renewal premium change of 13.6% in our management liability business and continued strong retention. We are also pleased to report strong production in our surety business. In our commercial businesses, written pricing continues to outpace estimated loss trend, which will continue to benefit margins as it earns in. Given social and other inflation, the frequency and severity of weather-related loss activity and the low interest rate environment, we expect the pricing environment to remain strong. 
In Personal Insurance, net written premiums increased by 7%. Policies in force in both auto and homeowners were at record levels, driven by continued strong retention and growth in new business. Before I wrap up on results, I'd like to spend a minute discussing how our leading data and analytics and risk expertise contributed to our relatively favorable loss experience with Hurricane IDA. As I shared in our first quarter earnings call, our share of the industry's property cat losses over the past 5 years have been meaningfully lower than our corresponding market share. And while there is always the potential for us to have outsized exposure to an event, it was no accident that we again outperformed in Hurricane Ida. Our leading underwriting expertise supported by cutting-edge data analytics are key to an effective assessment of risk and reward. For us, third-party models are a starting point for our more advanced proprietary cat modeling. At the portfolio level, the insights from our models warned us away from the coast to our item at landfall, given the impediments to achieving an appropriate risk-adjusted return. 
In the other states who are on Ida's path, we effectively managed risk selection, pricing and other terms and conditions by putting sophisticated data and analytics at the fingertips of our frontline underwriters. These include robust flood risk scoring, location intelligence down to the parcel level, hill dashboards and output from our risk control engineers. 
Within Personal Insurance, we continue to see the benefits from our highly segmented Quantum Home 2.0 product, which is now rolled out in more than 40 states. In the northeast, extreme rainfall from Ida resulted in significant claim activity for the industry, including from water and drainage backup, which is a coverage we provide in our QH 2.0 product. The model underneath the product leverages data and analytics to underwrite and price that coverage on a very granular basis. In addition to underwriting, data and analytics are increasingly informing our claims handling strategies. For example, our AI-assisted claim damage detection model was a key part of our Ida claim response. This model uses AI and high-resolution aerial imagery to detect the extensive damage to individual properties as soon as a day after an event. Within 2 days of impact, we were collecting and analyzing aerial imagery of customer properties along Ida's path as it moved across 20 states. This enabled us to remotely identify which of our customers' properties had sustained exterior damage and effectively organize our claim response.  
In some cases, we can use this technology to adjust and pay total losses before the customer has even been able to return to their homes. We also utilized other virtual abilities in our Ida response, such as image share and live video capture on a majority of claims with interior damage. These leading-edge capabilities enhance a claim experience for our customers by cutting significant time out of the claim process, expediting an accurate loss assessment, and in many cases, eliminating the need for physical inspection. Again, with Ida, we've successfully closed 90% of all homeowners claims within 30 days. All of this also results in a more efficient outcome for our shareholders. As strategic as the data and analytics are, maybe even more important is the culture that brings it all together, our collaborative approach to developing a holistic 360-degree view of risk incorporating underwriting claim, actuarial, risk control, legal and regulatory input is an important differentiating factor in effectively managing risk and reward. That culture is decades in the making and very hard to replicate.  
Before I turn the call over to Dan, I'd like to welcome Jeff Klenk President of our Bond & Specialty Insurance segment to the call. As I shared last quarter, Jeff is a 22-year veteran of Travelers, most recently as a member of Tom Kunkel's leadership team and Head of our Management Liability business. Jeff succeeded Tom following his retirement last month. We're fortunate to have Jeff in the role, and you'll hear from him in a few minutes.  
To sum it up, we're pleased with our results for the quarter and year-to-date. Our significant and hard-to-replicate competitive advantages position us very well to continue to deliver meaningful shareholder value over time.  
And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan."

Core income for the third quarter was $655 million compared to $798 million in the prior year quarter. For the quarter, core return on equity was 10.1%.

Core income for the third quarter was $655 million compared to $798 million in the prior year quarter. For the quarter, core return on equity was 10.1%. And on a year-to-date basis, core ROE was 11.6%. The decline in core income was driven by prior year reserve development and catastrophe losses.  
Recall that last year's PYD benefited by approximately $400 million of subrogation recoveries from PG&E. Most unfavorable year-over-year comparisons were partially offset by increased investment income and a higher level of underlying underwriting income. Underlying underwriting income increased 6% to $632 million pretax, reflecting a higher level of earned premium in all 3 segments and a strong underlying combined ratio of 91.4%. Improvements in the underlying combined ratio in both Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty were offset by an increase in the underlying combined ratio in Personal Insurance. 
Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty results both reflected the benefit of our pricing efforts, as earned price continues to exceed loss trend. We expected a higher underlying combined ratio in Personal Insurance, given that last year's quarter benefited from unusually low auto losses related to the pandemic. As Alan mentioned, the underlying combined ratio in PI was further impacted by higher severity in both the auto and homeowners products. Greg, Jeff and Michael will provide more detail on each segment's results in a few minutes.  
On a consolidated basis, the underlying loss ratio for the quarter improved slightly to 62% compared with last year's 62.2%. The expense ratio of 29.4% was in line with the prior year quarter and in line with our expectations. We've improved the expense ratio by more than 2 points from where we were 5 years ago. Having added roughly $7 billion to our annual net written premiums over that period while maintaining a focus on productivity and efficiency all while adding significantly to the level of strategic investment we're making to ensure our future success. Before turning to catastrophe losses, I wanted to point out that within our underlying combined ratio, non-cat weather was higher than we would have assumed for the quarter, although lower than the unusually high levels we experienced in last year's third quarter.
Our third quarter cat losses were $501 million pretax compared to $397 million a year ago. Remember that in last year's third quarter, we had a full recovery under the Property Aggregate Catastrophe XOL Treaty. In this year's third quarter, we recognized a partial recovery of $95 million from the treaty, $83 million benefiting the cat line with $43 million in Business Insurance and $39 million in Personal Insurance and $12 million benefiting our underlying results with $3 million in Business Insurance and $9 million in Personal Insurance. That leaves us with $255 million of potential recovery in the fourth quarter, depending on the level of qualifying losses we actually experience.
In terms of the level of cat losses relative to our assumptions, third quarter cats were elevated compared to what we would have assumed for a typical third quarter. Although our losses from Hurricane Ida are well below our relative market share, the sheer size of IDA on top of the other cat losses in the quarter resulted in overall cat losses that were higher than our assumption.  
Turning to prior year reserve development. In Personal Insurance, $30 million of pretax net favorable PYD resulted from better-than-expected experience from recent years in the property line. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, $22 million of pretax net favorable PYD was driven by favorable loss experience in the surety product line for recent accident years. In Business Insurance, net unfavorable PYD was $108 million pretax. Our annual asbestos review resulted in a charge of $225 million, as the level of claim activity did not decline as much as we had assumed in our previous estimate.  
Excluding the asbestos charge, Business Insurance had net favorable prior year reserve development of $117 million, driven primarily by better-than-expected loss experience in workers' comp across multiple accident years. Net investment income improved to $645 million after tax this quarter. Our non-fixed income portfolio delivered another strong result, contributing $224 million after tax. As you can see from the detail provided on Page 6 of the webcast presentation, our recent results in the non-fixed income portfolio have been unusually strong, and I would caution you that this level of returns is not likely to continue.  
Consistent with our expectations, fixed income returns were down slightly from the prior year quarter as the benefit from higher levels of invested assets was more than offset by a decline in yields. For the fourth quarter of 2021, we expect NII from the fixed income portfolio, including earnings from short-term securities of between $425 million and $435 million after tax. For 2022, we expect that, that figure to be between $420 million and $430 million per quarter.
Turning to capital management. Operating cash flow for the quarter of $2.5 billion was an all-time record. All our capital ratios were at or better than target levels, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $2 billion. The market value of the bonds in our fixed income portfolio declined as U.S. treasury yields increased and credit spreads widened during the quarter. Accordingly, our after-tax net unrealized investment gain decreased from $3.2 billion as of June 30 to $2.7 billion at September 30.  
Adjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses, was $104.77 at quarter end, up 5% since year-end and up 10% since September 30 of last year. We returned $821 million of capital to our shareholders during the third quarter with $220 million of dividends and $601 million in share repurchases. Overall, a very good quarter for us with healthy top line growth, strong and improved underlying margins in our commercial businesses, excellent cash flows and a terrifically strong balance sheet.  
And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of Business Insurance."

Business Insurance had another great quarter with strong financial results and terrific execution in the marketplace. Segment income was $558 million for the quarter, up more than 50% from the prior year quarter. The improved year-over-year result was driven by higher underlying underwriting income, prior year reserve development and higher net investment income, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses.  
We're once again particularly pleased with the underlying combined ratio of 90.2%, which improved by 3.8 points from the third quarter of 2020, primarily attributable to 3 things. First, about 2 points of the improvement resulted from earned pricing that continued to exceed loss cost trends. The other nearly 2 points resulted from a combination of a favorable impact associated with the pandemic and a lower level of property losses.  
Turning to the top line. Net written premiums were up 5%, benefiting from strong renewal rate and exposure levels as well as high retentions. As for domestic production, renewal premium change was once again historically high at 9.9%, while retention increased to an exceptional 85%. The 9.9% renewal premium change was up more than 2 points from the third quarter of last year, with strong renewal rate change of 6.3% and continued improvement in our customers' exposure growth.
In addition to our granular price execution, we've also focused on careful management of deductibles, attachment points, limits, sub-limits and exclusions, which can also contribute to an increase in the price per unit of risk. The business was down from the prior year quarter as we continue to be thoughtful about balancing risk and reward for new business in the marketplace.
As for the individual businesses, in Select, renewal premium change was a strong 9.7% while retention improved from recent periods to 82%. Underneath RPC renewal rate change was 4.1%, up well over 1 point from the third quarter of 2020. We're also encouraged with the improving exposure, which was up about 3 points as the economy continues to reopen. New business was up a bit from the prior year, driven by the continued success of our new BOP 2.0 product, which is now live in 39 states. In middle market, renewal premium change of 9.5% and retention of 88% were both historically high. Renewal rate change of 6.2% remains strong. As always, we remain disciplined around risk selection and underwriting.  
To sum up, Business Insurance had another terrific quarter. We're pleased with our execution in further improving the underlying margins in the book and we continue to invest in the business for long-term profitable growth.
With that, I'll turn the call over to our new partner in the room, Jeff Klenk."

We've built an industry-leading surety and management liability franchise, and we look forward to continuing to perform, innovate and transform to profitably grow these businesses into the future.  
Turning to the results. Bond & Specialty delivered excellent returns and growth in the quarter. Segment income was $174 million, up about 50% compared to the prior year quarter, driven by the impact of higher net earned premium, a significantly improved underlying underwriting margin and favorable prior year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio of 83.4% improved by 5.5 points from the prior year quarter, reflecting lower pandemic-related loss activity, earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends and a lower expense ratio.
Turning to the top line. Net written premiums grew an exceptional 19% in the quarter, with strong contributions from all our businesses. In domestic management liability, renewal premium change was a record 13.6%, driven by record renewal rate change. Retention remained strong at 86%. Consistent with recent quarters but down a few points year-over-year, as we continue to non-renew cyber policies for accounts that don't meet our updated minimum requirements for cyber hygiene. Notably, research indicates that implementing affordable cyber risk mitigation controls, such as multifactor authentication, could prevent the vast majority of ransom attacks.  
Domestic surety also posted strong growth relative to the pandemic impact of prior year quarter. In addition, our international businesses again posted excellent growth, including strong management liability retention and rate. So both top and bottom line results for Bond & Specialty were terrific this quarter, demonstrating our thoughtful approach and strong execution across our businesses.  
And now I'll turn the call over to Michael."

In Personal Insurance, bottom line results were impacted by weather or returned to pre-pandemic claim frequency in auto and higher loss severity impacting both auto and home results. Segment income declined by $394 million from the prior year quarter. $262 million of that decline is attributable to lower favorable prior year reserve development as the prior year quarter benefited from the PG&E settlement Dan referenced. The remaining unfavorable variance was primarily driven by lower underlying underwriting results. Our underlying combined ratio increased by 6.5 points to 95.2%. We were pleased to see our top line momentum continue in the quarter with net written premiums up 7%.  
Automobile underwriting results reflected higher loss levels for the quarter. The combined ratio was 100% and included 3.4 points of catastrophe losses, mostly from Hurricane Ida. The underlying combined ratio was 97%, up approximately 15 points from a prior year quarter, which reflected unusually low loss activity due to the pandemic.  
The underlying combined ratio increased mainly due to claims frequency effectively returning to pre-pandemic levels in line with the trend we referenced in our prior quarter call. To a lesser degree, higher loss severity impacted the combined ratio as well, as vehicle replacement and repair costs remained at elevated levels. We believe these profitability challenges are environmental. And in response, we are executing on our plan to file rate increases in about 40 states over the next 3 quarters. As we indicated last quarter, it will take time for future rate actions to earn into results, but we do expect to have higher rates in market in several states by year-end.
In Homeowners and Other, the third quarter combined ratio increased by 16 points from the prior year quarter to 109.3%, driven by a 24-point reduction in net favorable prior year reserve development, primarily related to the PG&E recovery from last year. The combined ratio included 17.6 points of catastrophe losses, mostly from Hurricane Ida. Homeowners catastrophe losses were 4.7 points below a very active prior year quarter.  
The underlying combined ratio was 93.3%, an improvement of 3.5 points over the prior year quarter, which experienced a very high level of loss activity. That said, the underlying combined ratio was above our expectations, reflecting elevated non-catastrophe weather and non-weather loss activity, both of which included higher severity related to a combination of labor and materials price increases. Again, we believe these trends are environmental, and we continue to see price increases in response.  
Before I shift to discussing production, I'll remind you that looking ahead to the fourth quarter, there tends to be a good amount of seasonality in our combined ratio results by line of business, with the fourth quarter auto losses typically higher and fourth quarter Homeowners losses typically lower than their annual average levels.  
Turning to production. We were very pleased to deliver another strong quarter in both auto and home. Automobile policies in force grew 5% to a record level, driven by strong retention at 85% and continued growth in new business, which increased by 8%. Renewal premium change was essentially flat, reflecting the continued impact of the rate increases we filed in response to the pandemic. Domestic Homeowners and Other delivered another excellent quarter with policies in force up 7%, also to a record level, driven by retention of 85% and new business growth of 5%. Renewal premium change increased to 8.8%.
In the quarter, we continued to deliver solutions that meet customers where they are, give them what they need and serve them how they want. A couple of highlights from the quarter include: our new digital self-inspection process for property customers, which improves their onboarding experience and provides valuable information to our underwriters. And IntelliDrive, our proprietary auto telematics offering, which now has distracted driving as a rating variable in 40 U.S. markets and Ontario, Canada, providing valuable feedbacks to drivers and continuing to advance our sophisticated pricing segmentation in automobile. We will continue to invest in new capabilities like these for our customers and distribution partners.  
Despite a challenging third quarter on the bottom line, we remain pleased with our overall performance, and we are well positioned to profitably grow our business over time.  
Now I'll turn the call back over to Abbe."

I guess, maybe help us define or think about what you mean by strong and how we can think about maybe margins for BI into next year or I guess the back half of next year? We have pricing now kind of close to where loss trends are. So just kind of help think about when -- with those reasons why prices remain strong? Should we expect this pricing to -- it seems like start to converge with where loss trends are, which obviously could have some impact on margins into 2022? So just comments on what you meant by strong there."

You're very narrowly, I think, focusing on rate versus loss trend, and by the way, there's still a margin there. And even if you look at pure rate over some long historical period, the rate we continue to get is actually a pretty good number. But if you look at the overall pricing number, I mean, at 9.9%, that's practically an all-time high, and there's a lot of margin in that exposure. So we continue to see a nice spread between written price and loss trend. I do think that's the right way to think about it. 
Nonetheless, as we -- we know what our product returns are. We know what the headwinds are. We know what our objectives are in terms of our returns, and we know what we need to do. So I think that from here, pricing will continue to be strong. Now we've also been getting pretty good pricing for some time now, and it's been compounding for a while. And so you've got different lines in different places. Some need more help than others. 
And so from here, the rate of increase is going to be impacted by that. So some lines are -- the rate of increase will be higher, some will go sideways, some still be an increase -- the rate of increase may go down. But overall, we continue to expect pricing to remain strong. I'm not sure we're going to put much more dimension around it other than that but hopefully that gives you some color to the top."

So to dimensionalize that a little bit more for you, the auto underlying combined was up 15 points in the quarter. We'd say 3/4 of that was loss experience returning to pre-pandemic levels and about 1/4 of -- about a remaining 1/4 of that is the trends in increased cost to repair and replace that we talked about last quarter that essentially continued into the quarter. 
In terms of how long it's going to last, I can point you to a little bit of external data that might help there. There's certainly pressure on the system, right? A lot of the costs relates to total losses and replacement cost values for total vehicles, which tracks pretty closely with used car prices. And inside the quarter, we were actually encouraged by the July and August data from places like the Moody's used car price index that looked like the peak had happened in May and June and was starting to decline in the first part of the quarter. Now that data ticked back up again in September, and I think its kick back up reflects the pressure on the system. 
You had IDA occur in the quarter. Estimates are that over 200,000 vehicles were destroyed in that event at the same time that you have vehicle inventories in the U.S. at historic lows. And so I think we're going to see continued pressure on the cost of repair and replace related to supply chain, related to labor and related to used car parts and prices. But again, that was about 1/4 of the 15 points, and we will factor that into our underwriting pricing decisions as we move forward."

You're right in terms of the impact on Business Insurance from the pandemic. 
Last year, in the third quarter, we gave you that the favorable impact was about 0.5 point and that was the net of direct charges that we took related to COVID, things like workers' comp charges for COVID-19, somebody contracts the disease and that was more than offset by indirect impacts, things like lower frequency on commercial auto. This year, you've got a larger net impact, but it's really the impact of the absence of those direct charges. We're not seeing that anywhere near the same level we saw a year ago.

And before I address the question, I think I may have misspoken. In the script I think I said that auto RPC was impacted by the rate increases we filed in response to the pandemic. Obviously, we didn't file rate increases in response to the pandemic. Those were rate decreases, which, by the way, I think, is relevant to your question, right? 
So as we are in the conversations with regulators, which are active and ongoing, as we speak, we're in conversations with them about that loss history. We're also in conversations with them about the actions we took in response, which included rate decreases in a variety of jurisdictions, which included premium refunds to customers in a variety of jurisdictions. And so we're having conversations with them around how we align pricing with loss costs over time and engage in discussions with them about how to view the 2020 loss experience in that context.
If I take a step back and think about the process a little bit more broadly, what we would say about the process of getting rate is that it is an ongoing dialogue between us and the regulators. It's about an exchange of information to justify the pricing that you think you need on a go-forward basis. And generally speaking, what we have found is, we've been able to get to a point where we can align price with loss cost over time. 
You'll have some challenging conversations in some jurisdictions and maybe less challenging conversations in others. To put a little bit of a point on the 40 jurisdictions, we do expect some of those increases to become effective in Q4 and actually a couple of them literally this month. So we're on the way to getting those increases filed and approved. And then as we've talked about, it will take time for them to get written and then earned into the book of business but we're making progress."

I think the other dynamic you see in a preferred book though is newer vehicles with more technology. And so when you think about some of the cost pressures on repair and replacement costs, that's going to put upward pressure there.
And I would say that while we saw, I think, some differences over the past 12 to 18 months that you could sort of point to in different parts of the country, different books of business in terms of how the pandemic impacted different segments differently. As we sit here today, the economy is broadly recovering. The country is broadly recovering. So you don't see quite as many differences, I don't think, geographically or by segments that are driving differences in loss experience across the segments of the industry. The other thing that's true of our book of business is it's heavily rounded. And so it's -- while we talk a lot about the individual lines of business, we certainly look at customers in the total portfolio as we look to manage it."

On the other hand, we actually see elevated shopping trips and recreational trips. So the mix of miles has changed.
But mileage broadly, when you look at Department of Transportation data, again, our IntelliDrive data, MS2 sensor data, is back to pre-pandemic levels as is frequency. So again, the mix looks a little bit different, but miles driven trips broadly are back sort of close to where they had been.

So there's a fairly long tail on the front end of any rate filing process up or down. And so we really wouldn't have expected any of those increases to take effect in the third quarter. As I mentioned, we've got 40 planned over the course of the next 3 quarters. And a couple -- 2 or 3 will likely take effect this month on several, call it, another handful of take effect probably before year-end, again, all subject to getting approvals from the states that we are working towards those effective dates with and then the remainder will be in the first or second quarter of next year. 
The few that we have likely to take effect in the back half of this year will represent 25%, 30% of the written premium volume we have across the country. So it's a relatively small number, but it should be impactful on a written basis. But again, I'll just caution you, it takes time for that to earn into the book, but we've started and we are making progress."

Certainly, there are conversations that are linked to 2. I guess I'd start by separating the 2, right? There are certainly conversations with state regulators and a handful, I would say, that are talking about and are actively pursuing the removal of credit scoring as a variable in pricing auto insurance. 
The 2 most notable are Washington and Colorado. Colorado has a bill that was approved by the state legislature that's in the rule-making process around removing credit score in that state. In the State of Washington, again, pretty widely followed. But Commissioner Kreidler issued an emergency rule to ban the use of credit scoring in auto insurance. That emergency rule was actually just overturned by a judge in Washington earlier this month. And so we're in the process. And that -- the overturn by the judge is now being challenged by the commissioner. So there's a back and forth in Washington. Those are probably the 2 most widely viewed views on credit scoring. 
As respect to credit scoring and telematics, what we would say is, first of all, credit is a powerful variable in pricing auto insurance. It's very predictive of claim experience. And if you remove it then you have subsidization in your rate plan between higher risk drivers and lower risk drivers. And in fact, in the context of a telematics program, the credit score and the telematics data are powerful together. 
If you're in a situation where you don't have credit and can't use credit, telematics is very valuable, probably becomes increasingly valuable. And in that kind of a world, we're encouraged by the capability we've got, the tools we have, the success of our IntelliDrive program and the power that it has in segmenting loss experience and helping us segment pricing."

Clearly, as I said earlier, we still have a slight negative in rates. So that's going to have a large weight on the overall net written premium delta. We had strong retention. Overall, if there's an area that brought the number down was on a new business basis. And when we look into the marketplace, particularly larger accounts for this quarter, where we saw the clearing price relative to our price to risk to make sure that we're getting adequate value over the long term, we didn't hit on some larger deals. So really, it's a function of disciplined underwriting. So the combination of all those drove that minus [indiscernible]."
