I'm joined virtually by Christa Davies, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President. 
As in previous quarters, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website. There are very few firms who can say they ended 2020 stronger than they began. And I want to thank our colleagues for making Aon one of those firms. Our team delivered a tremendous year, set against the public health and economic impact of COVID-19 and an overall unprecedented level of global volatility, punctuated by social unrest around the world. 
During the year, our colleagues came together to deliver results for clients to both time and energy to getting to know the Willis Towers Watson team and the integration planning for our pending combination and to support each other through personal and professional challenges. 
One silver lining that we heard over and over from colleagues was that 2020 was a year of increased connection across our firm. We saw our colleagues respond to the virtual environment for replacing in-person connections both introducing experts and sharing thought leadership with clients. We felt the impact of that connectivity as our COVID-19 task force ramped up to share insights and best practices. And we saw it translate into client success as local teams won new business by seamlessly bringing together colleagues from across the globe. 
By all accounts, 2020 tested our firm. Looking back, it's clear that our colleagues not only passed, although this diversity actually accelerated our long term strategy. Seeing our colleagues come together and forged stronger connection today was inspirational. And we'll build on these positive learnings and practices in 2020 as we continue to reject the constraints of the so-called new normal and instead look forward to defining a new better on our terms as we begin 2021. 
Turning to financial performance. In the fourth quarter, we delivered a great finish to the year, with 2% organic revenue growth across the firm, including 12% growth in Reinsurance Solutions and 4% growth in Commercial Risk Solutions. 
As in recent quarters, organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter was driven by strength in the core areas of our business, reflecting the resilience of our firm in a challenging economic environment overcoming ongoing and expected pressure in the more discretionary areas. 
In particular, we would highlight growth in the core, driven by ongoing strong retention and net new business generation as we continue to deliver innovative solutions to our clients in a challenging environment. 
We saw increased organic revenue growth as compared to the third quarter despite the somewhat larger portion of more discretionary revenues in the fourth quarter. This strong result spend partially from improvements in economic factors and sentiment around the virus and vaccine, which drives client buying behavior and investment. 
For example, we saw a positive impact to our revenue from construction starts and M&A activity in the U.S. as well as from employment levels. I would also note that in more discretionary areas, we're seeing meaningful variation in revenue growth across our businesses, with some recovering more quickly and some more slowly, largely driven by external factors tied to economic reopening and recovery.
For example, I would highlight strength in voluntary benefits in Health Solutions, and construction and commercial risk. I would also note that more discretionary areas, like travel and events within data and analytics and even capital within retirement solutions, continue to be impacted by economic and pandemic-related conditions. 
Our strong finish in Q4 contributed to full year financial results that demonstrate the strength and resilience of our business in this under [indiscernible] economic environment. For the year, we delivered organic revenue growth of 1%, operating income growth of 4%, with full year operating margins of 28.5%, an increase of 100 basis points from 2019 and free cash flow growth of 64% to $2.6 billion, the highest free cash flow in the history of our firm. 
This outstanding progress against each of our key financial metrics is a direct result of our one firm strategy, which guides everything we do in supporting colleagues, delivering value to clients and driving shareholder value. We are well positioned to continue to build on this momentum. 
And while we see many positive signs for the economy, significant uncertainty remains, and we expect the recovery will remain inconsistent. We continue to monitor several key factors, including GDP, asset values, corporate revenues and employment. 
As we look to 2021, though significant uncertainty remains, we expect, as economic conditions continue to stabilize and improve, we anticipate modest growth in Q1, with growth increasing toward mid-single digits as we continue through the year. 
Looking back, the challenges we faced in 2020 underscore the importance of colleagues, our culture and our commitment to inclusion and diversity. We've long observed that leaders who embody one firm are our most successful leaders, both in delivering business results and driving colleague engagement. And this year, we've seen that in special leadership trade results even stronger engagement and confidence in the combination, as measured in a January pull survey reflecting high engagement and consistently lower voluntary attrition, which decreased by 35% year-over-year from 2020 with strength in every major region and solution line. 
Further, we know the diverse talent, expertise and insights of our colleagues are vital to the success of our firm and our clients, and we continually invest to attract, grow and retain the best talent. In support of this priority, we announced the expansion of our apprenticeship program, including an investment of $30 million over the next 5 years and development of a nationwide network of employers to create 10,000 apprenticeships by 2030. With this expansion, we're building on our already successful program, which bridges the gap from education to employment by bringing high school graduates into the workforce, while they complete their college education. This program provides a fantastic pipeline of diverse talent and embodies our commitment to inclusion and diversity. 
In addition to emphasizing the importance of our colleagues and our culture, the events of 2020 exposed the interconnected nature of risk and vulnerabilities in many companies. Our recently published 2020 risk report highlights the increasing likelihood of connected extremes and reinforces that leading organizations in the future will be defined by their ability to manage the global implications of long-tail risks. 
In this survey of over 500 organizations across geographies and industries, 82% did not add pandemic in their top 10 risks before COVID-19 struck, and only 30% had a pandemic plan in place. Looking forward, respondents overwhelmingly agreed on the need for an enterprise-wide approach to risk. 
We know that existing emerging and long-tail risks will continue to challenge organizations across all industries and geographies. Organizations must prioritize strategies to address risks and resilience. We also know our strategy enables us to support clients in this changing landscape because it enables us to understand their biggest challenges and bring world-class content capability and innovative solutions to bear. 
And while we didn't architect our pending combination with Willis Towers Watson with the pandemic in mine, we see that the pandemic and its associated economic impacts have increased our conviction and the need to accelerate innovation to address client demand. 
On the topic of Willis Towers Walton, our excitement about the combination as well as the leadership and talent from both sides continues to grow. Last week, we reached another important milestone with the announcement of the combined executive committee that will be in place once the combination is closed. This team embraces the commitment to a One Firm mindset and brings together the best expertise, talent and leadership from both organizations. This team also brings to the table an exceptional set of experiences and capability, reinforcing the power of inclusion. As we said before, our culture is built to bring the best of our firm to clients. It's an essential part of how we operate our firm and drive results. 
At Willis Towers Watson, it's clear that their culture is equally focused on putting clients first. This newly announced team will blend the best of those cultures And that client-focused mindset will guide everything we do. 
In summary, 2020 was a momentous year. Our performance and actions throughout the year reflect exceptional resilience. Now the result of structural steps and investments we've made to ensure we're ready to not only take on, but grow stronger in the face of these challenges. Further, we've demonstrated momentum that will accelerate in combination with Willis Towers Watson. We begin 2021 in a position of strength to continue executing our strategy and making progress on our key financial metrics, both the stand-alone Aon and in our pending combination Willis Towers Watson. creating a significant growth opportunity for clients, for colleagues and for shareholders. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our financial progress this year and long-term outlook. Christa?"

As Greg highlighted, we delivered a strong operational and financial performance in Q4 to finish the year despite continuing macroeconomic challenges, demonstrating the resiliency and strength of our business in any economic environments. 
Turning to our results. We delivered organic revenue growth of 2% in the fourth quarter and 1% for the full year, driven by ongoing strength in our core business, offset by pressure in our more discretionary areas. 
I would note, total reported revenue was up slightly, overcoming a nearly $100 million headwind from the unfavorable impact of changes in FX as well as lower fiduciary investment income due to lower interest rates globally. 
We also delivered operational improvement for the full year, with operating income growth of 4% and operating margin expansion of 100 basis points to 28.5%, continuing our trajectory of long-term sustainable margin expansion. 
For the full year, adjusted operating expense declined 1% due to expense discipline and a reduction in travel and entertainment, offset by increased compensation costs. Adjusted operating expenses increased 4% in fourth quarter. 
Putting for in context, due to the significant uncertainty we saw during the year, we tightly controlled our expense base and level of long-term investment in the business. During 2020, our organic revenue growth improved sequentially from the second quarter through the fourth quarter, as internal and external factors contribute to a strong finish to the year. This led to a year-over-year increase in compensation benefits expense in the fourth quarter, a portion of which was variable compensation. This resulted in a full year increase in adjusted compensation and benefit expense of 1%. 
I would also note that compensation expense increased in part because of our commitment during 2020 to retain all 50,000 colleagues as well as lower voluntary attrition, which Greg described. As we said before, we make decisions on expenses and margins in the context of each full year and expect to continue to drive expansion in 2021. 
For the full year, we translated strong operational performance into EPS growth of 7%, overcoming a headwind from FX translation. If currency remains stable at today's rates, we'd expect a favorable impact of approximately $0.20 per share or approximately $60 million of operating income in the first quarter of 2021 due to a weaker dollar over euro. 
A key driver of our operational success has been the history of investment in our Aon Business Services platform, which has undergone a significant transformation over the last several years. The journey began with an initial group of 4,000 colleagues, after the divesture of our outsourcing business in 2017. By centralizing activities, eliminating inefficiencies and promoting standardization, we delivered higher quality service levels and cost savings with better scalability, flexibility and enhanced colleague experience. 
Today, approximately 13,000 of Aon's 50,000 colleagues are part of Aon Business Services, focused on driving operational improvement and enhancing how we serve clients. In 2020, for instance, we completed our data center consolidation program in the Americas, closing an additional 10 data centers and achieving $23 million of annual savings. 
We increased usage of our digital figures store by over 110%, saving more than 65,000 hours annually. We renewed 90% of the nearly 9,000 U.S. commercial risk licenses paperlessly, and we improved our global operations and shared capabilities, by delivering over 1 million hours of automation, freeing collate capacity for high-value activities with clients. 
Looking forward, we expect to leverage our Aon Business Services platform to continue to drive sustainable margin expansion. In addition, we see opportunities to embed best practices around agility and connectivity into how and where we operate, ultimately reducing our overall real estate footprint over the long term. 
Turning to cash and capital allocation. Free cash flow increased 64% to $2.6 billion, primarily driven by working capital improvements, including improved collections, a decrease in restructuring cash outlays and strong operational improvement. We remain focused on maximizing the translation of revenue into the highest level of free cash flow, as highlighted by our free cash flow margin of 23.9%, up substantially from last year. 
We are at capital based on return on invested capital, cash-on-cash returns. We continue to maximize shareholder value creation, highlighted by the $800 million of share repurchase in the quarter and nearly $1.8 billion in 2020.
In 2021, we expect to continue to allocate capital according to this framework, and we expect share repurchase will continue to be our highest return on capital investment, given our free cash flow valuation and outlook. We expect to remain highly focused on closing, and then successfully integrating our combination with Willis Towers Watson. Following that, we expect to continue to invest organically and inorganically in innovative content and capabilities in our priority areas. 
We remain very confident in the strength of our balance sheet and manage liquidity risk through a well-laddered debt maturity profile. Historically, we've looked to increase debt as EBITDA grows, while maintaining leverage ratios. However, due to uncertain macroeconomic conditions, we expect to continue to manage our leverage ratios conservatively in the near future and return to our past practice of growing debt as EBITDA grows over the long term. 
As I look towards 2021 and our pending combination with Willis Towers Watson, I'd like to reiterate how excited we are about the newly announced leadership team and the significant shareholder value creation potential we see in bringing together our 2 complementary businesses, both from a top line growth, driven by accelerated innovation to clients, and from the bottom line impact of $800 million in cost synergies. 
We continue to work collaboratively with the appropriate regulators to gain approvals and are focused on achieving a result that optimizes shareholder value. We remain committed to our expected close in the first half of 2021. 
In summary, our business has shown resiliency through the challenges of 2020. Our Aon United strategy, underpinned by our Aon Business Services operational platform, has enabled historically high free cash flow of $2.6 billion and enabled us to return nearly $2.2 billion of capital to shareholders in 2020. 
As we head into 2021, through our pending combination with Willis Towers Watson, this momentum will continue to enable long-term shareholder value creation. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'd be delighted to take your questions."

I did want to ask a little bit more about the margin expansion opportunity. I know you talked about they're still having an ability to expand margins this year, of course. 
And in that context, is it still going to be tough to achieve 70 to 80 basis points of margin expansion towards your long-term target, given that you still might not have fully returned to the normalized cost base? Or are there other efficiencies that you've been able to realized through COVID, more work from home or other efficiencies, lower traveling expenses that still might make that range feasible this year?"

And we -- that is really driven by accelerating organic revenue growth, the portfolio mix shifts to higher revenue growth, higher-margin areas And obviously, as you noted, the Aon Business Services platform continuing to drive productivity and efficiency for us.

Even yesterday, I was on a call that would have been a client meeting 1 year ago with 100 clients plus, we had 1,000 clients on yesterday. And so our ability to actually connect with clients and actually demonstrate the full capability of the firm at a time of high need is actually going up.

And then the discretionary pieces, as there was some promise on the recovery front, the vaccine front, et cetera, we saw some of those discretionary areas like transaction liability and constrained in employment levels begin to come up. 
But by the way, other areas, we still saw the pressure. I mentioned travel and events, as an example, and some others. So it still remains mixed, but the trend is positive. And what you're really seeing is us enabled to kind of interact in a very positive way with clients. And you're seeing that sort of build into Q4.

And so we were there to be able to help those new clients and existing clients really reposition their portfolios as they went into '21. 
But I would say that continued into the first quarter. As the market dynamics being what they are, the insurers are certainly looking to position and get support where they need it as they look to grow their own portfolio.

This core content and capability that exists across both organizations, we have very high expectations when we announced March 9. They've been exceeded substantially in multiple categories. And we think about the opportunity to drive growth -- organic growth on behalf of clients, and we see it in multiple categories. 
All these things come together to reinforce opportunities to both drive top line and also drive margin improvement, which by the way, we see for Aon, front and center, before we get any place else. 
So we just want to highlight, we see tremendous opportunity, both on the top line side and on the margin side for the combined firm for all the reasons, Christa has outlined. And everything we've seen since March 9 has only reinforced that. It's just been terrific."

We would come back and to [indiscernible] from an overall pricing set, we really look at market impact, which is really a function of how you describe price and then insured values and all of things to come with that. 
And then it really is client behavior. And so from our standpoint, we would say all the pricing impacts have really had modest impact on our performance. It really is around what we're doing fundamentally with clients. Maybe ask Eric to give a couple of examples of where this is. 
But really, Greg, just when we stepped back, it really is about this is when Aon can really show up and help clients succeed in times of need. And they do a lot of reconfiguring as we think about as the environment changes. 
But maybe, Eric, a couple of examples, does that make sense?"

It's never really a straight line between what the carrier points out is what they say is the unit price versus what a client actually does. 
Maybe to put it in a little bit of context, when we sit with the client, we first do the risk identification process by trying to help them understand exactly what risk they're trying to protect. Can they mitigate it themselves in a way that either through contracts or different changes of behavior? And can they finance it themselves, right, either to a captive or just using their balance sheet? 
So A lot happens with a client before they even risk transfer. So just always good to keep that in mind. But when they do decide the risk transfer, they certainly go into a market, and we help them with insight with regard to options and structures and whether it's retentions or deductibles, coinsurance limits a variety of things that clients will look at in terms of what their budget is able to do, and they'll make their trade-offs. 
So it's never really a straight line as to the unit cost as to what the client behavior actually sort of manifests itself in. And you see that in a couple of distressed products that are out there today. Certainly, D&O is one that's gotten a lot of attention how we work with clients to help them make those choices in terms of the protection that they provide. Cyber is another, property and catastrophe exposed areas. 
So there's a lot that goes into before they go to market as opposed to what they buy inside the marketplace. And so it's, frankly, an area where our teams have been focused on now for the last 24 months as the market has gotten firmer, to help clients make those trade-offs because they're dealing with the marketplace now at a time where many of them are feeling stressed, in general, on their own businesses. 
And so how they make those trade-offs become more acute, in the last -- certainly, in the last 12 months? And would expect that, that behavior and that process would continue going into this year."

Obviously, since the March 9 announcement, we've done a tremendous amount of workforce of the client, getting their insight, guidance perspective views on how we can better support them and serve them. I will say, it's been overwhelming. 
As we dig in with clients, and they understand that we're all about bringing them the best of the now, all the things they could do in the current environment. Eric has described a number of different challenges that are out there and how we're going to help serve them better. 
But also the challenges that are -- used to be on the horizon are now in their doorstep. And they're asking questions around what about the next pandemic, what do we do? I don't want to think about cyber, right? The market is still relatively small, $6 billion, $7 billion against a connected client impact of closer to $1 trillion. What do we do about that? 
By the way, they know climate is going to be front and center already is, but really going to be front and center in pandemic as the sites they're behind us. So they're asking questions to me around how do I address these long-tail risks that are being asked of me by CFOs and CEOs and Boards of Directors? 
So what I'm trying to highlight is need has never been higher. And the solutions that we must bring to bear have got to evolve. We have to be better in supporting them. And we as -- we start with Aon in the entire industry, and they see this combination as a chance to reverse the trend in which our overall relevance has actually declined as a percent of risk, as a percent of GDP over the last 30 years. And they see real promise in that. 
So our feedback has been overwhelmingly positive across the globe on what this combination would mean for them. And we're very excited to work hard to meet those needs on their behalf."

Listen, we are absolutely committed in every way to implementing ESG best practices, internally for sure, and to promote resiliency. But listen, the picture on it is so important. 
The way the industry can play, relating to climate, isn't just a pressing problem, it's one of the greatest opportunities for us. Again, if you think about where we are, everyone's focused on the pandemic in many respects now, but this is just gets the sides behind us. Climate change in our view is going to be front and center. 
And it's going to be a challenge. When you think about matching capital with risk, not to solve what energy source it is, but literally the transition risk, the clients -- transition pressure, the transition volatility of the clients encounter as you think about going from point A to point B, that should be our wheelhouse. That is how do we identify capability? How do we idenfity capital to help them do that? And the combination with Willis Towers Watson we believe will be formidable. There's tremendous capability in Willis Towers Watson that John Haley and his team has done a great job developing over time, that, combined with what we have, we think we ever shot to really make a difference, helping clients make better decisions as they think about this transition volatility that everyone is going to encounter as you think about addressing the climate challenges. 
So this is a high priority for us inside of Aon in our own world, for sure. And you'll see that, by the way, we've got an upcoming 2020 impact report that's going to detail our commitment around carbon neutrality and all pieces around that. But really, the opportunity here is what we can do on the outset clients. And it is, in our view, again, another -- it's just not been addressed in a way that's meaningful and it's a real opportunity for the industry to make a difference, and we look forward to doing."

Listen, at the individual level, there's always different circumstances that are going to come up. But if you take a step back and think about the implications of the climate change overall, this is the global economy. This is largely massive, massive challenge around increased volatility that's going to be absorbed by companies as they address this challenge.
Our ability to help reduce that over time is, we think, substantial. And that is why and this is a massive opportunity. It's going to require though new insight, new innovation, evolution beyond where our industry has done, beyond what we have done. And that's why back to why the combination? What's it all about? It's about being able to address some of the types of these issues. Climate is one. Cyber is another one, that's so underdeveloped substantially, intellectual property.

I'm joined virtually by Christa Davies, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President.  
As in previous quarters, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website. There are very few firms who can say they ended 2020 stronger than they began. And I want to thank our colleagues for making Aon one of those firms. Our team delivered a tremendous year, set against the public health and economic impact of COVID-19 and an overall unprecedented level of global volatility, punctuated by social unrest around the world.  
During the year, our colleagues came together to deliver results for clients to both time and energy to getting to know the Willis Towers Watson team and the integration planning for our pending combination and to support each other through personal and professional challenges.  
One silver lining that we heard over and over from colleagues was that 2020 was a year of increased connection across our firm. We saw our colleagues respond to the virtual environment for replacing in-person connections both introducing experts and sharing thought leadership with clients. We felt the impact of that connectivity as our COVID-19 task force ramped up to share insights and best practices. And we saw it translate into client success as local teams won new business by seamlessly bringing together colleagues from across the globe.  
By all accounts, 2020 tested our firm. Looking back, it's clear that our colleagues not only passed, although this diversity actually accelerated our long term strategy. Seeing our colleagues come together and forged stronger connection in new ways was inspirational. And we'll build on these positive learnings and practices in 2020 as we continue to reject the constraints of the so-called new normal and instead look forward to defining a new better on our terms as we begin 2021.  
Turning to financial performance. In the fourth quarter, we delivered a great finish to the year, with 2% organic revenue growth across the firm, including 12% growth in Reinsurance Solutions and 4% growth in Commercial Risk Solutions.  
As in recent quarters, organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter was driven by strength in the core areas of our business, reflecting the resilience of our firm in a challenging economic environment, overcoming ongoing and expected pressure in the more discretionary areas.  
In particular, we would highlight growth in the core, driven by ongoing strong retention and net new business generation as we continue to deliver innovative solutions to our clients in a challenging environment.  
We saw increased organic revenue growth as compared to the third quarter despite the somewhat larger portion of more discretionary revenues in the fourth quarter. This strong result spend partially from improvements in economic factors and sentiment around the virus and vaccine, which drives client buying behavior and investment.  
For example, we saw a positive impact to our revenue from construction starts and M&A activity in the U.S. as well as from employment levels. I would also note that in more discretionary areas, we're seeing meaningful variation in revenue growth across our businesses, with some recovering more quickly and some more slowly, largely driven by external factors tied to economic reopening and recovery. 
For example, I would highlight strength in voluntary benefits in Health Solutions, and Construction and Commercial Risk. I would also note that more discretionary areas, like travel and events within data and analytics and even capital within Retirement Solutions, continue to be impacted by economic and pandemic-related conditions.  
Our strong finish in Q4 contributed to full year financial results that demonstrate the strength and resilience of our business in this uncertain economic environment. For the year, we delivered organic revenue growth of 1%, operating income growth of 4%, with full year operating margins of 28.5%, an increase of 100 basis points from 2019 and free cash flow growth of 64% to $2.6 billion, the highest free cash flow in the history of our firm.  
This outstanding progress against each of our key financial metrics is a direct result of our one firm strategy, which guides everything we do in supporting colleagues, delivering value to clients and driving shareholder value. We are well-positioned to continue to build on this momentum. 
And while we see many positive signs for the economy, significant uncertainty remains, and we expect the recovery will remain inconsistent. We continue to monitor several key factors, including GDP, asset values, corporate revenues and employment. 
As we look to 2021, though significant uncertainty remains, we expect, as economic conditions continue to stabilize and improve, we anticipate modest growth in Q1, with growth increasing toward mid-single digits as we continue through the year. 
Looking back, the challenges we faced in 2020 underscore the importance of colleagues, our culture and our commitment to inclusion and diversity. We've long observed that leaders who embody one firm are our most successful leaders, both in delivering business results and driving colleague engagement. 
And this year, we've seen that in special leadership trade results even stronger engagement and confidence in the combination, as measured in a January poll survey reflecting high engagement and consistently lower voluntary attrition, which decreased by 35% year-over-year from 2020 with strength in every major region and solution line. 
Further, we know the diverse talent, expertise and insights of our colleagues are vital to the success of our firm and our clients, and we continually invest to attract, grow and retain the best talent. In support of this priority, we announced the expansion of our apprenticeship program, including an investment of $30 million over the next 5 years and development of a nationwide network of employers to create 10,000 apprenticeships by 2030. 
With this expansion, we're building on our already successful program, which bridges the gap from education to employment by bringing high school graduates into the workforce, while they complete their college education. This program provides a fantastic pipeline of diverse talent and embodies our commitment to inclusion and diversity. 
In addition to emphasizing the importance of our colleagues and our culture, the events of 2020 exposed the interconnected nature of risk and vulnerabilities in many companies. Our recently published 2020 risk report highlights the increasing likelihood of connected extremes and reinforces that leading organizations in the future will be defined by their ability to manage the global implications of long-tail risks. 
In this survey of over 500 organizations across geographies and industries, 82% did not add pandemic in their top 10 risks before COVID-19 struck, and only 30% had a pandemic plan in place. Looking forward, respondents overwhelmingly agreed on the need for an enterprise-wide approach to risk. 
We know that existing and emerging long-tail risks will continue to challenge organizations across all industries and geographies. Organizations must prioritize strategies to address risks and resilience. We also know our strategy enables us to support clients in this changing landscape because it enabled us to understand their biggest challenges and bring world-class content, capability and innovative solutions to bear.
And while we didn't architect our pending combination with Willis Towers Watson with the pandemic in mind, we see that the pandemic and its associated economic impacts have increased our conviction and the need to accelerate innovation to address client demand. 
On the topic of Willis Towers Watson. Our excitement about the combination as well as the leadership and talent from both sides continues to grow. Last week, we reached another important milestone with the announcement of the combined executive committee that will be in place once the combination is closed. This team embraces the commitment to a one firm mindset and brings together the best expertise, talent and leadership from both organizations. This team also brings to the table an exceptional set of experiences and capability, reinforcing the power of inclusion. As we said before, our culture is built to bring the best of our firm to clients. It's an essential part of how we operate our firm and drive results. 
At Willis Towers Watson, it's clear that their culture is equally focused on putting clients first. This newly announced team will blend the best of those cultures And that client-focused mindset will guide everything we do. 
In summary, 2020 was a momentous year. Our performance and actions throughout the year reflect exceptional resilience. Now the result of structural steps and investments we've made to ensure we're ready to not only take on, but grow stronger in the face of these challenges. Further, we've demonstrated momentum that will accelerate in combination with Willis Towers Watson. We begin 2021 in a position of strength to continue executing our strategy and making progress on our key financial metrics, both the stand-alone Aon and in our pending combination with Willis Towers Watson, creating a significant growth opportunity for clients, for colleagues and for shareholders. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our financial progress this year and long-term outlook. Christa?"

As Greg highlighted, we delivered a strong operational and financial performance in Q4 to finish the year, despite continuing macroeconomic challenges, demonstrating the resiliency and strength of our business in any economic environments. 
Turning to our results. We delivered organic revenue growth of 2% in the fourth quarter and 1% for the full year, driven by ongoing strength in our core business, offset by pressure in our more discretionary areas. 
I would note, total reported revenue was up slightly, overcoming a nearly $100 million headwind from the unfavorable impact of changes in FX as well as lower fiduciary investment income due to lower interest rates globally. 
We also delivered operational improvement for the full year, with operating income growth of 4% and operating margin expansion of 100 basis points to 28.5%, continuing our trajectory of long-term sustainable margin expansion. 
For the full year, adjusted operating expense declined 1% due to expense discipline and a reduction in travel and entertainment, offset by increased compensation costs. Adjusted operating expenses increased 4% in fourth quarter. 
Putting Q4 in context. Due to the significant uncertainty we saw during the year, we tightly controlled our expense base and level of long-term investment in the business. During 2020, our organic revenue growth improved sequentially from the second quarter through the fourth quarter, as internal and external factors contribute to a strong finish to the year. 
This led to a year-over-year increase in compensation benefits expense in the fourth quarter, a portion of which was variable compensation. This resulted in a full year increase in adjusted compensation and benefit expense of 1%. 
I would also note that compensation expense increased in part because of our commitment during 2020 to retain all 50,000 colleagues as well as lower voluntary attrition, which Greg described. As we said before, we make decisions on expenses and margins in the context of each full year and expect to continue to drive margin expansion in 2021. 
For the full year, we translated strong operational performance into EPS growth of 7%, overcoming a headwind from FX translation. If currency remains stable at today's rates, we'd expect this favorable impact of approximately $0.20 per share or approximately $60 million of operating income in the first quarter of 2021 due to a weaker dollar over the euro. 
A key driver of our operational success has been the history of investment in our Aon Business Services platform, which has undergone significant transformation over the last several years. The journey began with initial group of 4,000 colleagues, after the divesture of our outsourcing business in 2017. By centralizing activities, eliminating inefficiencies and promoting standardization, we delivered higher quality service levels and cost savings with better scalability, flexibility and enhanced colleague experience. 
Today, approximately 13,000 of Aon's 50,000 colleagues are part of Aon Business Services, focused on driving operational improvement and enhancing how we serve clients. In 2020, for instance, we completed our data center consolidation program in the Americas, closing an additional 10 data centers and achieving $23 million of annual savings. 
We increased the usage of our digital figures store by over 110%, saving more than 65,000 hours annually. We renewed 90% of the nearly 9,000 U.S. commercial risk licenses paperlessly. And we improved our global operations and shared capabilities, by delivering over 1 million hours of automation, freeing colleague capacity for high-value activities with clients. 
Looking forward, we expect to leverage our Aon Business Services platform to continue to drive sustainable margin expansion. In addition, we see opportunities to embed best practices around agility and connectivity into how and where we operate, ultimately reducing our overall real estate footprint over the long term. 
Turning to cash and capital allocation. Free cash flow increased 64% to $2.6 billion, primarily driven by working capital improvements, including improved collections, a decrease in restructuring cash outlays and strong operational improvement. We remain focused on maximizing the translation of revenue into the highest level of free cash flow, as highlighted by our free cash flow margin of 23.9%, up substantially from last year. 
We allocate capital based on return on invested capital, cash-on-cash returns. We continue to maximize shareholder value creation, highlighted by the $800 million of share repurchase in the quarter and nearly $1.8 billion in 2020.
In 2021, we expect to continue to allocate capital according to this framework, and we expect share repurchase will continue to be our highest return on capital investment, given our free cash flow valuation and outlook. We expect to remain highly focused on closing, and then successfully integrating our combination with Willis Towers Watson. Following that, we expect to continue to invest organically and inorganically in innovative content and capabilities in our priority areas. 
We remain very confident in the strength of our balance sheet and manage liquidity risk through a well-laddered debt maturity profile. Historically, we've looked to increase debt as EBITDA grows, while maintaining leverage ratios. However, due to uncertain macroeconomic conditions, we expect to continue to manage our leverage ratios conservatively in the near future and return to our past practice of growing debt as EBITDA grows over the long term. 
As I look towards 2021 and our pending combination with Willis Towers Watson, I'd like to reiterate how excited we are about the newly announced leadership team, and the significant shareholder value creation potential we see in bringing together our 2 complementary businesses, both from a top line growth, driven by accelerated innovation to clients, and from the bottom line impact of $800 million in cost synergies. 
We continue to work collaboratively with the appropriate regulators to gain approvals and are focused on achieving a result that optimizes shareholder value. We remain committed to our expected close in the first half of 2021. 
In summary, our business has shown resiliency through the challenges of 2020. Our Aon United strategy, underpinned by our Aon Business Services operational platform, has enabled historically high free cash flow of $2.66 billion and enabled us to return nearly $2.2 billion of capital to shareholders in 2020. 
As we head into 2021, through our pending combination with Willis Towers Watson, this momentum will continue to enable long-term shareholder value creation. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'd be delighted to take your questions."

And so we think that a $500 million is a conservative number. And we're definitely targeting underlying free cash flow growth over the long term in the double-digit range."

You guys came in at positive, too. So it seems like there was much better strength across many of your businesses, probably than you expected 3 months ago. 
So maybe if you could help us understand that. And then with that same discretionary piece, given that reinsurance is a bigger component of the Q1, I'm assuming so that would serve as a tailwind to Q1 organic, just given that more of the reinsurance business comes on in the first quarter. Is that factored in to your guide?"

As Eric just highlighted, there's so many opportunities that continue to emerge to help clients at times of need and they're just continuing to emerge around the world. And some of them are happening faster than we thought they would. 
If you think about the momentum into the fourth quarter, it really was in the core, and we continue to perform well there. And then the discretionary pieces, as there was some promise on the recovery front, the vaccine front, et cetera, we saw some of those discretionary areas like TL, transaction liability and constrained in employment levels begin to come up. 
But by the way, other areas, we still saw the pressure. I mentioned travel and events, as an example, and some others. So it still remains mixed, but the trend is positive. And what you're really seeing is us enabled to kind of interact in a very positive way with clients. And you're seeing that sort of build into Q4. You're also seeing it as we think about our opportunities in 2021. 
On the reinsurance front, again, team is fantastic. Eric, you talked about that, sort of which we -- as we end Q4, the implications and also the thoughts for the first quarter in 2021 on the reinsurance side. The great work by the team."

Certainly, Q4 has always been our smallest quarter in reinsurance that's been dominated by -- historically by fac and investment banking. There were some good treaty wins that happened. Certainly, there's a lot of action going on in that space in the third and fourth quarter in terms of new clients, new company creation, and the like. And so we were there to be able to help those new clients and existing clients really reposition their portfolios as they went into '21. 
But I would say that continued into the first quarter. As the market dynamics being what they are, the insurers are certainly looking to position and get support where they need it as they look to grow their own portfolio. So great quarter, certainly on the back of a fantastic quarter 1 year ago. So to see that kind of growth this year off the back of a 70% comparable was a special quarter for the team, and I think that momentum is carrying into the first quarter of this year."

And then it really is client behavior. And so from our standpoint, we would say all the pricing impacts have really had modest impact on our performance. It really is around what we're doing fundamentally with clients. Maybe ask Eric to give a couple of examples of where this is. 
But really, Greg, just when we stepped back, it really is about this is when Aon can really show up and help clients succeed in times of need. And they do a lot of reconfiguring as we think about as the environment changes.

It's never really a straight line between what the carrier points out is what they say is the unit price versus what a client actually does. 
Maybe to put it in a little bit of context, when we sit with the client, we first do the risk identification process by trying to help them understand exactly what risk they're trying to protect. Can they mitigate it themselves in a way that either through contracts or different changes of behavior? And can they finance it themselves, right, either to a captive or just using their balance sheet? 
So A lot happens with a client before they even risk transfer. So just always good to keep that in mind. But when they do decide the risk transfer, they certainly go into a market, and we help them with insight with regard to options and structures and whether it's retentions or deductibles, coinsurance, limits a variety of things that clients will look at in terms of what their budget is able to do, and they'll make their trade-offs. 
So it's never really a straight line as to the unit cost as to what the client behavior actually sort of manifests itself in. And you see that in a couple of distressed products that are out there today. Certainly, D&O is one that's gotten a lot of attention how we work with clients to help them make those choices in terms of the protection that they provide. Cyber is another, property and catastrophe exposed areas. 
So there's a lot that goes into before they go to market as opposed to what they buy inside the marketplace. And so it's frankly, an area where our teams have been focused on now for the last 24 months as the market has gotten firmer, to help clients make those trade-offs because they're dealing with the marketplace now at a time where many of them are feeling stressed, in general, on their own businesses. 
And so how they make those trade-offs become more acute, in the last -- certainly, in the last 12 months? And would expect that, that behavior and that process would continue going into this year."

As we dig in with clients, and they understand that we're all about bringing them the best of the now, all the things they could do in the current environment. Eric has described a number of different challenges that are out there and how we're going to help serve them better. 
But also the challenges that are -- used to be on the horizon are now in their doorstep. And they're asking questions around what about the next pandemic, what do we do? I don't want to think about cyber, right? The market is still relatively small, $6 billion, $7 billion against a connected client impact of closer to $1 trillion. What do we do about that? 
By the way, they know climate is going to be front and center already is, but really going to be front and center in pandemic as the sites they're behind us. So they're asking questions to me around how do I address these long-tail risks that are being asked of me by CFOs and CEOs and Boards of Directors? 
So what I'm trying to highlight is need has never been higher. And the solutions that we must bring to bear have got to evolve. We have to be better in supporting them. And we as -- we start with Aon in the entire industry, and they see this combination as a chance to reverse the trend in which our overall relevance has actually declined as a percent of risk, as a percent of GDP over the last 30 years.

I guess, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about ESG and the strategy there. And part of, to me, what is underlying this question is we've seen some carriers step away from certain products in full, and that they're not going to ensure projects like that and more. I mean, look, when I think of Aon, I think of a solution for unmet needs and being strategic in how you help clients place that risk. 
But if carriers are stepping away from things like that, to me, there could be competing efforts of you being a solution for unmet needs, but also having your own ESG policies that maybe coal isn't within your wheelhouse anymore. So coal is just an example, but you can talk more broadly than that, but just to help you clarify how I'm thinking about this."

Listen, we are absolutely committed in every way to implementing ESG best practices, internally for sure, and to promote resiliency. But listen, the picture on it is so important. 
The way the industry can play, relating to climate, it's [indiscernible]. Again, if you think about where we are, everyone's focused on the pandemic in many respects now, but this is just who gets the sides behind us. Climate change in our view is going to be front and center. 
And it's going to be a challenge. When you think about matching capital with risk, not to solve what energy source it is, but literally the transition risk, the clients -- transition pressure, they're getting transition volatility -- why don't we identify capability? 
How do I identify capital to help them do that? And the combination with Willis Towers Watson, we believe, will be formidable. There's tremendous capability in Willis Towers Watson that John Haley and his team has done a great job developing over time. That, combined with what we have, we think we ever shot to really make a difference, helping clients make better decisions as they think about this transition volatility that everyone is going to encounter as you think about addressing the climate challenges. 
So this is a high priority for us inside of Aon in our own world, for sure. And you'll see that, by the way, we've got an upcoming 2020 impact report that's going to detail our commitment around carbon neutrality and all pieces around that. But really, the opportunity here is what we can do on the outset clients. And it is, in our view, again, another -- it's just not been addressed in a way that's meaningful and it's a real opportunity for the industry to make a difference, and we look forward to doing."

Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year of 2020 conference call. I'm joined virtually by Christa Davies, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President.

I'm joined virtually by Christa Davies, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President.  
As in previous quarters, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website. There are very few firms who can say they ended 2020 stronger than they began. And I want to thank our colleagues for making Aon one of those firms. Our team delivered a tremendous year, set against the public health and economic impact of COVID-19 and an overall unprecedented level of global volatility, punctuated by social unrest around the world.  
During the year, our colleagues came together to deliver results for clients to both time and energy to getting to know the Willis Towers Watson team and the integration planning for our pending combination and to support each other through personal and professional challenges.  
One silver lining that we heard over and over from colleagues was that 2020 was a year of increased connection across our firm. We saw our colleagues respond to the virtual environment for replacing in-person connections both introducing experts and sharing thought leadership with clients. We felt the impact of that connectivity as our COVID-19 task force ramped up to share insights and best practices. And we saw it translate into client success as local teams won new business by seamlessly bringing together colleagues from across the globe.  
By all accounts, 2020 tested our firm. Looking back, it's clear that our colleagues not only passed, although this diversity actually accelerated our long term strategy. Seeing our colleagues come together and forged stronger connection in new ways was inspirational. And we'll build on these positive learnings and practices in 2020 as we continue to reject the constraints of the so-called new normal and instead look forward to defining a new better on our terms as we begin 2021.  
Turning to financial performance. In the fourth quarter, we delivered a great finish to the year, with 2% organic revenue growth across the firm, including 12% growth in Reinsurance Solutions and 4% growth in Commercial Risk Solutions.  
As in recent quarters, organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter was driven by strength in the core areas of our business, reflecting the resilience of our firm in a challenging economic environment, overcoming ongoing and expected pressure in the more discretionary areas.  
In particular, we would highlight growth in the core, driven by ongoing strong retention and net new business generation as we continue to deliver innovative solutions to our clients in a challenging environment.  
We saw increased organic revenue growth as compared to the third quarter despite the somewhat larger portion of more discretionary revenues in the fourth quarter. This strong result spend partially from improvements in economic factors and sentiment around the virus and vaccine, which drives client buying behavior and investment.  
For example, we saw a positive impact to our revenue from construction starts and M&A activity in the U.S. as well as from employment levels. I would also note that in more discretionary areas, we're seeing meaningful variation in revenue growth across our businesses, with some recovering more quickly and some more slowly, largely driven by external factors tied to economic reopening and recovery. 
For example, I would highlight strength in voluntary benefits in Health Solutions, and Construction and Commercial Risk. I would also note that more discretionary areas, like travel and events within data and analytics and even capital within Retirement Solutions, continue to be impacted by economic and pandemic-related conditions.  
Our strong finish in Q4 contributed to full year financial results that demonstrate the strength and resilience of our business in this uncertain economic environment. For the year, we delivered organic revenue growth of 1%, operating income growth of 4%, with full year operating margins of 28.5%, an increase of 100 basis points from 2019 and free cash flow growth of 64% to $2.6 billion, the highest free cash flow in the history of our firm.  
This outstanding progress against each of our key financial metrics is a direct result of our one firm strategy, which guides everything we do in supporting colleagues, delivering value to clients and driving shareholder value. We are well-positioned to continue to build on this momentum. 
And while we see many positive signs for the economy, significant uncertainty remains, and we expect the recovery will remain inconsistent. We continue to monitor several key factors, including GDP, asset values, corporate revenues and employment. 
As we look to 2021, though significant uncertainty remains, we expect, as economic conditions continue to stabilize and improve, we anticipate modest growth in Q1, with growth increasing toward mid-single digits as we continue through the year. 
Looking back, the challenges we faced in 2020 underscore the importance of colleagues, our culture and our commitment to inclusion and diversity. We've long observed that leaders who embody one firm are our most successful leaders, both in delivering business results and driving colleague engagement. 
And this year, we've seen that in special leadership trade results even stronger engagement and confidence in the combination, as measured in a January poll survey reflecting high engagement and consistently lower voluntary attrition, which decreased by 35% year-over-year from 2020 with strength in every major region and solution line. 
Further, we know the diverse talent, expertise and insights of our colleagues are vital to the success of our firm and our clients, and we continually invest to attract, grow and retain the best talent. In support of this priority, we announced the expansion of our apprenticeship program, including an investment of $30 million over the next 5 years and development of a nationwide network of employers to create 10,000 apprenticeships by 2030. 
With this expansion, we're building on our already successful program, which bridges the gap from education to employment by bringing high school graduates into the workforce, while they complete their college education. This program provides a fantastic pipeline of diverse talent and embodies our commitment to inclusion and diversity. 
In addition to emphasizing the importance of our colleagues and our culture, the events of 2020 exposed the interconnected nature of risk and vulnerabilities in many companies. Our recently published 2020 risk report highlights the increasing likelihood of connected extremes and reinforces that leading organizations in the future will be defined by their ability to manage the global implications of long-tail risks. 
In this survey of over 500 organizations across geographies and industries, 82% did not add pandemic in their top 10 risks before COVID-19 struck, and only 30% had a pandemic plan in place. Looking forward, respondents overwhelmingly agreed on the need for an enterprise-wide approach to risk. 
We know that existing and emerging long-tail risks will continue to challenge organizations across all industries and geographies. Organizations must prioritize strategies to address risks and resilience. We also know our strategy enables us to support clients in this changing landscape because it enabled us to understand their biggest challenges and bring world-class content, capability and innovative solutions to bear.
And while we didn't architect our pending combination with Willis Towers Watson with the pandemic in mind, we see that the pandemic and its associated economic impacts have increased our conviction and the need to accelerate innovation to address client demand. 
On the topic of Willis Towers Watson. Our excitement about the combination as well as the leadership and talent from both sides continues to grow. Last week, we reached another important milestone with the announcement of the combined executive committee that will be in place once the combination is closed. This team embraces the commitment to a one firm mindset and brings together the best expertise, talent and leadership from both organizations. This team also brings to the table an exceptional set of experiences and capability, reinforcing the power of inclusion. As we said before, our culture is built to bring the best of our firm to clients. It's an essential part of how we operate our firm and drive results. 
At Willis Towers Watson, it's clear that their culture is equally focused on putting clients first. This newly announced team will blend the best of those cultures And that client-focused mindset will guide everything we do. 
In summary, 2020 was a momentous year. Our performance and actions throughout the year reflect exceptional resilience. Now the result of structural steps and investments we've made to ensure we're ready to not only take on, but grow stronger in the face of these challenges. Further, we've demonstrated momentum that will accelerate in combination with Willis Towers Watson. We begin 2021 in a position of strength to continue executing our strategy and making progress on our key financial metrics, both the stand-alone Aon and in our pending combination with Willis Towers Watson, creating a significant growth opportunity for clients, for colleagues and for shareholders. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our financial progress this year and long-term outlook. Christa?"

As Greg highlighted, we delivered a strong operational and financial performance in Q4 to finish the year, despite continuing macroeconomic challenges, demonstrating the resiliency and strength of our business in any economic environments. 
Turning to our results. We delivered organic revenue growth of 2% in the fourth quarter and 1% for the full year, driven by ongoing strength in our core business, offset by pressure in our more discretionary areas. 
I would note, total reported revenue was up slightly, overcoming a nearly $100 million headwind from the unfavorable impact of changes in FX as well as lower fiduciary investment income due to lower interest rates globally. 
We also delivered operational improvement for the full year, with operating income growth of 4% and operating margin expansion of 100 basis points to 28.5%, continuing our trajectory of long-term sustainable margin expansion. 
For the full year, adjusted operating expense declined 1% due to expense discipline and a reduction in travel and entertainment, offset by increased compensation costs. Adjusted operating expenses increased 4% in fourth quarter. 
Putting Q4 in context. Due to the significant uncertainty we saw during the year, we tightly controlled our expense base and level of long-term investment in the business. During 2020, our organic revenue growth improved sequentially from the second quarter through the fourth quarter, as internal and external factors contribute to a strong finish to the year. 
This led to a year-over-year increase in compensation benefits expense in the fourth quarter, a portion of which was variable compensation. This resulted in a full year increase in adjusted compensation and benefit expense of 1%. 
I would also note that compensation expense increased in part because of our commitment during 2020 to retain all 50,000 colleagues as well as lower voluntary attrition, which Greg described. As we said before, we make decisions on expenses and margins in the context of each full year and expect to continue to drive margin expansion in 2021. 
For the full year, we translated strong operational performance into EPS growth of 7%, overcoming a headwind from FX translation. If currency remains stable at today's rates, we'd expect this favorable impact of approximately $0.20 per share or approximately $60 million of operating income in the first quarter of 2021 due to a weaker dollar over the euro. 
A key driver of our operational success has been the history of investment in our Aon Business Services platform, which has undergone significant transformation over the last several years. The journey began with initial group of 4,000 colleagues, after the divesture of our outsourcing business in 2017. By centralizing activities, eliminating inefficiencies and promoting standardization, we delivered higher quality service levels and cost savings with better scalability, flexibility and enhanced colleague experience. 
Today, approximately 13,000 of Aon's 50,000 colleagues are part of Aon Business Services, focused on driving operational improvement and enhancing how we serve clients. In 2020, for instance, we completed our data center consolidation program in the Americas, closing an additional 10 data centers and achieving $23 million of annual savings. 
We increased the usage of our digital figures store by over 110%, saving more than 65,000 hours annually. We renewed 90% of the nearly 9,000 U.S. commercial risk licenses paperlessly. And we improved our global operations and shared capabilities, by delivering over 1 million hours of automation, freeing colleague capacity for high-value activities with clients. 
Looking forward, we expect to leverage our Aon Business Services platform to continue to drive sustainable margin expansion. In addition, we see opportunities to embed best practices around agility and connectivity into how and where we operate, ultimately reducing our overall real estate footprint over the long term. 
Turning to cash and capital allocation. Free cash flow increased 64% to $2.6 billion, primarily driven by working capital improvements, including improved collections, a decrease in restructuring cash outlays and strong operational improvement. We remain focused on maximizing the translation of revenue into the highest level of free cash flow, as highlighted by our free cash flow margin of 23.9%, up substantially from last year. 
We allocate capital based on return on invested capital, cash-on-cash returns. We continue to maximize shareholder value creation, highlighted by the $800 million of share repurchase in the quarter and nearly $1.8 billion in 2020.
In 2021, we expect to continue to allocate capital according to this framework, and we expect share repurchase will continue to be our highest return on capital investment, given our free cash flow valuation and outlook. We expect to remain highly focused on closing, and then successfully integrating our combination with Willis Towers Watson. Following that, we expect to continue to invest organically and inorganically in innovative content and capabilities in our priority areas. 
We remain very confident in the strength of our balance sheet and manage liquidity risk through a well-laddered debt maturity profile. Historically, we've looked to increase debt as EBITDA grows, while maintaining leverage ratios. However, due to uncertain macroeconomic conditions, we expect to continue to manage our leverage ratios conservatively in the near future and return to our past practice of growing debt as EBITDA grows over the long term. 
As I look towards 2021 and our pending combination with Willis Towers Watson, I'd like to reiterate how excited we are about the newly announced leadership team, and the significant shareholder value creation potential we see in bringing together our 2 complementary businesses, both from a top line growth, driven by accelerated innovation to clients, and from the bottom line impact of $800 million in cost synergies. 
We continue to work collaboratively with the appropriate regulators to gain approvals and are focused on achieving a result that optimizes shareholder value. We remain committed to our expected close in the first half of 2021. 
In summary, our business has shown resiliency through the challenges of 2020. Our Aon United strategy, underpinned by our Aon Business Services operational platform, has enabled historically high free cash flow of $2.66 billion and enabled us to return nearly $2.2 billion of capital to shareholders in 2020. 
As we head into 2021, through our pending combination with Willis Towers Watson, this momentum will continue to enable long-term shareholder value creation. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'd be delighted to take your questions."

I know you've been continuing to make progress towards your $500 million of working capital improvement over time. How far into that? How much of that have you achieved so far?"

And so there's nothing unusual about that number. And then in terms of working capital, we obviously made some progress on working capital as we saw in 2020.

And then in terms of working capital, we obviously made some progress on working capital as we saw in 2020. But we'd actually say that the $500 million is still the right long-term target for Aon working capital. 
So -- and Dave, the thing I think I've said before on that $500 million is that's just the number that gets you to working capital-neutral. There are several countries in which we operate, we're working capital positive. We don't think that is entirely reasonable for a threshold services fund. 
And so we think that a $500 million is a conservative number. And we're definitely targeting underlying free cash flow growth over the long term in the double-digit range."

Even yesterday, I was on a call that would have been a client meeting, 1 year ago with 100 clients plus, we had 1,000 clients on yesterday. And so our ability to actually connect with clients and actually demonstrate the full capability of the firm at a time of high need is actually going up.

So maybe if you could help us understand that.

As Eric just highlighted, there's so many opportunities that continue to emerge to help clients at times of need and they're just continuing to emerge around the world.

If you think about the momentum into the fourth quarter, it really was in the core, and we continue to perform well there. And then the discretionary pieces, as there was some promise on the recovery front, the vaccine front, et cetera, we saw some of those discretionary areas like TL, transaction liability and constrained in employment levels begin to come up. 
But by the way, other areas, we still saw the pressure. I mentioned travel and events, as an example, and some others. So it still remains mixed, but the trend is positive. And what you're really seeing is us enabled to kind of interact in a very positive way with clients. And you're seeing that sort of build into Q4. You're also seeing it as we think about our opportunities in 2021.

And so we were there to be able to help those new clients and existing clients really reposition their portfolios as they went into '21. 
But I would say that continued into the first quarter. As the market dynamics being what they are, the insurers are certainly looking to position and get support where they need it as they look to grow their own portfolio. So great quarter, certainly on the back of a fantastic quarter 1 year ago. So to see that kind of growth this year off the back of a 70% comparable was a special quarter for the team, and I think that momentum is carrying into the first quarter of this year."

But really, Greg, just when we stepped back, it really is about this is when Aon can really show up and help clients succeed in times of need. And they do a lot of reconfiguring as we think about as the environment changes.

It's never really a straight line between what the carrier points out is what they say is the unit price versus what a client actually does. 
Maybe to put it in a little bit of context, when we sit with the client, we first do the risk identification process by trying to help them understand exactly what risk they're trying to protect. Can they mitigate it themselves in a way that either through contracts or different changes of behavior? And can they finance it themselves, right, either to a captive or just using their balance sheet? 
So A lot happens with a client before they even risk transfer. So just always good to keep that in mind. But when they do decide the risk transfer, they certainly go into a market, and we help them with insight with regard to options and structures and whether it's retentions or deductibles, coinsurance, limits a variety of things that clients will look at in terms of what their budget is able to do, and they'll make their trade-offs. 
So it's never really a straight line as to the unit cost as to what the client behavior actually sort of manifests itself in. And you see that in a couple of distressed products that are out there today. Certainly, D&O is one that's gotten a lot of attention how we work with clients to help them make those choices in terms of the protection that they provide. Cyber is another, property and catastrophe exposed areas. 
So there's a lot that goes into before they go to market as opposed to what they buy inside the marketplace. And so it's frankly, an area where our teams have been focused on now for the last 24 months as the market has gotten firmer, to help clients make those trade-offs because they're dealing with the marketplace now at a time where many of them are feeling stressed, in general, on their own businesses. 
And so how they make those trade-offs become more acute, in the last -- certainly, in the last 12 months? And would expect that, that behavior and that process would continue going into this year."

By the way, they know climate is going to be front and center already is, but really going to be front and center in pandemic as the sites they're behind us. So they're asking questions to me around how do I address these long-tail risks that are being asked of me by CFOs and CEOs and Boards of Directors? 
So what I'm trying to highlight is need has never been higher. And the solutions that we must bring to bear have got to evolve. We have to be better in supporting them. And we as -- we start with Aon in the entire industry, and they see this combination as a chance to reverse the trend in which our overall relevance has actually declined as a percent of risk, as a percent of GDP over the last 30 years. And they see real promise in that. 
So our feedback has been overwhelmingly positive across the globe on what this combination would mean for them. And we're very excited to work hard to meet those needs on their behalf."

I mean, look, when I think of Aon, I think of a solution for unmet needs and being strategic in how you help clients place that risk. 
But if carriers are stepping away from things like that, to me, there could be competing efforts of you being a solution for unmet needs, but also having your own ESG policies that maybe coal isn't within your wheelhouse anymore.

Listen, we are absolutely committed in every way to implementing ESG best practices, internally for sure, and to promote resiliency. But listen, the picture on it is so important. 
The way the industry can play, relating to climate, it's [indiscernible]. Again, if you think about where we are, everyone's focused on the pandemic in many respects now, but this is just who gets the sides behind us. Climate change in our view is going to be front and center. 
And it's going to be a challenge. When you think about matching capital with risk, not to solve what energy source it is, but literally the transition risk, the clients -- transition pressure, they're getting transition volatility -- why don't we identify capability? 
How do I identify capital to help them do that? And the combination with Willis Towers Watson, we believe, will be formidable. There's tremendous capability in Willis Towers Watson that John Haley and his team has done a great job developing over time. That, combined with what we have, we think we ever shot to really make a difference, helping clients make better decisions as they think about this transition volatility that everyone is going to encounter as you think about addressing the climate challenges. 
So this is a high priority for us inside of Aon in our own world, for sure. And you'll see that, by the way, we've got an upcoming 2020 impact report that's going to detail our commitment around carbon neutrality and all pieces around that. But really, the opportunity here is what we can do on the outset clients. And it is, in our view, again, another -- it's just not been addressed in a way that's meaningful and it's a real opportunity for the industry to make a difference, and we look forward to doing."

Our ability to help reduce that over time is, we think, substantial. And that is why and this is a massive opportunity. It's going to require though new insight, new innovation, evolution beyond where our industry has done, beyond what we have done. And that's why back to why the combination? What's it all about? It's about being able to address some of the types of these issues. Climate is one. Cyber is another one, that's so underdeveloped substantially, intellectual property.

Welcome to our first quarter 2021 conference call. I'm joined by Christa Davies, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President. As in previous quarters, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our websit",1310,"Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2021 conference call. I'm joined by Christa Davies, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President. As in previous quarters, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website. 
I'd like to start by acknowledging the tremendous work of our colleagues across the firm. Our team continues to find ways to get back, not just to normal, but even better than before. We like to call it the new better. The idea of the new better started in the second half of last year with a series of regional and local client coalitions. There are now 10 coalitions of leading companies around the world that we formed to explore the societal and economic implications of the pandemic. The group rejects the idea of accepting a suboptimal new normal and is working to find new better. The work is ongoing and continues to offer meaningful insights into how leading organizations will work, travel and convene in the year ahead. And we're translating those insights into new solutions that are designated and designed to accelerate recovery from COVID-19. 
For instance, we know that widespread global vaccine distribution is a key part of the solution and 1 that day on is enabling. Let me describe recognized in limitations with current supply chain solutions, Aon colleagues from commercial risk, reinsurance and health solutions collaborated with insurance, reinsurance and share tech and supply chain industry partners to develop a groundbreaking solution that uses sensors and analytics in the transportation and storage of vaccines. The centers provide transparent, real-time data and alerts gives the temperature of a vaccine shipment falls outside the manufacturers range. Potentially allowing for mitigation efforts and helping to maximize the number of doses administered to the public. It's just another example of how we're creating innovative solutions to move our industry and society forward. We're also donating all 2021 revenue from the solution to an international organization working to help end the human and economic tool caused by the pandemic. 
Turning now to financials. Our global team delivered outstanding results across each of our key financial metrics, including 6% organic revenue growth, a very strong start to the year on top of 5% organic in Q1 2020. Substantial operating margin expansion of 170 basis points, 16% EPS growth and 91% free cash flow growth. Within organic revenue, we continue to see strength in our core, driven by strong retention and net new business generation and overall growth within more discretionary areas of revenue, with some areas coming back faster than others. Commercial risk delivered 9% organic, an outstanding result with very strong new business growth and growth in project-related work and double-digit growth in transaction liability. Reinsurance delivered 6% growth with strong net new business in treaty and double-digit growth in facultative placements. Retirement Solutions delivered 5% growth, and I would highlight strength in core retirement and double-digit growth in human capital. Health Solutions growth of 4% and was driven by strength in the core, offset by pressure in project work. One of the areas we're seeing a little slower bounce back, and data and analytics continue to see pressure from the travel and events practice globally, resulting in a 2% organic decline. So against the prior Q1 quarter of pre pandemic results. 
These results are an improvement from our Q4 earnings call outlook. During the quarter, we saw better-than-expected macroeconomic growth, which positively impacted client buying behavior. Looking forward, if macroeconomic conditions continue to be strong, we would expect mid-single digit or greater organic revenue growth for the full year 2021. And while our Q1 results demonstrate, that our Aon United strategy is driving innovative solutions that address our clients' biggest challenges, we keep seeing signs that we must move faster. We see our clients justifiably focused on the economic impact of COVID-19, but they're also increasingly focused on other challenges, like climate change, supply chain disruption, reimagining and reconfiguring how and where work gets done, the growing health wealth gap and cyber. Our recent cyber risk report highlighted findings from our proprietary cyber quotient evaluation, a comprehensive assessment of cyber risk maturity. The 2020 data tells us that organizations across regions and industries, are only maintaining a basic level of cyber readiness. Specifically, only 2 in 5 organizations report they're prepared to navigate new exposures, and only 17% report having adequate application security measures in place. 
And on our recent gray swan report, we looked back at 40 years of corporate crises, analyzing 300 examples that show the significant impact on shareholder value due to lack of preparedness. The total impact represents $1.2 trillion in destroyed value, and in 10% of the events, 50% of shareholder value was lost. These risks and challenges are exactly what we want to help our clients assess and prepare for. In another great example, our human capital and commercial risk teams realized that their client in the life sciences med tech space had not done an assessment or quantification of cyber risk for their business or products. Our team analyzes risks across infrastructure, technology, vendor and digitally enabled products and quantify potential losses or impacts as reputation, business interruption or a hack from the direct to their devices. In response to this prioritized and quantified risk assessment. Our clients strengthen their own security measures and change their insurance coverage, increasing their preparedness and reducing potential future volatility of their business. A topic that's more critical than ever for companies in the life sciences industry. 
Looking forward, this is a process and a solution offering that makes innovative cyber solutions more accessible to our clients in the life sciences space. As we look to our pending combination with Willis Towers Watson, we're confident their insights and capabilities will be a compelling catalyst to this work. And this is just 1 example out of thousands where we see the potential for the pending combination of Aon and Willis Towers Watson teams to drive innovation based on forward-looking analytics and insight. As we brought together the executive committee that will be in place after the close of the combination, the potential is clearer than ever. We have an opportunity to be more relevant to clients at a time when they need us most. Another example, our Aon team is currently advising a client on the integration of their largest transaction today, a complex global merger that's moving very quickly. Colleagues from data analytics, retirement, health and benefits and human capital, came together to advise our client on harmonizing their people programs while balancing synergies and deal objectives to drive employee engagement and retention as well as a shared vision from day 1. Our client is relying on Aon to help them protect their greatest asset, their people. We know that the combination with Willis Towers Watson will enable us to bring together our combined capabilities as in each company's client insight around health, retirement and engagement will improve and accelerate our ability to deliver projects like these for clients. 
In summary, our first quarter results demonstrate the continued success of our strategy and position us with momentum to drive improvement on our key metrics over the course of the year, building on a track record of progress that we've delivered over the past decade. The events of 2021 continue to highlight unmet need and growing demand from clients around their biggest challenges, which we know are best addressed by our 1 firm, Aon United strategy. Our ability to address client needs and accelerate innovation will only get better in our pending combination with Willis Towers Watson, which continues to increase our commitment and excitement for the potential of the combined firm. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our financials and long-term outlook for continued shareholder value creation. Christa?"
119853,710900661,2264754,"Aon plc, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2021",2021-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Aon plc","Executives","Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone.

As Greg mentioned, we delivered a strong operational and financial performance in the first quarter to start the year. Highlighted by 6% organic revenue growth that translated into double-digit growth in operating income, earnings per share and free cash flow. Our Aon United strategy has enabled continued growth across our key financial metrics. We look forward to building on this momentum through the rest of 2021 and in our pending combination with Willis Towers Watson. As I further reflect on the quarter, we delivered organic revenue growth of 6% and driven by ongoing strength in our core business with an uneven recovery in our more discretionary areas. I would also note that total reported revenue was up 10%, including the favorable impact from changes in FX primarily driven by a weaker U.S. dollar versus the euro. 
Second, we delivered strong operational improvement with operating income growth of 15% and operating margin expansion of 170 basis points to 37.4%. Stepping back, our goal is to deliver a sustainable operating margin expansion over the course of the full year as there can be volatility quarter-to-quarter given the seasonality of our business and timing of expenses including long-term investment and growth. In Q1, margin expansion was helped by 2 factors. First, organic revenue growth exceeded our Q4 outlook, due to the impact of macroeconomic factors and client buying behavior. Second, Q1 2020 had higher expenses in areas like T&E and investments in the business, which made for an easier comparable when compared to our expectations for the rest of 2021. 
Looking to the rest of 2021, we anticipate investment in the business and some potential resumption of T&E later in the year. Looking forward to quarterly patterning of expenses for the balance of 2021. As we described last year, we reduced certain discretionary expenses at the onset of the pandemic, given the significant macroeconomic uncertainty. And then return to somewhat more normalized levels of spend in the back half of the year as macroeconomic conditions improved and the outlook stabilized. 
In 2021 compared to 2020, we expect approximately $200 million less expense to be recognized in the fourth quarter, offset by approximately $135 million more expense in Q2 and $65 million more expense in Q3. Put another way, we expect $135 million of expense to move from Q4 to Q2 and $65 million of expense to move from Q4 to Q3 when comparing to our expectations for the remainder of 2021 to prior year results, prior to any growth occurring. This shift, representing about 2% of our annual cost base is primarily due to the actions we took and highlighted last year. Including the reduction of certain discretionary expenses, including variable compensation in Q2 and Q3 of 2020. This shift also spreads our expense base more evenly across quarters. So we still do expect to see occasional variability and lumpiness in expenses. This change will have an impact on quarterly margins, reducing margins in Q2 and Q3 and increasing them in Q4. However, it does not change our expectation of full year margin expansion for 2020/'21. 
As we've stated previously, our goal is to deliver sustainable margin expansion over the course of each full year, driven by accelerating revenue growth, portfolio mix shift to higher growth, higher-margin businesses and leverage from Aon Business Services. Aon Business Services is focused on innovation as well as effectiveness. Recently, our Aon Business Services team saw an opportunity to improve premium accounting with a blockchain solution. The team works with a carrier partner and the insurance industry standard setting group to design and develop a clearinghouse for premium transactions. This process has been live since the 1st of January 2021 and has over 13,000 transactions executed. It's already improving the speed at which errors are identified and resolved. Over time, we expect our major carrier partners and other brokers to join the platform. We see this as a significant opportunity to improve the client experience with higher quality, and reduce inefficiencies across the industry. As with other Aon Business Services process improvements, efficiencies in this new blockchain process enable our colleagues to spend more time with clients and on higher value-added activities. 
Turning back to the results of the quarter. We translated strong operational performance into EPS growth of 16%. As noted in our earnings material, FX translation was a favorable impact of approximately $0.18 in the quarter. If currency to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect a $0.04 per share favorable impact in Q2, a $0.02 per share favorable impact in Q3 and a $0.01 per share favorable impact in Q4. 
Finally, moving to cash and capital allocation. Free cash flow increased 91% to $532 million, primarily driven by strong operational improvement, a decrease in restructuring cash outlays and a decrease in CapEx. I would note that we do expect CapEx for the full year to increase modestly as we invest in technology to drive business growth. 
Looking forward, we expect to drive free cash flow growth over the long term, building on our 10-year track record of 14% CAGR growth in free cash flow. Including 64% growth to $2.6 billion free cash flow in 2020. We remain incredibly excited for the long-term cash flow potential of the pending combination. We make capital allocation decisions based on our ROIC framework, highlighted by $50 million of share repurchase in the fourth -- first quarter. As a reminder, Q1 is our seasonally smallest quarter for free cash flow, due primarily to incentive compensation payments. We also repaid $400 million of term debt in February. 
Looking forward, we expect to remain highly focused on closing and then successfully integrating our combination with Willis Towers Watson. Following that, we expect to continue to invest organically and inorganically in innovative content and capabilities in priority areas to service our clients' unmet needs. We remain very confident in the strength of our balance sheet and manage liquidity risk through a well-laddered debt maturity profile. In the near term, we expect to continue to manage our leverage ratios conservatively and return to our past practice of growing debt as EBITDA grows over the long term. 
As I look towards our pending combination with Willis Towers Watson, we remain incredibly excited about the potential for growth in innovative solutions for clients, and the shareholder value creation opportunity. We are continuing to work collaboratively with the appropriate regulators to gain approvals, and we've offered remedies. We continue to anticipate $800 million of cost synergies taking into account the remedies offered. We would expect to allocate any divestiture proceeds according to our ROIC framework in which share buyback continues to be our highest return investment. We are working towards the close in the first half of 2021, subject to regulatory approval. 
In summary, our first quarter results reflect continued progress, building on a decade of momentum. Driven by our Aon United strategy and underpinned by our Aon Business Services operational platform. We remain incredibly excited about closing our pending combination and beginning the integration process with Willis Towers Watson, which will continue to enable long-term shareholder value creation. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'd be delighted to take your questions."

But before I do, if I can make a comment on your earlier question, just on the excitement around the combination of what we're starting to see maybe a level lower certainly, the teams have been working on integration from a client experience and a revenue standpoint, culture innovation, all those things. And we're really beginning to see the possibilities. As we go deeper into the organization around the planning process, whether it's things like on the risk side, the cat modeling and securitization experience that Aon has the Willis' climate capabilities and their resilient hub and they're climatized. Those types of things, when you put them together really do provide excitement for our teams to see what's possible. And so there's a lot of those things that we're identifying as we go through the process, and it's really building some excitement across both organizations as they really begin to see the value they can unlock for clients. 
And so now maybe to picture question on pricing. I would say this, the dynamic of the pricing, as we say, it's moderately positive. But it's always -- it's never a straightforward answer, right? And I'll give you some context as to why. We engage these clients in a couple of steps before you ever get to the marketplace, right? We do the risk analysis and identification. We work with them on mitigating strategies so that they don't even transfer the risk, how they can finance it among themselves. And then ultimately, if they do decide to make the transfer to a third party, they're coming at this marketplace with their own risk appetite, their own budget capacity, the options in the market. We're using our capability to help them make the trade offs. But ultimately, each product, there is no marketplace, right? I always got to kick out of when people talk about the broader market. It's a series of micro markets. Each product has its own dynamics, own claim trends, terms conditions, retention, claims, supply demand, all of that, whether you're talking property, D&O, marine, it's a variety of different things. And ultimately, our role in this is to help clients evaluate how to manage the risk, make the right choices that they make, they can make. So as we see it, it's moderate, it's moderately positive, as we say. But ultimately, clients make choices in every market that help them meet their own needs."

But more importantly, I think there's enormous client value to unlock that expertise in an immediate way where they're not getting an interpretation through someone else. They're talking right to the source. And getting that value in real time. So I mean, ultimately, we're going to use what we've learned, and we're going to meet the clients where they want to be met. But I think we've learned a lot and we're going to apply it."

They're supporting each other. That's nonduplicatable, right? That's taken us a decade to work through. And so it turns out the 10 paces on the screen amplifies what it means to work Aon United together as 1 firm. And that what clients see, they commented to us, which is, wow, I didn't really understand what this meant before. And by the only way they could have seen it is, as Eric -- as Eric described, we put 10 people in the conference room, which we're never going to do. But 10 on Webex totally interacting on behalf of clients, really addressing their issues, that is pretty cool. The example I gave on the commentary upfront around the the vaccine protection was exactly that. It was a group of people together that probably wouldn't have gone together in the same way before. So we just want you to -- we don't understand how we're thinking about our business as T&E comes back, but it's much, much broader than that."

So clients are actually more tuned, they're like, what am I going to do on this? And how am I going to play it out?

Welcome to our first quarter 2021 conference call. I'm joined by Christa Davies, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President. As in previous quarters, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our websit",1309,"Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2021 conference call. I'm joined by Christa Davies, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President. As in previous quarters, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website. 
I'd like to start by acknowledging the tremendous work of our colleagues across the firm. Our team continues to find ways to get back, not just to normal, but even better than before. We like to call it the new better. The idea of the new better started in the second half of last year with a series of regional and local client coalitions. There are now 10 coalitions of leading companies around the world. That we formed to explore the societal and economic implications of the pandemic. The group rejects the idea of accepting a suboptimal new normal and is working to find a new better. The work is ongoing and continues to offer meaningful insights into how leading organizations will work, travel and convene in the year ahead. And we're translating those insights into new solutions that are designated and designed to accelerate recovery from COVID-19. 
For instance, we know that widespread global vaccine distribution is a key part of the solution and one that day on is enabling. Let me describe. Recognized in limitations with current supply chain solutions, Aon colleagues from commercial risk, reinsurance and health solutions collaborated with insurance, reinsurance and share tech and supply chain industry partners to develop a groundbreaking solution that uses sensors and analytics in the transportation and storage of vaccines. The centers provide transparent, real-time data and alerts give the temperature of a vaccine shipment falls outside the manufacturers range. Potentially allowing for mitigation efforts and helping to maximize the number of doses administered to the public. It's just another example of how we're creating innovative solutions to move our industry and society forward. We're also donating all 2021 revenue from the solution to an international organization working to help end the human and economic toll caused by the pandemic. 
Turning now to financials. Our global team delivered outstanding results across each of our key financial metrics, including 6% organic revenue growth, a very strong start to the year on top of 5% organic in Q1 2020. Substantial operating margin expansion of 170 basis points, 16% EPS growth and 91% free cash flow growth. Within organic revenue, we continue to see strength in our core, driven by strong retention and net new business generation and overall growth within more discretionary areas of revenue, with some areas coming back faster than others. Commercial risk delivered 9% organic, an outstanding result with very strong new business growth and growth in project-related work and double-digit growth in transaction liability. Reinsurance delivered 6% growth with strong net new business in treaty and double-digit growth in facultative placements. Retirement Solutions delivered 5% growth, and I would highlight strength in core retirement and double-digit growth in human capital. Health Solutions growth of 4% and was driven by strength in the core, offset by pressure in project work. One of the areas we're seeing a little slower bounce back, and data and analytics continued to see pressure from the travel and events practice globally, resulting in a 2% organic decline. So against the prior Q1 quarter of pre-pandemic results. 
These results are an improvement from our Q4 earnings call outlook. During the quarter, we saw better-than-expected macroeconomic growth, which positively impacted client buying behavior. Looking forward, if macroeconomic conditions continue to be strong, we would expect mid-single digit or greater organic revenue growth for the full year 2021. And while our Q1 results demonstrate, that our Aon United strategy is driving innovative solutions that address our clients' biggest challenges, we keep seeing signs that we must move faster. We see our clients justifiably focused on the economic impact of COVID-19, but they're also increasingly focused on other challenges, like climate change, supply chain disruption, reimagining and reconfiguring how and where work gets done, the growing health wealth gap and cyber. Our recent cyber risk report highlighted findings from our proprietary cyber quotient evaluation, a comprehensive assessment of cyber risk maturity. The 2020 data tells us that organizations across regions and industries, are only maintaining a basic level of cyber readiness. Specifically, only 2 in 5 organizations report they're prepared to navigate new exposures, and only 17% report having adequate application security measures in place. 
In our recent gray swan report, we looked back at 40 years of corporate crises, analyzing 300 examples that show the significant impact on shareholder value due to lack of preparedness. The total impact represents $1.2 trillion in destroyed value, and in 10% of the events, 50% of shareholder value was lost. These risks and challenges are exactly what we want to help our clients assess and prepare for. In another great example, our human capital and commercial risk teams realized that their client in the life sciences med tech space had not done an assessment or quantification of cyber risk for their business or products. Our team analyzes risks across infrastructure, technology, vendor and digitally enabled products and quantify potential losses or impacts as reputation, business interruption or a hack from the direct to their devices. In response to this prioritized and quantified risk assessment. Our clients strengthen their own security measures and change their insurance coverage, increasing their preparedness and reducing potential future volatility of their business. A topic that's more critical than ever for companies in the life sciences industry. 
Looking forward, this is a process and a solution offering that makes innovative cyber solutions more accessible to our clients in the life sciences space. As we look to our pending combination with Willis Towers Watson, we're confident their insights and capabilities will be a compelling catalyst to this work. And this is just one example out of thousands where we see the potential for the pending combination of Aon and Willis Towers Watson teams to drive innovation based on forward-looking analytics and insight. As we brought together the executive committee that will be in place after the close of the combination, the potential is clearer than ever. We have an opportunity to be more relevant to clients at a time when they need us most. Another example, our Aon team is currently advising a client on the integration of their largest transaction today, a complex global merger that's moving very quickly. Colleagues from data analytics, retirement, health and benefits and human capital, came together to advise our client on harmonizing their people programs while balancing synergies and deal objectives to drive employee engagement and retention as well as a shared vision from day 1. Our client is relying on Aon to help them protect their greatest asset, their people. We know that the combination with Willis Towers Watson will enable us to bring together our combined capabilities as in each company's client insight around health, retirement and engagement will improve and accelerate our ability to deliver projects like these for clients. 
In summary, our first quarter results demonstrate the continued success of our strategy and position us with momentum to drive improvement on our key metrics over the course of the year, building on a track record of progress that we've delivered over the past decade. The events of 2021 continue to highlight unmet need and growing demand from clients around their biggest challenges, which we know are best addressed by our one firm, Aon United strategy. Our ability to address client needs and accelerate innovation will only get better in our pending combination with Willis Towers Watson, which continues to increase our commitment and excitement for the potential of the combined firm. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our financials and long-term outlook for continued shareholder value creation. Christa?"
119853,710900661,2264900,"Aon plc, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2021",2021-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Aon plc","Executives","Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg mentioned, we delivered a strong operational and financial performance in the first quarter to start the year. Highlighted by 6% organic revenue growth that translated into double-digit growth in o",1210,"Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg mentioned, we delivered a strong operational and financial performance in the first quarter to start the year. Highlighted by 6% organic revenue growth that translated into double-digit growth in operating income, earnings per share and free cash flow. Our Aon United strategy has enabled continued growth across our key financial metrics. We look forward to building on this momentum through the rest of 2021 and in our pending combination with Willis Towers Watson. As I further reflect on the quarter, we delivered organic revenue growth of 6% driven by ongoing strength in our core business with an uneven recovery in our more discretionary areas. I would also note that total reported revenue was up 10%, including the favorable impact from changes in FX primarily driven by a weaker U.S. dollar versus the euro. 
Second, we delivered strong operational improvement with operating income growth of 15% and operating margin expansion of 170 basis points to 37.4%. Stepping back, our goal is to deliver a sustainable operating margin expansion over the course of the full year as there can be volatility quarter-to-quarter given the seasonality of our business and timing of expenses including long-term investment and growth. In Q1, margin expansion was helped by 2 factors. First, organic revenue growth exceeded our Q4 outlook, due to the impact of macroeconomic factors and client buying behavior. Second, Q1 2020 had higher expenses in areas like T&E and investments in the business, which made for an easier comparable when compared to our expectations for the rest of 2021. 
Looking to the rest of 2021, we anticipate investment in the business and some potential resumption of T&E later in the year. Looking forward to quarterly patterning of expenses for the balance of 2021. As we described last year, we reduced certain discretionary expenses at the onset of the pandemic, given the significant macroeconomic uncertainty. And then returned to somewhat more normalized levels of spend in the back half of the year as macroeconomic conditions improved and the outlook stabilized. 
In 2021 compared to 2020, we expect approximately $200 million less expense to be recognized in the fourth quarter, offset by approximately $135 million more expense in Q2 and $65 million more expense in Q3. Put another way, we expect $135 million of expense to move from Q4 to Q2 and $65 million of expense to move from Q4 to Q3 when comparing to our expectations for the remainder of 2021 to prior year results, prior to any growth occurring. This shift, representing about 2% of our annual cost base is primarily due to the actions we took and highlighted last year. Including the reduction of certain discretionary expenses, including variable compensation in Q2 and Q3 of 2020. This shift also spreads our expense base more evenly across quarters. So we still do expect to see occasional variability and lumpiness in expenses. This change will have an impact on quarterly margins, reducing margins in Q2 and Q3 and increasing them in Q4. However, it does not change our expectation of full year margin expansion for 2020/21. 
As we've stated previously, our goal is to deliver sustainable margin expansion over the course of each full year, driven by accelerating revenue growth, portfolio mix shift to higher growth, higher-margin businesses and leverage from Aon Business Services. Aon Business Services is focused on innovation as well as effectiveness. Recently, our Aon Business Services team saw an opportunity to improve premium accounting with a blockchain solution. The team works with a carrier partner and the insurance industry standard setting group to design and develop a clearinghouse for premium transactions. This process has been live since the 1st of January 2021 and has over 13,000 transactions executed. It's already improving the speed at which errors are identified and resolved. Over time, we expect our major carrier partners and other brokers to join the platform. We see this as a significant opportunity to improve the client experience with higher quality, and reduce inefficiencies across the industry. As with other Aon Business Services process improvements, efficiencies in this new blockchain process enable our colleagues to spend more time with clients and on higher value-added activities. 
Turning back to the results of the quarter. We translated strong operational performance into EPS growth of 16%. As noted in our earnings material, FX translation was a favorable impact of approximately $0.18 in the quarter. If currency to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect a $0.04 per share favorable impact in Q2, a $0.02 per share favorable impact in Q3 and a $0.01 per share favorable impact in Q4. 
Finally, moving to cash and capital allocation. Free cash flow increased 91% to $532 million, primarily driven by strong operational improvement, a decrease in restructuring cash outlays and a decrease in CapEx. I would note that we do expect CapEx for the full year to increase modestly as we invest in technology to drive business growth. 
Looking forward, we expect to drive free cash flow growth over the long term, building on our 10-year track record of 14% CAGR growth in free cash flow. Including 64% growth to $2.6 billion free cash flow in 2020. We remain incredibly excited for the long-term cash flow potential of the pending combination. We make capital allocation decisions based on our ROIC framework, highlighted by $50 million of share repurchase in the fourth -- first quarter. As a reminder, Q1 is our seasonally smallest quarter for free cash flow, due primarily to incentive compensation payments. We also repaid $400 million of term debt in February. 
Looking forward, we expect to remain highly focused on closing and then successfully integrating our combination with Willis Towers Watson. Following that, we expect to continue to invest organically and inorganically in innovative content and capabilities in priority areas to service our clients' unmet needs. We remain very confident in the strength of our balance sheet and manage liquidity risk through a well-laddered debt maturity profile. In the near term, we expect to continue to manage our leverage ratios conservatively and return to our past practice of growing debt as EBITDA grows over the long term. 
As I look towards our pending combination with Willis Towers Watson, we remain incredibly excited about the potential for growth in innovative solutions for clients, and the shareholder value creation opportunity. We are continuing to work collaboratively with the appropriate regulators to gain approvals, and we've offered remedies. We continue to anticipate $800 million of cost synergies taking into account the remedies offered. We would expect to allocate any divestiture proceeds according to our ROIC framework in which share buyback continues to be our highest return investment. We are working towards the close in the first half of 2021, subject to regulatory approval. 
In summary, our first quarter results reflect continued progress, building on a decade of momentum. Driven by our Aon United strategy and underpinned by our Aon Business Services operational platform. We remain incredibly excited about closing our pending combination and beginning the integration process with Willis Towers Watson, which will continue to enable long-term shareholder value creation. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'd be delighted to take your questions."

But before I do, if I can make a comment on your earlier question, just on the excitement around the combination of what we're starting to see maybe a level lower. Certainly, the teams have been working on integration from a client experience and a revenue standpoint, culture innovation, all those things. And we're really beginning to see the possibilities. As we go deeper into the organization around the planning process, whether it's things like on the risk side, the cat modeling and securitization experience that Aon has the Willis' climate capabilities and their resilient hub and they're climatized. Those types of things, when you put them together really do provide excitement for our teams to see what's possible. And so there's a lot of those things that we're identifying as we go through the process, and it's really building some excitement across both organizations as they really begin to see the value they can unlock for clients. 
And so now maybe to picture question on pricing. I would say this, the dynamic of the pricing, as we say, it's moderately positive. But it's always -- it's never a straightforward answer, right? And I'll give you some context as to why. We engage these clients in a couple of steps before you ever get to the marketplace, right? We do the risk analysis and identification. We work with them on mitigating strategies so that they don't even transfer the risk, how they can finance it among themselves. And then ultimately, if they do decide to make the transfer to a third party, they're coming at this marketplace with their own risk appetite, their own budget capacity, the options in the market. We're using our capability to help them make the trade offs. But ultimately, each product, there is no marketplace, right? I always get a kick out of when people talk about the broader market. It's a series of micro markets. Each product has its own dynamics, own claim trends, terms conditions, retention, claims, supply demand, all of that, whether you're talking property, D&O, marine, it's a variety of different things. And ultimately, our role in this is to help clients evaluate how to manage the risk, make the right choices that they make, they can make. So as we see it, it's moderate, it's moderately positive, as we say. But ultimately, clients make choices in every market that help them meet their own needs."

And it's ultimately a positive step in the global recovery that we can interact. And -- but we've learned a lot, right? As we've said it in the past, and just using that example, Greg, to go a little bit deeper. Historically, if a client wanted to talk about a situation that was occurring outside their home country, we would either try into a conference call or plan a trip. Right? And now what we do is we open up Webex, and we actually have the leader of the country leader of the issue in that country on the Webex, and we can solve the issue right away. Right? Certainly, there's efficiency and cost advantages to it. But more importantly, I think there's enormous client value to unlock that expertise in an immediate way where they're not getting an interpretation through someone else. They're talking right to the source. And getting that value in real time. So I mean, ultimately, we're going to use what we've learned, and we're going to meet the clients where they want to be met. But I think we've learned a lot and we're going to apply it."

But when you actually put colleagues around the world from different solution lines together, and it's clear to the client that they know each other. They're reacting to different situations. They're supporting each other. That's nonduplicatable, right? That's taken us a decade to work through. And so it turns out the 10 paces on the screen amplifies what it means to work Aon United together as one firm. And that what clients see, they commented to us, which is, wow, I didn't really understand what this meant before. And by the only way they could have seen it is, as Eric -- as Eric described, we put 10 people in the conference room, which we're never going to do. But 10 on Webex totally interacting on behalf of clients, really addressing their issues, that is pretty cool. The example I gave on the commentary upfront around the the vaccine protection was exactly that. It was a group of people together that probably wouldn't have gone together in the same way before. So we just want you to -- we don't understand how we're thinking about our business as T&E comes back, but it's much, much broader than that."

Welcome to our second quarter conference call. I'm joined virtually by Christa Davies, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President.
As in previous quarters, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website.
We want to begin by thanking our 50,000 Aon colleagues for their dedication and focus on serving clients. Over the last year plus, certainly, every organization around the world has wrestled with how to best support employees, how to manage record volatility and how to deliver more value to customers. At Aon, our colleagues have led through all this while also preparing for a substantial integration. What our team has accomplished is extraordinary. Today, we move forward with the benefit of all that work without the constraint of regulatory uncertainty.
My remarks will cover our outstanding financial performance in Q2 and year-to-date, provide some observations on the termination of our combination with Willis Towers Watson, then speak to our go-forward plan to continue delivering great service and innovation on behalf of clients, enabling growth for colleagues and delivering excellent return to shareholders.
In Q2, our global team delivered outstanding results across each of our key financial metrics, and I'd note particular strength across the top and bottom line with 11% organic revenue growth driven by mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth from every solution line, highlighted the particular strength in commercial risk at 14%, which translated into 17% adjusted EPS growth in Q2 and 13% free cash flow growth for the first half. Our 8% organic revenue growth for the first half reflects mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth from 4 of our 5 solution lines. Our Aon United strategy is delivering net new business generation and ongoing strong retention. We also saw double-digit growth overall in the more discretionary portions of our business, including transaction liability, human capital and project-related work within Commercial Risk Solutions.
One fantastic Aon United client example in the quarter was around cybersecurity organization design. Aon colleagues came together across solution lines to address a significant yet common client challenge. Our client cyber risk was increasing, while our security organization faced the rapidly increasing cost in attracting and retaining top talent to execute their cyber defense strategy. Colleagues from our cyber solutions group within commercial risk and from our rewards practice within human capital, combined with our unique expertise in cyber risk, with best practices and benchmarking around talent and compensation. The results for our client was an organizational design solution that aligns their HR and technology teams to manage their cyber risk in a more cost and efficient way. The result for Aon is a repeatable offering that helps address the common need for many of our clients in an area of growing risk.
I would also note that we saw strong global macroeconomic conditions in the quarter, but we continue to assess 3 key factors as we have since the beginning of the pandemic. Those factors are the virus and vaccine rollout, including the potential impact of the delta variant, as well as government stimulus and overall GDP growth. These macro conditions do affect our clients and our business. For example, we continue to see impact to our travel and defense practice within Data & Analytic Services. Considering the current outlook for these factors, we continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth for the full year 2021 and over the long term.
Turning now to the termination of our combination with Willis Towers Watson. We recently announced our mutual agreement to move forward as 2 independent companies. On behalf of Aon, I'd like to thank our counterparts at Willis Towers Watson for their professionalism over the past 16 months since we announced the transaction. We have the utmost respect for them and have truly enjoyed getting to know the team. The combination had significant regulatory momentum, including, notably, approval from the European Commission as well as approval from many jurisdictions globally who had thoroughly evaluated and vetted the transaction, with the exception of the United States. The demands made by the U.S. Department of Justice on our U.S. business stifled innovation and reduced our client-serving capability. Meeting these demands would have significantly impacted our existing U.S. business with potential shareholder value creation as a combination and our ability to continue to drive ongoing progress against our key financial metrics. Similarly, the path forward on litigation was untenable because current courts appear to take us well into 2022, and we could not accept that level of delay. Ultimately, the choice was clear. We simply would never compromise colleague and client priorities to close the combination. Our decision to end the combination and pay the termination fee creates certainty and clarity about how we move forward. And we're confident this is the right decision for our firm, for our colleagues, our clients and our shareholders. We move forward with energy and applied confidence in our ability to continue delivering new and innovative solutions for clients, exceptional opportunity for colleagues and financial performance for shareholders.
As we look forward, there are 3 important points that were clear when we announced the combination and are equally, if not more, important now. First, the world is becoming more volatile, and clients need a partner capable to accelerate innovation on their behalf. Just look at the socioeconomic impact of the pandemic, the rise of state-sponsored cyber hack, the floods in Eastern Europe, the fires in Western America and the challenges globally of working remotely.
Second, the events of the past 16 months have honed the power of Aon United and our ability to work together to deliver new sources of value to clients. Over this time, we crystallized our operating model and cemented our one firm mindset. We've uncovered countless new growth, investment and efficiency opportunities. And at this point, we're better connected across our firm with all the value of this work and none of integration distractions. 
Third, we're moving forward with a proven platform and are operating from a position of strength and momentum, as demonstrated by our client feedback and colleague engagement stores at or approaching their highest levels for the past decade. Our colleagues are delivering client retention and net new business generation across all solution lines, driving 8% organic revenue growth over the first half and 11% organic revenue growth this quarter, our strongest performance in almost 2 decades.
And our Aon Business Services operating platform is digitizing our firm, improving the client experience and enabling efficiency, as demonstrated by operating margin expansion and 13% free cash flow growth in the first half. Aon has never been in a better position to propel top and bottom line growth and build on over a decade of progress on our key financial metrics.
In summary, our second quarter results demonstrate the successful momentum of our Aon United strategy. We're operating from a position of strength, and we've never been better positioned to deliver for clients, support our colleagues and generate shareholder value.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our results, the financial impact of the termination and our long-term outlook for continued shareholder value creation. Christa?"
119853,1673557552,2356425,"Aon plc, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2021",2021-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Aon plc","Executives","Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. We delivered continued progress for both the quarter and year-to-date, including an impressive 11% organic revenue growth in Q2. Through the first half of the year, we translated strong organic revenue gro",1334,"Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. We delivered continued progress for both the quarter and year-to-date, including an impressive 11% organic revenue growth in Q2. Through the first half of the year, we translated strong organic revenue growth into double-digit operating income, earnings per share and free cash flow growth, demonstrating the power of our Aon United strategy. As I further reflect on our performance for the first half of the year, as Greg noted, organic revenue growth was 11% in the second quarter and 8% year-to-date. We continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth for the full year 2021 and over the long term.
I would also note the total reported revenue was up 16% in Q2 and 12% year-to-date, including the favorable impact from changes in FX rates, driven by a weaker U.S. dollar versus most currencies. Our strong revenue growth and ongoing operational discipline contributed to adjusted operating income growth of 11% in Q2 and 14% through the first half of the year.
Turning to expenses and margins. There are 2 key points I wanted to describe further. First, I want to speak to the impact of our previously communicated repatterning of expenses as compared to COVID-impacted spend in 2020, which I'll describe before any 2021 growth. As we communicated in Q1, the timing of expenses is changing year-over-year such that $135 million of expenses moved into Q2 from Q4. This impact is due to the actions we took and highlighted last year as we reduced discretionary expenses to be prepared for the potential impact of COVID-19 and potential macroeconomic distress. The $135 million is approximately 1.5% of our total 2020 expense base. In Q2, this repatterning negatively impacted margins by approximately 470 basis points, resulting in Q2 operating margin contraction of 100 basis points. Excluding this impact, margins would have expanded by 370 basis points in Q2 and 250 basis points for the first half of 2021. As we said before, we expected a further $65 million to move from Q4 into Q3 for a total of $200 million of expenses moving out of Q4. 
A second key factor impacting margins has been the relative speed of revenue growth and investment. In Q2, excluding the impact of repatterning, our strong revenue growth significantly outpaced expense growth. We continue to evaluate investments using our ROIC framework. While we made deliberate investments in people, operations and technology to enable long-term growth, the expenses associated with these investments were not fully incurred in Q2 and will ramp up during the second half of the year. We also anticipate some potential resumption of T&E and modest potential increase in real estate costs as more colleagues return to the office. Collectively, the headwind from expense repatterning and tailwind from slower investment as compared to growth were the main factors driving 100 basis points of margin contraction in Q2 and the 40 basis points of margin expansion in the first half of 2021. Looking forward, as we've said historically, we expect to deliver full margin expansion for 2021 and over the long term.
Turning back to the results in the quarter. We translated strong operating income growth into adjusted EPS growth of 17% in Q2 and 16% year-to-date. As noted in our earnings material, FX translation was a favorable impact of approximately $0.04 in Q2 and $0.22 year-to-date. If currency to remain stable at today's rates, we'd expect a $0.02 per share favorable impact in Q3 and $0.01 per share favorable impact in Q4.
As Greg mentioned, Aon and Willis Towers Watson mutually agreed to terminate our business combination agreement and move forward immediately as 2 independent firms. In accordance with the business combination agreement, we have paid the $1 billion termination fee to Willis Towers Watson. With respect to the termination of fee, our U.S. businesses were the primary focus of the Department of Justice's challenge, and we paid the fee to defend that business from additional remedy divestitures that are essential to our ability to serve clients as well as the continuing delay in uncertainty in completing the combination. As part of the termination, we also expect to incur approximately $350 million to $400 million of additional charges in Q3 related to transaction costs and compensation expenses as well as a small number of actions related to further steps on our Aon United operating model. These charges are related to costs to terminate and conclude the combination, including related divestitures. They will all be incurred in Q3 as part of a clean break with Willis Towers Watson.
Given the outstanding work our colleagues have done over the last past 16 months, we've taken steps internally to ensure our colleagues share in the growth potential of the firm going forward, and this includes those who are previously offered retention bonuses in connection with the combination. The majority of the cash relating to these charges will be paid in Q3 and Q4. Aside from these transaction costs, we do not expect any further significant impacts from the termination of the transaction on our financials going forward. Excluding the termination fee, our performance and outlook for free cash flow growth in 2021 and going forward remains strong. Free cash flow increased 13% year-to-date to $1.3 billion, driven primarily by strong operating income growth and a decline in structural use of cash. We continue to expect to drive free cash flow growth over the long term, building on our long-term track record of 14% CAGR over the last 10 years, based on operating income growth, working capital improvements and reduced structural use of cash. As we communicated in Q1, we continue to expect CapEx for the full year to increase modestly year-over-year as we invest in technology to drive business growth. 
Given our outlook for long-term free cash flow growth, we expect share repurchase to continue to remain our highest return on capital opportunity for capital allocation. In the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares for approximately $240 million. We also expect to continue to invest organically and inorganically in innovative content and capabilities to address unmet client needs. Our priority areas of investments are focused on: addressing new forms of volatility like cyber; helping clients build a resilient workforce, with better solutions around engagement and employee benefits; rethinking access to capital, such as within intellectual property solutions; and addressing the underserved with digital solutions like CoverWallet. Our M&A pipeline is focused on bringing innovation at scale to our clients' biggest challenges, delivered by the connectivity on United.
Now turning to our balance sheet and debt capacity. We remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet and manage liquidity risk through a well-laddered debt maturity profile. Our financial profile has improved over the past 18 months. And considering our June 30 balance sheet and the payment of the termination fee, we estimate we have $1.5 billion of additional debt capacity for discretionary use in the second half as we return to historical leverage ratios while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating. Over the long term, we expect to return to our past practice of growing debt as EBITDA growth. Further, I'd note that free cash flow generation in the second half is seasonally stronger than the first half, and we intend to allocate this cash to our highest and best use based on return on capital.
In summary, we ended the second quarter in a position of strength as our Aon United strategy and investments in long-term growth are driving strong top and bottom line performance. While the termination of our combination with Willis Towers Watson was not the outcome we originally intended,  the opportunity for Aon has only grown. Our disciplined approach to return on capital, combined with our expected long-term free cash flow growth and increased debt opportunity, provides financial flexibility to unlock significant shareholder value creation over the long term.
With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator, and we'd be happy to take your questions."

And listen, I would just say clients make choices when prices move up or down, right? And one of the things that we do with them, and I think I've mentioned this in the past, we first helped them to identify the risk that they have and then try and manage, right, without the use of risk transfer.
And then as prices go up, clients finance more of it themselves if they can handle it. And then ultimately, when you get to the risk transfer part of whether they decide to trade the risk, they make choices there, too, the amount of insurance that they buy, the coinsurance, deductibles, things that try and manage for them, the budget that they have to spend on topics like risk transfer. So it's never a direct line from what a carrier publishes as rate to what a client actually does for the risk that they're trying to transfer.
And so all those areas that we're talking about, clients have a real heightened focus on during a time when pricing is increasing. They get very specific around how they try and manage it themselves or finance it themselves before they try and risk transfer it into the market."

In terms of your question around CapEx, we would say that CapEx should increase modestly year-over-year, driven by investments in technology to drive long-term growth. And I would say, look, going forward, we expect free cash flow to grow double digits over the long term, really driven by 3 key things: growth in operating income, declining uses of cash and improvements in working capital. And so we're really excited about the growth in free cash flow long term as well as our ability to add debt as EBITDA continues to grow. So a substantial amount of cash to invest back in Aon."

When you take a step back over the last 16 months, the primary thesis behind the combination is exceptionally strong. In fact, pandemic has made it stronger over that period of time. Obviously, strong shareholder approval, regulatory momentum in virtually every jurisdiction around the world. And I noted, obviously, DG-Comp in the European theater, but others around the world as well. And just so you understand, we reached an impasse in the U.S. Department of Justice. We could have completed the deal in a couple of ways, but we made the choice to reject what we believe were 2 unacceptable options. One was the remedies, and we could have completed the deal through the remedy just like we did in Europe, but it wouldn't have been the right answer for us. It simply would not have been the right answer. We roughly know what it would take. But candidly, it would have damaged our client-serving capability as we described before, stifle innovation. And as I've said, you've heard Eric and Christa talk about it, we will never sacrifice our Aon United strategy to close the transaction. Just not going to happen. And in the end, that's where we were on the remedy side.
And the second option, equally unappealing, is litigation. We have an exceptionally strong hand from our view. But the time line pushed the deal into 2022, it looks -- looked like it did in every way, shape or form. Also unacceptable. We're just not going to wait in a holding pattern well into 2022 to sort of have this resolved. It's just too long. So we wanted to make a choice, David, for our firm. And we said, on our terms, to move forward independently, and obviously, in a position of strength. If you think about where we were in 2020 from now where we are now, very much in a position of strength. And we're excited about how we move forward with real enthusiasm given by our team and the strength of our Aon United strategy. So that's the rough picture in terms of sort of where we are, but [indiscernible] get to growth. Eric or Christa, anything else you want to comment on that?"

We spend so much time thinking about opportunities on the growth side, on the efficiency side, on the investment side. And we came up with a ton of them, and we're incorporating all of those. All that then reinforced by the Aon United strategy and the connectivity.

And what we've done over the last 16 months around integration is fundamental improvement of our platform. What's going to be the combination combined platform, but it absolutely is applicable to Aon. But Eric, you led this, what do you think?"

I'm joined virtually by Christa Davies, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President. As in previous quarters, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website. 
We want to begin by thanking our 50,000 Aon colleagues for their dedication and focus on serving clients. Over the last year plus, certainly, every organization around the world has wrestled with how to best support employees, how to manage record volatility and how to deliver more value to customers. At Aon, our colleagues have led through all this while also preparing for a substantial integration. What our team has accomplished is extraordinary. Today, we move forward with the benefit of all that work without the constraint of regulatory uncertainty. 
My remarks will cover our outstanding financial performance in Q2 and year-to-date, provide some observations on the termination of our combination with Willis Towers Watson, then speak to our go-forward plan to continue delivering great service and innovation on behalf of clients, enabling growth for colleagues and delivering excellent return to shareholders. 
In Q2, our global team delivered outstanding results across each of our key financial metrics, and I'd note particular strength across the top and bottom line with 11% organic revenue growth, driven by mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth from every solution line, highlighted the particular strength in commercial risk at 14%, which translated into 17% adjusted EPS growth in Q2 and 13% free cash flow growth for the first half. 
Our 8% organic revenue growth for the first half reflects mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth from 4 of our 5 solution lines. Our Aon United strategy is delivering net new business generation and ongoing strong retention. 
We also saw double-digit growth overall in the more discretionary portions of our business, including transaction liability, human capital and project-related work within Commercial Risk Solutions. 
One fantastic Aon United client example in the quarter was around cybersecurity organization design. Aon colleagues came together across solution lines to address a significant yet common client challenge. Our client cyber risk was increasing, while our security organization faced the rapidly increasing cost in attracting and retaining top talent to execute their cyber defense strategy. Colleagues from our cyber solutions group within commercial risk and from our rewards practice within human capital, combined with our unique expertise in cyber risk, with best practices and benchmarking around talent and compensation. 
The results for our client was an organizational design solution that aligns their HR and technology teams to manage their cyber risk in a more cost and efficient way. The result for Aon is a repeatable offering that helps address the common need for many of our clients in an area of growing risk. 
I would also note that we saw strong global macroeconomic conditions in the quarter, but we continue to assess 3 key factors as we have since the beginning of the pandemic. Those factors are the virus and vaccine rollout, including the potential impact of the delta variant; as well as government stimulus; and overall GDP growth. These macro conditions do affect our clients and our business. For example, we continue to see impact to our travel and defense practice within Data & Analytic Services. Considering the current outlook for these factors, we continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth for the full year 2021 and over the long term. 
Turning now to the termination of our combination with Willis Towers Watson. We recently announced our mutual agreement to move forward as 2 independent companies. On behalf of Aon, I'd like to thank our counterparts at Willis Towers Watson for their professionalism over the past 16 months since we announced the transaction. We have the utmost respect for them and have truly enjoyed getting to know the team. 
The combination had significant regulatory momentum, including, notably, approval from the European Commission as well as approval from many jurisdictions globally who had thoroughly evaluated and vetted the transaction, with the exception of the United States. The demands made by the U.S. Department of Justice on our U.S. business would have stifled innovation and reduced our client-serving capability. 
Meeting these demands would have significantly impacted our existing U.S. business with potential shareholder value creation as a combination, and our ability to continue to drive ongoing progress against our key financial metrics. Similarly, the path forward on litigation was untenable because current courts appear to take us well into 2022, and we could not accept that level of delay. Ultimately, the choice was clear. We simply would never compromise colleague and client priorities to close the combination. Our decision to end the combination and pay the termination fee creates certainty and clarity about how we move forward. And we're confident this is the right decision for our firm, for our colleagues, our clients and our shareholders. We move forward with energy and applied confidence in our ability to continue delivering new and innovative solutions for clients, exceptional opportunity for colleagues and financial performance for shareholders. 
As we look forward, there are 3 important points that were clear when we announced the combination and are equally, if not more, important now. First, the world is becoming more volatile, and clients need a partner capable to accelerate innovation on their behalf. Just look at the socioeconomic impact of the pandemic, the rise of state-sponsored cyber hack, the floods in Eastern Europe, the fires in Western America and the challenges globally of working remotely. 
Second, the events of the past 16 months have honed the power of Aon United and our ability to work together to deliver new sources of value to clients. Over this time, we crystallized our operating model and cemented our one firm mindset. We've uncovered countless new growth, investment and efficiency opportunities. And at this point, we're better connected across our firm with all the value of this work and none of integration distractions.  
Third, we're moving forward with a proven platform and are operating from a position of strength and momentum, as demonstrated by our client feedback and colleague engagement stores at/or approaching their highest levels for the past decade. Our colleagues are delivering client retention and net new business generation across all solution lines, driving 8% organic revenue growth over the first half and 11% organic revenue growth this quarter, our strongest performance in almost 2 decades. 
And our Aon Business Services operating platform is digitizing our firm, improving the client experience and enabling efficiency, as demonstrated by operating margin expansion and 13% free cash flow growth in the first half. Aon has never been in a better position to propel top and bottom line growth and build on over a decade of progress on our key financial metrics. 
In summary, our second quarter results demonstrate the successful momentum of our Aon United strategy. We're operating from a position of strength, and we've never been better positioned to deliver for clients, support our colleagues and generate shareholder value. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our results, the financial impact of the termination and our long-term outlook for continued shareholder value creation. Christa?"
119853,1673557552,2356779,"Aon plc, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2021",2021-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Aon plc","Executives","Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. We delivered continued progress for both the quarter and year-to-date, including an impressive 11% organic revenue growth in Q2.

We delivered continued progress for both the quarter and year-to-date, including an impressive 11% organic revenue growth in Q2. Through the first half of the year, we translated strong organic revenue growth into double-digit operating income, earnings per share and free cash flow growth, demonstrating the power of our Aon United strategy. As I further reflect on our performance for the first half of the year, as Greg noted, organic revenue growth was 11% in the second quarter and 8% year-to-date. We continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth for the full year 2021 and over the long term. 
I would also note the total reported revenue was up 16% in Q2 and 12% year-to-date, including the favorable impact from changes in FX rates, driven by a weaker U.S. dollar versus most currencies. Our strong revenue growth and ongoing operational discipline contributed to adjusted operating income growth of 11% in Q2 and 14% through the first half of the year. 
Turning to expenses and margins. There are 2 key points I wanted to describe further. First, I want to speak to the impact of our previously communicated repatterning of expenses as compared to COVID-impacted spend in 2020, which I'll describe before any 2021 growth. As we communicated in Q1, the timing of expenses is changing year-over-year such that $135 million of expenses moved into Q2 from Q4. This impact is due to the actions we took and highlighted last year as we reduced discretionary expenses to be prepared for the potential impact of COVID-19 and potential macroeconomic distress. 
The $135 million is approximately 1.5% of our total 2020 expense base. In Q2, this repatterning negatively impacted margins by approximately 470 basis points, resulting in Q2 operating margin contraction of 100 basis points. Excluding this impact, margins would have expanded by 370 basis points in Q2 and 250 basis points for the first half of 2021. As we said before, we expected a further $65 million to move from Q4 into Q3 for a total of $200 million of expenses moving out of Q4.  
A second key factor impacting margins has been the relative speed of revenue growth and investment. In Q2, excluding the impact of repatterning, our strong revenue growth significantly outpaced expense growth. We continue to evaluate investments using our ROIC framework. While we made deliberate investments in people, operations and technology to enable long-term growth, the expenses associated with these investments were not fully incurred in Q2 and will ramp up during the second half of the year. We also anticipate some potential resumption of T&E and modest potential increase in real estate costs as more colleagues return to the office. 
Collectively, the headwind from expense repatterning and tailwind from slower investment as compared to growth were the main factors driving 100 basis points of margin contraction in Q2 and the 40 basis points of margin expansion in the first half of 2021. Looking forward, as we've said historically, we expect to deliver full margin expansion for 2021 and over the long term. 
Turning back to the results in the quarter. We've translated strong operating income growth into adjusted EPS growth of 17% in Q2 and 16% year-to-date. As noted in our earnings material, FX translation was a favorable impact of approximately $0.04 in Q2 and $0.22 year-to-date. If currency to remain stable at today's rates, we'd expect a $0.02 per share favorable impact to Q3 and $0.01 per share favorable impact in Q4. As Greg mentioned, Aon and Willis Towers Watson mutually agreed to terminate our business combination agreements and move forward immediately as 2 independent firms. In accordance with the business combination agreement, we have paid the $1 billion termination fee to Willis Towers Watson. 
With respect to the termination of fee. Our U.S. businesses were the primary focus of the Department of Justice's challenge, and we paid this fee to defend that business from additional remedy divestitures that are essential to our ability to serve clients as well as the continuing delay in uncertainty in completing the combination. As part of the termination, we also expect to incur approximately $350 million to $400 million of additional charge in Q3 related to transaction costs and compensation expenses as well as a small number of actions related to further steps on our Aon United operating model. These charges are related to costs to terminate and conclude the combination, including related divestitures. They will all be incurred in Q3 as part of a clean break with Willis Towers Watson. 
Given the outstanding work our colleagues have done over the last past 16 months, we've taken steps internally to ensure our colleagues share in the growth potential of the firm going forward, and this includes those who are previously offered retention bonuses in connection with the combination. The majority of the cash relating to these charges will be paid in Q3 and Q4. Aside from these transaction costs, we do not expect any further significant impacts from the termination of the transaction on our financials going forward. Excluding the termination fee, our performance and outlook for free cash flow growth in 2021 and going forward remains strong. Free cash flow increased 13% year-to-date to $1.3 billion, driven primarily by strong operating income growth and a decline in structural uses of cash. We continue to expect to drive free cash flow growth over the long term, building on our long-term track record of 14% CAGR over the last 10 years, based on operating income growth, working capital improvements and reduced structural use of cash. 
As we communicated in Q1, we continue to expect CapEx for the full year to increase modestly year-over-year as we invest in technology to drive business growth. Given our outlook for long-term free cash flow growth, we expect share repurchase to continue to remain our highest return on capital opportunity for capital allocation. In the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares for approximately $240 million. We also expect to continue to invest organically and inorganically in innovative content and capabilities to address unmet client needs. Our priority areas of investments are focused on: addressing new forms of volatility like cyber; helping clients build a resilient workforce, with better solutions around engagement and employee benefits; rethinking access to capital, such as within intellectual property solutions; and addressing the underserved with digital solutions like CoverWallet. Our M&A pipeline is focused on bringing innovation at scale to our clients' biggest challenges, delivered by the connectivity of Aon United. 
Now turning to our balance sheet and debt capacity. We remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet and manage liquidity risk through a well-laddered debt maturity profile. Our financial profile has improved over the past 18 months. And considering our June 30 balance sheet and the payment of the termination fee, we estimate we have $1.5 billion of additional debt capacity for discretionary use in the second half as we return to historical leverage ratios while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating. 
Over the long term, we expect to return to our past practice of growing debt as EBITDA growth. Further, I'd note that free cash flow generation in the second half is seasonally stronger than the first half, and we intend to allocate this cash to our highest and best use based on return on capital. 
In summary, we ended the second quarter in a position of strength as our Aon United strategy and investments in long-term growth are driving strong top and bottom line performance. While the termination of our combination with Willis Towers Watson was not the outcome we originally intended, the opportunity for Aon has only grown. Our disciplined approach to return on capital, combined with our expected long-term free cash flow growth and increased debt opportunity, provides financial flexibility to unlock significant shareholder value creation over the long term. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator, and we'd be happy to take your questions."

These trends, I think, are the result of all the flexibility and connectivity and the support we've been giving to our colleagues over the last 6 months, not just with the Willis Towers Watson combination, but also with the pandemic.

We have -- we've just got an enormously positive performance, and that's sort of carried through over the last 16 months. That's shown up and what really is the focal point for Aon, which is translating revenue into free cash flow and that ability to grow in cash flow. 
And with that cash, it really comes how we invest and it truly comes back to return on invested capital. So we're always going to take steps that actually maximize invested capital with cash-on-cash return. And we'll look to opportunities or we have tremendous organic opportunities, inorganic opportunities, all shapes and sizes. And very much looking forward to sort of driving shareholder value, applying the cash in the appropriate way. And we'll continue to look for all the means to do that."

As clients need increased our ability to react to clients and serve them also continue to increase. And so Jimmy, we end up with new business generation, net new business generation, really at all-time highs. And it continued to build, move into the third and fourth quarter of last year. Now you see it in the first half of this year and really for the last 5 quarters. 
A real kind of tour de force effort on behalf of colleagues around the world on all areas as it relates to growth. It's why we underscore and reinforce the mid-single-digit organic for the year and ongoing beyond 2021. But it really is the fundamental. It really is how we're connecting with clients and supporting clients, how we're applying the Aon United strategy, bringing the best of our firm to clients every day. And that actually has just strengthened and grown. That's why we really come out of the last 18 months -- when you think about the chassis of Aon -- the Aon United Foundation.

It's always a great question because people always wonder why the direct carrier sort of per unit price doesn't show up and translate across to the intermediaries on the risk side. And listen, I would just say clients make choices when prices move up or down, right? And one of the things that we do with them, and I think I've mentioned this in the past, we first helped them to identify the risk that they have and then try and manage, right, without the use of risk transfer.
And then as prices go up, clients finance more of it themselves if they can handle it. And then ultimately, when you get to the risk transfer part of whether they decide to trade the risk, they make choices there, too, the amount of insurance that they buy, the coinsurance, deductibles, things that try and manage for them, the budget that they have to spend on topics like risk transfer. So it's never a direct line from what a carrier publishes as rate to what a client actually does for the risk that they're trying to transfer.
And so all those areas that we're talking about, clients have a real heightened focus on during a time when pricing is increasing. They get very specific around how they try and manage it themselves or finance it themselves before they try and risk transfer it into the market."

I highlighted in data analytics services. Look, our travel business is still under a tremendous amount of pressure, as you would expect. But still, our colleagues are fighting through that and finding opportunities, finding ways to connect with clients, and you're seeing that.
So for us, we feel good about mid-single-digit or greater. We've made that commitment before. And there was really no snapback. As we said before, that the ability to connect with clients and drive growth has sustained throughout the pandemic and certainly sustained, even amplified into 2021.

When you take a step back over the last 16 months, the primary thesis behind the combination is exceptionally strong. In fact, pandemic has made it stronger over that period of time. Obviously, strong shareholder approval, regulatory momentum in virtually every jurisdiction around the world. And I noted, obviously, DG-Comp in the European theater, but others around the world as well. And just so you understand, we reached an impasse in the U.S. Department of Justice. We could have completed the deal in a couple of ways, but we made the choice to reject what we believe were 2 unacceptable options. One was the remedies, and we could have completed the deal through the remedy just like we did in Europe, but it wouldn't have been the right answer for us. It simply would not have been the right answer. We roughly know what it would take. But candidly, it would have damaged our client-serving capability as we described before, stifle innovation. And as I've said, you've heard Eric and Christa talk about it, we will never sacrifice our Aon United strategy to close the transaction. Just not going to happen. And in the end, that's where we were on the [ revenue ] side.
And the second option, equally unappealing, was litigation. We have an exceptionally strong hand from our view. But the time line pushed the deal into 2022, it looks -- looked like it did in every way, shape or form, also unacceptable. We're just not going to wait in a holding pattern well into 2022 to sort of have this resolved. It's just too long. So we wanted to make a choice, David, for our firm. And we said, on our terms, to move forward independently, and obviously, they're in a position of strength. If you think about where we were in 2020 from now where we are now, very much in a position of strength. And we're excited about how we move forward with real enthusiasm given by our team and the strength of our Aon United strategy. So that's the rough picture in terms of sort of where we are, but who leads te growth? Eric or Christa, anything else you want to comment on that?"

We spend so much time thinking about opportunities on the growth side, on the efficiency side, on the investment side. And we came up with a ton of them, and we're incorporating all of those. All that then reinforced by the Aon United strategy and the connectivity. 
And ironically, COVID created a situation where we are on WebEx. Now there's different                 systems. WebEx connected our firm in a way in the -- sitting across a virtual table from clients in a way that's been incredibly, incredibly powerful. And that's what's led to literally net new business growth and also growth with existing clients, the strongest we've ever seen. So it really puts it us exceptionally well to continue to increase market share and take share around the world, which we've been doing and continue to do, as well as create net new. 
And I just don't want to get away. This is not a zero-sum game for us. We're winning a zero-sum game, but it isn't about that.

By the way, not just for this year, but ongoing, as a piece, and then double-digit free cash flow. And our view is that economic model, as we think about it from an investor standpoint, is extraordinary in terms of sort of what that means. And so we -- what we want to do is make sure you understand. We're reflecting the high confidence in our ability to achieve that, and we'll keep pushing forward on that basis. So there's -- it's not about rebound or anything else. But Christa, anything else you want to add in that?"

I'm joined virtually by Christa Davies, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President. As in previous quarters, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website. 
We want to begin by thanking our 50,000 Aon colleagues for their dedication and focus on serving clients. Over the last year plus, certainly, every organization around the world has wrestled with how to best support employees, how to manage record volatility and how to deliver more value to customers. At Aon, our colleagues have led through all this while also preparing for a substantial integration. What our team has accomplished is extraordinary. Today, we move forward with the benefit of all that work without the constraint of regulatory uncertainty. 
My remarks will cover our outstanding financial performance in Q2 and year-to-date, provide some observations on the termination of our combination with Willis Towers Watson, then speak to our go-forward plan to continue delivering great service and innovation on behalf of clients, enabling growth for colleagues and delivering excellent return to shareholders. 
In Q2, our global team delivered outstanding results across each of our key financial metrics, and I'd note particular strength across the top and bottom line with 11% organic revenue growth, driven by mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth from every solution line, highlighted the particular strength in commercial risk at 14%, which translated into 17% adjusted EPS growth in Q2 and 13% free cash flow growth for the first half. 
Our 8% organic revenue growth for the first half reflects mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth from 4 of our 5 solution lines. Our Aon United strategy is delivering net new business generation and ongoing strong retention. 
We also saw double-digit growth overall in the more discretionary portions of our business, including transaction liability, human capital and project-related work within Commercial Risk Solutions. 
One fantastic Aon United client example in the quarter was around cybersecurity organization design. Aon colleagues came together across solution lines to address a significant yet common client challenge. Our client's cyber risk was increasing, while their security organization faced the rapidly increasing cost of attracting and retaining top talent to execute their cyber defense strategy. Colleagues from our cyber solutions group within commercial risk and from our rewards practice within human capital combined with our unique expertise in cyber risk, with best practices and benchmarking around talent and compensation. 
The results for our client was an organizational design solution that aligns their HR and technology teams to manage their cyber risk in a more cost and efficient way. The result for Aon is a repeatable offering that helps address the common need for many of our clients in an area of growing risk. 
I would also note that we saw strong global macroeconomic conditions in the quarter, but we continue to assess 3 key factors as we have since the beginning of the pandemic. Those factors are the virus and vaccine rollout, including the potential impact of the delta variant; as well as government stimulus; and overall GDP growth. These macro conditions do affect our clients and our business. For example, we continue to see impact to our travel and defense practice within Data & Analytic Services. Considering the current outlook for these factors, we continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth for the full year 2021 and over the long term. 
Turning now to the termination of our combination with Willis Towers Watson. We recently announced our mutual agreement to move forward as 2 independent companies. On behalf of Aon, I'd like to thank our counterparts at Willis Towers Watson for their professionalism over the past 16 months since we announced the transaction. We have the utmost respect for them and have truly enjoyed getting to know the team. 
The combination had significant regulatory momentum, including, notably, approval from the European Commission as well as approval from many jurisdictions globally who had thoroughly evaluated and vetted the transaction. The exception was the United States. The demands made by the U.S. Department of Justice on our U.S. business would have stifled innovation and reduced our client-serving capability. 
Meeting these demands would have significantly impacted our existing U.S. business, the potential shareholder value creation of the combination, and our ability to continue to drive ongoing progress against our key financial metrics. Similarly, the path forward on litigation was untenable because current course appear to take us well into 2022, and we could not accept that level of delay. Ultimately, the choice was clear. We simply would never compromise colleague and client priorities to close the combination. Our decision to end the combination and pay the termination fee creates certainty and clarity about how we move forward. And we're confident this is the right decision for our firm, for our colleagues, our clients and our shareholders. We move forward with energy and a high confidence in our ability to continue delivering new and innovative solutions for clients, exceptional opportunity for colleagues and financial performance for shareholders. 
As we look forward, there are 3 important points that were clear when we announced the combination and are equally, if not more, important now. First, the world is becoming more volatile, and clients need a partner capable to accelerate innovation on their behalf. Just look at the socioeconomic impact of the pandemic, the rise of state-sponsored cyber hacking, the floods in Eastern Europe, the fires in Western America and the challenges globally of working remotely. 
Second, the events of the past 16 months have honed the power of Aon United and our ability to work together to deliver new sources of value to clients. Over this time, we crystallized our operating model and cemented our one firm mindset. We've uncovered countless new growth, investment and efficiency opportunities. And at this point, we're better connected across our firm with all the value of this work and none of integration distractions. 
Third, we're moving forward with a proven platform and are operating from a position of strength and momentum, as demonstrated by our client feedback and colleague engagement scores at/or approaching their highest levels for the past decade. Our colleagues are delivering client retention and net new business generation across all solution lines, driving 8% organic revenue growth over the first half and 11% organic revenue growth this quarter, our strongest performance in almost 2 decades. 
And our Aon Business Services operating platform is digitizing our firm, improving the client experience and enabling efficiency, as demonstrated by operating margin expansion and 13% free cash flow growth in the first half. Aon has never been in a better position to propel top and bottom line growth and build on over a decade of progress on our key financial metrics. 
In summary, our second quarter results demonstrate the success and momentum of our Aon United strategy. We're operating from a position of strength, and we've never been better positioned to deliver for clients, support our colleagues and generate shareholder value. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our results, the financial impact of the termination and our long-term outlook for continued shareholder value creation. Christa?"
119853,1673557552,2384257,"Aon plc, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2021",2021-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Aon plc","Executives","Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. We delivered continued progress for both the quarter and year-to-date, including an impressive 11% organic revenue growth in Q2.

We delivered continued progress for both the quarter and year-to-date, including an impressive 11% organic revenue growth in Q2. Through the first half of the year, we translated strong organic revenue growth into double-digit operating income, earnings per share and free cash flow growth, demonstrating the power of our Aon United strategy. As I further reflect on our performance for the first half of the year, as Greg noted, organic revenue growth was 11% in the second quarter and 8% year-to-date. We continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth for the full year 2021 and over the long term. 
I would also note the total reported revenue was up 16% in Q2 and 12% year-to-date, including the favorable impact from changes in FX rates, driven by a weaker U.S. dollar versus most currencies. Our strong revenue growth and ongoing operational discipline contributed to adjusted operating income growth of 11% in Q2 and 14% through the first half of the year. 
Turning to expenses and margins. There are 2 key points I wanted to describe further. First, I want to speak to the impact of our previously communicated repatterning of expenses as compared to COVID-impacted spend in 2020, which I'll describe before any 2021 growth. As we communicated in Q1, the timing of expenses is changing year-over-year such that $135 million of expenses moved into Q2 from Q4. This impact is due to the actions we took and highlighted last year as we reduced discretionary expenses to be prepared for the potential impacts of COVID-19 and potential macroeconomic distress. 
The $135 million is approximately 1.5% of our total 2020 expense base. In Q2, this repatterning negatively impacted margins by approximately 470 basis points, resulting in Q2 operating margin contraction of 100 basis points. Excluding this impact, margins would have expanded by 370 basis points in Q2 and 250 basis points for the first half of 2021. As we said before, we expected a further $65 million to move from Q4 into Q3 for a total of $200 million of expenses moving out of Q4. 
A second key factor impacting margins has been the relative speed of revenue growth and investment. In Q2, excluding the impact of repatterning, our strong revenue growth significantly outpaced expense growth. We continue to evaluate investments using our ROIC framework. While we made deliberate investments in people, operations and technology to enable long-term growth, the expenses associated with these investments were not fully incurred in Q2 and will ramp up during the second half of the year. We also anticipate some potential resumption of T&E and modest potential increase in real estate costs as more colleagues return to the office. 
Collectively, the headwind from expense repatterning and tailwind from slow investment as compared to growth were the main factors driving 100 basis points of margin contraction in Q2 and the 40 basis points of margin expansion in the first half of 2021. Looking forward, as we've said historically, we expect to deliver full margin expansion for 2021 and over the long term. 
Turning back to the results in the quarter. We've translated strong operating income growth into adjusted EPS growth of 17% in Q2 and 16% year-to-date. As noted in our earnings material, FX translation was a favorable impact of approximately $0.04 in Q2 and $0.22 year-to-date. If currency to remain stable at today's rates, we'd expect a $0.02 per share favorable impact in Q3 and $0.01 per share favorable impact in Q4.
As Greg mentioned, Aon and Willis Towers Watson mutually agreed to terminate our business combination agreements and move forward immediately as 2 independent firms. In accordance with the business combination agreement, we have paid the $1 billion termination fee to Willis Towers Watson. 
With respect to the termination fee, our U.S. businesses were the primary focus of the Department of Justice's challenge, and we paid this fee to defend that business from additional remedy divestitures that are essential to our ability to serve clients as well as the continuing delay and uncertainty in completing the combination.
As part of the termination, we also expect to incur approximately $350 million to $400 million of additional charges in Q3 related to transaction costs and compensation expenses as well as a small number of actions related to further steps on our Aon United operating model. These charges are related to costs to terminate and conclude the combination, including related divestitures. They will all be incurred in Q3 as part of a clean break with Willis Towers Watson. 
Given the outstanding work our colleagues have done over the last past 16 months, we've taken steps internally to ensure our colleagues share in the growth potential of the firm going forward, and this includes those who are previously offered retention bonuses in connection with the combination. The majority of the cash relating to these charges will be paid in Q3 and Q4. Aside from these transaction costs, we do not expect any further significant impacts from the termination of the transaction on our financials going forward.
Excluding the termination fee, our performance and outlook for free cash flow growth in 2021 and going forward remain strong. Free cash flow increased 13% year-to-date to $1.3 billion, driven primarily by strong operating income growth and a decline in structural uses of cash. We continue to expect to drive free cash flow growth over the long term, building on our long-term track record of 14% CAGR over the last 10 years, based on operating income growth, working capital improvements and reduced structural use of cash. As we communicated in Q1, we continue to expect CapEx for the full year to increase modestly year-over-year as we invest in technology to drive business growth.
Given our outlook for long-term free cash flow growth, we expect share repurchase to continue to remain our highest return on capital opportunity for capital allocation. In the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares for approximately $240 million. We also expect to continue to invest organically and inorganically in innovative content and capabilities to address unmet client needs. Our priority areas of investments are focused on: addressing new forms of volatility like cyber; helping clients build a resilient workforce, with better solutions around engagement and employee benefits; rethinking access to capital, such as within intellectual property solutions; and addressing the underserved with digital solutions like CoverWallet. Our M&A pipeline is focused on bringing innovation at scale to our clients' biggest challenges, delivered by the connectivity of Aon United. 
Now turning to our balance sheet and debt capacity. We remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet and manage liquidity risk through a well-laddered debt maturity profile. Our financial profile has improved over the past 18 months. And considering our June 30 balance sheet and the payment of the termination fee, we estimate we have $1.5 billion of additional debt capacity for discretionary use in the second half as we return to historical leverage ratios while maintaining our current investment-grade credit ratings. 
Over the long term, we expect to return to our past practice of growing debt as EBITDA grows. Further, I'd note that free cash flow generation in the second half is seasonally stronger than the first half, and we intend to allocate this cash to our highest and best use based on return on capital. 
In summary, we ended the second quarter in a position of strength as our Aon United strategy and investments in long-term growth are driving strong top and bottom line performance. While the termination of our combination with Willis Towers Watson was not the outcome we originally intended, the opportunity for Aon has only grown. Our disciplined approach to return on capital, combined with our expected long-term free cash flow growth and increased debt opportunity, provides financial flexibility to unlock significant shareholder value creation over the long term. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator, and we'd be happy to take your questions."

And listen, I would just say clients make choices when prices move up or down, right? And one of the things that we do with them, and I think I've mentioned this in the past, we first helped them to identify the risk that they have and then try and manage them, right, without the use of risk transfer. 
And then as prices go up, clients finance more of it themselves if they can handle it. And then ultimately, when you get to the risk transfer part of whether they decide to trade the risk, they make choices there, too, the amount of insurance that they buy, the coinsurance, deductibles, things they try and manage for them, the budget that they have to spend on topics like risk transfer. So it's never a direct line from what a carrier publishes as rate to what a client actually does for the risk that they're trying to transfer. 
And so all those areas that we're talking about, clients have a real heightened focus on during a time when pricing is increasing. They get very specific around how they try and manage it themselves or finance it themselves before they try and risk transfer it into the market."

In terms of your question around CapEx, we would say that CapEx should increase modestly year-over-year, driven by investments in technology to drive long-term growth. And I would say, look, going forward, we expect free cash flow to grow double digits over the long term, really driven by 3 key things: growth in operating income; declining uses of cash; and improvements in working capital. And so we're really excited about the growth in free cash flow long term as well as our ability to add debt as EBITDA continues to grow. So a substantial amount of cash to invest back in Aon."

It's worth actually just putting things in context when you think about sort of where we've come over the last 16 months, and we'll translate it directly into growth, which will be a great story as we've shown in the first half.Whe",418,"So maybe let's start. It's worth actually just putting things in context when you think about sort of where we've come over the last 16 months, and we'll translate it directly into growth, which will be a great story as we've shown in the first half.
When you take a step back over the last 16 months, the primary thesis behind the combination is exceptionally strong. In fact, pandemic has made it stronger over that period of time. Obviously, strong shareholder approval, regulatory momentum in virtually every jurisdiction around the world. And I noted, obviously, DG COMP in the European theater, but others around the world as well.
And just so you understand, we reached an impasse in the U.S. Department of Justice. We could have completed the deal in a couple of ways, but we made the choice to reject what we believe were 2 unacceptable options. One was the remedies, and we could have completed the deal through the remedy just like we did in Europe, but it wouldn't have been the right answer for us. It simply would not have been the right answer. We roughly know what it would take. But candidly, it would have damaged our client-serving capability as we described before, stifled innovation. And as I've said, you've heard Eric and Christa talk, that we will never sacrifice our Aon United strategy to close the transaction. That's not going to happen. And in the end, that's where we were on the remedies side. 
And the second option, equally unappealing, was litigation. We have an exceptionally strong hand from our view. But the time line pushed the deal into 2022, it looks -- looked like it did in every way, shape or form, also unacceptable. We're just not going to wait in a holding pattern well into 2022 to sort of have this resolved. It's just too long. So we wanted to make a choice, David, for our firm. And we said, on our terms, to move forward independently, and obviously, they're in a position of strength. If you think about where we were in 2020 and now where we are now, very much in a position of strength. And we're excited about how we move forward with real enthusiasm given by our team and the strength of our Aon United strategy. So that's the rough picture in terms of sort of where we are, but when we get to growth, Eric or Christa, anything else you want to comment on that?"

Maybe I'll talk a little bit about the integration planning process and how we're using that work to help propel us forward post this event. Maybe to go back a little bit, we went into the, certainly, the pandemic and the Willis Towers Watson combination, in a great place, right? We are very strong going in, both operationally and with revenue growth. And when we started the integration management effort, we were essentially able to maintain the client momentum and continue to work on our strategy. During the last 16 months of planning, the teams really perfected our Aon operating model, the delivering Aon United strategy as well as our go-to-market. How do we actually pull all these teams together for the benefit of our clients? All that's going to be incorporated going forward, which will continue to likely build the momentum. So I think while we came into this process in a strong position, I think we're actually coming out of it in an even stronger position."

So again, David, I think just want to give you a sense of sort of what that history has been over the last 16 months, to your question, then you kind of say, ""Well, how does that translate into growth?"" I think Eric's point was really important. The fundamental capability actually has strengthened. We spend so much time thinking about opportunities on the growth side, on the efficiency side, on the investment side. And we came up with a ton of them, and we're incorporating all of those. All that then reinforced by the Aon United strategy and the connectivity. 
And ironically, COVID created a situation where we are on WebEx. Now there's different systems. WebEx connected our firm in a way in the -- sitting across a virtual table from clients in a way that's been incredibly, incredibly powerful. And that's what's led to literally net new business growth and also growth with existing clients, the strongest we've ever seen. So it really positions us exceptionally well to continue to increase market share and take share around the world, which we've been doing and continue to do as well as create net new. 
And I just don't want to get away. This is not a zero-sum game for us. We're winning a zero-sum game, but it isn't about that. It's about net new, as we put solutions in place around cyber, intellectual property and climate. I mean it's just the 3 we talk about a lot. We spend a tremendous amount of time focused on those. So we're very excited about the growth prospects. That's why we talk about mid-single-digit or greater across all our solution lines in 2021 and beyond."

I'm joined virtually by Christa Davies, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President. As in previous quarters, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website. 
We want to begin by thanking our 50,000 Aon colleagues for their dedication and focus on serving clients. Over the last year plus, certainly, every organization around the world has wrestled with how to best support employees, how to manage record volatility and how to deliver more value to customers. At Aon, our colleagues have led through all this while also preparing for a substantial integration. What our team has accomplished is extraordinary. Today, we move forward with the benefit of all that work without the constraint of regulatory uncertainty. 
My remarks will cover our outstanding financial performance in Q2 and year-to-date, provide some observations on the termination of our combination with Willis Towers Watson, then speak to our go-forward plan to continue delivering great service and innovation on behalf of clients, enabling growth for colleagues and delivering excellent return to shareholders. 
In Q2, our global team delivered outstanding results across each of our key financial metrics, and I'd note particular strength across the top and bottom line with 11% organic revenue growth, driven by mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth from every solution line, highlighted the particular strength in commercial risk at 14%, which translated into 17% adjusted EPS growth in Q2 and 13% free cash flow growth for the first half. 
Our 8% organic revenue growth for the first half reflects mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth from 4 of our 5 solution lines. Our Aon United strategy is delivering net new business generation and ongoing strong retention. 
We also saw double-digit growth overall in the more discretionary portions of our business, including transaction liability, human capital and project-related work within Commercial Risk Solutions. 
One fantastic Aon United client example in the quarter was around cybersecurity organization design. Aon colleagues came together across solution lines to address a significant yet common client challenge. Our client's cyber risk was increasing, while their security organization faced the rapidly increasing cost of attracting and retaining top talent to execute their cyber defense strategy. Colleagues from our cyber solutions group within commercial risk and from our rewards practice within human capital combined with our unique expertise in cyber risk, with best practices and benchmarking around talent and compensation. 
The results for our client was an organizational design solution that aligns their HR and technology teams to manage their cyber risk in a more cost and efficient way. The result for Aon is a repeatable offering that helps address the common need for many of our clients in an area of growing risk. 
I would also note that we saw strong global macroeconomic conditions in the quarter, but we continue to assess 3 key factors as we have since the beginning of the pandemic. Those factors are the virus and vaccine rollout, including the potential impact of the delta variant; as well as government stimulus; and overall GDP growth. These macro conditions do affect our clients and our business. For example, we continue to see impact to our travel and defense practice within Data & Analytic Services. Considering the current outlook for these factors, we continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth for the full year 2021 and over the long term. 
Turning now to the termination of our combination with Willis Towers Watson. We recently announced our mutual agreement to move forward as 2 independent companies. On behalf of Aon, I'd like to thank our counterparts at Willis Towers Watson for their professionalism over the past 16 months since we announced the transaction. We have the utmost respect for them and have truly enjoyed getting to know the team. 
The combination had significant regulatory momentum, including, notably, approval from the European Commission as well as approval from many jurisdictions globally who had thoroughly evaluated and vetted the transaction. The exception was the United States. The demands made by the U.S. Department of Justice on our U.S. business would have stifled innovation and reduced our client-serving capability. 
Meeting these demands would have significantly impacted our existing U.S. business, the potential shareholder value creation of the combination, and our ability to continue to drive ongoing progress against our key financial metrics. Similarly, the path forward on litigation was untenable because current course appear to take us well into 2022, and we could not accept that level of delay. Ultimately, the choice was clear. We simply would never compromise colleague and client priorities to close the combination. Our decision to end the combination and pay the termination fee creates certainty and clarity about how we move forward. And we're confident this is the right decision for our firm, for our colleagues, our clients and our shareholders. We move forward with energy and a high confidence in our ability to continue delivering new and innovative solutions for clients, exceptional opportunity for colleagues and financial performance for shareholders. 
As we look forward, there are 3 important points that were clear when we announced the combination and are equally, if not more, important now. First, the world is becoming more volatile, and clients need a partner capable to accelerate innovation on their behalf. Just look at the socioeconomic impact of the pandemic, the rise of state-sponsored cyber hacking, the floods in Eastern Europe, the fires in Western America and the challenges globally of working remotely. 
Second, the events of the past 16 months have honed the power of Aon United and our ability to work together to deliver new sources of value to clients. Over this time, we crystallized our operating model and cemented our one firm mindset. We've uncovered countless new growth, investment and efficiency opportunities. And at this point, we're better connected across our firm with all the value of this work and none of integration distractions. 
Third, we're moving forward with a proven platform and are operating from a position of strength and momentum, as demonstrated by our client feedback and colleague engagement scores at/or approaching their highest levels for the past decade. Our colleagues are delivering client retention and net new business generation across all solution lines, driving 8% organic revenue growth over the first half and 11% organic revenue growth this quarter, our strongest performance in almost 2 decades. 
And our Aon Business Services operating platform is digitizing our firm, improving the client experience and enabling efficiency, as demonstrated by operating margin expansion and 13% free cash flow growth in the first half. Aon has never been in a better position to propel top and bottom line growth and build on over a decade of progress on our key financial metrics. 
In summary, our second quarter results demonstrate the success and momentum of our Aon United strategy. We're operating from a position of strength, and we've never been better positioned to deliver for clients, support our colleagues and generate shareholder value. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our results, the financial impact of the termination and our long-term outlook for continued shareholder value creation. Christa?"
119853,1673557552,2384270,"Aon plc, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2021",2021-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Aon plc","Executives","Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. We delivered continued progress for both the quarter and year-to-date, including an impressive 11% organic revenue growth in Q2.

We delivered continued progress for both the quarter and year-to-date, including an impressive 11% organic revenue growth in Q2. Through the first half of the year, we translated strong organic revenue growth into double-digit operating income, earnings per share and free cash flow growth, demonstrating the power of our Aon United strategy. As I further reflect on our performance for the first half of the year, as Greg noted, organic revenue growth was 11% in the second quarter and 8% year-to-date. We continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth for the full year 2021 and over the long term. 
I would also note the total reported revenue was up 16% in Q2 and 12% year-to-date, including the favorable impact from changes in FX rates, driven by a weaker U.S. dollar versus most currencies. Our strong revenue growth and ongoing operational discipline contributed to adjusted operating income growth of 11% in Q2 and 14% through the first half of the year. 
Turning to expenses and margins. There are 2 key points I wanted to describe further. First, I want to speak to the impact of our previously communicated repatterning of expenses as compared to COVID-impacted spend in 2020, which I'll describe before any 2021 growth. As we communicated in Q1, the timing of expenses is changing year-over-year such that $135 million of expenses moved into Q2 from Q4. This impact is due to the actions we took and highlighted last year as we reduced discretionary expenses to be prepared for the potential impacts of COVID-19 and potential macroeconomic distress. 
The $135 million is approximately 1.5% of our total 2020 expense base. In Q2, this repatterning negatively impacted margins by approximately 470 basis points, resulting in Q2 operating margin contraction of 100 basis points. Excluding this impact, margins would have expanded by 370 basis points in Q2 and 250 basis points for the first half of 2021. As we said before, we expected a further $65 million to move from Q4 into Q3 for a total of $200 million of expenses moving out of Q4. 
A second key factor impacting margins has been the relative speed of revenue growth and investment. In Q2, excluding the impact of repatterning, our strong revenue growth significantly outpaced expense growth. We continue to evaluate investments using our ROIC framework. While we made deliberate investments in people, operations and technology to enable long-term growth, the expenses associated with these investments were not fully incurred in Q2 and will ramp up during the second half of the year. We also anticipate some potential resumption of T&E and modest potential increase in real estate costs as more colleagues return to the office. 
Collectively, the headwind from expense repatterning and tailwind from slow investment as compared to growth were the main factors driving 100 basis points of margin contraction in Q2 and the 40 basis points of margin expansion in the first half of 2021. Looking forward, as we've said historically, we expect to deliver full margin expansion for 2021 and over the long term. 
Turning back to the results in the quarter. We've translated strong operating income growth into adjusted EPS growth of 17% in Q2 and 16% year-to-date. As noted in our earnings material, FX translation was a favorable impact of approximately $0.04 in Q2 and $0.22 year-to-date. If currency to remain stable at today's rates, we'd expect a $0.02 per share favorable impact in Q3 and $0.01 per share favorable impact in Q4.
As Greg mentioned, Aon and Willis Towers Watson mutually agreed to terminate our business combination agreements and move forward immediately as 2 independent firms. In accordance with the business combination agreement, we have paid the $1 billion termination fee to Willis Towers Watson. 
With respect to the termination fee, our U.S. businesses were the primary focus of the Department of Justice's challenge, and we paid this fee to defend that business from additional remedy divestitures that are essential to our ability to serve clients as well as the continuing delay and uncertainty in completing the combination.
As part of the termination, we also expect to incur approximately $350 million to $400 million of additional charges in Q3 related to transaction costs and compensation expenses as well as a small number of actions related to further steps on our Aon United operating model. These charges are related to costs to terminate and conclude the combination, including related divestitures. They will all be incurred in Q3 as part of a clean break with Willis Towers Watson. 
Given the outstanding work our colleagues have done over the last past 16 months, we've taken steps internally to ensure our colleagues share in the growth potential of the firm going forward, and this includes those who are previously offered retention bonuses in connection with the combination. The majority of the cash relating to these charges will be paid in Q3 and Q4. Aside from these transaction costs, we do not expect any further significant impacts from the termination of the transaction on our financials going forward.
Excluding the termination fee, our performance and outlook for free cash flow growth in 2021 and going forward remain strong. Free cash flow increased 13% year-to-date to $1.3 billion, driven primarily by strong operating income growth and a decline in structural uses of cash. We continue to expect to drive free cash flow growth over the long term, building on our long-term track record of 14% CAGR over the last 10 years, based on operating income growth, working capital improvements and reduced structural use of cash. As we communicated in Q1, we continue to expect CapEx for the full year to increase modestly year-over-year as we invest in technology to drive business growth.
Given our outlook for long-term free cash flow growth, we expect share repurchase to continue to remain our highest return on capital opportunity for capital allocation. In the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares for approximately $240 million. We also expect to continue to invest organically and inorganically in innovative content and capabilities to address unmet client needs. Our priority areas of investments are focused on: addressing new forms of volatility like cyber; helping clients build a resilient workforce, with better solutions around engagement and employee benefits; rethinking access to capital, such as within intellectual property solutions; and addressing the underserved with digital solutions like CoverWallet. Our M&A pipeline is focused on bringing innovation at scale to our clients' biggest challenges, delivered by the connectivity of Aon United. 
Now turning to our balance sheet and debt capacity. We remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet and manage liquidity risk through a well-laddered debt maturity profile. Our financial profile has improved over the past 18 months. And considering our June 30 balance sheet and the payment of the termination fee, we estimate we have $1.5 billion of additional debt capacity for discretionary use in the second half as we return to historical leverage ratios while maintaining our current investment-grade credit ratings. 
Over the long term, we expect to return to our past practice of growing debt as EBITDA grows. Further, I'd note that free cash flow generation in the second half is seasonally stronger than the first half, and we intend to allocate this cash to our highest and best use based on return on capital. 
In summary, we ended the second quarter in a position of strength as our Aon United strategy and investments in long-term growth are driving strong top and bottom line performance. While the termination of our combination with Willis Towers Watson was not the outcome we originally intended, the opportunity for Aon has only grown. Our disciplined approach to return on capital, combined with our expected long-term free cash flow growth and increased debt opportunity, provides financial flexibility to unlock significant shareholder value creation over the long term. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator, and we'd be happy to take your questions."

As clients' need increased, our ability to react to clients and serve them also continued to increase. And so Jimmy, we end up with new business generation, net new business generation, really at all-time highs. And it continued to build, moved into the third and fourth quarter of last year. Now you see it in the first half of this year.
And really for the last 5 quarters, a real kind of tour de force effort on behalf of colleagues around the world on all areas as it relates to growth. It's why we underscore and reinforce the mid-single-digit organic for the year and ongoing beyond 2021. But it really is the fundamental. It really is how we're connecting with clients and supporting clients, how we're applying the Aon United strategy, bringing the best of our firm to clients every day.

It's always a great question because people always wonder why the direct carrier sort of per unit price doesn't show up and translate across to the intermediaries on the risk side. And listen, I would just say clients make choices when prices move up or down, right? And one of the things that we do with them, and I think I've mentioned this in the past, we first helped them to identify the risk that they have and then try and manage them, right, without the use of risk transfer. 
And then as prices go up, clients finance more of it themselves if they can handle it. And then ultimately, when you get to the risk transfer part of whether they decide to trade the risk, they make choices there, too, the amount of insurance that they buy, the coinsurance, deductibles, things they try and manage for them, the budget that they have to spend on topics like risk transfer. So it's never a direct line from what a carrier publishes as rate to what a client actually does for the risk that they're trying to transfer. 
And so all those areas that we're talking about, clients have a real heightened focus on during a time when pricing is increasing. They get very specific around how they try and manage it themselves or finance it themselves before they try and risk transfer it into the market."

It's worth actually just putting things in context when you think about sort of where we've come over the last 16 months, and we'll translate it directly into growth, which will be a great story as we've shown in the first half.
When you take a step back over the last 16 months, the primary thesis behind the combination is exceptionally strong. In fact, pandemic has made it stronger over that period of time. Obviously, strong shareholder approval, regulatory momentum in virtually every jurisdiction around the world. And I noted, obviously, DG COMP in the European theater, but others around the world as well.
And just so you understand, we reached an impasse in the U.S. Department of Justice. We could have completed the deal in a couple of ways, but we made the choice to reject what we believe were 2 unacceptable options. One was the remedies, and we could have completed the deal through the remedy just like we did in Europe, but it wouldn't have been the right answer for us. It simply would not have been the right answer. We roughly know what it would take. But candidly, it would have damaged our client-serving capability as we described before, stifled innovation. And as I've said, you've heard Eric and Christa talk, that we will never sacrifice our Aon United strategy to close the transaction. That's not going to happen. And in the end, that's where we were on the remedies side. 
And the second option, equally unappealing, was litigation. We have an exceptionally strong hand from our view. But the time line pushed the deal into 2022, it looks -- looked like it did in every way, shape or form, also unacceptable. We're just not going to wait in a holding pattern well into 2022 to sort of have this resolved. It's just too long. So we wanted to make a choice, David, for our firm. And we said, on our terms, to move forward independently, and obviously, they're in a position of strength. If you think about where we were in 2020 and now where we are now, very much in a position of strength. And we're excited about how we move forward with real enthusiasm given by our team and the strength of our Aon United strategy. So that's the rough picture in terms of sort of where we are, but when we get to growth, Eric or Christa, anything else you want to comment on that?"

We spend so much time thinking about opportunities on the growth side, on the efficiency side, on the investment side. And we came up with a ton of them, and we're incorporating all of those. All that then reinforced by the Aon United strategy and the connectivity. 
And ironically, COVID created a situation where we are on WebEx. Now there's different systems. WebEx connected our firm in a way in the -- sitting across a virtual table from clients in a way that's been incredibly, incredibly powerful.

I'm joined by Christa Davies, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President. As in previous quarters, for your reference, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website.
We want to begin by thanking our 50,000 colleagues. 2021 continues to be a remarkable year. And as a result of our colleagues' hard work, dedication and perseverance, we've delivered outstanding results in Q3 and year-to-date. This performance is an extraordinary accomplishment and a direct result of their efforts, working together as one firm to bring the best of Aon to clients.
We're also proud to report that our client feedback continues to be outstanding as net promoter scores are at a 5-year high. Additionally, Aon's colleague engagement is at the highest levels we've seen over the past decade, consistent with top quartile employers. This client feedback and colleague engagement are directly reflected in our firm's sustained momentum and financial performance.
In deep appreciation for all that our colleagues do for our clients and our firm, we were excited to establish in Q3 the Aon United growth ownership plan. This unique program rewards every colleague with a stock-based award to share in the current and future success of our firm, and we're thrilled to recognize and support our colleagues in this way. 
Overall, as we reflect on Q3 and the first 9 months of 2021, our momentum, defined by client delivery, colleague engagement and financial results, is exceptional, even more promising as what we see in the opportunity ahead. Our conversations with clients reinforce substantial and growing unmet demand to support them in making better decisions to protect and grow their businesses in an increasingly volatile world. This opportunity to create new markets to serve our clients is the catalyst for our innovation agenda and a source of greater momentum in our business.
Focusing on financial performance in Q3, our global team delivered outstanding results across each of our key financial metrics, including 12% organic revenue growth. Notably, our strongest growth in over a decade for 2 quarters in a row, driven by mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth from every solution line, highlighted by particular strength in health and commercial risk at 16% and 30%, respectively and adjusted EPS growth of 14%. 
Year-to-date, our 9% organic revenue growth reflects mid-single-digit or greater organic growth from 3 of our 4 solution lines. Our Aon United strategy is delivering significant momentum in every solution line, with net new business generation and ongoing strong retention. We also saw double-digit growth for the second consecutive quarter in the more discretionary portions of our business, such as transaction liability, human capital and project-related work within Commercial Risk Solutions and Health Solutions. 
We continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth and margin expansion in the full year 2021, 2022 and over the long term as we continue to win share in our core business and execute to further expand our total addressable market.
As we move forward, we continue to be guided by our Aon United Blueprint, to ensure we're operating as a fully integrated global team capable of delivering the best of our firm in every local market. Today, we'd like to highlight how the core tenets of our blueprint drive momentum and deliver greater future opportunity.
Specifically, how delivering Aon United is enabling core new business generation and fueling stronger retention. How Aon Business Services is building capability for colleagues and translating into better service for clients. Our ongoing focus on innovation at scale is accelerating the development of new solutions to serve unmet demand, and our commitment to inclusive people leadership has resulted in the highest level of engagement and retention in over a decade.
First, executing Aon United is delivering net new business generation and ongoing strong retention by continuing to engage clients across all their needs with the entirety of our firm. This strategy has been built over many years and enables extraordinary solutions for clients, resulting in Aon winning more, growing our book of business with new and existing clients and, in turn, delivering exceptional results to shareholders. 
Second, we've invested heavily in Aon Business Services, or ABS, over the past 5 years, which now represents the core operating platform that spans the entirety of the firm. ABS Centers of Excellence have and will continue to grow margins by driving efficiencies across all solution lines. Equally important, ABS capability enables us to improve client service delivery and scale innovation globally much faster, driving higher organic growth. The ABS model is redefining what we're capable of delivering to clients and improving the way we work.
Third, we continue to accelerate innovation at scale. AON is delivering innovative solutions to our clients by helping them navigate new forms of volatility, build resilient workforces, access new forms of capital and address the underserved through digital solutions, all of which substantially grow our total addressable market.
This has been demonstrated, for example, intellectual property back financing, a first-of-its-kind option created and enabled by Aon's IP solutions team. Given the inllectual property represents 80-plus percent of the value of the S&P 500, we believe the entire IP category has the potential to be a $100 billion market over time. Other categories that represent new addressable markets in the tens of billions, include cyber, climate, supply chain and digital client solutions, led by our exceptional team at [indiscernible]. 
Fundamentally, this opportunity to serve substantial new addressable markets is driven by client demand. At Aon, we relentlessly focused on the voice of the client, and we're hearing consistent client feedback about the need to make better decisions around long tail risks.
For example, we're currently getting this guidance from the almost 3,500 clients that are currently participating in our regional Aon Insight series. And it's also being reinforced by 2 pieces of proprietary research that we recently released. Every 2 years, Aon conducts our global risk management survey, and the latest report released 3 days ago was informed by insights from more than 2,300 clients across 16 industries spanning public and private organizations from 60 countries around the world. With more emphasis and reliance on technology, cyber risk top the list as the #1 current and predicted future risk globally. It's highest rank since the inception of survey. 
The top 10 risks also reflect the impact COVID has had on organizations as they needed to navigate volatility with better and faster decisions. We're seeing organizations shift focus from event-based to impact-based risk assessments, reflecting the shift in mindset following the systemic impact of the pandemic.
Aon also recently released results of a survey focused on 800 C-suite leaders and senior executives in the U.S., EU, U.K. and Canada to understand how organizations are preparing for and responding to the current environment. We found that, today, senior leaders are more astutely risk aware than ever before, but remain confident to take on calculated risks and investments that build resiliency of their companies.
As we stated before, the approach to risk strategy has shifted from being generally defensive and risk averse to more opportunistic, taking a holistic, integrated view as they seek solutions to address these challenges. There's great respect to the need to defend their businesses, but that's accompanied by a desire to find solutions that help them win, that the IP financing example highlights. In this environment, we're uniquely positioned to deliver data-driven insights to help our clients make better decisions that grow their businesses.
Fourth and finally, we continue to see tremendous impact of our commitment to inclusive people leadership. Voluntary attrition is down substantially versus our 2019 baseline our quarterly pulse of colleagues shows that we continue to enjoy all-time high engagement levels.
Many examples highlight our talent focus and priority, including our commitment on our apprenticeship programs and a $30 million investment to create 10,000 new roles in the apprenticeship community. Our investment in talent development has over 14,000 Aon colleagues around the world have participated in training programs in the last 9 months alone, and the announcement of the Ann United growth ownership plan.
In summary, our global Aon team delivered the best third quarter results in over a decade. Our United Blueprint, powered by our capability in Aon Business Services, combined with significant investment in new and growing categories of addressable client demand, reinforces the momentum we have today and offer even greater potential over the next few years. The result is clients that are better informed, better advised and equipped to make better decisions.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our financial results and our long-term outlook for continued shareholder value creation. Christa?"

As Greg highlighted, we delivered continued progress for both the quarter and year-to-date. Through the first 9 months of the year, we translated strong organic revenue growth into double-digit adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share growth, building on our momentum as we head into the last quarter of the year.
As I further reflect on our performance year-to-date, as Greg noted, organic revenue growth was 12% in the third quarter and 9% year-to-date, our strongest organic revenue growth in over a decade. We saw strong global macroeconomic conditions in the quarter, but we continue to assess the refactors as we have since the beginning of the pandemic. Those factors are the virus and vaccine rollout, including the potential impacts of new variants, government stimulus and overall GDP growth. These macroeconomic conditions do impact our clients in various areas of our business. 
Considering the current outlook for these factors, we continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth for the full year 2021, 2022 and over the long term. I would also note that total reported revenue was up 13% in Q3 and 12% year-to-date, including the favorable impact from changes in FX rates driven by a weaker U.S. dollar versus most currencies.

First, I want to speak to the impact of our previously communicated refunding expenses as compared to COVID-impacted expense in 2020, which I'll describe before any 2021 growth. As we've described, the timing of expenses is changing year-over-year, such that $65 million of expenses moved into Q3 from Q4. This impact is due to the actions we took allotted in 2020 as we reduced discretionary expenses to be prepared for the impact of COVID-19 and potential macroeconomic distress. 
In Q3, this repatterning negatively impacted margins by approximately 240 basis points, resulting in Q3 operating margin contraction of 30 basis points. Excluding this impact, margins would have expanded by 210 basis points in Q3 and 240 basis points year-to-date. A second key factor impacting adjusted margins has been the relative speed of revenue growth and investment. 
In Q3, excluding the impact of the rebating, our strong organic revenue growth significantly outpaced expense growth similar to Q2. We continue to evaluate investments using our return on invested capital framework in the areas of talent, and business services and innovation to enable long-term growth. We expect that these areas of investment will continue to ramp up significantly during Q4. 
In addition, we anticipate continued resumption of T&E and modest increases in real estate as more colleagues return to the office. Collectively, the headwind from expensary patterning and tailwind from slower investment as compared to revenue growth were the main factors driving 30 basis points of margin contraction in Q3 and 20 basis points of margin expansion year-to-date. Looking forward, as we've said historically, we expect to deliver full year margin expansion for 2021 and over the long term.
Turning back to the results in the quarter. We translated strong adjusted operating income growth into adjusted EPS growth of 14% in Q3 and 16% year-to-date. As noted in our earnings material, FX translation was a favorable impact of approximately $0.02 per share in Q3 and $0.24 per share year-to-date. If currencies remain stable at today's rates, we would expect an insignificant impact in Q4.
Excluding the costs associated with the termination of the combination with Willis Towers Watson-related costs, our performance and outlook for free cash flow in 2021 and going forward remains strong. Free cash flow decreased 40% year-to-date to $1.1 billion as strong revenue growth was offset by the $1 billion termination fee payment and other related costs. Of the total $1.363 billion of termination fee and other related costs, a pretax amount, the $1 billion termination fee was paid in Q3 and approximately 2/3 of the remaining charges will be paid in 2021, with the majority of the balance paid in 2022. 
We continue to expect to drive free cash flow over the long term, building on our long-term track record of 14% CAGR over the last 10 years based on operating income growth, working capital improvements and reduced structural uses of cash enabled by Aon Business Services.
As Greg highlighted, Aon Business Services not only drive efficiencies, but also enables revenue opportunities and innovation at scale. As an example, through our integrated vendor management system in the U.S. last year, we were able to ensure that 5% of addressable vendor spend was with diverse suppliers, which is 2x higher than the Fortune 500 average. In addition to being a key initiative for Aon as part of our overall ESG strategy, this is also a way we can have an even bigger impact on what we deliver for clients in an Aon United way.
In the third quarter, we have an opportunity to engage with the biopharmaceutical clients looking to establish a supplier diversity program as part of their broader inclusion and diversity strategy. Given our demonstrated supply diversity expertise, our global spend management team and human capital colleagues came together to forge a new innovative solution based on this client's emerging need, which included establishing government structure and conducting research on peer and industry norms.
Given our outlook for long-term free cash flow growth, we expect share repurchase to continue to remain our highest return on capital opportunity for capital allocation. In the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 4.4 million shares or approximately $1.3 billion. We also expect to continue to invest organically and inorganically in innovative content and capabilities to address unmet client needs. Our M&A pipeline, centered around the 4 areas that Greg described, is focused on bringing innovative solutions to our clients' biggest challenges, delivered by the connectivity of Aon United.
I would also note that on October 1, we closed the previously announced sale of our Retiree Exchange business to a light. In 2020, the Retiree Exchange generated $176 million of revenue and it is a predominantly Q4 business. 
Turning now to our balance sheet and debt capacity. We remained confident in the strength of our balance sheet and manage liquidity risk through a well-lettered debt maturity profile. In Q3, we issued $1 billion of senior notes as we return closer to historical leverage ratios, while maintaining our current investment-grade credit ratings. Interest expense in the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately $85 million, reflecting our increased debt levels. Over the long term, we expect to return to our past practice of growing debt as EBITDA grows.
Further, I'd note that fourth quarter is our seasonally strongest quarter for free cash flow generation, and we intend to allocate this cash to our highest and best uses based on return on capital, which remains share repurchase.
In summary, strong top and bottom line performance for both the quarter and year-to-date reflect continued progress and momentum as we enter the last quarter of the year. We believe our disciplined approach to return on invested capital, combined with expected long-term free cash flow growth, will unlock substantial shareholder value creation over the long term.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions."

First, on the data and analytics area continue to invest in our digital space, our modeling and analytic capability to help clients see what's coming and understand better. 
You mentioned in your opening comments around C-suite people are now risk aware. And by risk aware, that means they want more information, right? And so we need to have more analytic capability, more modeling capabilities. So we're investing there. And then you've got your traditional areas where we're seeing great growth rate, whether it's M&A services, construction, health benefits. Those areas where we really do see that need underneath the Aon United platform of integrating those teams is really it's something. So there's a lot out there.

We do expect to generate strong free cash flow this year, and we expect free cash flow, over the long term, to be growing double digits. 
One of the things I'd note, Charlie, is if you start with the $2.6 billion of free cash flow, straight off the GAAP cash flow statement in 2020, that's cash flow from operations less CapEx that equals $2.6 billion you can grow that double digits, Charlie, and get yourself to a good starting point for 2022 free cash flow.

The clients make decisions based on their risk appetite, budget capacity, insurance options in the marketplace, et cetera, and each product essentially has its own dynamics, right? It has its own claim trends. It has to turn to conditions, retention deductible, supply/demand, which markets are competing, et cetera. 
So we're coming out of probably a 24- to 36-month price increase environment. But we're seeing a deceleration across the globe on the major products. You mentioned cyber, in particular. It's important to put that in scale in terms of the size and reach of the entirety of the insurance marketplace. So it gets a lot of attention over the last couple of days I've heard as well. 
But the reality is it's one product in an entire risk management portfolio that clients are managing against. And a lot of the energy that's going into cyber today is actually going into the consulting aspect of it, the risk management part or the post-event part as opposed to just the risk transfer, as the market is trying to get its right balance as to what is -- what's the right trading price, if you will, for risk transfer and what's covered in it and the like based on all the activity we've seen in ransomware and other things over the last couple of years. 
But keep it in context, because overall, the size and scale of what our clients are doing around the world, they're trying to make trade-offs and choices based on market conditions that have been more favorable to insurers than clients over the last couple of years. But ultimately, our role in that is to help them -- using our expertise, our analytics, our modeling capability to help them make those choices.

When a client -- if it's a U.S.-based client and they want to talk about something that's happening in France, you just pop up the French team, and they can go direct to it and have that conversation. 
So historically, that would have come from the team in France to the account exec in the U.S. and would have been talked about in the third person as opposed to just unlocking the global team, and it does a couple of things for us. One, it shows the power of the global company to a client. It also makes connections among our teams in a way where they're learning firsthand as well and so can repeat that learning. So you're absolutely right on everything you said, Christa, before, but it is there's an ability for us to really see and use the global connectivity in a way that historically had just been harder to do and do it on a more frequent basis.
And we have found over the last 18 months that the clients have really valued that access, being able to get right to the point of the expertise and be able to bring it and deliver it in a really easy way for the client to digest it and really build those relationships as well. 
We definitely are going to take those forward. That has been a real value part for us and something that we're going to bake into the model going forward."

It's really -- it's been fantastic. 
And in essence, in many respects, they're getting a chance to see the firm in a way they haven't seen it before. So beyond kind of the aspect of the sort of the wealth creation aspect of it, really is the financial wellness aspect of it has been absolutely fantastic.

And that's where we are, and that's where we have achieved and continue to achieve, and that's we're anticipating for next year, or the year after, in the coming years.
So look for that, that's the benchmark in terms of where we are. We really don't look at it the same way as maybe I'll just describe it this idea of quarter-to-quarter at of course and get a return. We really look at overall how we support our colleagues, the talent strategy of our firm. How we both bring them in and develop them, but also how we develop our current set of colleagues who come in and are part of Aon over time. 
And that's sort of new hires, but it's also, I think about our apprenticeship program. Our apprentice program has been an amazing investment and opportunity over the last number of years. we started it in 2017 as an example. In Chicago, we now have 15 employers engaged in the apprenticeship network with 1,000 of furnaces in Chicago. We made this investment across North America. We've copied what's been done across Europe. We've been recognized, even fortunate to recognize sort of what we've done in terms of sort of the impact this is going to have. 
And all I'm trying to highlight what's on this topic of talent, it's central day. And we developed it in a very specific way. I talked about 14,000 Aon colleagues in the last 9 months alone, really going through training programs that help our colleagues continue to evolve as professionals dealt serve clients in an environment which becomes more complex. That is the way we approach the market. on all angles and all aspects with full expectation. We're going to achieve results, mid-single digit or greater.
So it's not kind of up, down or different. It's just that's what it's going to be mid-single digit or greater. And then we see opportunity to continue to expand with these new addressable markets we talked about. So that's philosophically how we think about it. It isn't kind of the ramp up, ramp down, ramp up, ramp down that others often talk about, ours is really mid-single digit or greater over time. 
But Eric got something from your standpoint as you think about this from the talent?"
119853,1684768416,2417788,"Aon plc, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2021",2021-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Aon plc","Executives","Yes. Maybe a different angle on it, too, is that when you think about Aon United model and how we actually interact with clients, essentially having a client leader who can bring all of the capability of the firm to a client, whether it's on the risk side",266,"Yes. Maybe a different angle on it, too, is that when you think about Aon United model and how we actually interact with clients, essentially having a client leader who can bring all of the capability of the firm to a client, whether it's on the risk side, whether it's on the wealth side or the health side, et cetera. 
That model is a team-based model, right? So it's less about hiring a person and then getting an immediate return, it's really around investing in the capability so that as we interact with clients, we can bring to them either existing solutions that we have today or as the teams work together and create new solutions together, where you're matching human capital and risk or reinsurance and health to try and create new ways to unlock value. That's less about I need 5 new people to get 5 new things. 
It's more on how do you invest consistently over time so that you have the expertise and you have the team-based culture that allows you to deliver that capability to a client in a way that nobody else can. That's what we're after, and that's what we've been building on over the last couple of years.
So as Greg said, it's less about headcount up, head count down. It's around do you have the right culture, -- Do you have the right expertise and the right planning process so that we're able to interact with a client in a way where we can deliver something no one else can. That's the plan.

I'm joined by Christa Davies, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President. 
As in previous quarters, for your reference, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website. 
We want to begin by thanking our 50,000 colleagues. 2021 continues to be a remarkable year. And as a result of our colleagues' hard work, dedication and perseverance, we've delivered outstanding results in Q3 and year-to-date. This performance is an extraordinary accomplishment and a direct result of their efforts, working together as one firm to bring the best of Aon to clients. 
We're also proud to report that our client feedback continues to be outstanding as net promoter scores are at a 5-year high. Additionally, Aon's colleague engagement is at the highest levels we've seen over the past decade, consistent with top quartile employers. This client feedback and colleague engagement are directly reflected in our firm's sustained momentum and financial performance. 
In deep appreciation for all that our colleagues do for our clients and our firm, we were excited to establish in Q3 the Aon United growth ownership plan. This unique program rewards every colleague with a stock-based award to share in the current and future success of our firm, and we're thrilled to recognize and support our colleagues in this way.  
Overall, as we reflect on Q3 and the first 9 months of 2021, our momentum, defined by client delivery, colleague engagement and financial results, is exceptional, even more promising as what we see in the opportunity ahead. Our conversations with clients reinforce substantial and growing unmet demand to support them in making better decisions to protect and grow their businesses in an increasingly volatile world. This opportunity to create new markets to serve our clients is the catalyst for our innovation agenda and a source of greater momentum in our business. 
Focusing on financial performance in Q3, our global team delivered outstanding results across each of our key financial metrics, including 12% organic revenue growth. Notably, our strongest growth in over a decade for 2 quarters in a row, driven by mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth from every solution line, highlighted by particular strength in health and commercial risk at 16% and 30%, respectively and adjusted EPS growth of 14%.  
Year-to-date, our 9% organic revenue growth reflects mid-single-digit or greater organic growth from 3 of our 4 solution lines. Our Aon United strategy is delivering significant momentum in every solution line, with net new business generation and ongoing strong retention. We also saw double-digit growth for the second consecutive quarter in the more discretionary portions of our business, such as transaction liability, human capital and project-related work within Commercial Risk Solutions and Health Solutions.  
We continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth and margin expansion in the full year 2021, 2022 and over the long term as we continue to win share in our core business and execute to further expand our total addressable market. 
As we move forward, we continue to be guided by our Aon United Blueprint, to ensure we're operating as a fully integrated global team capable of delivering the best of our firm in every local market. Today, we'd like to highlight how the core tenets of our blueprint drive momentum and deliver greater future opportunity. 
Specifically, how delivering Aon United is enabling core new business generation and fueling stronger retention. How Aon Business Services is building capability for colleagues and translating into better service for clients. Our ongoing focus on innovation at scale is accelerating the development of new solutions to serve unmet demand, and our commitment to inclusive people leadership has resulted in the highest level of engagement and retention in over a decade. 
First, executing Aon United is delivering net new business generation and ongoing strong retention by continuing to engage clients across all their needs with the entirety of our firm. This strategy has been built over many years and enables extraordinary solutions for clients, resulting in Aon winning more, growing our book of business with new and existing clients and, in turn, delivering exceptional results to shareholders.  
Second. We've invested heavily in Aon Business Services, or ABS, over the past 5 years, which now represents the core operating platform that spans the entirety of the firm. ABS Centers of Excellence have and will continue to grow margins by driving efficiencies across all solution lines. Equally important, ABS capability enables us to improve client service delivery and scale innovation globally much faster, driving higher organic growth. The ABS model is redefining what we're capable of delivering to clients and improving the way we work. 
Third, we continue to accelerate innovation at scale. AON is delivering innovative solutions to our clients by helping them navigate new forms of volatility, build resilient workforces, access new forms of capital and address the underserved through digital solutions, all of which substantially grow our total addressable market. 
This has been demonstrated, for example, intellectual property back financing, a first-of-its-kind option created and enabled by Aon's IP solutions team. Given the inllectual property represents 80-plus percent of the value of the S&P 500, we believe the entire IP category has the potential to be a $100 billion market over time. Other categories that represent new addressable markets in the tens of billions, include cyber, climate, supply chain and digital client solutions, led by our exceptional team at [indiscernible].  
Fundamentally, this opportunity to serve substantial new addressable markets is driven by client demand. At Aon, we relentlessly focused on the voice of the client, and we're hearing consistent client feedback about the need to make better decisions around long tail risks. 
For example, we're currently getting this guidance from the almost 3,500 clients that are currently participating in our regional Aon Insight series. And it's also being reinforced by 2 pieces of proprietary research that we recently released. Every 2 years, Aon conducts our global risk management survey, and the latest report released 3 days ago was informed by insights from more than 2,300 clients across 16 industries spanning public and private organizations from 60 countries around the world. With more emphasis and reliance on technology, cyber risk top the list as the #1 current and predicted future risk globally. It's highest rank since the inception of survey.  
The top 10 risks also reflect the impact COVID has had on organizations as they needed to navigate volatility with better and faster decisions. We're seeing organizations shift focus from event-based to impact-based risk assessments, reflecting the shift in mindset following the systemic impact of the pandemic. 
Aon also recently released results of a survey focused on 800 C-suite leaders and senior executives in the U.S., EU, U.K. and Canada to understand how organizations are preparing for and responding to the current environment. We found that, today, senior leaders are more astutely risk aware than ever before, but remain confident to take on calculated risks and investments that build resiliency of their companies. 
As we stated before, the approach to risk strategy has shifted from being generally defensive and risk averse to more opportunistic, taking a holistic, integrated view as they seek solutions to address these challenges. There's great respect to the need to defend their businesses, but that's accompanied by a desire to find solutions that help them win, that the IP financing example highlights. In this environment, we're uniquely positioned to deliver data-driven insights to help our clients make better decisions that grow their businesses. 
Fourth and finally, we continue to see tremendous impact of our commitment to inclusive people leadership. Voluntary attrition is down substantially versus our 2019 baseline our quarterly pulse of colleagues shows that we continue to enjoy all-time high engagement levels. 
Many examples highlight our talent focus and priority, including our commitment on our entrepreneurship programs and a $30 million investment to create 10,000 new roles in the apprenticeship community. Our investment in talent development has over 14,000 Aon colleagues around the world have participated in training programs in the last 9 months alone, and the announcement of the Ann United growth ownership plan. 
In summary, our global Aon team delivered the best third quarter results in over a decade. Our Aon United Blueprint, powered by our capability in Aon Business Services, combined with significant investment in new and growing categories of addressable client demand, reinforces the momentum we have today and offer even greater potential over the next few years. The result is clients that are better informed, better advised and equipped to make better decisions. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our financial results and our long-term outlook for continued shareholder value creation. Christa?"

Through the first 9 months of the year, we translated strong organic revenue growth into double-digit adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share growth, building on our momentum as we head into the last quarter of the year. 
As I further reflect on our performance year-to-date, as Greg noted, organic revenue growth was 12% in the third quarter and 9% year-to-date, our strongest organic revenue growth in over a decade. We saw strong global macroeconomic conditions in the quarter, but we continue to assess the refactors as we have since the beginning of the pandemic. Those factors are the virus and vaccine rollout, including the potential impacts of new variants, government stimulus and overall GDP growth. These macroeconomic conditions do impact our clients in various areas of our business.  
Considering the current outlook for these factors, we continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth for the full year 2021, 2022 and over the long term. I would also note that total reported revenue was up 13% in Q3 and 12% year-to-date, including the favorable impact from changes in FX rates driven by a weaker U.S. dollar versus most currencies. 
Moving to operating performance. First, I want to speak to the impact of our previously communicated repatterning expenses as compared to COVID-impacted expense in 2020, which I'll describe before any 2021 growth. As we've described, the timing of expenses is changing year-over-year, such that $65 million of expenses moved into Q3 from Q4. This impact is due to the actions we took allotted in 2020 as we reduced discretionary expenses to be prepared for the impact of COVID-19 and potential macroeconomic distress.  
In Q3, this repatterning negatively impacted margins by approximately 240 basis points, resulting in Q3 operating margin contraction of 30 basis points. Excluding this impact, margins would have expanded by 210 basis points in Q3 and 240 basis points year-to-date. A second key factor impacting adjusted margins has been the relative speed of revenue growth and investment.  
In Q3, excluding the impact of the repatterning, our strong organic revenue growth significantly outpaced expense growth similar to Q2. We continue to evaluate investments using our return on invested capital framework in the areas of talent, and business services and innovation to enable long-term growth. We expect that these areas of investment will continue to ramp up significantly during Q4.  
In addition, we anticipate continued resumption of T&E and modest increases in real estate as more colleagues return to the office. Collectively, the headwind from expansionary patterning and tailwind from slower investment as compared to revenue growth were the main factors driving 30 basis points of margin contraction in Q3 and 20 basis points of margin expansion year-to-date. Looking forward, as we've said historically, we expect to deliver full year margin expansion for 2021 and over the long term. 
Turning back to the results in the quarter. We translated strong adjusted operating income growth into adjusted EPS growth of 14% in Q3 and 16% year-to-date. As noted in our earnings material, FX translation was a favorable impact of approximately $0.02 per share in Q3 and $0.24 per share year-to-date. If currencies remain stable at today's rates, we would expect an insignificant impact in Q4. 
Excluding the costs associated with the termination of the combination with Willis Towers Watson-related costs, our performance and outlook for free cash flow in 2021 and going forward remains strong. Free cash flow decreased 40% year-to-date to $1.1 billion as strong revenue growth was offset by the $1 billion termination fee payment and other related costs. Of the total $1.363 billion of termination fee and other related costs, a pretax amount, the $1 billion termination fee was paid in Q3 and approximately 2/3 of the remaining charges will be paid in 2021, with the majority of the balance paid in 2022.  
We continue to expect to drive free cash flow over the long term, building on our long-term track record of 14% CAGR over the last 10 years based on operating income growth, working capital improvements and reduced structural uses of cash enabled by Aon Business Services. 
As Greg highlighted, Aon Business Services not only drive efficiencies, but also enables revenue opportunities and innovation at scale. As an example, through our integrated vendor management system in the U.S. last year, we were able to ensure that 5% of addressable vendor spend was with diverse suppliers, which is 2x higher than the Fortune 500 average. In addition to being a key initiative for Aon as part of our overall ESG strategy, this is also a way we can have an even bigger impact on what we deliver for clients in an Aon United way. 
In the third quarter, we have an opportunity to engage with the biopharmaceutical clients looking to establish a supplier diversity program as part of their broader inclusion and diversity strategy. Given our demonstrated supply diversity expertise, our global spend management team and human capital colleagues came together to forge a new innovative solution based on this client's emerging need, which included establishing government structure and conducting research on peer and industry norms. 
Given our outlook for long-term free cash flow growth, we expect share repurchase to continue to remain our highest return on capital opportunity for capital allocation. In the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 4.4 million shares or approximately $1.3 billion. We also expect to continue to invest organically and inorganically in innovative content and capabilities to address unmet client needs. Our M&A pipeline, centered around the 4 areas that Greg described, is focused on bringing innovative solutions to our clients' biggest challenges, delivered by the connectivity of Aon United. 
I would also note that on October 1, we closed the previously announced sale of our retiree exchange business to a light. In 2020, the Retiree Exchange generated $176 million of revenue and it is a predominantly Q4 business.  
Turning now to our balance sheet and debt capacity. We remained confident in the strength of our balance sheet and manage liquidity risk through a well-lettered debt maturity profile. In Q3, we issued $1 billion of senior notes as we return closer to historical leverage ratios, while maintaining our current investment-grade credit ratings. Interest expense in the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately $85 million, reflecting our increased debt levels. Over the long term, we expect to return to our past practice of growing debt as EBITDA grows. 
Further, I'd note that fourth quarter is our seasonally strongest quarter for free cash flow generation, and we intend to allocate this cash to our highest and best uses based on return on capital, which remains share repurchase. 
In summary, strong top and bottom line performance for both the quarter and year-to-date reflect continued progress and momentum as we enter the last quarter of the year. We believe our disciplined approach to return on invested capital, combined with expected long-term free cash flow growth, will unlock substantial shareholder value creation over the long term. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions."

I remember what our clients are thinking about around the world has been really helpful.  
And really one of the benefits of using the technology in a way that we're going to keep using going forward. So the historical model of doing a road show, putting people in conference rooms around city to city to city, right? Our ability to do it in 2 hours and talk to 4,000 clients at the same time is material. So that's just one area. Christa, I just didn't want to lose that point because it has been such a great impact for us.  
And then second, Greg, is we continue to see real growth opportunities in the business really in a couple of different areas, right? First, on the data and analytics area continue to invest in our digital space, our modeling and analytic capability to help clients see what's coming and understand better.  
You mentioned in your opening comments around C-suite people are now risk aware. And by risk aware, that means they want more information, right? And so we need to have more analytic capability, more modeling capabilities. So we're investing there. And then you've got your traditional areas where we're seeing great growth rate, whether it's M&A services, construction, health benefits. Those areas where we really do see that need underneath the Aon United platform of integrating those teams is really it's something. So there's a lot out there. We could talk for days about it, but just to make those comments off the question."

We do expect to to generate strong free cash flow this year, and we expect free cash flow, over the long term, to be growing double digits.  
One of the things I'd note, Charlie, is if you start with the $2.6 billion of free cash flow, straight off the GAAP cash flow statement in 2020, that's cash flow from operations less CapEx that equals $2.6 billion you can grow that double digits, Charlie, and get yourself to a good starting point for 2022 free cash flow.

The clients make decisions based on their risk appetite, budget capacity, insurance options in the marketplace, et cetera, and each product essentially has its own dynamics, right? It has its own claim trends. It has to turn to conditions, retention deductible, supply/demand, which markets are competing, et cetera.  
So we're coming out of probably a 24- to 36-month price increase environment. But we're seeing a deceleration across the globe on the major products. You mentioned cyber, in particular. It's important to put that in scale in terms of the size and reach of the entirety of the insurance marketplace. So it gets a lot of attention over the last couple of days I've heard as well.  
But the reality is it's one product in an entire risk management portfolio that clients are managing against. And a lot of the energy that's going into cyber today is actually going into the consulting aspect of it, the risk management part or the post-event part as opposed to just the risk transfer, as the market is trying to get its right balance as to what is -- what's the right trading price, if you will, for risk transfer and what's covered in it and the like based on all the activity we've seen in ransomware and other things over the last couple of years.  
But keep it in context, because overall, the size and scale of what our clients are doing around the world, they're trying to make trade-offs and choices based on market conditions that have been more favorable to insurers than clients over the last couple of years. But ultimately, our role in that is to help them using our expertise, our analytics, our modeling capability to help them make those choices. But I would just say, I would keep cyber in context relative to the entirety of the marketplace."

It's a great question. We're really focused on learning the best lessons in how we've been serving clients well over the last 18 months, bringing global expertise and teams to serve their most important issues.  
Via video globally, as Eric described, with our client insight series over 4,000 clients virtually. And it's creating more opportunities for colleagues to be included globally, and we're utilizing this to bring the best talent and best expertise to clients. And so for us, this is really about the future of work and how we position Aon in a new better scenario. So serving clients with the best talent and expertise, providing employees with flexibility and ensuring that they're productive, and having a diverse and an inclusive workforce. But Eric, you're at the front end center of clients every day, what would you add here?"

When a client -- if it's a U.S.-based client and they want to talk about something that's happening in France, you just pop up the French team, and they can go direct to it and have that conversation.  
So historically, that would have come from the team in France to the account exec in the U.S. and would have been talked about in the third person as opposed to just unlocking the global team, and it does a couple of things for us. One, it shows the power of the global company to a client. It also makes connections among our teams in a way where they're learning firsthand as well and so can repeat that learning. So you're absolutely right on everything you said, Christa, before, but it is there's an ability for us to really see and use the global connectivity in a way that historically had just been harder to do and do it on a more frequent basis. 
And we have found over the last 18 months that the clients have really valued that access, being able to get right to the point of the expertise and be able to bring it and deliver it in a really easy way for the client to digest it and really build those relationships as well.  
We definitely are going to take those forward. That has been a real value part for us and something that we're going to bake into the model going forward."

It's really -- it's been fantastic.  
And in essence, in many respects, they're getting a chance to see the firm in a way they haven't seen it before.

And that's where we are, and that's where we have achieved and continue to achieve, and that's we're anticipating for next year, or the year after, in the coming years. 
So look for that, that's the benchmark in terms of where we are. We really don't look at it the same way as maybe I'll just describe it this idea of quarter-to-quarter at of course and get a return. We really look at overall how we support our colleagues, the talent strategy of our firm. How we both bring them in and develop them, but also how we develop our current set of colleagues who come in and are part of Aon over time.  
And that's sort of new hires, but it's also, I think about our apprenticeship program. Our apprentice program has been an amazing investment and opportunity over the last number of years. we started it in 2017 as an example. In Chicago, we now have 15 employers engaged in the apprenticeship network with 1,000 apprentices in Chicago. We made this investment across North America. We've copied what's been done across Europe. We've been recognized, even fortunate to recognize sort of what we've done in terms of sort of the impact this is going to have.  
And all I'm trying to highlight what's on this topic of talent, it's central day. And we developed it in a very specific way. I talked about 14,000 Aon colleagues in the last 9 months alone, really going through training programs that help our colleagues continue to evolve as professionals dealt serve clients in an environment which becomes more complex. That is the way we approach the market. on all angles and all aspects with full expectation. We're going to achieve results, mid-single digit or greater. 
So it's not kind of up, down or different. It's just that's what it's going to be mid-single digit or greater. And then we see opportunity to continue to expand with these new addressable markets we talked about. So that's philosophically how we think about it. It isn't kind of the ramp up, ramp down, ramp up, ramp down that others often talk about, ours is really mid-single digit or greater over time.  
But Eric got something from your standpoint as you think about this from the talent?"
119853,1684768416,2417975,"Aon plc, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2021",2021-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Aon plc","Executives","Yes. Maybe a different angle on it, too, is that when you think about Aon United model and how we actually interact with clients, essentially having a client leader who can bring all of the capability of the firm to a client, whether it's on the risk side",266,"Yes. Maybe a different angle on it, too, is that when you think about Aon United model and how we actually interact with clients, essentially having a client leader who can bring all of the capability of the firm to a client, whether it's on the risk side, whether it's on the wealth side or the health side, et cetera.  
That model is a team-based model, right? So it's less about hiring a person and then getting an immediate return, it's really around investing in the capability so that as we interact with clients, we can bring to them either existing solutions that we have today or as the teams work together and create new solutions together, where you're matching human capital and risk or reinsurance and health to try and create new ways to unlock value. That's less about I need 5 new people to get 5 new things.  
It's more on how do you invest consistently over time so that you have the expertise and you have the team-based culture that allows you to deliver that capability to a client in a way that nobody else can. That's what we're after, and that's what we've been building on over the last couple of years. 
So as Greg said, it's less about headcount up, head count down. It's around do you have the right culture, -- Do you have the right expertise and the right planning process so that we're able to interact with a client in a way where we can deliver something no one else can. That's the plan.

I'm joined by Christa Davies, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President. 
As in previous quarters, for your reference, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website.
We want to begin by thanking our 50,000 colleagues. 2021 continues to be a remarkable year. And as a result of our colleagues' hard work, dedication and perseverance, we've delivered outstanding results in Q3 and year-to-date. This performance is an extraordinary accomplishment and a direct result of their efforts, working together as one firm to bring the best of Aon to clients.
We're also proud to report that our client feedback continues to be outstanding, as net promoter scores are at a 5-year high. Additionally, Aon's colleague engagement is at the highest levels we've seen over the past decade, consistent with top quartile employers. This client feedback and colleague engagement are directly reflected in our firm's sustained momentum and financial performance.
In deep appreciation for all that our colleagues do for our clients and our firm, we were excited to establish in Q3 the Aon United growth ownership plan. This unique program rewards every colleague with a stock-based award to share in the current and future success of our firm, and we're thrilled to recognize and support our colleagues in this way.
Overall, as we reflect on Q3 and the first 9 months of 2021, our momentum, defined by client delivery, colleague engagement and financial results, is exceptional, even more promising as what we see in the opportunity ahead. Our conversations with clients reinforce substantial and growing unmet demand to support them in making better decisions to protect and grow their businesses in an increasingly volatile world. This opportunity to create new markets to serve our clients is the catalyst for our innovation agenda and a source of greater momentum in our business.
Focusing on financial performance in Q3, our global team delivered outstanding results across each of our key financial metrics, including 12% organic revenue growth, notably our strongest growth in over a decade for 2 quarters in a row, driven by mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth from every solution line, highlighted by particular strength in Health and Commercial Risk at 16% and 13%, respectively, and adjusted EPS growth of 14%. 
Year-to-date, our 9% organic revenue growth reflects mid-single-digit or greater organic growth from 3 of our 4 solution lines. Our Aon United strategy is delivering significant momentum in every solution line, with net new business generation and ongoing strong retention. We also saw double-digit growth for the second consecutive quarter in the more discretionary portions of our business such as transaction liability, human capital and project-related work within Commercial Risk Solutions and Health Solutions.
We continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth and margin expansion in the full year 2021, 2022 and over the long term as we continue to win share in our core business and execute to further expand our total addressable market.
As we move forward, we continue to be guided by our Aon United Blueprint, to ensure we're operating as a fully integrated global team capable of delivering the best of our firm in every local market. Today, we'd like to highlight how the core tenets of our blueprint drive momentum and deliver greater future opportunity. Specifically, how delivering Aon United is enabling core new business generation and fueling stronger retention; how Aon Business Services is building capability for colleagues and translating into better service for clients; how our ongoing focus on innovation at scale is accelerating the development of new solutions to serve unmet demand; and how our commitment to inclusive people leadership has resulted in the highest level of engagement and retention in over a decade.
First, executing Aon United is delivering net new business generation and ongoing strong retention by continuing to engage clients across all their needs within the entirety of our firm. This strategy has been built over many years and enables extraordinary solutions for clients, resulting in Aon winning more, growing our book of business with new and existing clients and, in turn, delivering exceptional results to shareholders.
Second, we've invested heavily in Aon Business Services, or ABS, over the past 5 years, which now represents the core operating platform that spans the entirety of the firm. ABS Centers of Excellence have and will continue to grow margins by driving efficiencies across all solution lines. Equally important, ABS capability enables us to improve client service delivery and scale innovation globally much faster, driving higher organic growth. The ABS model is redefining what we're capable of delivering to clients and improving the way we work.
Third, we continue to accelerate innovation at scale. AON is delivering innovative solutions to our clients by helping them navigate new forms of volatility, build resilient workforces, access new forms of capital and address the underserved through digital solutions, all of which substantially grow our total addressable market.
This has been demonstrated, for example, in intellectual property-backed financing, a first-of-its-kind option created and enabled by Aon's IP solutions team. Given the intellectual property represents 80-plus percent of the value of the S&P 500, we believe the entire IP category has the potential to be a $100 billion market over time. Other categories that represent new addressable markets in the tens of billions include cyber, climate, supply chain and digital client solutions, led by our exceptional team at CoverWallet.
Fundamentally, this opportunity to serve substantial new addressable markets is driven by client demand. At Aon, we relentlessly focused on the voice of the client, and we're hearing consistent client feedback about the need to make better decisions around long tail risks. For example, we're currently getting this guidance from the almost 3,500 clients that are currently participating in our regional Aon Insight series, and it's also being reinforced by 2 pieces of proprietary research that we recently released.
Every 2 years, Aon conducts our global risk management survey, and the latest report released 3 days ago was informed by insights from more than 2,300 clients across 16 industries spanning public and private organizations from 60 countries around the world. With more emphasis and reliance on technology, cyber risk topped the list as the #1 current and predicted future risk globally, its highest rank since the inception of the survey. The top 10 risks also reflect the impact COVID has had on organizations, as they needed to navigate volatility with better and faster decisions. We're seeing organizations shift focus from event-based to impact-based risk assessments, reflecting the shift in mindset following the systemic impact of the pandemic.
Aon also recently released results of a survey focused on 800 C-suite leaders and senior executives in the U.S., EU, U.K. and Canada to understand how organizations are preparing for and responding to the current environment. We found that, today, senior leaders are more astutely risk aware than ever before but remain confident to take on calculated risks in investments that build resiliency of their companies.
As we stated before, the approach to risk strategy has shifted from being generally defensive and risk averse to more opportunistic, taking a holistic integrated view as they seek solutions to address these challenges. There's great respect for the need to defend their businesses, but that's accompanied by a desire to find solutions that help them win as the IP financing example highlights. In this environment, we're uniquely positioned to deliver data-driven insights to help our clients make better decisions that grow their businesses.
Fourth and finally, we continue to see tremendous impact of our commitment to inclusive people leadership. Voluntary attrition is down substantially versus our 2019 baseline and our quarterly pulse of colleagues shows that we continue to enjoy all-time high engagement levels.
Many examples highlight our talent focus and priority, including our commitment to Aon Apprenticeship Program and a $30 million investment to create 10,000 new roles in the apprenticeship community; our investment in talent development, as over 14,000 Aon colleagues around the world have participated in training programs in the last 9 months alone; and the announcement of the Aon United growth ownership plan.
In summary, our global Aon team delivered the best third quarter results in over a decade. Our Aon United Blueprint, powered by our capability in Aon Business Services, combined with significant investment in new and growing categories of addressable client demand, reinforces the momentum we have today and offer even greater potential over the next few years. The result is clients that are better informed, better advised and equipped to make better decisions.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our financial results and our long-term outlook for continued shareholder value creation. Christa?"
119853,1684768416,2445425,"Aon plc, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2021",2021-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Aon plc","Executives","Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg highlighted, we delivered continued progress for both the quarter and year-to-date. Through the first 9 months of the year, we translated strong organic revenue growth into double-digit adjusted op",1204,"Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg highlighted, we delivered continued progress for both the quarter and year-to-date. Through the first 9 months of the year, we translated strong organic revenue growth into double-digit adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share growth, building on our momentum as we head into the last quarter of the year.
As I further reflect on our performance year-to-date, as Greg noted, organic revenue growth was 12% in the third quarter and 9% year-to-date, our strongest organic revenue growth in over a decade. We saw strong global macroeconomic conditions in the quarter, but we continue to assess 3 factors as we have since the beginning of the pandemic. Those factors are the virus and vaccine rollout, including the potential impacts of new variants; government stimulus; and overall GDP growth. These macroeconomic conditions do impact our clients in various areas of our business. 
Considering the current outlook for these factors, we continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth for the full year 2021, 2022 and over the long term. I would also note that total reported revenue was up 13% in Q3 and 12% year-to-date, including the favorable impact from changes in FX rates driven by a weaker U.S. dollar versus most currencies.
Moving to operating performance. First, I want to speak to the impact of our previously communicated repatterning expenses as compared to COVID-impacted expense in 2020, which I'll describe before any 2021 growth. As we've described, the timing of expenses is changing year-over-year such that $65 million of expenses moved into Q3 from Q4. This impact is due to the actions we took and highlighted in 2020 as we reduced discretionary expenses to be prepared for the impact of COVID-19 and potential macroeconomic distress.
In Q3, this repatterning negatively impacted margins by approximately 240 basis points, resulting in Q3 operating margin contraction of 30 basis points. Excluding this impact, margins would have expanded by 210 basis points in Q3 and 240 basis points year-to-date. A second key factor impacting adjusted margins has been the relative speed of revenue growth and investment.
In Q3, excluding the impact of the repatterning, our strong organic revenue growth significantly outpaced expense growth similar to Q2. We continue to evaluate investments using our return on invested capital framework in the areas of talent and business services and innovation to enable long-term growth. We expect that these areas of investment will continue to ramp up significantly during Q4.
In addition, we anticipate continued resumption of T&E and modest increases in real estate as more colleagues return to the office. Collectively, the headwind from expense repatterning and tailwind from slower investment as compared to revenue growth were the main factors driving 30 basis points of margin contraction in Q3 and 20 basis points of margin expansion year-to-date. Looking forward, as we've said historically, we expect to deliver full year margin expansion for 2021 and over the long term.
Turning back to the results in the quarter. We translated strong adjusted operating income growth into adjusted EPS growth of 14% in Q3 and 16% year-to-date. As noted in our earnings materials, FX translation was a favorable impact of approximately $0.02 per share in Q3 and $0.24 per share year-to-date. If currency is to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect an insignificant impact in Q4.
Excluding the costs associated with the termination of the combination with Willis Towers Watson-related costs, our performance and outlook for free cash flow in 2021 and going forward remains strong. Free cash flow decreased 40% year-to-date to $1.1 billion, as strong revenue growth was offset by the $1 billion termination fee payment and other related costs. Of the total $1.363 billion of termination fee and other related costs, a pretax amount, the $1 billion termination fee was paid in Q3 and approximately 2/3 of the remaining charges will be paid in 2021, with the majority of the balance paid in 2022.
We continue to expect to drive free cash flow over the long term, building on our long-term track record of 14% CAGR over the last 10 years based on operating income growth, working capital improvements and reduced structural uses of cash enabled by Aon Business Services.
As Greg highlighted, Aon Business Services not only drives efficiencies but also enables revenue opportunities and innovation at scale. As an example, through our integrated vendor management system in the U.S. last year, we were able to ensure that 5% of addressable vendor spend was with diverse suppliers, which is 2x higher than the Fortune 500 average. In addition to being a key initiative for Aon as part of our overall ESG strategy, this is also a way we can have an even bigger impact on what we deliver for clients in an Aon United way.
In the third quarter, we had an opportunity to engage with the biopharmaceutical clients looking to establish a supplier diversity program as part of their broader inclusion and diversity strategy. Given our demonstrated supply diversity expertise, our global spend management team and human capital colleagues came together to forge a new innovative solution based on this client's emerging need, which included establishing government structure and conducting research on peer and industry norms.
Given our outlook for long-term free cash flow growth, we expect share repurchase to continue to remain our highest return on capital opportunity for capital allocation. In the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 4.4 million shares for approximately $1.3 billion. We also expect to continue to invest organically and inorganically in innovative content and capabilities to address unmet client needs. Our M&A pipeline, centered around the 4 areas that Greg described, is focused on bringing innovative solutions to our clients' biggest challenges, delivered by the connectivity of Aon United.
I would also note that on October 1, we closed the previously announced sale of our retiree exchange business to Alight. In 2020, the retiree exchange generated $176 million of revenue, and it is a predominantly Q4 business.
Turning now to our balance sheet and debt capacity. We remained confident in the strength of our balance sheet and managed liquidity risk through a well-laddered debt maturity profile. In Q3, we issued $1 billion of senior notes as we return closer to historical leverage ratios while maintaining our current investment-grade credit ratings. Interest expense in the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately $85 million, reflecting our increased debt levels. Over the long term, we expect to return to our past practice of growing debt as EBITDA grows.
Further, I'd note that fourth quarter is our seasonally strongest quarter for free cash flow generation, and we intend to allocate this cash to our highest and best uses based on return on capital, which remains share repurchase.
In summary, strong top and bottom line performance for both the quarter and year-to-date reflect continued progress and momentum as we enter the last quarter of the year. We believe our disciplined approach to return on invested capital, combined with expected long-term free cash flow growth, will unlock substantial shareholder value creation over the long term.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions."

We do expect to generate strong free cash flow this year, and we expect free cash flow over the long term to be growing double digits. 
One of the things I'd note, Charlie, is if you start with the $2.6 billion of free cash flow straight off the GAAP cash flow statement in 2020, that's cash flow from operations less CapEx that equals $2.6 billion, you can grow that double digits, Charlie, and get yourself to a good starting point for 2022 free cash flow.

The clients make decisions based on their risk appetite, budget capacity, insurance options in the marketplace, et cetera, and each product essentially has its own dynamics, right? It has its own claim trends, it has its terms and conditions, retention/deductible, supply/demand, which markets are competing, et cetera. 
So we're coming out of probably a 24- to 36-month price increase environment. We're seeing a deceleration across the globe on the major products. You mentioned cyber, in particular. It's important to put that in scale in terms of the size and reach of the entirety of the insurance marketplace.
So it gets a lot of attention over the last couple of days I've heard as well. But the reality is, it's one product in an entire risk management portfolio that clients are managing against. And a lot of the energy that's going into cyber today is actually going into the consulting aspect of it, the risk management part or the post-event part as opposed to just the risk transfer, as the market is trying to get its right balance as to what is -- what's the right trading price, if you will, for risk transfer and what's covered in it and the like based on all the activity we've seen in ransomware and other things over the last couple of years. 
But keep it in context because, overall, the size and scale of what our clients are doing around the world, they're trying to make trade-offs and choices based on market conditions that have been more favorable to insurers than clients over the last couple of years. But ultimately, our role in that is to help them using our expertise, our analytics, our modeling capability to help them make those choices. But I would just say, I would keep cyber in context relative to the entirety of the marketplace."

And it's creating more opportunities for colleagues to be included globally, and we're utilizing this to bring the best talent and best expertise to clients.
And so for us, this is really about the future of work and how we position Aon in a new better scenario. So serving clients with the best talent and expertise, providing employees with flexibility and ensuring that they're productive and having a diverse and an inclusive workforce.

When a client is -- if it's a U.S.-based client and they want to talk about something that's happening in France, you just pop up the French team, and they can go direct to it and have that conversation.
Though, historically, that would have come from the team in France to the account exec in the U.S. and would have been talked about in the third person as opposed to just unlocking the global team, and it does a couple of things for us, one, it shows the power of the global company to a client; it also makes connections among our teams in a way where they're learning firsthand as well and so can repeat that learning. So you're absolutely right on everything you said, Christa, before, but it is -- there's an ability for us to really see and use the global connectivity in a way that historically had just been harder to do and do it on a more frequent basis.
And we have found over the last 18 months that the clients have really valued that access, being able to get right to the point of the expertise and be able to bring it and deliver it in a really easy way for the client to digest it and really build those relationships as well.
So we definitely are going to take those forward. That has been a real value part for us and something that we're going to bake into the model going forward."

When you talk about financial wellness and understanding, every colleague at Aon has a fidelity statement. Now every colleague at Aon actually has a piece of the firm, can watch and see what happens, engage in a discussion around how this works, the mechanics of it, all the nuances of it. It's really -- it's been fantastic.
And in essence, in many respects, they're getting a chance to see the firm in a way they haven't seen it before. So beyond kind of the aspect of the -- sort of the wealth creation aspect of it, really, the financial wellness aspect of it has been absolutely fantastic.

Essentially, we talked about mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth across all of our solution lines. And that's where we are, and that's where we have achieved and continue to achieve, and that's what we're anticipating for next year, the year after and the coming year.
So look for that. That's the benchmark in terms of where we are. We really don't look at it in the same way. Maybe I'll just describe this idea of quarter-to-quarter and, of course, get a return. We really look at overall how we support our colleagues, the talent strategy of our firm, how we both bring them in and develop with them, but also how we develop our current set of colleagues who come in and are part of Aon over time.
And that's sort of new hires, but it's also, I think, about our apprenticeship program. Our apprentice program has been an amazing investment and opportunity over the last number of years. We started this in 2017 as an example. In Chicago, we now have 15 employers engaged in the apprenticeship network with 1,000 apprentices in Chicago. We made this investment across North America. We've copied what's been done across Europe. We've been recognized, even Fortune recognized sort of what we've done in terms of sort of the impact this is going to have. 
And all I'm trying to highlight, Weston, on the topic of talent, it's central to Aon. And we develop it in a very specific way. I talked about 14,000 Aon colleagues in the last 9 months alone really going through training programs that help our colleagues continue to evolve as professionals help serve clients in an environment which becomes more complex. That is the way we approach the market in all angles and all aspects. With full expectation, we're going to achieve results, mid-single digit or greater.
So it's not kind of up, down or different. It's just that's what it's going to be, mid-single digit or greater. And then we see opportunity to continue to expand with these new addressable markets we talked about. So that's philosophically how we think about it. It isn't kind of the ramp up, ramp down, ramp up, ramp down that others often talk about. Ours is really mid-single digit or greater over time.
But Eric, thoughts on, from your standpoint, as you think about this from the talent?"
119853,1684768416,2445425,"Aon plc, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2021",2021-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Aon plc","Executives","Yes. Maybe a different angle on it, too, is that when you think about our Aon United model and how we actually interact with clients, essentially having a client leader who can bring all of the capability of the firm to a client, whether it's on the risk",266,"Yes. Maybe a different angle on it, too, is that when you think about our Aon United model and how we actually interact with clients, essentially having a client leader who can bring all of the capability of the firm to a client, whether it's on the risk side, whether it's on the wealth side or the health side, et cetera, that model is a team-based model, right?
So it's less about hiring a person and then getting an immediate return. It's really around investing in the capability so that as we interact with clients, we can bring to them either existing solutions that we have today or as the teams work together and create new solutions together, where you're matching human capital and risk or reinsurance and health to try and create new ways to unlock value. That's less about I need 5 new people to get 5 new things. It's more around how do you invest consistently over time so that you have the expertise and you have the team-based culture that allows you to deliver that capability to a client in a way that nobody else can. That's what we're after, and that's what we've been building on over the last couple of years.
So as Greg said, it's less about headcount up, head count down. It's around do you have the right culture, do you have the right expertise and the right planning process so that we're able to interact with a client in a way where we can deliver something no one else can. That's the play.
Christa, anything you'd add?"
