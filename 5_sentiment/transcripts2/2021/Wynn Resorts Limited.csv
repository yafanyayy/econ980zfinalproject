We clearly made progress in the fourth quarter this year as all of our properties were actually EBITDA positive. It's a real testament to the team. The way we've been able to streamline our cost structure and take more of the revenue to the EBITDA line. And in fact, I think our company is in the best position it's ever been in to translate revenue into EBITDA as more of the business comes back. Because it's going to. We continue to anticipate that we're going to see growth month-over-month in each of our markets, and we are well positioned with the way that we've streamlined our business. 
If you look at Macau, we generated $39 million of EBITDA for the quarter. And Macau is continuing to see progress. The government there has been very thoughtful and very cautious as to the way that it's been allowing people into Macau. And we feel confident that, that growth is going to continue. 
One of the positives of 2020 was that we've been able to spend a lot of time thinking about the future of Macau, and really what the growth drivers are going to be going forward. And it's crystal clear that the growth drivers for Macau are really the sweet spot of our company, and that's the premium segment, premium mass, in particular. So we spent a lot of time reconfiguring our properties over the last 6 months to cater to that customer. We've turned restaurants, the buffet into a hotpot restaurant. We've taken Michelin Star restaurants and created a more premium mass environment. In fact, we've taken some of our large villas that we don't anticipate we will be using for the junket business, and we've turned them into entertainment facilities for the premium mass customer. That customer is going to lead Macau back, and we are well positioned to take a disproportionate share of that business. And we think that it's going to continue to improve month-over-month. And our team is positioned to focus on the premium mass segment. 
Moving to North America. In Las Vegas, we made roughly $21 million of EBITDA for the quarter and $14 million of that came in October. So in October, we were seeing some green shoots, I think, as most of the country was before the ramp-up of the COVID number sort of around the country. And the restrictions kicked back in. They kicked back in in Nevada and in our key markets in California, New York and other places, and we saw a real decline in business after October. As an example, in October, we were booking roughly 1,650 rooms per night for future bookings, and with a couple of weeks after that into November and December, that number fell to 700, 700 rooms per night. And that continued into January. However, we've seen just in the last 10 days, an uptick again. And it's right in line with the COVID numbers sort of around the country, decreasing. 
It's clear that people are ready to have fun. They're ready to travel, but they're still not quite sure if it's time. We've seen our rooms -- booking rooms per night go back up to almost 1,600 from 800 in November and December, just in the last 10 days. In fact, for Super Bowl, we're going to be at almost 50% occupancy, the first time since October with over 1,000 casino customers coming, which is significantly more than we had for New Year's Eve. 
So while there's still a long way to go in Las Vegas, we can tell that as people become more and more -- feeling more safe, they're ready to travel and they're ready to have fun. And we're ready to create that experience. In fact, we've built multiple restaurants in Las Vegas during this period that we haven't opened. So we're going to be opening new restaurants this year as the restrictions continue to lift. Just to remind everybody, we built a 400,000 square foot convention center that opened at the beginning of last year that we've never used. And so we have lots of new products, exciting stuff that we've been working on all throughout 2020  that we'll be able to launch as business comes back. And if you look at the convention space, there's a lot of questions about it, obviously. We have roughly 170,000 room nights -- convention room nights on the books for the third quarter and fourth quarter of this year, which is about the same as what we had in 2019. Now clearly, I expect some wash out of that. We haven't seen massive cancellations yet, but I'm sure that there will be cancellations. But we're doing everything we can to keep that business and to create additional business. 
As an example, we opened the first in Nevada, a private partnership with UMC vaccination destination -- vaccination center. We're vaccinating between 500 and 700 people a day in our Encore ballroom. And this month, we'll be opening our COVID testing lab, which is a PCR-based lab that will have the ability to process between 5,000 and 7,000 tests a day. That opens this month. 
And the idea is that when we talk to groups or when we're talking to the state leaders about entertainment, about nightclubs, about conventions, that will have the ability for customers to have a health passport, whereby they can say and show that they've been vaccinated or they've been tested in our lab on site, and it's been turned around within 6 hours. So you know everybody in your space, everybody in this convention area has either tested negative for covid or has been vaccinated. I think that, that's going to be a real advantage for us going forward to keep these groups on and to attract additional business as we see the restrictions, hopefully, continue to lift as vaccines roll out, and we're very hopeful that by this summer, we're really starting to see a lot more people traveling to Las Vegas. 
Looking at Massachusetts, Encore Boston Harbor. We made about $16.7 million in EBITDA for the quarter. And again, same story as Las Vegas, $11 million of that in October. As the numbers ticked up -- the COVID numbers ticked up in Massachusetts, the restrictions rightfully kicked in. And there, we actually had to close Encore Boston Harbor at 9 o'clock at night, beginning in November into January. But just recently, because their numbers have been going down, and their positivity rates are looking quite good in Massachusetts. We've been able to reopen 24/7 in Massachusetts. And today, the governor actually announced additional lifting of certain restrictions, moving occupancy percentages for restaurants and other places up from 25% to 40%. 
And there are some interesting things about the Massachusetts gaming environment that I think will provide additional short-term growth as restrictions are lifted. For example, we've never been able to open craps there. There's a big demand for craps, but that has not been allowed to date, and we're hopeful that, that will be allowed quite soon. 
On the table game side, we are capacity constrained on the weekends, in particular now that we're offering -- now that we're open 24/7. But we only have 3 seats on a table game, whereas I think almost all other jurisdictions around the company -- around the country are at 4 seats. And so we're quite hopeful that some of those things and those restrictions will continue to lift as, again, the vaccinations roll out and the numbers look good. 
The trends at Encore Boston Harbor are quite strong. We -- our margins should be quite good there. And we're very optimistic about the future of our business at Encore Boston Harbor. 
Now looking at Wynn Interactive. So Wynn Interactive, we're very excited about. And I know that everybody is talking about the online business as they should be. Just looking at the 5 states that we're legal and offering online gaming and online sports betting in November and December, if you run rate those numbers, just in those 5 states, it's roughly a $4 billion to $5 billion market just in those states. So that's quite an opportunity. And if you think about all of the other states that will likely be rolling out sports betting and maybe some online gaming, clearly, this totable addressable market is quite large. It's multiples more than it is now. And it's one that we are very focused on. 
We bought BetBull in November. We've consolidated it. We've added over 100 people to the team. Recently, we recently launched in Michigan and in Colorado. And our gaming revenues have increased more than 50% since our last call, and we're currently on a run rate of about $50 million in our Wynn Interactive business. 
And so the way we look at this is because each state will take time to roll out, that's actually a benefit for us. We have the brand. We're releasing new features on our product every week. We're beefing up our team. We have some very exciting media deals and partnership deals that we're working on. And as we build our strength and build our brand campaign and roll out in these states, we think we're going to be in a very good position by the back half of this year as the NFL season kicks off again. So Wynn Interactive is a big focus of ours, and we're seeing all the right things that we were hoping that we would see right now, in particular, with the revenues growing almost 50% over the last 3 months. 
So with that, I'm going to go ahead and turn it over to Craig to talk a little bit more [Audio Gap]."
3449701,702753009,2192467,"Wynn Resorts, Limited, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2021",2021-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Wynn Resorts, Limited","Executives","Thanks, Matt. Similar to the past few calls, I'd like to start with a few points on liquidity and operating expense. As of January 31, our global cash and liquidity position was $3.39 billion. In Macau, we had approximately $2.24 billion of available liqu",702,"Thanks, Matt. Similar to the past few calls, I'd like to start with a few points on liquidity and operating expense. As of January 31, our global cash and liquidity position was $3.39 billion. In Macau, we had approximately $2.24 billion of available liquidity as of January 31. In the U.S., we had total available liquidity of approximately $1.15 billion on January 31 with a substantially lower daily cash burn globally compared to Q3 2020. 
Meanwhile,  we can be focused on operating expenses. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, our global property and corporate operating expenses per day, excluding gaming tax, of $4.6 million, decreased nearly 40% year-over-year compared to $7.6 million in Q4 '19, with our FTE count decreasing by approximately 8,700 or 34%. We expect a meaningful portion of these savings to drive operating leverage as business volumes return. 
In Macau, as Matt noted, we generated $39.4 million of EBITDA in the quarter with particular strength around the December holiday season. Our EBITDA was driven by encouraging gaming and non-gaming performance as well as a continued focus on cost controls. Gross gaming revenue in Q4 2020 was approximately 32% of Q4 2019 levels, led by the premium mass segment. 
With respect to cost controls, our OpEx, again, excluding gaming tax, was $2.2 million per day. This is down from approximately $3 million per day in Q4 '19 and only up modestly from $2 million per day in Q3 '20, due primarily to in variable costs as business volumes return. 
At Wynn Las Vegas, we generated $21 million of adjusted property EBITDA from a business that remains heavily weighted to weakened occupancy. In the casino, we saw broad-based strength across key segments with slot handle in [indiscernible] reaching 85% and 72% of Q4 2019 levels, respectively, during the quarter. 
We remain focused on cost discipline in Las Vegas with our OpEx per day, excluding gaming taxes, decreasing to $1.6 million per day in Q4 2020 from $3 million per day in Q4 2019, and from $1.8 million per day in Q3 2020. 
As Matt noted, as COVID accelerated and holiday trouble was discouraged around the already seasonally challenging holiday period, the back half of the quarter was weaker than the front. In this environment of suppressed demand, we expect 1Q '21 performance overall to be subdued, but we do expect pockets of strong demand in February, as Matt mentioned, around Super Bowl and President's Day weekend. We believe that a combination of meaningful permanent costs saves, along with increased group demand position as well to accelerate our recovery as we move into the back half of '21. 
In Boston, as noted on the Q3 call and by Matt just now, we generated record adjusted property EBITDA of [indiscernible] in October, but curtailed operating hours stemming from the state stay-at-home order negatively impacted EBITDA during November and December. We were pleased by the recent decision to lift state-at-home orders, and we are now picking up where we left off in October. 
Similar to Las Vegas, we've remained very disciplined on the cost side with OpEx per day, excluding gaming tax, of $680,000 in Q4 2020 compared to $1.3 million a day in Q4 2019 and $750,000 per day in Q3 2020. 
Turning to Wynn Interactive. Our 72% owned online gaming and sports betting subsidiary continues [indiscernible] to advancing an online casino strategy with current annualized run rate gross gaming revenue of around $50 million based on results in January and early February. Wynn Bet -- our online -- our U.S. online sports betting and casino gaming application has now been live in New Jersey several months, and we recently launched in Colorado and Michigan. As Matt mentioned, we are simultaneously scaling operations, improving our brand positioning, making product improvements and launching in new states. 
We continue to see growth in the business with much of that growth back-half loaded, particularly as we enter the 2021 NFL season. 
Our CapEx in the quarter was $29 million. As noted last quarter, the vast majority of our CapEx plans remain on hold, and we are only proceeding with our highest priority projects. 
With that, operator, we will now open up the call to Q&A."

And quite frankly, there was there was a lot of anticipation about Chinese New Year. And clearly, we had a number of outbreaks in China during January, late December and January that have curtailed a lot of travel and understandably, the authorities and the PRC have been working hard to contain the outbreaks. The cases have dropped from the 100s to the teens. So that's very positive, but it has impacted the booking cycle for Chinese New Year. We do have a lot of player interest still in Chinese New Year. We have a number of our bigger players reserving suites and villas, and they will potentially travel, but certainly, it's affected bookings throughout town. So we're probably looking at more like an October Golden Week situation than the Christmas and Western New Year period. However, we believe that it's a temporary setback -- a very temporary setback as winter is ending. The recent outbreak [indiscernible] vaccines are starting to get rolled out. They're getting rolled out, obviously by the millions in China, but locally in Macau, we've just received our first delivery of 100,000 vaccines. And in late March, we have a further delivery and distribution of another 100,000 for a small population. 
In terms of visas opening up more and more people being allowed access into Macau, that's obviously very fluid and very linked to containment in China. But there has behind the scenes being a pickup in #1 optimism; and number two, discussions between the authorities and the Greater Bay area between Hong Kong, the PRC and Macau about the reestablishment of a travel bubble. So people are looking to the future. There is light at the end of the tunnel. This is a temporary setback. 
Cadences, frankly, demand is out there. And we're priming our properties to take full advantage of that. We command a luxury sector, and we believe that we're ready to take more than our fair market share. We proved in Q4, we built market share up to nearly 16%. And we believe that there is more market share for us to take, particularly given that we've commanded the luxury sector, and those are the customers that are coming back."

But what you know about our business, Joe, is where we do not need 50,000 people a day walking through our facilities to get back to our EBITDA targets.

So we're making -- we're doing product drops really every 2 weeks. And our focus there is making sure that we can achieve market parity in order to do that. And so I would say that's our number 1 focus, and it consumes 40% of our time on Wynn Interactive. 
Then the other key components, as you rightly point out, are kind of 2 parts of marketing, performance marketing, where you're actually kind of driving installs through ad networks, through Facebook, et cetera. And we certainly have begun to hit the gas on that component of our marketing, because you can do it in a very targeted way. 
The second component of marketing is really third-party relationships and third-party partnerships, mass media, if you will. And that's a little bit of a chicken or the egg. Because before you engage in large-scale mass media, you want to make sure that your product is where you want it to be. And for us, that's a high standard given our brand. And you want to make sure that you're in enough states to where any bleed that you're experiencing into states where it's not legal, is acceptable. And so you should expect to see a lot more from us on the third-party mass media marketing side over the course of 2021, but we're doing performance marketing today in order to begin to scale the product."

Thanks for joining us. We clearly made progress in the fourth quarter this year as all of our properties were actually EBITDA positive. It's a real testament to the team.

We clearly made progress in the fourth quarter this year as all of our properties were actually EBITDA positive. It's a real testament to the team. The way we've been able to streamline our cost structure and take more of the revenue to the EBITDA line. And in fact, I think our company is in the best position it's ever been in to translate revenue into EBITDA as more of the business comes back. Because it's going to. We continue to anticipate that we're going to see growth month-over-month in each of our markets, and we are well positioned with the way that we've streamlined our business. 
If you look at Macau, we generated $39 million of EBITDA for the quarter. And Macau is continuing to see progress. The government there has been very thoughtful and very cautious as to the way that it's been allowing people into Macau. And we feel confident that, that growth is going to continue. 
One of the positives of 2020 was that we've been able to spend a lot of time thinking about the future of Macau, and really what the growth drivers are going to be going forward. And it's crystal clear that the growth drivers for Macau are really the sweet spot of our company, and that's the premium segment, premium mass, in particular. So we spent a lot of time reconfiguring our properties over the last 6 months to cater to that customer. We've turned restaurants, the buffet into a hotpot restaurant. We've taken Michelin Star restaurants and created a more premium mass environment. In fact, we've taken some of our large villas that we don't anticipate we will be using for the junket business, and we've turned them into entertainment facilities for the premium mass customer. That customer is going to lead Macau back, and we are well positioned to take a disproportionate share of that business. And we think that it's going to continue to improve month-over-month. And our team is positioned to focus on the premium mass segment. 
Moving to North America. In Las Vegas, we made roughly $21 million of EBITDA for the quarter and $14 million of that came in October. So in October, we were seeing some green shoots, I think, as most of the country was before the ramp-up of the COVID number sort of around the country. And the restrictions kicked back in. They kicked back in in Nevada and in our key markets in California, New York and other places, and we saw a real decline in business after October. As an example, in October, we were booking roughly 1,650 rooms per night for future bookings, and with a couple of weeks after that into November and December, that number fell to 700, 700 rooms per night. And that continued into January. However, we've seen just in the last 10 days, an uptick again. And it's right in line with the COVID numbers sort of around the country, decreasing. 
It's clear that people are ready to have fun. They're ready to travel, but they're still not quite sure if it's time. We've seen our rooms -- booking rooms per night go back up to almost 1,600 from 800 in November and December, just in the last 10 days. In fact, for Super Bowl, we're going to be at almost 50% occupancy, the first time since October with over 1,000 casino customers coming, which is significantly more than we had for New Year's Eve. 
So while there's still a long way to go in Las Vegas, we can tell that as people become more and more -- feeling more safe, they're ready to travel and they're ready to have fun. And we're ready to create that experience. In fact, we've built multiple restaurants in Las Vegas during this period that we haven't opened. So we're going to be opening new restaurants this year as the restrictions continue to lift. Just to remind everybody, we built a 400,000 square foot convention center that opened at the beginning of last year that we've never used. And so we have lots of new products, exciting stuff that we've been working on all throughout 2020  that we'll be able to launch as business comes back. And if you look at the convention space, there's a lot of questions about it, obviously. 
We have roughly 170,000 room nights -- convention room nights on the books for the third quarter and fourth quarter of this year, which is about the same as what we had in 2019. Now clearly, I expect some wash out of that. We haven't seen massive cancellations yet, but I'm sure that there will be cancellations. But we're doing everything we can to keep that business and to create additional business. 
As an example, we opened the first in Nevada, a private partnership with UMC vaccination destination -- vaccination center. We're vaccinating between 500 and 700 people a day in our Encore ballroom. And this month, we'll be opening our COVID testing lab, which is a PCR-based lab that will have the ability to process between 5,000 and 7,000 tests a day. That opens this month. 
And the idea is that when we talk to groups or when we're talking to the state leaders about entertainment, about nightclubs, about conventions, that will have the ability for customers to have a health passport, whereby they can say and show that they've been vaccinated or they've been tested in our lab on site, and it's been turned around within 6 hours. So you know everybody in your space, everybody in this convention area has either tested negative for covid or has been vaccinated. I think that, that's going to be a real advantage for us going forward to keep these groups on and to attract additional business as we see the restrictions, hopefully, continue to lift as vaccines roll out, and we're very hopeful that by this summer, we're really starting to see a lot more people traveling to Las Vegas. 
Looking at Massachusetts, Encore Boston Harbor. We made about $16.7 million in EBITDA for the quarter. And again, same story as Las Vegas, $11 million of that in October. As the numbers ticked up -- the COVID numbers ticked up in Massachusetts, the restrictions rightfully kicked in. And there, we actually had to close Encore Boston Harbor at 9 o'clock at night, beginning in November into January. But just recently, because their numbers have been going down, and their positivity rates are looking quite good in Massachusetts. We've been able to reopen 24/7 in Massachusetts. And today, the governor actually announced additional lifting of certain restrictions, moving occupancy percentages for restaurants and other places up from 25% to 40%. 
And there are some interesting things about the Massachusetts gaming environment that I think will provide additional short-term growth as restrictions are lifted. For example, we've never been able to open craps there. There's a big demand for craps, but that has not been allowed to date, and we're hopeful that, that will be allowed quite soon. 
On the table game side, we are capacity constrained on the weekends, in particular now that we're offering -- now that we're open 24/7. But we only have 3 seats on a table game, whereas I think almost all other jurisdictions around the company -- around the country are at 4 seats. And so we're quite hopeful that some of those things and those restrictions will continue to lift as, again, the vaccinations roll out and the numbers look good. 
The trends at Encore Boston Harbor are quite strong. We -- our margins should be quite good there. And we're very optimistic about the future of our business at Encore Boston Harbor. 
Now looking at Wynn Interactive. So Wynn Interactive, we're very excited about. And I know that everybody is talking about the online business as they should be. Just looking at the 5 states that we're legal and offering online gaming and online sports betting in November and December, if you run rate those numbers, just in those 5 states, it's roughly a $4 billion to $5 billion market just in those states. So that's quite an opportunity. And if you think about all of the other states that will likely be rolling out sports betting and maybe some online gaming, clearly, this totable addressable market is quite large. It's multiples more than it is now. And it's one that we are very focused on. 
We bought BetBull in November. We've consolidated it. We've added over 100 people to the team. Recently, we recently launched in Michigan and in Colorado. And our gaming revenues have increased more than 50% since our last call, and we're currently on a run rate of about $50 million in our Wynn Interactive business. 
And so the way we look at this is because each state will take time to roll out, that's actually a benefit for us. We have the brand. We're releasing new features on our product every week. We're beefing up our team. We have some very exciting media deals and partnership deals that we're working on. And as we build our strength and build our brand campaign and roll out in these states, we think we're going to be in a very good position by the back half of this year as the NFL season kicks off again. So Wynn Interactive is a big focus of ours, and we're seeing all the right things that we were hoping that we would see right now, in particular, with the revenues growing almost 50% over the last 3 months. 
So with that, I'm going to go ahead and turn it over to Craig to talk a little bit more about the numbers."

Similar to the past few calls, I'd like to start with a few points on liquidity and operating expense. As of January 31, our global cash and liquidity position was $3.39 billion.

As of January 31, our global cash and liquidity position was $3.39 billion. In Macau, we had approximately $2.24 billion of available liquidity as of January 31. In the U.S., we had total available liquidity of approximately $1.15 billion on January 31 with a substantially lower daily cash burn globally compared to Q3 2020. 
Meanwhile,  we continue to be focused on operating expenses. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, our global property and corporate operating expenses per day, excluding gaming tax, of $4.6 million, decreased nearly 40% year-over-year compared to $7.6 million in Q4 '19, with our FTE count decreasing by approximately 8,700 or 34%. We expect a meaningful portion of these savings to drive operating leverage as business volumes return. 
In Macau, as Matt noted, we generated $39.4 million of EBITDA in the quarter with particular strength around the December holiday season. Our EBITDA was driven by encouraging gaming and non-gaming performance as well as a continued focus on cost controls. Gross gaming revenue in Q4 2020 was approximately 32% of Q4 2019 levels, led by the premium mass segment. 
With respect to cost controls, our OpEx, again, excluding gaming tax, was $2.2 million per day. This is down from approximately $3 million per day in Q4 '19 and only up modestly from $2 million per day in Q3 '20, due primarily to in variable costs as business volumes return. 
At Wynn Las Vegas, we generated $21 million of adjusted property EBITDA from a business that remains heavily weighted to weakened occupancy. In the casino, we saw broad-based strength across key segments with slot handle and table reaching 85% and 72% of Q4 2019 levels, respectively, during the quarter. 
We remain focused on cost discipline in Las Vegas with our OpEx per day, excluding gaming taxes, decreasing to $1.6 million per day in Q4 2020 from $3 million per day in Q4 2019, and from $1.8 million per day in Q3 2020. 
As Matt noted, as COVID accelerated and holiday trouble was discouraged around the already seasonally challenging holiday period, the back half of the quarter was weaker than the front. In this environment of suppressed demand, we expect 1Q '21 performance overall to be subdued, but we do expect pockets of strong demand in February, as Matt mentioned, around Super Bowl and President's Day weekend. We believe that a combination of meaningful permanent costs saves, along with increased group demand position as well to accelerate our recovery as we move into the back half of '21. 
In Boston, as noted on the Q3 call and by Matt just now, we generated record adjusted property EBITDA of $11.3 million in October, but curtailed operating hours stemming from the state stay-at-home order negatively impacted EBITDA during November and December. We were pleased by the recent decision to lift stay-at-home orders, and we are now picking up where we left off in October. 
Similar to Las Vegas, we've remained very disciplined on the cost side with OpEx per day, excluding gaming tax, of $680,000 in Q4 2020 compared to $1.3 million per day in Q4 2019 and $750,000 per day in Q3 2020. 
Turning to Wynn Interactive. Our 72% owned online gaming and sports betting subsidiary continues to advance our sports betting and online casino strategy with current annualized run rate gross gaming revenue of around $50 million based on results in January and early February. Wynn Bet -- our online -- our U.S. online sports betting and casino gaming application has now been live in New Jersey several months, and we recently launched in Colorado and Michigan. As Matt mentioned, we are simultaneously scaling operations, improving our brand positioning, making product improvements and launching in new states. 
We continue to see growth in the business with much of that growth back-half loaded, particularly as we enter the 2021 NFL season. 
Our CapEx in the quarter was $29 million. As noted last quarter, the vast majority of our CapEx plans remain on hold, and we are only proceeding with our highest priority projects. 
With that, operator, we will now open up the call to Q&A."

And quite frankly, there was there was a lot of anticipation about Chinese New Year. And clearly, we had a number of outbreaks in China during January, late December and January that have curtailed a lot of travel and understandably, the authorities and the PRC have been working hard to contain the outbreaks. 
The cases have dropped from the hundreds to the teens. So that's very positive, but it has impacted the booking cycle for Chinese New Year. We do have a lot of player interest still in Chinese New Year. We have a number of our bigger players reserving suites and villas, and they will potentially travel, but certainly, it's affected bookings throughout town. So we're probably looking at more like an October Golden Week situation than the Christmas and Western New Year period. However, we believe that it's a temporary setback -- a very temporary setback as winter is ending. The recent outbreaks have been contained, and vaccines are starting to get rolled out. They're getting rolled out, obviously by the millions in China, but locally in Macau, we've just received our first delivery of 100,000 vaccines. And in late March, we have a further delivery and distribution of another 100,000 for a small population. 
In terms of visas opening up more and more people being allowed access into Macau, that's obviously very fluid and very linked to containment in China. But there has behind the scenes being a pickup in number 1 optimism; and number two, discussions between the authorities and the Greater Bay area between Hong Kong, the PRC and Macau about the reestablishment of a travel bubble. So people are looking to the future. There is light at the end of the tunnel. This is a temporary setback. 
Cadences, frankly, demand is out there. And we're priming our properties to take full advantage of that. We command a luxury sector, and we believe that we're ready to take more than our fair market share. We proved in Q4, we built market share up to nearly 16%. And we believe that there is more market share for us to take, particularly given that we've commanded the luxury sector, and those are the customers that are coming back."

I was on the phone on a Zoom call actually with someone in Shanghai last night, who was just talking about, it's life as usual. I mean we're back, we're going to clubs, we're going out. They are really ready to travel and go to Macau. And so there's a real sense of optimism when you're talking to people in China. 
And we are very well positioned for that customer. That is the premium segment. Yes, the premium segment did better than the core mass segment. I don't want to get into the exact numbers, but it was not down 50% as the overall mass was. But what you know about our business, Joe, is where we do not need 50,000 people a day walking through our facilities to get back to our EBITDA targets. We require significantly less people, because we cater to the higher-end customer. And those are going to be the customers, in our opinion, that are going to be traveling first. They're going to be the ones that are coming back first. And we're targeting that segment.

The second component of marketing is really third-party relationships and third-party partnerships, mass media, if you will. And that's a little bit of a chicken or the egg. Because before you engage in large-scale mass media, you want to make sure that your product is where you want it to be. And for us, that's a high standard given our brand.

As we've been thinking about onli",1206,"Thanks, Craig, and good afternoon, everyone.
Before we dive right into the quarter results, I'd like to first talk about how excited we are to announce the merger of Wynn Interactive into the Austerlitz Acquisition Corp. As we've been thinking about online sports betting in the iGaming space over the last few years, we knew that we had to stick to what we do, which is build great product and provide the best customer service. Wynn Interactive is now a company with over 300 people. We have some luminaries from European gaming, people co-founders of BeWynn, that are responsible for a lot of the product that we're developing in this 300-person team.
And as we look out into the future, and we realize this is likely going to be as large as the commercial casino revenue opportunity of $40 billion over the next 5-plus years which, by the way, that's typically about how long it takes to build one of our bricks-and-mortar properties, around 5 years, we knew that this was an opportunity that we had to capitalize on. And so as we explored various options, it became very clear that creating a purely public company, in partnership with Bill Foley, one of the most renowned investors in the United States, was clearly the right thing to do to create those value for the Wynn Resort shareholders and for the Wynn Interactive shareholders.
Bill, just for those of you that don't know, has created over $100 billion in shareholder value during his investing career, $100 billion. He's the owner of a professional sports team. He owns luxury hospitality assets around the country. He recently completed the successful Day Safe, a digital payments company that is now getting into the digital gaming space. So partnering with Bill and our team of 300 people and thinking about the product roadmap and the marketing dollars and -- that we're going to invest to ensure that we're winners in this space felt like the exact right thing to do, and we're very excited to have $640 million of committed capital injected into this company to launch this venture.
We'll be posting a presentation online after this call that has a lot more details around this merger, and we'll be spending time after this call talking about it.
With that, I'm going to go ahead and turn over to our quarterly results. And what we've been seeing in our properties in Macau, Las Vegas and in Boston has been a very similar story, momentum each month continuing to accelerate. As an example, in Macau, we generated $43.9 million of EBITDA in the first quarter, but it's moving so fast over there I feel like talking about what we're seeing now is more relevant than what we experienced in the first quarter as we saw strength continue into February and in March. So that momentum continued in April and in May.
And in fact, during the Golden Week, which is the first week of May in Macau, we experienced and generated $3 million of normalized EBITDA per day during Golden Week. By far, the highest amount of normalized profit that we've been able to generate since the onset of the pandemic at the beginning of 2020. Even with the junket volumes continuing to fluctuate between 25% and 30% of Golden Week 2019, we were able to achieve these results because we focused our business on mass and premium mass. And as we talked about in previous calls, we've been converting space that was previously for VIP into premium mass space, and we feel very comfortable and confident with our position in the Macau market.
In fact, we generated 76% of our mass volumes during the Golden Week this year compared to Golden Week in 2019. Our hotel occupancy during Golden Week was 93%. In retail, which is continuing to be a shining star across our portfolio in North America and Macau, was up 80% over the Golden Week numbers in 2019. Going forward, in May and into June, we do expect that May, we'll continue to see acceleration over the April results. And we are very, very excited about the summer and what's going to come in Macau. Just seeing the earnings power over Golden Week and understanding where the Chinese consumer is headed and what our position in that market is makes us more confident in our position in Macau in the Macau market and our future development opportunities in and around Wynn Palace to continue to build on what we do best and to grow our top line and our bottom line in Macau.
Moving to North America in Las Vegas. Again, we've seen very encouraging trends. We generated $28 million in EBITDA in the first quarter. And what we really saw was right around March madness was when the volumes began to pick up in the first quarter, and that has accelerated. As an example, in the month of April, our RevPAR, which is where we're really focused, has increased 50%, 5-0, over the first quarter results. Retail revenues in the month of April were the second best month on record. From 2005 until April of 2021, it's the second best month on record. And what's even more encouraging and much more than a green shoot, but a clear indication of the roaring consumer that's coming back, our slot revenues in April were $25 million which was a property record, more than any other month in the history of Wynn Las Vegas.
So you take those things that we're already seeing in Las Vegas and looking at quarter-to-date, our EBITDA has already exceeded the first quarter in Las Vegas. Our weekends going forward are in the 90s in terms of hotel occupancy. And we're really focused on pricing and pricing power. Our group business is holding on and looking actually quite strong for the back half of the year. In fact, just last week, we hosted our first large group of 600 people, and it went off without a hitch. People are so happy to be back. Conventions work, customers are excited and as more restrictions are lifted and we're able to really start to roll out our entertainment and our night clubs and do what we do best, we think that Las Vegas' opportunity is really unique, and the best times are ahead.
Moving to Boston at Encore Boston Harbor. We achieved record EBITDA of $30 million for the quarter. And that's even with restricted operating hours and quite significant COVID restrictions in the month of January. And that trend has continued. In fact, in the second quarter, thus far, our daily EBITDA is up 30-plus percent compared to the first quarter. Encore Boston Harbor is hitting on all cylinders right now. We've been able to really rationalize the cost, run the building much more efficiently and focus on our casino customers and being the top super regional casino in the Northeast. I believe that Encore Boston Harbor is going to continue to grow quarter-over-quarter throughout this year as that property and that management team are really doing an amazing job.
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Craig to provide more details on the quarter."

As Matt noted, our Macau operations delivered $43.9 million of EBITDA in the quarter on $417 million of operating revenue.

As Matt noted, our Macau operations delivered $43.9 million of EBITDA in the quarter on $417 million of operating revenue. Our EBITDA was driven by encouraging gaming and nongaming performance combined with solid cost controls. Gross gaming revenue per day in 1Q '21 was approximately 34% of Q4 2019, led by the premium mass segment with particular strength in March. As Matt mentioned, this strength continued into April as mass drop reached $16.8 million per day or 59% of Q4 2019 or a 26% increase compared to 1Q 2021 levels. Our 1Q 2021 results in Macau were positively impacted by higher-than-normal table games hold that increased EBITDA by approximately $10 million to $15 million from a normalized level.
With respect to cost controls, our OpEx, excluding gaming tax, was $2.2 million per day in the quarter. This was down 25% from approximately $3 million per day in Q4 2019 and flattish sequentially. We are well positioned to drive strong operating leverage as the business continues to recover.
At Wynn Las Vegas, we generated $28.1 million of adjusted property EBITDA on $178.7 million of operating revenue from a business that was heavily weighted to weakened occupancy the casino saw broad-based strength across key segments, with slot handle and table drop reaching 86% and 80% of Q4 2019 levels, respectively, during the quarter. The team in Las Vegas has done a great job of controlling costs without negatively impacting the guest experience.
OpEx per day, excluding gaming taxes, decreased 48% to 1.6 million per day in 1Q '21 from $3 million per day in Q4 2019. And similar to Macau, OpEx was largely flat compared to Q4 2020. As Matt noted, the business picked up beginning in March, and the strength continued in the second quarter to date. We believe the combination of meaningful permanent cost saves, along with increased group demand, position as well to accelerate our recovery as we move into the back half of 2021.
In Boston, we generated record EBITDA of $30.4 million despite curtailed operating hours for much of January and a continued significant limitation on gaming positions. Similar to Las Vegas, we've remained very disciplined on the cost side, with OpEx per day, excluding gaming tax, of $760,000 in 1Q 2021, a 40% decrease compared to $1.3 million per day in Q4 '19 and a modest increase relative to the $680,000 per day in Q4 2020.
Turning to Wynn Interactive. Now with approximately 300 employees, as Matt mentioned, and over $100 million in run rate gross gaming revenue based on March results, we are aggressively scaling our efforts to close key product gaps, develop new and innovative features and create a world-class branding and brand ambassador program. You'll hear more about this exciting business during our video presentation and in our slide deck that will be posted to our Investor Relations website at approximately 2:30 p.m. Pacific today.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our liquidity position remains very strong with global cash and revolver availability of nearly $4 billion as of April 30. In Macau, we had approximately $2.09 billion of available liquidity as of the end of April. And in the U.S., we had total available liquidity of approximately $1.85 billion on April 30, with a substantially lower daily cash burn globally compared to the second half of 2020.
As a reminder, on February 11, we completed a successful public offering of 7.5 million shares of Wynn Resort stock with net proceeds of $842 million. Our CapEx in the quarter was $40 million. With the North American business environment improving, we have made the decision to proceed with the Las Vegas room remodel this summer and have approximately $175 million remaining to spend. Beyond that, we are remaining extremely prudent with respect to CapEx while we gained further confidence in the recovery.

Or do you foresee some vaccination type or, I should say, visa-type restrictions loosening that would kind of really allow the growth to be a little bit more unbridled?"

So some of the things that I think are quite positive is we're actually seeing a lot of new customers, a lot of new premium mass customers, premium mass was actually up during Golden Week more than mass for us, but they were both very strong, just because Macau is an option for people to travel. And so we think that over the long term, Macau opening up to China is actually allowing us to acquire customers that we've never seen before.
So I think that each week that goes by, again, Golden Week excluded, it is getting stronger, and we -- looking at our forecast, even though the window is quite short, back half of May and into June, we're feeling pretty good about the continued strength. Ian, do you want to add anything to that?"

And I believe that that's going to be very sticky for us through the summer. What we've seen post Golden Week is the normal post-holiday loan, but it's at a higher level than some of the week and weekend business that we had in April. So as we head towards the summer, we're very positive."

And the idea that we need to wait because we're worried about room compression, I think, is the wrong thing to do. Because if you look at our property and going into 2022, we have yet to utilize our new 400,000 square foot convention center. And a lot of -- while the back half of '21 looks good, '22 is really strong. And so what we want to do is we want to come out of '21 and go into '22 with brand-new room product.

We've got the full launch of the West Casino in Macau. We've expanded our Diamond and Chairman Wynn Palace. We've repurposing bills a large suites to provide many billet experiences for the premium mass market. And we're doing a long series of private events in culinary art and concerts over the summer and into the end of the year which will drive more premium mass business for us. And we've got a digital brand campaign that we're launching during the summer in but non-gaming, which will attract more customers to our properties.
So we're excited about that and despite the arrival of new competition in the marketplace, particularly in our neighborhood, we actually welcome that. And it's affirming up what we call South Cotai. We've had Morpheus open, and GM is ramping up. And we've got Brandish Bo Palace opening at some point in the summer. So that's all great for the future to introduce new customers to Wynn."

Before we dive right into the quarterly results, I'd like to first talk about how excited we are to announce the merger of Wynn Interactive into the Austerlitz Acquisition Corp. As we've been thinking about online sports betting and the iGaming space over the last few years, we knew that we had to stick to what we do, which is build great products and provide the best customer service. Wynn Interactive is now a company with over 300 people. We have some luminaries from European gaming, people -- co-founders of Bwin, that are responsible for a lot of the product that we're developing in this 300-person team.
And as we look out into the future, and we realize this is likely going to be as large as the commercial casino revenue opportunity of $40 billion over the next 5-plus years, which, by the way, that's typically about how long it takes to build one of our bricks-and-mortar properties, around 5 years, we knew that this was an opportunity that we had to capitalize on. And so as we explored various options, it became very clear that creating a pure-play public company in partnership with Bill Foley, one of the most renowned investors in the United States, was clearly the right thing to do to create those value for the Wynn Resort shareholders and for the Wynn Interactive shareholders.
Bill, just for those of you that don't know, has created over $100 billion in shareholder value during his investing career, $100 billion. He's the owner of a professional sports team. He owns luxury hospitality assets around the country. He recently completed the successful de-SPAC of Paysafe, a digital payments company that is now getting into the digital gaming space. 
So partnering with Bill and our team of 300 people and thinking about the product road map and the marketing dollars and -- that we're going to invest to ensure that we're winners in this space felt like the exact right thing to do. And we're very excited to have $640 million of committed capital injected into this company to launch this venture.
We'll be posting a presentation online after this call that has a lot more details around this merger, and we'll be spending time after this call talking about it.
With that, I'm going to go ahead and turn over to our quarterly results. And what we've been seeing in our properties in Macau, Las Vegas and in Boston has been a very similar story, momentum each month continuing to accelerate. As an example, in Macau, we generated $43.9 million of EBITDA in the first quarter, but it's moving so fast over there. I feel like talking about what we're seeing now is more relevant than what we experienced in the first quarter as we saw strength continue into February and in March. So that momentum continued in April and in May.
And in fact, during the Golden Week, which is the first week of May in Macau, we experienced and generated $3 million of normalized EBITDA per day during Golden Week, by far the highest amount of normalized profit that we've been able to generate since the onset of the pandemic at the beginning of 2020. Even with the junket volumes continuing to fluctuate between 25% and 30% of Golden Week 2019, we were able to achieve these results because we focused our business on mass and premium mass. And as we talked about in previous calls, we've been converting space that was previously for VIP into premium mass space, and we feel very comfortable and confident with our position in the Macau market.
In fact, we generated 76% of our mass volumes during the Golden Week this year compared to the Golden Week in 2019. Our hotel occupancy during Golden Week was 93%. And retail, which is continuing to be a shining star across our portfolio in North America and Macau, was up 80% over the Golden Week numbers in 2019. Going forward, in May and into June, we do expect that May will continue to see acceleration over the April results. And we are very, very excited about the summer and what's going to come in Macau. Just seeing the earnings power over Golden Week and understanding where the Chinese consumer is headed and what our position in that market is makes us more confident in our position in Macau, in the Macau market and our future development opportunities in and around Wynn Palace to continue to build on what we do best and to grow our top line and our bottom line in Macau.
Moving to North America in Las Vegas. Again, we've seen very encouraging trends. We generated $28 million in EBITDA in the first quarter. And what we really saw was right around March Madness was when the volumes began to pick up in the first quarter, and that has accelerated. As an example, in the month of April, our RevPAR, which is where we're really focused, has increased 50%, 5-0, over the first quarter results. Retail revenues in the month of April were the second-best month on record. From 2005 until April of 2021, it's the second-best month on record. And what's even more encouraging and much more than a green shoot but a clear indication of the roaring consumer that's coming back, our slot revenues in April were $25 million which was a property record, more than any other month in the history of Wynn Las Vegas.
So you take those things that we're already seeing in Las Vegas and looking at quarter-to-date, our EBITDA has already exceeded the first quarter in Las Vegas. Our weekends going forward are in the 90s in terms of hotel occupancy. And we're really focused on pricing and pricing power. Our group business is holding on and looking actually quite strong for the back half of the year. In fact, just last week, we hosted our first large group of 600 people, and it went off without a hitch. People are so happy to be back. Conventions work. Customers are excited. And as more restrictions are lifted and we're able to really start to roll out our entertainment and our night clubs and do what we do best, we think that Las Vegas' opportunity is really unique, and the best times are ahead.
Moving to Boston at Encore Boston Harbor. We achieved record EBITDA of $30 million for the quarter. And that's even with restricted operating hours and quite significant COVID restrictions in the month of January. And that trend has continued. In fact, in the second quarter, thus far, our daily EBITDA is up 30-plus percent compared to the first quarter. Encore Boston Harbor is hitting on all cylinders right now. We've been able to really rationalize the cost, run the building much more efficiently and focus on our casino customers and being the top super regional casino in the Northeast. I believe that Encore Boston Harbor is going to continue to grow quarter-over-quarter throughout this year as that property and that management team are really doing an amazing job.
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Craig to provide more details on the quarter."

As Matt noted, our Macau operations delivered $43.9 million of EBITDA in the quarter on $417 million of operating revenue.

As Matt noted, our Macau operations delivered $43.9 million of EBITDA in the quarter on $417 million of operating revenue. Our EBITDA was driven by encouraging gaming and nongaming performance combined with solid cost controls. Gross gaming revenue per day in 1Q '21 was approximately 34% of Q4 2019, led by the premium mass segment with particular strength in March. As Matt mentioned, this strength continued into April as mass drop reached $16.8 million per day or 59% of Q4 2019 or a 26% increase compared to 1Q 2021 levels. Our 1Q 2021 results in Macau were positively impacted by higher-than-normal table games hold that increased EBITDA by approximately $10 million to $15 million from a normalized level.
With respect to cost controls, our OpEx, excluding gaming tax, was $2.2 million per day in the quarter. This was down 25% from approximately $3 million per day in Q4 2019 and flattish sequentially. We are well positioned to drive strong operating leverage as the business continues to recover.
At Wynn Las Vegas, we generated $28.1 million of adjusted property EBITDA on $178.7 million of operating revenue from a business that was heavily weighted to weakened occupancy. In the casino, we saw broad-based strength across key segments with slot handle and table drop reaching 86% and 80% of Q4 2019 levels, respectively, during the quarter. The team in Las Vegas has done a great job of controlling costs without negatively impacting the guest experience.
OpEx per day, excluding gaming taxes, decreased 48% to $1.6 million per day in 1Q '21 from $3 million per day in Q4 2019. And similar to Macau, OpEx was largely flat compared to Q4 2020. As Matt noted, the business picked up beginning in March, and the strength continued in the second quarter to date. We believe the combination of meaningful permanent cost saves, along with increased group demand, position as well to accelerate our recovery as we move into the back half of 2021.
In Boston, we generated record EBITDA of $30.4 million despite curtailed operating hours for much of January and a continued significant limitation on gaming positions. Similar to Las Vegas, we've remained very disciplined on the cost side with OpEx per day, excluding gaming tax, of $760,000 in 1Q 2021, a 40% decrease compared to $1.3 million per day in Q4 '19 and a modest increase relative to the $680,000 per day in Q4 2020.
Turning to Wynn Interactive. Now with approximately 300 employees, as Matt mentioned, and over $100 million in run rate gross gaming revenue based on March results, we are aggressively scaling our efforts to close key product gaps, develop new and innovative features and create a world-class branding and brand ambassador program. You'll hear more about this exciting business during our video presentation and in our slide deck that will be posted to our Investor Relations website at approximately 2:30 p.m. Pacific today.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our liquidity position remains very strong with global cash and revolver availability of nearly $4 billion as of April 30. In Macau, we had approximately $2.09 billion of available liquidity as of the end of April. And in the U.S., we had total available liquidity of approximately $1.85 billion on April 30, with a substantially lower daily cash burn globally compared to the second half of 2020.
As a reminder, on February 11, we completed a successful public offering of 7.5 million shares of Wynn Resorts stock with net proceeds of $842 million. Our CapEx in the quarter was $40 million. With the North American business environment improving, we have made the decision to proceed with the Las Vegas room remodel this summer and have approximately $175 million remaining to spend. Beyond that, we are remaining extremely prudent with respect to CapEx while we gain further confidence in the recovery.

So some of the things that I think are quite positive is we're actually seeing a lot of new customers, a lot of new premium mass customers. Premium mass was actually up during Golden Week more than mass for us, but they were both very strong. Just because Macau is an option for people to travel, and so we think that over the long term, Macau opening up to China is actually allowing us to acquire customers that we've never seen before.
So I think that each week that goes by, again, Golden Week excluded, it is getting stronger. And we -- looking at our forecast, even though the window is quite short, back half of May and into June, we're feeling pretty good about the continued strength.

You could say it's almost been a test bed for a raging Chinese economy where people have no way of traveling overseas. And to what you said earlier, we are seeing new customers coming to market who haven't traveled to Macau before, and they're getting positively overwhelmed with the quality of resorts in the city. And I believe that that's going to be very sticky for us through the summer. What we've seen post Golden Week is the normal post-holiday norm, but it's at a higher level than some of the weakened weekend business that we had in April. So as we head towards the summer, we're very positive."

And a lot of -- while the back half of '21 looks good, '22 is really strong. And so what we want to do is we want to come out of '21 and go into '22 with brand-new room product.

We've been repurposing villas and large suites to provide many villa experiences for the premium mass market. And we're doing a long series of private events in culinary arts and concerts over the summer and into the end of the year, which will drive more premium mass business for us. And we've got a digital brand campaign that we're launching during the summer aimed at non-gaming, which will attract more customers to our properties.
So we're excited about that. And despite the arrival of new competition in the marketplace, particularly in our neighborhood, we actually welcome that. And it's a firming up of what we call South Cotai. We've had Morpheus open. MGM is ramping up. And we've got Grand Lisboa Palace opening at some point in the summer.

We were able to achieve $133 million of EBITDA without international high-end play, which in the past had been almost 20% of our results and without conventions. 
And that trend continued into July. In fact, in July, Wynn Las Vegas experienced its single largest EBITDA for a month since we opened in 2005. We were able to get occupancy up to the mid-90s on the weekend, and it was still in the 80s during the week, but we focused on rate. We had -- we were getting over $500 ADR on the weekend. And we're continuing to make sure we have the right customers in here and achieving the right results. 
Moving on to Boston. Same thing can be said. It was a record quarter in Boston at $46 million. We saw each month stronger than the last. Our database is accelerating quite rapidly there. In fact, our new sign-ups for our Wynn rewards program were up 70% in the second quarter compared to the first quarter, 70%. And again, same story. July, record month, our best month on record for Encore Boston Harbor. 
So when I look at our results in North America, it's interesting to say, could the second quarter be a peak? And I think that, that's very short-term thinking. The second quarter is not a peak. It's a preview of what's to come. We've all been able to streamline our expense structure, understand how to yield our properties better. And the ability to generate significant EBITDA out of these assets is quite clear. 
Now clearly, the Delta variant's throwing a little bit of a curveball right now. But that will be short term, and it will subside. And what is clear is people want to have fun. They want to go to Las Vegas. And as we see conventions come back, which is going to happen and then more international play from around the world come back, I am very confident that we will continue to see growth in our results in both Las Vegas and in Boston. 
Looking at Macau, we made $67 million in EBITDA for the quarter. And Macau has been continuously sort of 2 steps forward, 1 step back. On our first quarter earnings call, we talked about the strength that we've just experienced during May in Golden Week, where we had achieved $3 million in EBITDA a day during that period. Then -- however, after that call, there was a small outbreak in Guangdong that was quickly stamped out within a couple of weeks, but that greatly suppressed the volumes in June. 
We did start to see a slight comeback in the middle of July to where the results were getting close to the April and May results, which really indicates that there's real pent-up demand in the region to go to Macau. Clearly, there's been another outbreak that we've all been reading about in the region. And the restrictions have stepped up quite significantly just over the last few days in terms of travel restrictions. 
I think the good thing that we all have now experienced is that the Macau government acts decisively and quickly. And usually, it has been able to remedy these things and in the Greater Bay Area within a matter of weeks. 
So while we don't know how long this is going to last, the experience thus far with the decisive action, the ability to test millions of millions of people just within a matter of days in the region and in Macau does give us great hope that this will continue to pass. And what's really -- what we're really focused on is the accelerating vaccination rate in the region. 
And so while it's impossible to predict right now, we are quite hopeful that as the vaccination rate continues to accelerate and the stated goals are hopefully achieved by the end of the year that we will begin to see a more stabilized and normalized operating environment. 
Looking at the interactive space, Wynn Interactive. We have an S-4 that's live right now out there. We're working very closely with the Austerlitz team on our SPAC, and that is moving forward quite well. And we're really excited about it. 
We put together a full robust program of new product delivery and the marketing program that we will be rolling out for NFL this year that we are excited about. The space is competitive, there's no doubt. But we are very confident with what we put together, with our product, with our brand and what we're going to be able to offer that we are going to be a real player in this market. And we're excited to share a lot more with you at an upcoming Analyst Day that Craig will talk about in a little more detail on this call. 
So with that, I'm going to go ahead and turn it over to Craig to get into some more detail."
3449701,1675608987,2363176,"Wynn Resorts, Limited, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2021",2021-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Wynn Resorts, Limited","Executives","Thanks, Matt.

As Matt noted, our Macau operations delivered $67.6 million of EBITDA in the quarter on $454.4 million of operating revenue. Our EBITDA was driven by encouraging gaming and nongaming performance combined with solid cost controls with particular strength in April and May. 
Gross gaming revenue per day in 2Q '21 was approximately 31% of Q2 '19 led by the premium mass segment. Our 2Q results in Macau were positively impacted by higher-than-normal VIP table games hold that increased EBITDA by approximately $10 million from a normalized level. 
With respect to cost controls, our OpEx, excluding gaming tax, was $2.3 million per day in the quarter. This is down 23% from $3 million per day in the fourth quarter of 2019 and only up slightly sequentially despite the increase in revenue. We continue to be well positioned to drive strong operating leverage as the business recovers. 
At Wynn Las Vegas, we generated $133.2 million of adjusted property EBITDA on $355.1 million of operating revenue with particular strength on the weekends. In the casino, we saw broad-based strength across key segments with slot handle 37% above 2Q 2019 levels and table dropped only 3% below 2Q '19. 
The team in Las Vegas has done a great job of controlling costs without negatively impacting the guest experience, delivering a record adjusted property EBITDA margin of 37.5% in the quarter. OpEx per day, again excluding gaming taxes, decreased 24% to $2.3 million per day in the second quarter of '21 from $3 million per day in the fourth quarter of '19. While OpEx increased approximately 45% sequentially from $1.6 million in 1Q '21, revenue nearly doubled, driving strong operating leverage. 
In Boston, as Matt mentioned, we generated another record quarter with adjusted property EBITDA of $46.9 million on a record EBITDA margin of 28.4%. Similar to Las Vegas, we have remained very disciplined on the cost side with OpEx per day, excluding gaming tax, of $870,000 in the quarter, a decrease of over 30% compared to $1.3 million per day in Q4 '19 and a modest increase relative to the first quarter of '21 on the back of improved business volumes and increased operating hours. 
Turning to Wynn Interactive. We spent much of the quarter aggressively advancing our product features and building a robust marketing campaign ahead of the 2021 football season. Strategic highlights over the past few months include the recent launch of our web applications in Indiana, Colorado, Tennessee, New Jersey and Virginia, which we expect to help drive user acquisition over time. 
We've also strengthened our third-party partnerships through agreements with the Detroit Lions, the Colorado Rockies and Cumulus Media. We've also announced several new high-profile brand ambassadors, including Tim Howard and Chad Johnson, with more to come. 
Additionally, as sports and sports media continue to converge, we've partnered with several engaging content creators, including Chris Long, to develop unique sports theme programming from the new Blue Wire podcast studio at Wynn Las Vegas, which is scheduled to open in a few weeks. Wynn Interactive is now powered by just over 340 employees and is run rating $110 million in annualized gross revenue as of July. 
We modestly exceeded the Q2 results underpinning the projections published in connection with our announced de-SPAC with Austerlitz in May despite lower-than-expected user acquisition spend. We anticipate our revenue to accelerate over the remainder of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter, as we roll out our thoughtful and unique marketing campaign and our new product features. 
Our total acquisition spending declined sequentially, and we believe our ability to exceed our revenue projections on lower acquisition spend is a testament to the brand's ability to drive retention and higher average spend per customer. We look forward to sharing more details on this business during a presentation to sell-side analysts planned for September, along with a slide deck that will be posted on our IR website at that time. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our liquidity position remains very strong with global cash and revolver availability of over $3.9 billion as of June 30. In Macau, we had approximately $2 billion of available liquidity as of June 30. In the U.S., we had total liquidity of approximately $1.9 billion on June 30, with a substantially lower daily cash burn globally compared to the first quarter of '21. 
Earlier this week, a subsidiary of Wynn Macau Limited received commitments for a new $1.5 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility that will mature in 2025. The arrangement includes broad participation by our bank group of supportive existing lenders, including local and international banks. Borrowings under the new facility, along with cash on hand, will be used to refinance and retire our existing senior secured credit facility in Macau. 
Finally, our CapEx in the quarter was $70 million, and we remain prudent with respect to CapEx while we gain further confidence in the recovery. With that, we will now turn it over to Q&A. Operator?"

We have managed the listing business very well. There is a desire on the part of the PRC government to allow travel into Macau whenever it's possible. 
We've obviously had a pullback in the last couple of days, but there's confidence that the current small cluster will be under control within a couple of weeks. We're going through mass testing of the entire population of Macau over a 3-day period. And we're confident that we will reopen with the PRC in due course, but it is very linked to vaccine rollout. 
The one consequence of having a small cluster Delta outbreak in Macau is it will be a huge encouragement for some of the people that are held back on getting a vaccine because they deemed Macau very safe. This could be an alert for them to go and get vaccinated. Right now, we're at 44% vaccination rate in the city, very similar to Hong Kong. So we hope to lift that considerably in the coming weeks and months."

I'd like to start off with our results in North America, which we were all very happy with.  Starting in Las Vegas. We made $133 million in EBITDA in Las Vegas. And what was great about the s",923,"Thanks, Craig, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I'd like to start off with our results in North America, which we were all very happy with.  
Starting in Las Vegas. We made $133 million in EBITDA in Las Vegas. And what was great about the second quarter was each month was stronger than the last. In fact, June's EBITDA was double what we experienced in April.  
We saw our occupancy continue to grow week-over-week, and the strength across all segments was quite apparent from our night clubs to our hotel, our restaurants and our gaming volumes. We were able to achieve $133 million of EBITDA without international high-end play, which in the past had been almost 20% of our results and without conventions. And that trend continued into July. In fact, in July, Wynn Las Vegas experienced its single largest EBITDA for a month since we opened in 2005. We were able to get occupancy up to the mid-90s on the weekend, and it was still in the 80s during the week, but we focused on rate. We had -- we were getting over $500 ADR on the weekends. And we're continuing to make sure we have the right customers in here and achieving the right results.  
Moving on to Boston. Same thing can be said. It was a record quarter in Boston at $46 million. We saw each month stronger than the last. Our database is accelerating quite rapidly there. In fact, our new sign-ups for our Wynn Rewards program were up 70% in the second quarter compared to the first quarter, 70%. And again, same story. July, record month, our best month on record for Encore Boston Harbor.  
So when I look at our results in North America, it's interesting to say, could the second quarter be a peak? And I think that, that's very short-term thinking. The second quarter is not a peak. It's a preview of what's to come. We've all been able to streamline our expense structure, understand how to yield our properties better. And the ability to generate significant EBITDA out of these assets is quite clear.  
Now clearly, the Delta variant's throwing a little bit of a curveball right now. But that will be short term, and it will subside. And what is clear is people want to have fun. They want to go to Las Vegas. And as we see conventions come back, which is going to happen, and then more international play from around the world come back, I am very confident that we will continue to see growth in our results in both Las Vegas and in Boston.  
Looking at Macau, we made $67 million in EBITDA for the quarter. And Macau has been continuously sort of 2 steps forward, 1 step back. On our first quarter earnings call, we talked about the strength that we've just experienced during May in Golden Week, where we had achieved $3 million in EBITDA a day during that period. Then -- however, after that call, there was a small outbreak in Guangdong that was quickly stamped out within a couple of weeks, but that greatly suppressed the volumes in June.  
We did start to see a slight comeback in the middle of July to where the results were getting close to the April and May results, which really indicates that there's real pent-up demand in the region to go to Macau. Clearly, there's been another outbreak that we've all been reading about in the region. And the restrictions have stepped up quite significantly just over the last few days in terms of travel restrictions. I think the good thing that we all have now experienced is that the Macau government acts decisively and quickly. And usually, it has been able to remedy these things and in the Greater Bay Area within a matter of weeks.  
So while we don't know how long this is going to last, the experience thus far, with the decisive action, the ability to test millions of millions of people just within a matter of days in the region and in Macau does give us great hope that this will continue to pass. And what's really -- what we're really focused on is the accelerating vaccination rate in the region.  
And so while it's impossible to predict right now, we are quite hopeful that as the vaccination rate continues to accelerate and the stated goals are hopefully achieved by the end of the year, that we will begin to see a more stabilized and normalized operating environment.  
Looking at the interactive space, Wynn Interactive. We have an S-4 that's live right now out there. We're working very closely with the Austerlitz team on our SPAC, and that is moving forward quite well. And we're really excited about it.  
We put together a full robust program of new product delivery and the marketing program that we will be rolling out for NFL this year that we are excited about. The space is competitive, there's no doubt. But we are very confident with what we put together, with our product, with our brand and what we're going to be able to offer that we are going to be a real player in this market. And we're excited to share a lot more with you at an upcoming Analyst Day that Craig will talk about in a little more detail on this call.  
So with that, I'm going to go ahead and turn it over to Craig to get into some more detail."

As Matt noted, our Macau operations delivered $67.6 million of EBITDA in the quarter on $454.4 million of operating revenue. Our EBITDA was driven by encouraging gaming and nongaming performance combined with solid cost controls with particular strength in April and May.  
Gross gaming revenue per day in 2Q '21 was approximately 31% of Q2 '19, led by the premium mass segment. Our 2Q results in Macau were positively impacted by higher-than-normal VIP table games hold that increased EBITDA by approximately $10 million from a normalized level.  
With respect to cost controls, our OpEx, excluding gaming tax, was $2.3 million per day in the quarter. This is down 23% from $3 million per day in the fourth quarter of 2019 and only up slightly sequentially despite the increase in revenue. We continue to be well positioned to drive strong operating leverage as the business recovers.  
At Wynn Las Vegas, we generated $133.2 million of adjusted property EBITDA on $355.1 million of operating revenue with particular strength on the weekends. In the casino, we saw broad-based strength across key segments with slot handle 37% above 2Q 2019 levels and table dropped only 3% below 2Q '19.  
The team in Las Vegas has done a great job of controlling costs without negatively impacting the guest experience, delivering a record adjusted  property EBITDA margin of 37.5% in the quarter. OpEx per day, again excluding gaming taxes, decreased 24% to $2.3 million per day in the second quarter of '21 from $3 million per day in the fourth quarter of '19. While OpEx increased approximately 45% sequentially from $1.6 million in 1Q '21, revenue nearly doubled, driving strong operating leverage.  
In Boston, as Matt mentioned, we generated another record quarter with adjusted property EBITDA of $46.9 million on a record EBITDA margin of 28.4%. Similar to Las Vegas, we have remained very disciplined on the cost side with OpEx per day, excluding gaming tax, of $870,000 in the quarter, a decrease of over 30% compared to $1.3 million per day in Q4 '19 and a modest increase relative to the first quarter of '21 on the back of improved business volumes and increased operating hours.  
Turning to Wynn Interactive. We spent much of the quarter aggressively advancing our product features and building a robust marketing campaign ahead of the 2021 football season. Strategic highlights over the past few months include the recent launch of our web applications in Indiana, Colorado, Tennessee, New Jersey and Virginia, which we expect to help drive user acquisition over time.  
We've also strengthened our third-party partnerships through agreements with the Detroit Lions, the Colorado Rockies and Cumulus Media. We've also announced several new high-profile brand ambassadors, including Tim Howard and Chad Johnson, with more to come. 
Additionally, as sports and sports media continue to converge, we've partnered with several engaging content creators, including Chris Long, to develop unique sports themed programming from the new Blue Wire Podcasts studio at Wynn Las Vegas, which is scheduled to open in a few weeks. 
Wynn Interactive is now powered by just over 340 employees and is run rating $110 million in annualized gross revenue as of July. We modestly exceeded the Q2 results underpinning the projections published in connection with our announced de-SPAC with Austerlitz in May despite lower-than-expected user acquisition spend. We anticipate our revenue to accelerate over the remainder of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter, as we roll out our thoughtful and unique marketing campaign and our new product features. 
Our total acquisition spending declined sequentially, and we believe our ability to exceed our revenue projections on lower acquisition spend is a testament to the brand's ability to drive retention and higher average spend per customer. We look forward to sharing more details on this business during a presentation to sell-side analysts planned for September, along with a slide deck that will be posted on our IR website at that time. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our liquidity position remains very strong with global cash and revolver availability of over $3.9 billion as of June 30. In Macau, we had approximately $2 billion of available liquidity as of June 30. In the U.S., we had total liquidity of approximately $1.9 billion on June 30, with a substantially lower daily cash burn globally compared to the first quarter of '21. 
Earlier this week, a subsidiary of Wynn Macau, Limited received commitments for a new $1.5 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility that will mature in 2025. The arrangement includes broad participation by our bank group of supportive existing lenders, including local and international banks. Borrowings under the new facility, along with cash on hand, will be used to refinance and retire our existing senior secured credit facility in Macau. 
Finally, our CapEx in the quarter was $70 million, and we remain prudent with respect to CapEx while we gain further confidence in the recovery. With that, we will now turn it over to Q&A. Operator?"

We have managed the lift in business very well. There is a desire on the part of the PRC government to allow travel into Macau whenever it's possible. 
We've obviously had a pullback in the last couple of days, but there's confidence that the current small cluster will be under control within a couple of weeks. We're going through mass testing of the entire population of Macau over a 3-day period. And we're confident that we will reopen with the PRC in due course, but it is very linked to vaccine rollout. 
The one consequence of having a small cluster Delta outbreak in Macau is it will be a huge encouragement for some of the people that has held back on getting a vaccine because they deemed Macau very safe. This could be an alert for them to go and get vaccinated. Right now, we're at 44% vaccination rate in the city, very similar to Hong Kong. So we hope to lift that considerably in the coming weeks and months."

So we're in good shape right now. We've had just a handful of cancellations. We have our largest group that comes in next week, and the pickup is solid. So we feel really good about that. 
For 2022, we are above pace from what we were in 2019, and the same is true for 2023. And the ADRs are higher in 2022 and 2023. So we feel good about that group business in addition.

So first, I'd like to address my decision to leave the company. I've been at Wynn for 20 years and been the CEO for the last 4.

I've been at Wynn for 20 years and been the CEO for the last 4. And I made a commitment in 2018 to this company and to the Board of Directors and what was likely one of the messiest transitions in corporate history that I'd do everything I could to keep the culture to make the -- to get the company on firm footing and to ensure that we would emerge better than we were before. 
Now along that journey as we were making lots of progress in getting things stable, we bumped into a pandemic. And that was the time really when Wynn was able to shine. We became the beacon in the hospitality. People looked at us on what to do. We paid all of our staff during the shutdown. We invested in our culture. We knew that by doing those things and continuing to be exactly who we are, that it would pay off over the long term, not just for our people and for our customers but for our shareholders. 
I'd like to thank the unwavering commitment and support of the Board of Directors during these 4 years. After we made this decision, they did ask me if I would remain on the Wynn Macau board to ensure stability and to assist with the concession renewal process there, which I agreed to do through 2022 and also the Win Interactive Board to make sure that we create lots of value for the Wynn Resort shareholders, which I also agreed to. 
I'm very happy to say that the Board was -- is 100% behind and has picked the exact right person to replace me as I transition out in Craig Billings. Craig has been my right hand man for 5 years now. He's been through the good, the bad, all of it, and he knows what to do. He understands culture. 
He's not a guy that's going to build a big corporate infrastructure. He makes decisions fast, and he feels the brand and the company really couldn't be in a better position going forward. And in fact, if you look at that, I think the proof is in this quarter. If we just jump to the results and get the business here, in Las Vegas, we made $183 million of EBITDA. And that's not a whole bunch of cost savings that are going to go away over time and can you sustain the margin, et cetera. Only $15 million to $18 million of that $183 million came from cost savings. The rest of it, we're taking market share. 
Over the last 4 years, we've opened a 400,000 square-foot convention facility. We built a new golf course. We have changed out 40 of our 60 retail stores to become the shopping destination. We restructured our club so that margins went from 7% to almost 30%. 
We've raised our prices in our hotels seeing straight flow through. Every area we're taking share, casino included. We are not only outpacing all of our results, but we're taking share from the market.
I knew coming in that we needed to cater to a demographic that was in more than 30 to 50 on top of our current demographic in the baby boomer generation. We've opened lots of new restaurants. In fact, one of the new ones, the Delilah, if you call right now, you can't get in until February. I've never seen anything like it. And while that's one restaurant, it's an example of all the changes that we've made that have really set the foundation for Wynn Las Vegas to take off like a rocket ship. And I think one of the most important aspects of a successful business is culture. 
People talk about that, but we all know in our business, only people make people happy. And if your employees believe that their future will be better because of the place they work and that their employer is going to take care of them. When times get tough, you've harnessed the power of the universe. And that's what we have going on right now. 
Look, I'll give you an example. Hospitality is experiencing extreme labor shortages right now throughout North America. It's a fact. People are talking about it, but not at Wynn. We had 4 open servers in our restaurants, positions, open positions. Last month, we had 1,066 people apply. Sure. big job. You might expect that. 
We had 22 open positions for casino cleaners last month. They clean the bathrooms, the casino, the restaurants. They make the place sparkle. We had 2,015 people apply for those 22 spots. That is the sign of a good business. That's when you know you're going to win over the long term because your customers understand that loyalty and people want to be here. And so I feel very good about where Wynn Las Vegas is in terms of its culture, its employees, the product and its future. 
Looking on Encore Boston Harbor, same thing, record results, $64 million of EBITDA. And we did the very similar that we did in Las Vegas during the shutdown was we looked at things that weren't working. We had a buffet that was losing $12 million a year. So we ripped it out while we were shut down, and we built probably the world's best sports bar that once Massachusetts legalizes sports betting, it will be the best sports book on the East Coast hands down. 
We put in new food and beverage offerings. We reconfigured the entire casino. We changed out our casino loyalty program, and our database has been growing exponentially. We have over 418,000 people in the database. And it's the trajectory that it's growing now, that's probably going to double over the next 2 years. 
So Encore Boston Harbor, again, is only at the beginning of its growth and the North American assets really couldn't be in a better position. There was a little bit of concern that maybe stimulus money or pent-up demand, et cetera, was causing some of this? And that may be true for the third quarter and what we experienced in the summer, but it's certainly continuing. 
In October, Wynn Las Vegas had its best month on record, highest EBITDA, highest margin and we held below our normal range. Same at Encore Boston Harbor. The group business is coming back. We've seen groups taking up over 30% of our room nights in August and September. 
And the way that we're running these facilities now and the way that we're yielding and being unrelenting on price because people like the quality, the flow-through is happening. Just last weekend, our average rate was $780 in Las Vegas, and we're at 99% occupancy. And that is continuing into the future because we're taking market share and Las Vegas itself is growing. 
Turning to Macau. We've had, as everyone in the market has had fits and starts there as to the business. But what has been very encouraging over the last month has been the consultation process with the government. It's been open, it's been transparent. It's been productive, and we feel very good about the future of Macau and our position in Macau. 
Looking at Wynn Interactive. We launched lots of new products this quarter that we're very proud of. We made great progress in Arizona with first-time depositors . And we're seeing good customer feedback and our retention is quite strong. However, the market is really not sustainable right now. 
Competitors are spending too much to get customers. And the economics are just not something that we're going to participate in, in the short term. So while we built the brand, we launched the product in the third quarter, we're going to be focused on building a long-term business that's sustainable that is not losing lots and lots of money.
So we are shifting our strategy to think about the future, think about the long term, think about cash preservation, and we remain very confident that we'll create significant value for the Wynn Resort shareholders with our digital strategy. With that, I'm going to go ahead and turn it over to Craig. Congratulations, Craig..."

Like everyone in the company, I've admired your leadership over the course of the past 4 years. More than anyone, you know the dedication and talent of the thousands of folks who make up the Wynn team, and I'm honored to have been asked to lead that team. 
Turning to the quarter. At Wynn Las Vegas, we generated $183.4 million of adjusted property EBITDA on $476 million of operating revenue. Overall, our hotel occupancy reached 83% in the quarter with 93% occupancy on weekends. Importantly, we stayed true to our luxury brand and have resisted dropping rate with overall ADR reaching $392 during the third quarter of '21, nearly 30% above Q3 2019 levels.
Our other non-gaming business saw broad-based strength across F&B and retail, which was also well above pre-pandemic levels. In the casino, our Q3 '21 slot handle was 31% above Q3 2019, and table drop was 18% above Q3 '19 despite still suppressed international play due to COVID-related travel challenges. 
The team in Las Vegas has done a great job of controlling costs without negatively impacting the guest experience, delivering a record adjusted property EBITDA margin of 38.5% in the quarter. OpEx per day was $3 million in Q3 '21, approximately $250,000 per day below Q3 2019 levels despite the 19% increase in revenue. As new high-margin business like groups and convention returned to the property, we expect OpEx to increase modestly but we remain committed to maintaining the cost structure that appropriately balances margins and our exacting service standards.
In Boston, we generated another record quarter with adjusted property EBITDA of $64.6 million in Q3 on a record EBITDA margin of 33.6%. We remain very disciplined on the cost side there, too with OpEx per day, excluding a $3 million benefit from a few onetime items of $950,000 in Q3 '21, a decrease of over 25% compared to 1.3 million per day in Q4 '19 and a modest increase relative to 2Q '21.
Our Macau operations delivered $10.2 million of EBITDA in the quarter on $312 million of operating revenue, while business in the quarter was challenging, due to the evolving COVID situation, we remain disciplined on costs. Our OpEx, excluding gaming tax and the reversal of certain performance-based incentive accruals in the third quarter was approximately $2.1 million per day.
We continue to be well positioned to drive strong operating leverage as the business recovers. Turning to Wynn Interactive. In Q3, the business generated approximately $645 million in total turnover, disproportionately weighted to September. In late August, we launched a number of key product improvements, which have been well received by customers.
On a normalized basis, Wynn Interactive is now run rating over $170 million of gross revenue. During the quarter and since, we have achieved several other key milestones for the business, including launching day 1 in Arizona, where we drove over 26,000 first-time depositors through September 30, securing a number of additional market access agreements, obtaining a license to operate in the state of New York and becoming an official sports betting partner of the NFL. 
While sports betting remains an exciting, high-growth market and will potentially be a $30 billion to $40 billion TAM over time, the marketplace is proving to be very competitive with multiple operators deploying meaningful marketing dollars, driving high cost per acquisition and significant customer bonus offers.
In light of this dynamic, we have -- are intentionally pivoting our approach to scaling, taking a more measured and long-term focus to grow a healthy and sustainable business, as Matt mentioned thus, we expect our Q3 and Q4 EBITDA burn, driven heavily by our branding campaign and preopening user acquisition in Arizona will decline materially beginning in Q1 2022 as we focus on cost per acquisition that is commensurate with customer lifetime values.
We continue to believe in our team, our product and the longer-term opportunity. And there's certainly a path to grow our business in ways that create value for Wind Resorts shareholders but the current combination of large-scale brand spend, performance marketing spend and customer bonuses that we see in the marketplace does not drive unit economics that meet our return requirements. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our liquidity position remains very strong with global cash and revolver availability of over $3.7 billion as of September 30. In Macau, we had approximately $1.8 billion of available liquidity as of September 30. And in the U.S., we had total available liquidity of approximately $1.9 billion as of September 30. 
As previously announced, during the quarter, Wynn Macau Limited entered into a new $1.5 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in 2025. The arrangement includes broad participation by our group of supportive existing lenders, including local and international banks. 
Borrowing under the new facility, along with $200 million of cash on hand, we are used to refinance and retire our existing senior secured credit Finally, our CapEx in the quarter was $103 million, and we remain prudent with respect to CapEx while we gain further confidence in the recovery. 
As a reminder, we are limited in what we can say about Wynn Interactive due to the live S-4 that we have on file. With that, we'll now open up the call to Q&A. Operator?"

If you materially overshoot on CPA or offer noneconomic promotions, then you can end up upside down on a customer pretty quickly, which obviously isn't very shareholder friendly. 
In the current environment, there are certainly opportunities for us to do ROI positive acquisition. They absolutely exist. It's really a question of scale. So if you're not trying to be aggressive and drive headline market share with large-scale brand spend, performance spend, hyper-aggressive customer promos, there are absolutely opportunities to grow the business over the course of the longer term."

I mean I know you know this formula better than probably anyone else on this call. Can you talk about the prevailing like just level of what you're seeing out there? Because one challenge we, I think, all run into as analysts is the formula kind of spits out whatever in a way, a little bit of whatever you want. 
So the more you spend on marketing, you can justify it if your LTV is higher, and it's hard for us to kind of independently validate. So just a little bit of thought around like what is that prevailing level of spend out there sort of what do you maybe want it to be to make the model or math work to what you think is going to be a profitable long term?"

What I would say is that you really have kind of 3 elements that impact this, right? You have brand spend, you have performance spend, where you're actually buying digital ads to bring customers directly to the product. 
And then you have the underlying promotion that you're providing to the customer. And some participants in the market have structural advantages in those areas. Some participants don't. And so when you're pulling all 3 of those levers, into a very, very aggressive market where there's a ton of competition and a ton of folks doing the same thing, it can become particularly difficult, particularly in states where you're entering the market late. So in Arizona as an example, where we did 26,000-plus FTDs over the course of September that's a great outcome. 
Other states that -- where maybe you're entering or scaling a little bit later, it becomes much more offer-driven. And you can pretty -- again, pretty quickly get upside down. So I think what we're focused on is leveraging the advantages that we have, right? We have a database, we have a brands. And to the extent that we're not aggressively chasing every single lever, we can build a business over the longer term. That's a great business into what will eventually be a really, really strong TAM."

And I mean, old school, and I think as you do that profitability matters more than that. 
But what -- how do you -- I guess, what are your thoughts about if you don't focus on that in the early stages, you mentioned that entering late is more offer driven maybe than getting it on day 1.

So first, I'd like to address my decision to leave the company. I've been at Wynn for 20 years and been the CEO for the last 4. And I made a commitment in 2018 to this company and to the Board of Dire",1389,"Thanks, Craig, and thank you all for joining us today. So first, I'd like to address my decision to leave the company. I've been at Wynn for 20 years and been the CEO for the last 4. And I made a commitment in 2018 to this company and to the Board of Directors and what was likely one of the messiest transitions in corporate history that I'd do everything I could to keep the culture, to make the -- to get the company on firm footing and to ensure that we would emerge better than we were before.
Now along that journey as we were making lots of progress in getting things stable, we bumped into a pandemic. And that was the time really when Wynn was able to shine. We became the beacon in the hospitality. People looked at us on what to do. We paid all of our staff during the shutdown. We invested in our culture. We knew that by doing those things and continuing to be exactly who we are, that it would pay off over the long term, not just for our people and for our customers, but for our shareholders. 
I'd like to thank the unwavering commitment and support of the Board of Directors during these 4 years. After we made this decision, they did ask me if I would remain on the Wynn Macau board to ensure stability and to assist with the concession renewal process there, which I agreed to do through 2022 and also the Wynn Interactive Board to make sure that we create lots of value for the Wynn Resort shareholders, which I also agreed to.
I'm very happy to say that the Board was -- is 100% behind and has picked the exact right person to replace me as I transition out in Craig Billings. Craig has been my right hand man for 5 years now. He's been through the good, the bad, all of it, and he knows what to do. He understands culture.
He's not a guy that's going to build a big corporate infrastructure. He makes decisions fast and he feels the brand and the company really couldn't be in a better position going forward. And in fact, if you look at that, I think the proof is in this quarter.  
If we just jump to the results and get the business here, in Las Vegas, we made $183 million of EBITDA.   And that's not a whole bunch of cost savings that are going to go away over time and can you sustain the margin, et cetera. Only $15 million to $18 million of that $183 million came from cost savings. The rest of it, we're taking market share.
Over the last 4 years, we've opened a 400,000 square-foot convention facility. We built a new golf course. We have changed out 40 of our 60 retail stores to become the shopping destination. We restructured our club so that margins went from 7% to almost 30%.
We've raised our prices in our hotels seeing straight flow through. Every area we're taking share, casino included. We are not only outpacing all of our results, but we're taking share from the market.
I knew coming in that we needed to cater to a demographic that was in more than 30 to 50 on top of our current demographic in the baby boomer generation. We've opened lots of new restaurants. In fact, one of the new ones, Delilah. If you call right now, you can't get in until February. I've never seen anything like it. And while that's one restaurant, it's an example of all the changes that we've made, that have really set the foundation for Wynn Las Vegas to take off like a rocket ship. And I think one of the most important aspects of a successful business is culture.
People talk about that, but we all know in our business, only people make people happy. And if your employees believe that their future will be better because of the place they work and that their employer is going to take care of them when times get tough, you've harnessed the power of the universe. And that's what we have going on right now.
Look, I'll give you an example. Hospitality is experiencing extreme labor shortages right now throughout North America. It's a fact. People are talking about it, but not at Wynn. We had 4 open servers in our restaurants, positions, open positions. Last month, we had 1,066 people apply.   Sure, big tip job. You might expect that.
We had 22 open positions for casino cleaners last month. They clean the bathrooms, the casino, the restaurants. They make the place sparkle. We had 2,015 people apply for those 22 spots. That is the sign of a good business. That's when you know you're going to win over the long term because your customers understand that loyalty and people want to be here. And so I feel very good about where Wynn Las Vegas is in terms of its culture, its employees, the product and its future.
Looking on for Boston Harbor, same thing. Record results, $64 million of EBITDA. And we did the very similar that we did in Las Vegas during the shutdown, was we looked at things that weren't working. We had a buffet that was losing $12 million a year. So we ripped it out, while we were shut down, and we built probably the world's best sports bar that once Massachusetts legalizes sports betting, it will be the best sports book on the East Coast hands down.
We put in new food and beverage offerings. We reconfigured the entire casino. We changed out our casino loyalty program, and our database has been growing exponentially. We have over 418,000 people in the database. And at the trajectory that it's growing now, that's probably going to double over the next 2 years.
So Encore Boston Harbor, again, is only at the beginning of its growth and the North American assets really couldn't be in a better position.   There was a little bit of concern that maybe the stimulus money or pent-up demand, et cetera, was causing some of this? And that may be true for the third quarter and what we experienced in the summer, but it's certainly continuing.
In October, Wynn Las Vegas had its best month on record, highest EBITDA, highest margin and we held below our normal range. Same at Encore Boston Harbor. The group business is coming back. We've seen groups taking up over 30% of our room nights in August and September.
And the way that we're running these facilities now and the way that we're yielding and being unrelenting on price because people like the quality, the flow-through is happening. Just last weekend, our average rate was $780 in Las Vegas, and we're at 99% occupancy. And that is continuing into the future because we're taking market share and Las Vegas itself is growing.
Turning to Macau. We've had, as everyone in the market has had fits and starts there as to the business. But what has been very encouraging over the last month has been the consultation process with the government. It's been open, it's been transparent, it's been productive, and we feel very good about the future of Macau and our position in Macau.
Looking at Wynn Interactive. We launched lots of new products this quarter that we're very proud of. We made great progress in Arizona with first-time depositors . And we're seeing good customer feedback and our retention is quite strong. However, the market is really not sustainable right now.
Competitors are spending too much to get customers. And the economics are just not something that we're going to participate in, in the short term. So while we built the brand, we launched the product in the third quarter, we're going to be focused on building a long-term business that's sustainable, that is not losing lots and lots of money.
So we are shifting our strategy to think about the future, think about the long term, think about cash preservation. And we remain very confident that we'll create significant value for the Wynn Resort shareholders with our digital strategy.
With that, I'm going to go ahead and turn it over to Craig. Congratulations, Craig."

Turning to the quarter. At Wynn Las Vegas, we generated $183.4 million of adjusted property EBITDA on $476 million of operating revenue. Overall, our hotel occupancy reached 83% in the quarter, with 93% occupancy on weekends. Importantly, we stayed true to our luxury brand and have resisted dropping rate with overall ADR reaching $392 during the third quarter of '21, nearly 30% above Q3 2019 levels.
Our other non-gaming business saw broad-based strength across F&B and retail, which was also well above pre-pandemic levels. In the casino, our Q3 '21 slot handle was 31% above Q3 2019, and table drop was 18% above Q3 '19, despite still suppressed international play due to COVID-related travel challenges.
The team in Las Vegas has done a great job of controlling costs without negatively impacting the guest experience, delivering a record adjusted property EBITDA margin of 38.5% in the quarter. OpEx per day was $3 million in Q3 '21, approximately $250,000 per day below Q3 2019 levels despite the 19% increase in revenue. As new high-margin business like groups and convention returned to the property, we expect OpEx to increase modestly, but we remain committed to maintaining the cost structure that appropriately balances margins and our exacting service standards.
In Boston, we generated another record quarter with adjusted property EBITDA of $64.6 million in Q3 on a record EBITDA margin of 33.6%. We remain very disciplined on the cost side there, too with OpEx per day, excluding a $3 million benefit from a few onetime items of $950,000 in Q3 '21, a decrease of over 25% compared to $1.3 million per day in Q4 '19 and a modest increase relative to 2Q '21.
Our Macau operations delivered $10.2 million of EBITDA in the quarter on $312 million of operating revenue, while business in the quarter was challenging due to the evolving COVID situation, we remain disciplined on costs. Our OpEx, excluding gaming tax and the reversal of certain performance-based incentive accruals in the third quarter was approximately $2.1 million per day. We continue to be well positioned to drive strong operating leverage as the business recovers. 
Turning to Wynn Interactive. In Q3, the business generated approximately $645 million in total turnover, disproportionately weighted to September. In late August, we launched a number of key product improvements, which have been well received by customers.
On a normalized basis, Wynn Interactive is now run rating over $170 million of gross revenue. During the quarter and since, we have achieved several other key milestones for the business, including launching day 1 in Arizona, where we drove over 26,000 first-time depositors through September 30, securing a number of additional market access agreements, obtaining a license to operate in the state of New York and becoming an official sports betting partner of the NFL.
While sports betting remains an exciting, high-growth market and will potentially be a $30 billion to $40 billion TAM over time, the marketplace is proving to be very competitive with multiple operators deploying meaningful marketing dollars, driving high cost per acquisition and significant customer bonus offers.
In light of this dynamic, we have -- we are intentionally pivoting our approach to scaling, taking a more measured and long-term focus to grow a healthy and sustainable business, as Matt mentioned. Thus, we expect our Q3 and Q4 EBITDA burn, driven heavily by our branding campaign and preopening user acquisition in Arizona will decline materially beginning in Q1 2022, as we focus on cost per acquisition that is commensurate with customer lifetime values.
We continue to believe in our team, our product and the longer-term opportunity. And there's certainly a path to grow our business in ways that create value for Wynn Resorts shareholders. But the current combination of large-scale brand spend, performance marketing spend and customer bonuses that we see in the marketplace does not drive unit economics that meet our return requirements.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our liquidity position remains very strong with global cash and revolver availability of over $3.7 billion as of September 30. In Macau, we had approximately $1.8 billion of available liquidity as of September 30. And in the U.S., we had total available liquidity of approximately $1.9 billion as of September 30.
As previously announced, during the quarter, Wynn Macau, Limited entered into a new $1.5 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in 2025. The arrangement includes broad participation by our group of supportive existing lenders, including local and international banks.
Borrowing under the new facility, along with $200 million of cash on hand, we are used to refinance and retire our existing senior secured credit  facility. Finally, our CapEx in the quarter was $103 million, and we remain prudent with respect to CapEx, while we gain further confidence in the recovery. As a reminder, we are limited in what we can say about Wynn Interactive due to the live S-4 that we have on file.
With that, we'll now open up the call to Q&A. Operator?"

In the current environment, there are certainly opportunities for us to do ROI-positive acquisition. They absolutely exist. It's really a question of scale. So if you're not trying to be aggressive and drive headline market share with large-scale brand spend, performance spend, hyper-aggressive customer promos, there are absolutely opportunities to grow the business over the course of the longer term."

I mean I know you know this formula better than probably anyone else on this call.
Can you talk about the prevailing like just level of what you're seeing out there? Because one challenge we, I think, all run into as analysts is the formula kind of spits out whatever in a way, a little bit of whatever you want.
So the more you spend on marketing, you can justify it if your LTV is higher, and it's hard for us to kind of independently validate. So just a little bit of thought around like what is that prevailing level of spend out there and sort of what do you maybe want it to be to make the model or math work to what you think is going to be a profitable long term?"

What I would say is that you really have kind of 3 elements that impact this, right? You have brand spend, you have performance spend, where you're actually buying digital ads to bring customers directly to the product.
And then you have the underlying promotion that you're providing to the customer. And some participants in the market have structural advantages in those areas. Some participants don't. And so when you're pulling all 3 of those levers, into a very, very aggressive market where there's a ton of competition and a ton of folks doing the same thing, it can become particularly difficult, particularly in states where you're entering the market late. So in Arizona as an example, where we did 26,000-plus FTDs over the course of September that's a great outcome.
Other states that -- where maybe you're entering or scaling a little bit later, it becomes much more offer-driven. And you can pretty -- again, pretty quickly get upside down. So I think what we're focused on is leveraging the advantages that we have, right? We have a database, we have brands. And to the extent that we're not aggressively chasing every single lever, we can build a business over the longer term. That's a great business into what will eventually be a really, really strong TAM."

It just happens to be, over time, a more expensive piece of debt than we observed in the bond markets today. At the end of the day, each operator is going to make their own decision and form their own strategy. Being an opco has its advantages and has its disadvantages depending upon what's happening in the broader business.
So I don't think it's an operational question other than the willingness to continue to reinvest in your business and how you do that, but I don't think it's a day-to-day operational question per se."

Yes, we were really pleased to be awarded that license yesterday. And New York clearly has the potential to be one of the largest addressable markets in the U.S. Given the tax rate, as you point out, it's a prime example of a market where you need to be incredibly prudent with respect to marketing and bonusing spend, which obviously, as you also pointed out, a theme that I discussed pretty heavily in my prepared remarks.
We have a great database in New York, particularly in the more affluent areas of the state. And certainly, to the extent that you're prudent with marketing spend and bonusing, there's the opportunity to build a business there over time. But no doubt, the tax rate is a headwind that we all have to acknowledge."

And there are other potential new jurisdictions that could be really exciting, actually. And what's so great about this company is our design team and architecture team, over 100 people that are responsible for Mirage and Treasure Island and Bellagio and Wynn, basically the modern day integrated resort are all intact and excited.
And you can't build something new if you haven't built these things in the past, and our team is really good at that and understands how to make these things work, both financially, but more importantly, for the customers. So If a new opportunity comes up, that makes sense for Wynn and the Wynn brand, I think that we will -- the team will continue to look at it."

Can I follow up on a quick one related to the online gaming strategy, if I could. I'm just curious with the approach of so many online betting operators, is that revenue matters early and at not -- I would say, not at any cost, but that -- and the market seems very willing to value on multiples of revenue. And I mean, I'm old school, and I think as you do that profitability matters more than that.
But what -- how do you -- I guess, what are your thoughts about if you don't focus on that in the early stages, you mentioned that entering late is more offer driven maybe than getting it on day 1. And so it seems like that suggests that you do see a trade-off of -- that there will be expense later if you don't sort of capture the topline market share upfront. So I wonder if you could just put some context around that."

So that's where we're focused. It's much more about the return on the spend, the return on the ad spend. And certainly, we believe that we have the ability to do that over time. It doesn't mean that we're going to intentionally enter markets late."
