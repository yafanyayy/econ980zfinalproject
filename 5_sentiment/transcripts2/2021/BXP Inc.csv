Today, I'm going to depart from my typical organizational remarks. And instead summarize all the reasons why we are confident in Boston Properties future prospects and enthusiastic about the company's growth potential at this unique point in time. As part of my comments, I will address accomplishments and challenges of the past year. Current capital and property market conditions as well as Boston Properties capital allocation decisions and strategy. So why BXP? And why now? 
I will begin with 3 points on Boston properties potential for income growth, both in the short and long-term from where we closed out 2020. First, our variable income streams will recover. Over the next 24 months, Boston properties will likely enjoy 1 of its most significant and predictable improvements in economic conditions and leasing activity. As we witnessed the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. 2 vaccines with high efficacy rates have been FDA approved, 5.8% of Americans have already received at least 1 dose of the vaccine
[Audio Gap] 
we have been collecting through the pandemic over 99% of our office rents owed demonstrating the quality of our buildings and office tenants. Only 7.1% of our leases roll over this year, and we experienced 20% roll-ups on average the last 3 years, providing a cushion for decreases in market rent caused by the pandemic. We have signed over 600,000 square feet of leases on currently vacant space that will experience rent commencement in 2021. We expect the noncash charges experienced in 2020 for accrued rent balances to diminish, if not cease in 2021. We are now recognizing rent on a cash basis for all theater and co-working tenants as well as the vast majority of retail credits we consider at risk. 
We will also be delivering in whole or part 3 assets into service this year, 100 Causeway, 159 East 53rd Street and 200 West Street, just under 1 million square feet in the aggregate and 95% leased. Third, Boston Properties has significant external growth drivers, which are readily quantifiable over the next 4 years. We currently have under development and redevelopment 7 projects comprising 3.7 million square feet and $2.2 billion in total investment. These projects are 88% pre-leased, fully funded with cash on our balance sheet and projected to generate cash yields on cost at stabilization of approximately 7%. 
In addition, we recently delivered 3 Class A urban apartment complexes in Boston, Reston and Oakland, with an aggregate of 1,350 units that are only 56% leased, and have substantial income upside as the economy reopens. We expect the income from delivering this development pipeline to add 3.4% annually to our FFO growth over the next 4 years. We also anticipate starts this year of over $800 million, the majority of which are new life science developments and conversions. 
And lastly, we own or control land aggregating over 16 million square feet of potential office, lab and residential development, which we will commence as dictated by market conditions. 
Now my next points relate to our business model and strategy. A core strategic principle for Boston properties is to build, acquire and own high-quality buildings. Our portfolio is dominated by Class A urban assets many among the leading buildings in their respective markets, such as Salesforce Tower, the General Motors Building, 200 Clarendon Street and Kendall Center. Higher quality buildings stay more occupied and perform better in times of recession, as certain customers take advantage of lower rents to upgrade their space. 
For example, VTS reported from their database that tours for Class A buildings in New York City went from 38% of total before the pandemic to 54% during the pandemic. Another hallmark of our quality strategy is market selection as we believe in the long-term health and attractiveness of our coastal gateway markets. We acknowledge the economic damage to local businesses and city budgets, the pandemic has brought as well as individual relocations to lower tax jurisdictions. But we remain confident in the attractiveness of our target markets for 2 basic reasons; the clustering of knowledge workers and increased barriers to new supply. The cities where we currently and aspire to operate, New York, San Francisco, Boston, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and Seattle, have unmatched educational, cultural and civic Resources which attract the leading clusters of knowledge workers in the U.S., particularly in computer science and life sciences. Knowledge workers have more job opportunities and are more productive when working with others in clustered environments. 
Future job growth and office demand is going to be driven in the technology and life science fields where our target markets have a distinct clustering advantage. To create value in office real estate as an owner, you need rental growth, which is driven by both job growth and barriers to supply. Our markets have built in obstacles to new development, including a dearth of available sites difficulty in permitting, anti development local ordinances and cost and complexity in construction. 
My last point on business model is Boston Properties fully integrated operating capability and quality of execution. In 2020, we were able to lease 3.7 million square feet with a weighted average lease term of 8.6 years, which is around 60% of our recent annual leasing averages while the leasing activity in our markets was approximately 40% of recent annual averages. In all our core cities, we are a market-leading participant providing advantages in assessing new investment opportunities, procurement and attracting and retaining talent. We are an industry leader in ESG performance as measured by GRESB, the EPA, U.S. GBC, Energy Star, Fit Well and others and were recently recognized as the leading office company and second best property company in Newsweek's 2021 Most Responsible Companies ranking. 
My next point relate to valuation. Because of the pandemic and the variability in our parking, retail and hotel income streams, Boston Properties FFO dropped approximately 15% the last 3 quarters of 2020 versus pre-pandemic levels, which is clearly disconnected from our stock price, which has dropped 37% over the same period. The gap is caused by expectations, specifically concerned about Gateway markets addressed earlier and the impact of work from home on office demand. I will reiterate that we think more remote work is here to stay after the pandemic, but concerns over the impact to office space demand are overblown. 
Business leaders want their employees back in the office to foster culture, collaboration, teamwork and mentoring and to provide more supervision. In a recent employee survey completed by Gensler, workers want to return to the office as well, where they believe they are most productive and collaborative. But 52% want a hybrid model with more time to work from home for convenience and safety from COVID-19, fear of which should dissipate over time. However, 90% of those employees surveyed won an assigned workstation when in the office. And while only 21% of those surveyed had a private office layout, 47% wanted it. Though employees may be working remotely more in the future, it will be difficult for employers to translate lower census into space savings due to employees' desire for more privacy and a fixed workstation. There is also a disconnect between where the private real estate market is valuing Class A office assets in gateway markets and where the public market is valuing Boston Properties. 
At our current share price, the look-through cap rate on our portfolio is 5.9%. High-quality office assets comparable to much of Boston Properties portfolio are trading at sub-5% cap rates. Though office transaction volumes were down materially in the last 3 quarters of 2020 from the prior year, activity improved each quarter as investors return to the market. Volumes were down 45% in the fourth quarter versus the fourth quarter in 2019, but were up 59% sequentially from the third quarter. Office was no more out of favor than other asset classes after the pandemic as office transaction volume was 29% of total commercial real estate volume, both in 2019 and the last 3 quarters of 2020. 
There continues to be a robust market for life science real estate as well as quality office buildings and technology-driven markets with more limited leasing exposures. Just in life science, life sciences a portfolio dominated by a leasehold interest in University Park in Cambridge sold for $3.4 billion, around $1,500 a square foot and a mid-4% cap rate with roll up potential. And a partial interest in Discovery Park in Cambridge was sold for $720 million, representing $1,190 a square foot and a 4.7% cap rate. And in office, 410 10th Avenue in New York City sold for $950 million, which equated to $1,490 a square foot and a 4.5% cap rate. And 510 Townsend and 505 Brandon streets in San Francisco sold for a combined $570 million, $1,280 a square foot and a 5% cap rate. Though both buildings are leased long term, one is being sublet in full by its user. 
And in the Seattle CBD, a leasehold interest in 2 sold for $700 million, $1,020 a square foot and a 4.7% cap rate and 1918 8th Avenue sold for $625 million, $940 a square foot and also a 4.7% cap rate. There is material investment activity in like assets to Boston properties. And with interest rates forecast to remain low and the economic recovery described earlier, we expect transaction activity to increase and cap rates potentially to tighten for well leased assets. And lastly, Boston Properties has the balance sheet and access to capital to take advantage of opportunities that will present themselves as a result of the pandemic. 
We currently have $3.2 billion in liquidity. And after the redemption of our unsecured bonds and fully funding our current development pipeline, we'll have $1.5 billion of liquidity remaining. We have been more actively monetizing in service assets, having completed $570 million in gross sales in 2020, and we expect a similarly elevated level of activity this year. We have access in size at attractive terms to the unsecured debt market, if needed, and have been developing increasingly formalized relationships with large-scale private equity partners to help us fund acquisitions. We have a reasonable pipeline of potential new opportunities in our core markets in Seattle and continue to look for investments that require leasing and/or redevelopment to take advantage of our operating skills and to create higher returns. 
As mentioned, we also intend to invest more aggressively into life science real estate and have 5.8 million square feet of new development and redevelopment projects under our control located primarily in the life science hubs of Cambridge, Waltham and South San Francisco. 
So in conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to create a very challenging environment for many sectors of the U.S. economy and commercial real estate, including office assets. However, the end of the pandemic is approaching, and we are confident Boston properties will emerge with strength and momentum given our portfolio quality, income stability, growth potential, access to capital and highly engaged management team. 
Doug, over to you."
368278,700977355,2182188,"Boston Properties, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2021",2021-01-27,"Earnings Calls","BXP, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Owen. I thought about just sort of stopping right there and starting with questions, but I guess I'll make some remarks and give some time for Mike as well. Good morning, everybody. As we sit here in January of '21, we are shifting from COVID, C",2012,"Thanks, Owen. I thought about just sort of stopping right there and starting with questions, but I guess I'll make some remarks and give some time for Mike as well. 
Good morning, everybody. As we sit here in January of '21, we are shifting from COVID, COVID and COVID as the obstacle to a pickup in activity to vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, as the signal to rejuvenate tenant conversations about bringing staff back to the office and starting the leasing transaction processes. There is no question that the rapid increase in COVID cases over the last 6 weeks of 2020 and the beginning of 2021 suppressed leasing tours in discussions during that period of time. But in the last 2 weeks, to large Boston companies have announced their expected return to work dates. We signed an LOI for a 70,000 square foot tenant that's going to need space in December of 2021. And just yesterday, Amazon announced in Boston that they are committing to another 630,000 square feet to be built office building and bringing 3,000 additional jobs to the Boston CBD. 
So while the first half of '21 is expected to be quiet, we are cautiously optimistic that we've been through the worst of the pandemic and that the latter part of '21 will have a discernible pickup in leasing transaction volume, parking revenue and retail sales. The year-end market leasing reports that are published by the commercial brokerage organization held a few surprises, as you probably heard through many of the analyst calls. Leasing volumes were way off their historical pace, and with the significant sublet space added to the market, we saw negative absorption and increased availability everywhere. 
It's important to remember that there are 2 types of sublet space. First, space that comes from users that have had changes in their employee headcount and are clearly no longer going to need all that space. And then there's a second group. Tenants that are being opportunistic, listing their entire premises, by the way, at no cost to them, with an expectation that they'll decide what to do if they get an acceptable actionable offer down the road. They may reoccupy, they may relocate and transact or they may find a way to sublet a portion of their space, we just don't know. But based on all the conversations we have had with our technology, our life science, our professional service, our legal, our financial firms, as well as the leasing brokers that are responsible for these listings, a change in workplace strategy, aka, we're going to work from home, where we're going to go to a disaggregated workforce, that's not what's driving the bulk of the sublet activity. 
One thing is sure, not all the sublet space is actually available. You might find the following illustrative ad. In Midtown Manhattan, after the Great recession, according to CBRE, from 2008 to 2009, about 24 million square feet of space was put on the sublet market. Between 2009 and 2010, 13.6 million or 57% of that was withdrawn from the market. Not all space is available. The Boston Properties office portfolio ended the year at 90.1% occupied. The quarterly sequential drop is entirely due to the addition of Dock 72 at 33% leased into the in-service portfolio. As Owen said, we have 600,000 plus square feet of signed leases 134 basis points in our in-service portfolio that has not yet commenced revenue and hence is still defined as vacant, but it has been leased. We completed another 1.2 million square feet of leasing during the quarter. On a relative basis, my view of the ranking activity on our portfolio, active lease negotiations, tours, RFPs in our markets is as follows, starting with the best and moving to the least. 
Boston Waltham, by the way, we don't have any available space in Cambridge. Northern Virginia, Midtown Manhattan, Princeton, Los Angeles, the Peninsula Silicon Valley, DC and finally, the CBD of San Francisco. During the fourth quarter, in the Boston CBD, we did 5 leases, including another full floor of new tenant at Atlantic. The cash starting rent on this full floor lease will be 34% higher than the expiring rent, and there are future rent increases. The cash rent on the other 4 leases had a weighted average increase of about 30%. 
We continue to have additional activity in our CBD Boston portfolio, albeit with a number of smaller tenants under 10,000 square feet. A few are looking for incremental growth, and a few were considering letting their 2021 leases expire and are now actively engaged in short-term renewal conversations. I also want to note that we finally obtained possession of the 120,000 square foot 2-story former Lord & Taylor building on Boylston Street during the early part of this month. This was a big win as we believe we can find a far more productive use for this box that has been under leased since the mid 1960s to Lord & Taylor. 
In our suburban Boston portfolio, we completed 226,000 square feet of new leasing, including all of the remaining space at 20 CityPoint, First Generation. This is in addition to the life science lease we did at 200 West Street. The cash rent on the second generation leases, about 150,000 square feet was up an average of 23% on a cash basis. We continue to have additional activity in suburban Boston. 
In Waltham, we're negotiating a 60,000 square foot lease extension, a lease with a new tenant for a 63,000 square foot block of space and we're responding to a number of large life science lab requirements. At the moment, we don't have any ready to go vacant lab space, but we hope to begin our conversion of 880 Winter Street 220,000 square feet during the second quarter. And our 300,000 square foot 180 CityPoint lab building has been fully designed, fully permitted, and we are simply waiting final construction bids over the next few months. 
Turning to Northern Virginia. This quarter, we completed 6 renewals at our VA 95 single-story park, totaling about 218,000 square feet. In addition to the VW commitment in Reston Next, we completed another 82,000 square feet in the town center in Reston. In total, in 2020, we completed 1.15 million square feet of leasing in Reston Town Center. We still have more work to do. But we have a good start to 2021 with lease negotiations ongoing for an additional 60,000 square foot block of space. 
In Reston Town Center, rents are basically flat to slightly down 1% to 2% on the relet, since the expiring cash rents have been increasing contractually by 2.5% to 3% for the last 10 years, and they will continue to do so on a going-forward basis. Our D.C. CBD exposure rests in our JV assets. But here too, activity in our portfolio has picked up. We completed 24,000 square feet of leasing during the quarter, and we're negotiating over 120,000 square feet of leases as we speak. In New York City, we executed our lease with Ascena at Times Square Tower for about 132,000 square feet of office space. We completed 2 floor deals in the New York City market, each 31,000 square feet at 601 Lex, one was a 1 year extension, and the second was a 10-year renewal and the cash rent decreased about 8% on that renewal. 
We also did 4 small transactions at 250 West 55th Street in Time square tower totaling 26,000 square feet, 3 were short-term and 1 was a 10 year deal. We're negotiating a full floor of transaction at 399 Park on a space that's not expiring until the end of 2021. While we didn't do much leasing in Princeton during the quarter, we have a number of active discussions ongoing that we believe tenants will be making decisions to expand or relocate in late '21 and are strongly considering Carnegie Center. 
When we talk about California, you need to appreciate the fact that the state has been strongly discouraging tenants from asking their employees to go to their offices for the last 11 months. The uncertainty level and the lack of pedestrian activity at the Street plane, particularly in the CBD of San Francisco, has been more severe than anywhere else in our portfolio. And this has affected tenant's appetite for making any decisions. Just to put this year in perspective. From 2017 to 2019, there were, on average, 10 -- excuse me, 14 tech company leases per year in excess of 100,000 square feet. In 2020, there were none. Our San Francisco assets are 95% leased, and we have 280,000 square feet expiring in '21. The third quarter produced just 3 transactions totaling about 23,000 square feet at EC. And during the fourth quarter, we did another 4 leases, all renewals, up about 18% on a cash basis totaling 20,000 square feet, pretty slow there. 
In South San Francisco, our gateway JV is planning the construction commencement of 751 Gateway, a 230,000 square feet ground up lab development to begin over the next few months, followed by the conversion of 651 Gateway, which will be a renovated building, if we're able to relocate the existing tenant there. There's more activity in the Silicon Valley Mountain View area than the rest of the Bay Area. 2 technology companies did 100,000 square foot plus expansions during the quarter, and there are 3 active requirements right now in the market in excess of 200,000 square feet. There continues to be a slow resurgence of medical device, alternative energy, automotive, the hardware side of technology that are all out looking for space. We are seeing a few of these organizations looking at our Mountain view single-story product, which is plug-and-play ready. 
In Santa Clara, we're going to be taking our 218,000 square foot Peterson way building out of service when the lease expires in the second quarter of '21. This was a covered land play and contributed about $4.8 million of revenue in 2020. We have entitlements for a 630,000 square foot campus, permitted and improved, ready to go. In spite of the challenging COVID-related conditions in California, in Santa Monica, we continue our renewal negotiations with our 2021 expirations. And as I said at the outset, we signed a 70,000 square foot LOI at Colorado center from a new tenant. You may recall earlier this year, we actually did an expansion with another technology company at the Santa Monica Business Park. 
I purposely didn't make any comments about market rents during my remarks. With very limited activity, any conjecture about where rents will settle out is pure opinion. What I can tell you is that there will be large differences between deals cut on sublet space and direct space. Sublet landlords will have less appetite for capital and more leeway with lowering face rents or giving free rent. There will be tenants, however, that simply don't want the risk of sublet space. Will that prime tenant actually pay their rent for the full term? Is that a risk worth taking? Or the conditions and others issues associated with that may make them very uncomfortable with those risks. There will be a very wide gap between the bid and the ask on direct space at the outset until we have a meaningful amount of direct deal comparable transactions for the market to understand. 
Landlords with vacant space that are tenants that want a new installation will use capital to entice users to this space, not necessarily space rent. And landlords working on renewals will be more aggressive with swing space where it can be made available or lower contractual rates if the installation that's there currently works for the user. However, there will be a flight to quality and the better buildings as tenants see value in paying less of a premium to be in the best assets in these markets. Conditions are going to vary submarket by submarket. I'm going to stop there and yield the rest of our time to Mike."
368278,700977355,2182188,"Boston Properties, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2021",2021-01-27,"Earnings Calls","BXP, Inc.","Executives","Excellent. Thanks, Doug. Good morning. So I'm going to cover the details of our earnings for the fourth quarter.

So I'm going to cover the details of our earnings for the fourth quarter. I'll also explain our guidance for the first quarter that we provided and some insight into our expectations for the full year 2021. 
We've reinstated quarterly FFO guidance, which we hope will be helpful and serve as an indicator of our increased confidence in the operating environment. Our office tenant collections remain strong, and we believe the write-offs are largely behind us. We also continue to execute on new and renewal lease requirements as evidenced by the 1.2 million square feet of leasing in the fourth quarter and the 3.7 million square feet of leasing in 2020 overall, despite the pandemic-related shutdowns. We're encouraged by the rollout of the vaccine and are confident we will see a return of workers to the office en mass, but there remains uncertainty with respect to timing. We anticipate our ancillary revenues, such as parking and retail will continue to be weak until the population increases. Once we have better visibility into the timing, we expect to restore full year guidance as well. 
Our fourth quarter results contained 2 charges that I would like to explain. The first is a $60 million noncash impairment of our equity investment in Dock 72. Our 670,000 square foot development we put into service in the Brooklyn Navy yard. This investment is held in an unconsolidated joint venture, where we own 50%. Because the investment is unconsolidated, GAAP requires a mark to current fair value. Also, while the $0.35 per share charge is a deduction from net income, it is added back to arrive at FFO. So it has no impact on our reported FFO pursuant to NAREIT's definition. 
Dock 72 is only 33% leased, as Doug said. And while we had some promising leasing activity pre-COVID, there's little activity today and the market conditions in Brooklyn have weakened. We have increased our projected costs to stabilize as well as modified and extended our anticipated lease-up. And the combination of this has resulted in a lower current fair value for the property. The extension of timing to achieve stabilization has a meaningful impact on fair value. We see Dock 72 as a unique situation, and we do not anticipate any additional impairments in the portfolio. The rest of our development pipeline is very well leased at 88%, our in-service portfolio is over 90% leased, and honestly, most of the assets have significant embedded gains. 
The second charge is a $38 million or $0.22 per share noncash charge to net income and FFO for the write-off of all accrued rental income for tenants in the co-working industry. While these tenants are paying rent today, we believe the ongoing length of the pandemic is stressing the sector's revenue and liquidity. As such, we do not believe they meet the standard to maintain an accrued rent asset on our balance sheet. As we discussed in both our second and third quarter earnings calls, co-working is the remaining tenant sector that we've been monitoring closely. It is possible we could face a few individual credit situations this year due to the impact of the pandemic across the portfolio, but we don't anticipate additional significant accrued rent write-offs to other sectors of tenants like we've experienced with retail and with co-working in 2020. 
For the fourth quarter, our reported FFO was $1.37 per share. If you exclude the accrued rent charge, our fourth quarter FFO would have been $1.59 per share and in line with consensus and the expectations that we shared with you last quarter. 
Now I'd like to look forward to 2021. We have provided first quarter 2021 guidance for FFO of $1.53 to $1.57 per share. At the midpoint, this is $0.04 per share lower than our fourth quarter 2020 FFO before charges. The decline is entirely due to approximately $0.10 per share of seasonally higher anticipated G&A. The first quarter is always our highest quarter for G&A due to accounting for compensation. If you look back historically, we typically record 30% of our annual G&A expense in the first quarter. The increase in G&A expense is anticipated to be partially offset by higher revenue contribution from our portfolio including the commencement of revenue for a portion of the signed leases that Doug described. We also expect lower interest expense. We are redeeming our $850 million bond issuance in mid-February with cash on hand. These bonds have a yield of 4.3%, and there will be no prepayment charge. We're currently earning close to 0 on our cash. So we will see the full benefit of lower interest expense for the second half of this quarter and for the rest of 2021. 
So as we think about the full year 2021, there's a few things to consider. If you simply annualize the midpoint of our first quarter guidance, you get to about $6.20 per share. But that does not account for the seasonality of our G&A, the reduction of interest expense from our bond redemption or the incremental impact of leased developments coming online during the year. For modeling purposes, we suggest you consider adding the following to the Q1 annualized FFO of $6.20 per share; $0.19 per share for the impact of lower G&A for the rest of the year, $0.08 per share from lower interest expense due to the bond redemption and $0.05 per share of incremental FFO from new developments coming online, including 159 East 53rd Street, which is 96% leased to NYU and where we expect to commence revenue in the second quarter, 100 Causeway Street in Boston, which is 94% leased with projected revenue phasing in starting in the third quarter, and 200 West Street, our life science development in Waltham, which is 100% leased and is projected to deliver in December. So adjusting our first quarter annualized run rate for these known items gets to approximately $6.52 per share for 2021. 
That said, we are not providing full year guidance for FFO because there remains uncertainty than our variable income streams, including our ancillary income and our same-property leasing, both of which impact revenues and occupancy. The timing of recovery from the pandemic is still unknown. It could have a material impact on the recovery of revenues from our parking, retail and hotel. Currently, these income streams are depressed. Their contribution is nearly $30 million lower on a quarterly basis than what we saw pre-pandemic. We are hopeful that a portion of this revenue will start to return in the back half of 2021, but the timing is really reliant on the success of the COVID vaccines and return to a safe and healthy environment in our cities. We also have lease expirations in 2021 that will impact our occupancy and same-property NOI. 
Our rollover for 2021 is 3.2 million square feet. As Doug described, we already have 610,000 square feet of leases signed that will take occupancy of currently vacant space this year. We're also actively working on over 1 million square feet of new leases and renewals across the portfolio. Overall, we expect our year-end 2021 occupancy to be flat to down 100 basis points compared to current occupancy. It's also worth noting that we have a meaningful amount of free rent that burned off in 2020 that will boost our cash same-property performance and AFFO in 2021, specifically at 399 Park Avenue, we had 450,000 square feet of space in build out and under free rent for 9 months in 2020 that is now in cash rent. And at the General Motors building, 160,000 square feet of office fees and a portion of our retail was under free rent for most of 2020 and are now paying cash rent. This showed up in our results in the fourth quarter with a $10 million increase in same-property cash NOI sequentially from Q3 to Q4. 
In summary, we're excited about the prospects for revenue and FFO growth. Our portfolio cash flow is expected to grow in 2021. The success of the vaccine program should give rise to the recovery of our ancillary revenue streams. And we have $2.2 billion of leased developments coming online over the next couple of years, all of which should drive future earnings growth and value. That completes our formal remarks. If you could open the lines up for questions, operator, that would be great."

But our method of sort of coming up with that number is to understand the amount of space that we have rolling over. And while we have a probability on renewals, the real variability is on how much of the vacant space that we currently have is going to, A, be leased and B be revenue producing. Because it has to be revenue producing, meaning we have to have delivered it and as a ready space or in second-generation and not tamales. And so it's -- that's what's really driving the number to sort of flat to negative because we just don't know what we're going to be asked to do relative to the delivery conditions of that space and when revenue is going to start. And as again, we sit here today with net basis points of lease space that's not revenue recognizing right now. And we just don't know where we're going to be as we get to the end of the year. And honestly, we expect our transaction volume is going to pick up as the year goes on, it's going to be slow in the first half of the year. And our expectation is if the vaccine rollout goods as we believe it will, that there will be a significant pickup at activity once people are back in school from a population perspective, and people are back in their desks, and people are feeling very confident about their business prospects. And so the third and fourth quarters are going to be back weighted, which again, impacts the revenue number."

And look, we're trying to provide as much assistance as we can but there are some variable pieces that are pretty big that would require a wide range, I would say. 
On the same-store, every 50 basis points of occupancy based upon our current kind of rental rates is about $15 million. So that's $0.09 a share is every 50 basis points of occupancy. The variable income streams that I talked about could add $30 million a quarter. So we just don't know when that's going to come in. I think that the hotel portion of that, which is minor, it is only $5 million a quarter that we think it's going to take longer. But the parking and the retail components of that, it could snap back more quickly. It could be third quarter, it could be fourth quarter. And it's just really hard for us to say when that's going to happen. So providing a meaningful guidance range to you all is just difficult at this time. So we've chosen not to do that. But I think I've given you a sense just on these comments of what our expectation is. If our occupancy is going to go down, then after you pull out the charges we incurred in 2020 from the same-store and you just think about run rate, if our occupancy goes down by 50 basis points on average, I would expect our same-store to be down very slightly. We look at these -- our lease-up on a lease by lease basis, so we've looked at all of our units. Our renewal retention has gone up, and you've seen it quarter-over-quarter during the pandemic. It was, I think, 56%, 57% this quarter, which is pretty good. So we've done that analysis to come up with kind of the occupancy views that we have based upon the activity that we're seeing today in the portfolio. Hopefully, that's helpful."

I think the reason for that is, most importantly, we're in a recession. And in all recessions, leasing activity slows down, businesses have more uncertain outcomes and CEOs are less likely to make major financial commitments, which are leases. So this is no different from prior recessions. I think office lags a bit. So I think you're going to -- we're probably not going to get more stronger leasing activity until later in the year when the virus dissipates, people come back to the office and the economy is clearly in improvement. 
As I said in my remarks, we acknowledge the impact of work from home and do believe that workers in America and possibly around the world will want to work from home on a part-time basis more frequently. So we acknowledge that impact, but we also see with our -- and we also see with CEOs, I think the importance that they see an in-person work and their strong interest in getting their employees back to the office. So then the issue is, okay, what's the impact of the additional part-time work on office demand? And again, to save space by having with people working at home on a part-time basis, you really need to do 2 things. You need to schedule when that time out of the office is because everybody can't be at an office on Monday or Friday; and 2, you have to go to flexible workstations and move people around. And again, if you're looking at employee preferences, one of them is they want to work from home more. And as I said in my remarks, 90% of the survey in the Gentler survey said they wanted a fixed workstations. So which employee preference will be accommodated. So again, we acknowledge there's an impact from work from home, but we think it's overblown for those."

We do have significant capital, but we also have significant ambition in terms of growing the company and making new investments that make sense for shareholders.

We have a reasonably significant portfolio that's already partnered with global leading real estate investors like Norges and CPP, and we think extending that type of business makes a lot of sense. Selling assets is not an efficient way for us to raise capital. Most, if not all, of our major assets have a significant tax gain, which requires a cash or it requires a special dividend. And therefore, the retention of capital is much lower. So for all those reasons, we think the joint ventures make sense.

And we're just waiting to see what happens with regards to the aspirations of these technology companies relative to understanding that there's a heck of a lot of additional labor available because of the recession in certain things that happened earlier in the year that residential rents have come down, so affordability is very significantly changed.

Are they finding sublease space or maybe some cutting or eliminating their physical footprint or some moving to other markets. So I guess the question is, are there any trends you're picking up on that front on the tenants that are moving out that are clearly different from pre-pandemic?"

Again, knock on wood, maybe something goes wrong with the vaccines or there's a slower rollout or there's something goes on. But in essence, unlike an economic recovery, which perhaps is harder to predict, again, if this is all about vaccinations, maybe this one is easier to predict. And I think as all of us come out of the isolation that we're getting really tired of and return to the world into our offices into restaurants and to theater and to each other, the economy is going to reopen and I think jobs are going to come back. I think of all the small businesses that we'll get to reopen and restart as part of all this. So we do think this year, we're going to have a significant improvement in economic activity.

As more people get vaccinated and more people are immune because they've recovered from infection. So when I think it's deemed to be safe, I do think then companies are going to be faced with the dilemma, Michael, that you described, which is, okay, we want people back and how hard are we going to push it? Because our employee base some of these employees do like the work from home and they want to be out of the office. I don't think they want to be out of the office full time, but they certainly want to be out of the office more. So these employers are going to have to decide what are we comfortable with? What do we need to do to be competitive in our industry in terms of in-person work and what kind of policies should we put up to balance this competitiveness issue with the retention of talent? And I think each company is going to make those decisions differently. But again, I think as the infection rate goes down, and my assumption is that will be over the summer, I do think you'll see a lot more companies requiring employees to come back to work. And I think different companies will have different policies around work from home."

And so as more and more of -- as we see more and more of those types of things occurring, it's going to be quite clear that the difficulties associated with asking your employees to come back to work are going to have dissipated because they're going to have demonstrated that they are comfortable being in and around other human beings in a very close proximate way. If you're a believer in the efficacy of the vaccine and the vaccine does what it really is designed to do, which is you don't get sick if you're in contact with the virus, I think there's going to be a stronger desire for people to come back. Again, once we've solved those other issues, which are we've now put people in a position where there are children are going back-to-school, where they're comfortable going on public transportation, where all of the things that have been impediments to at least intellectually, people coming to work, and we have a governmental programmatic desire to get people back in seats, right, as opposed to saying, we think that people should remain as far apart as possible because we're trying to keep this pandemic in containment, which is where we are and have been for the last 11 months."

But in New York, everything is sort of bled in over a 5- year period of time as those changes occur. So year-to-year, it's not a very big change, 8-K versus what it would have been were we not in this evaluation challenge. In a market like Boston, there's been so much addition to the supply that we actually don't expect to see much in the way of significant rises in real estate taxes because the assessments have gone up, but there's more base. The cities have actually reduced the tariff rate so it hasn't been significant. And similarly, I think in the greater D.C. area, we'll obviously see -- they have valuations in the district, and you don't see much difference unless your building is being revalued. But net-net, I mean, it's quite clear that to the extent that a jurisdiction has some physical issues, it's going to be looking to its real estate taxpayers to bear a portion of that. But I don't think in the short term, it's going to be a meaningful detractor in our revenue or impact our margins in a very significant way."

Today, I'm going to depart from my typical organizational remarks and instead summarize all the reasons why we are confident in Boston Properties' future prospects and enthusiastic about the company'",2014,"Thank you. Thank you, Sara, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to depart from my typical organizational remarks and instead summarize all the reasons why we are confident in Boston Properties' future prospects and enthusiastic about the company's growth potential at this unique point in time. As part of my comments, I will address accomplishments and challenges of the past year, current capital and property market's conditions as well as Boston Properties' capital allocation decisions and strategy. So why BXP? And why now?
I will begin with 3 points on Boston Properties' potential for income growth, both in the short and long term from where we closed out 2020. First, our variable income streams will recover. Over the next 24 months, Boston Properties will likely enjoy one of its most significant and predictable improvements in economic conditions and leasing activity as we witness the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. Two vaccines with high efficacy rates have been FDA approved, 5.8% of Americans have already received at least 1 dose of the vaccine.
The more easily refrigerated Johnson & Johnson vaccine is near approval and health authorities are advising that anyone who wants to be vaccinated will be accommodated by this summer. The Biden administration is aggressively pursuing a more rapid vaccine rollout as well as economic stimulus to help bridge the economic damage caused by the pandemic.
Given the herd immunity created by a high percentage of the population either recovered from infection and/or vaccinated, infections will likely drop precipitously in the middle of the year. We are all anxious to come out of isolation and return to our normal lives. So as the infection rate drops, the economy will reopen and individuals will return to offices, restaurants, shops, theaters and travel. Approximately $97 million of Boston Properties' FFO decrease in 2020 came from the variable income streams of parking, our single hotel and retail customers, all of which were devastated by the lockdowns. And we will likely see a strong recovery in these variable income streams in the near term as the economy reopens.
Second, Boston Properties' office portfolio is stable. We have been collecting through the pandemic over 99% of our office rents owed demonstrating the quality of our buildings and office tenants. Only 7.1% of our leases roll over this year, and we experienced 20% roll-ups on average the last 3 years, providing a cushion for decreases in market rent caused by the pandemic.
We have signed over 600,000 square feet of leases on currently vacant space that will experience rent commencement in 2021. We expect the noncash charges experienced in 2020 for accrued rent balances to diminish, if not cease in 2021. We are now recognizing rent on a cash basis for all theater and co-working tenants as well as the vast majority of retail credits we consider at risk. We will also be delivering in whole or part 3 assets into service this year, 100 Causeway, 159 East 53rd Street and 200 West Street, just under 1 million square feet in the aggregate and 95% leased.
Third, Boston Properties has significant external growth drivers, which are readily quantifiable over the next 4 years. We currently have under development and redevelopment 7 projects comprising 3.7 million square feet and $2.2 billion in total investment. These projects are 88% pre-leased, fully funded with cash on our balance sheet and projected to generate cash yields on cost at stabilization of approximately 7%.
In addition, we recently delivered 3 Class A urban apartment complexes in Boston, Reston and Oakland, with an aggregate of 1,350 units that are only 56% leased and have substantial income upside as the economy reopens. We expect the income from delivering this development pipeline to add 3.4% annually to our FFO growth over the next 4 years. We also anticipate starts this year of over $800 million, the majority of which are new life science developments and conversions.
And lastly, we own or control land aggregating over 16 million square feet of potential office, lab and residential development, which we will commence as dictated by market conditions.
Now my next points relate to our business model and strategy. A core strategic principle for Boston Properties is to build, acquire and own high-quality buildings. Our portfolio is dominated by Class A urban assets many among the leading buildings in their respective markets, such as Salesforce Tower, the General Motors Building, 200 Clarendon Street and Kendall Center.
Higher quality buildings stay more occupied and perform better in times of recession, as certain customers take advantage of lower rents to upgrade their space. For example, VTS reported from their database that tours for Class A buildings in New York City went from 38% of total before the pandemic to 54% during the pandemic.
Another hallmark of our quality strategy is market selection as we believe in the long-term health and attractiveness of our coastal gateway markets. We acknowledge the economic damage to local businesses and city budgets the pandemic has brought as well as individual relocations to lower tax jurisdictions. But we remain confident in the attractiveness of our target markets for 2 basic reasons: the clustering of knowledge workers and increased barriers to new supply. The cities where we currently and aspire to operate, New York, San Francisco, Boston, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and Seattle, have unmatched educational, cultural and civic resources which attract the leading clusters of knowledge workers in the U.S., particularly in computer science and life sciences.
Knowledge workers have more job opportunities and are more productive when working with others in clustered environments. Future job growth and office demand is going to be driven in the technology and life science fields where our target markets have a distinct clustering advantage. To create value in office real estate as an owner, you need rental growth, which is driven by both job growth and barriers to supply. Our markets have built in obstacles to new development, including a dearth of available sites difficulty in permitting, antidevelopment local ordinances and cost and complexity in construction.
My last point on business model is Boston Properties' fully integrated operating capability and quality of execution. In 2020, we were able to lease 3.7 million square feet with a weighted average lease term of 8.6 years, which is around 60% of our recent annual leasing averages, while the leasing activity in our markets was approximately 40% of recent annual averages.
In all our core cities, we are a market-leading participant providing advantages in assessing new investment opportunities, procurement and attracting and retaining talent. We are an industry leader in ESG performance as measured by GRESB, the EPA, USGBC, Energy Star, Fitwel and others and were recently recognized as the leading office company and second best property company in Newsweek's 2021 Most Responsible Companies ranking.
My next points relate to valuation. Because of the pandemic and the variability in our parking, retail and hotel income streams, Boston Properties' FFO dropped approximately 15% the last 3 quarters of 2020 versus prepandemic levels, which is clearly disconnected from our stock price, which has dropped 37% over the same period. The gap is caused by expectations, specifically concerned about Gateway markets addressed earlier and the impact of work-from-home on office demand. I will reiterate that we think more remote work is here to stay after the pandemic, but concerns over the impact to office space demand are overblown.
Business leaders want their employees back in the office to foster culture, collaboration, teamwork and mentoring and to provide more supervision. In a recent employee survey completed by Gensler, workers want to return to the office as well, where they believe they are most productive and collaborative. But 52% want a hybrid model with more time to work-from-home for convenience and safety from COVID-19, fears of which should dissipate over time. However, 90% of those employees surveyed won an assigned workstation when in the office. And while only 21% of those surveyed had a private office layout, 47% wanted it. Though employees may be working remotely more in the future, it will be difficult for employers to translate lower census into space savings due to employees' desire for more privacy and a fixed workstation.
There is also a disconnect between where the private real estate market is valuing Class A office assets in Gateway markets and where the public market is valuing Boston Properties. At our current share price, the look-through cap rate on our portfolio is 5.9%. High-quality office assets comparable to much of Boston Properties' portfolio are trading at sub-5% cap rates. Though office transaction volumes were down materially in the last 3 quarters of 2020 from the prior year, activity improved each quarter as investors return to the market. Volumes were down 45% in the fourth quarter versus the fourth quarter in 2019, but were up 59% sequentially from the third quarter. Office was no more out of favor than other asset classes after the pandemic as office transaction volume was 29% of total commercial real estate volume, both in 2019 and the last 3 quarters of 2020.
There continues to be a robust market for life science real estate as well as quality office buildings and technology-driven markets with more limited leasing exposures. Just in life science, life science is a portfolio dominated by a leasehold interest in University Park in Cambridge sold for $3.4 billion, around $1,500 a square foot and a mid-4% cap rate with roll-up potential. And a partial interest in Discovery Park in Cambridge was sold for $720 million, representing $1,190 a square foot and a 4.7% cap rate. And in office, 410 10th Avenue in New York City sold for $950 million, which equated to $1,490 a square foot and a 4.5% cap rate. And 510 Townsend and 505 Brannan streets in San Francisco sold for a combined $570 million, $1,280 a square foot and a 5% cap rate. Though both buildings are leased long term, one is being sublet in full by its user.
And in the Seattle CBD, a leasehold interest in 2NU sold for $700 million, $1,020 a square foot and a 4.7% cap rate and 1918 8th Avenue sold for $625 million, $940 a square foot and also a 4.7% cap rate. There is material investment activity in like assets to Boston Properties. And with interest rates forecast to remain low and the economic recovery described earlier, we expect transaction activity to increase and cap rates potentially to tighten for well-leased assets.
And lastly, Boston Properties has the balance sheet and access to capital to take advantage of opportunities that will present themselves as a result of the pandemic. We currently have $3.2 billion in liquidity. And after the redemption of our unsecured bonds and fully funding our current development pipeline, we'll have $1.5 billion of liquidity remaining. We have been more actively monetizing in-service assets, having completed $570 million in gross sales in 2020, and we expect a similarly elevated level of activity this year.
We have access in size at attractive terms to the unsecured debt market, if needed, and have been developing increasingly formalized relationships with large-scale private equity partners to help us fund acquisitions. We have a reasonable pipeline of potential new opportunities in our core markets in Seattle and continue to look for investments that require leasing and/or redevelopment to take advantage of our operating skills and to create higher returns. As mentioned, we also intend to invest more aggressively into life science real estate and have 5.8 million square feet of new development and redevelopment projects under our control located primarily in the life science hubs of Cambridge, Waltham and South San Francisco.
So in conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to create a very challenging environment for many sectors of the U.S. economy and commercial real estate, including office assets. However, the end of the pandemic is approaching and we are confident Boston Properties will emerge with strength and momentum given our portfolio quality, income stability, growth potential, access to capital and highly engaged management team.
Doug, over to you."

I thought about just sort of stopping right there and starting with questions, but I guess I'll make some remarks and give some time for Mike as well.Good morning, everybody. As we sit here in January of '21, we are shifting from COVID, CO",2012,"Thanks, Owen. I thought about just sort of stopping right there and starting with questions, but I guess I'll make some remarks and give some time for Mike as well.
Good morning, everybody. As we sit here in January of '21, we are shifting from COVID, COVID, COVID as the obstacle to a pickup in activity to vaccine, vaccine, vaccine as the signal to rejuvenate tenant conversations about bringing staff back to the office and starting the leasing transaction processes.
There is no question that the rapid increase in COVID cases over the last 6 weeks of 2020 and the beginning of 2021 suppressed leasing tours in discussions during that period of time. But in the last 2 weeks, 2 large Boston companies have announced their expected return-to-work dates. We signed an LOI for a 70,000 square foot tenant that's going to need space in December of 2021. And just yesterday, Amazon announced in Boston that they are committing to another 630,000 square feet to be built office building and bringing 3,000 additional jobs to the Boston CBD.
So while the first half of '21 is expected to be quiet, we are cautiously optimistic that we've been through the worst of the pandemic and that the latter part of '21 will have a discernible pickup in leasing transaction volume, parking revenue and retail sales. The year-end market leasing reports that are published by the commercial brokerage organizations held a few surprises, as you probably heard through many of the analyst calls.
Leasing volumes were way off their historical pace and with the significant sublet space added to the market, we saw negative absorption and increased availability everywhere. It's important to remember that there are 2 types of sublet space. First, space that comes from users that have had changes in their employee headcount and are clearly no longer going to need all that space. And then there's a second group. Tenants that are being opportunistic, listing their entire premises, by the way, at no cost to them, with an expectation that they'll decide what to do if they get an acceptable actionable offer down the road. They may reoccupy, they may relocate and transact or they may find a way to sublet a portion of their space, we just don't know.
But based on all the conversations we have had with our technology, our life science, our professional service, our legal, our financial firms as well as the leasing brokers that are responsible for these listings, a change in workplace strategy, aka, we're going to work from home, where we're going to go to a disaggregated workforce, that's not what's driving the bulk of the sublet activity.
One thing is sure, not all the sublet space is actually available. You might find the following illustrative at. In Midtown Manhattan, after the Great recession, according to CBRE, from 2008 to 2009, about 24 million square feet of space was put on the sublet market. Between 2009 and 2010, 13.6 million or 57% of that was withdrawn from the market. Not all space is available.
The Boston Properties' office portfolio ended the year at 90.1% occupied. The quarterly sequential drop is entirely due to the addition of Dock 72 at 33% leased into the in-service portfolio. As Owen said, we have 600,000-plus square feet of signed leases, 134 basis points in our in-service portfolio that has not yet commenced revenue and hence is still defined as vacant, but it has been leased. We completed another 1.2 million square feet of leasing during the quarter.
On a relative basis, my view of the ranking activity on our portfolio, active lease negotiations, tours, RFPs in our markets is as follows, starting with the best and moving to the least. Boston Waltham, by the way, we don't have any available space in Cambridge. Northern Virginia, Midtown Manhattan, Princeton, Los Angeles, the Peninsula Silicon Valley, DC and, finally, the CBD of San Francisco. During the fourth quarter, in the Boston CBD, we did 5 leases, including another full floor new tenant at Atlantic Wharf. The cash starting rent on this full floor lease will be 34% higher than the expiring rent, and there are future rent increases. The cash rents on the other 4 leases had a weighted average increase of about 30%.
We continue to have additional activity in our CBD Boston portfolio, albeit with a number of smaller tenants under 10,000 square feet. A few are looking for incremental growth, and a few were considering letting their 2021 leases expire and are now actively engaged in short-term renewal conversations. I also want to note that we finally obtained possession of the 120,000 square foot 2-story former Lord & Taylor Building on Boylston Street during the early part of this month. This was a big win as we believe we can find a far more productive use for this box that has been under leased since the mid-1960s to Lord & Taylor.
In our suburban Boston portfolio, we completed 226,000 square feet of new leasing, including all of the remaining space at 20 CityPoint, first generation. This is in addition to the life science lease we did at 200 West Street. The cash rent on the second-generation leases, about 150,000 square feet was up an average of 23% on a cash basis. We continue to have additional activity in suburban Boston.
In Waltham, we're negotiating a 60,000 square foot lease extension, a lease with a new tenant for a 63,000 square foot block of space and we're responding to a number of large life science lab requirements. At the moment, we don't have any ready-to-go vacant lab space, but we hope to begin our conversion of 880 Winter Street 220,000 square feet during the second quarter. And our 300,000 square foot 180 CityPoint lab building has been fully designed, fully permitted, and we are simply waiting final construction bids over the next few months.
Turning to Northern Virginia. This quarter, we completed 6 renewals at our VA 95 single-story park, totaling about 218,000 square feet. In addition to the VW commitment in Reston Next, we completed another 82,000 square feet in the town center in Reston. In total, in 2020, we completed 1.15 million square feet of leasing in Reston Town Center. We still have more work to do. But we have a good start to 2021 with lease negotiations ongoing for an additional 60,000 square foot block of space.
In Reston Town Center, rents are basically flat to slightly down 1% to 2% on the relet, since the expiring cash rents have been increasing contractually by 2.5% to 3% for the last 10 years, and they will continue to do so on a going-forward basis.
Our D.C. CBD exposure rests in our JV assets. But here too, activity in our portfolio has picked up. We completed 24,000 square feet of leasing during the quarter, and we're negotiating over 120,000 square feet of leases as we speak.
In New York City, we executed our lease with Ascena at Times Square Tower for about 132,000 square feet of office space. We completed 2 floor deals in the New York City market, each 31,000 square feet at 601 Lex, one was a 1-year extension, and the second was a 10-year renewal and the cash rent decreased about 8% on that renewal.
We also did 4 small transactions at 250 West 55th Street in Time Square Tower totaling 26,000 square feet, 3 were short term and 1 was a 10-year deal. We're negotiating a full floor of transaction at 399 Park on a space that's not expiring until the end of 2021. While we didn't do much leasing in Princeton during the quarter, we have a number of active discussions ongoing that we believe tenants will be making decisions to expand or relocate in late '21 and are strongly considering Carnegie Center.
When we talk about California, you need to appreciate the fact that the state has been strongly discouraging tenants from asking their employees to go to their offices for the last 11 months. The uncertainty level and the lack of pedestrian activity at the Street plane, particularly in the CBD of San Francisco, has been more severe than anywhere else in our portfolio. And this has affected tenant's appetite for making any decisions. Just to put this year in perspective, from 2017 to 2019, there were, on average, 10 -- excuse me, 14 tech company leases per year in excess of 100,000 square feet. In 2020, there were none.
Our San Francisco assets are 95% leased, and we have 280,000 square feet expiring in '21. The third quarter produced just 3 transactions totaling about 23,000 square feet at EC. And during the fourth quarter, we did another 4 leases, all renewals, up about 18% on a cash basis totaling 20,000 square feet, it's pretty slow there. In South San Francisco, our Gateway JV is planning the construction commencement of 751 Gateway, a 230,000 square feet ground up lab development to begin over the next few months, followed by the conversion of 651 Gateway, which will be a renovated building, if we're able to relocate the existing tenant there.
There's more activity in the Silicon Valley Mountain View area than the rest of the Bay Area. 2 technology companies did 100,000 square foot plus expansions during the quarter, and there are 3 active requirements right now in the market in excess of 200,000 square feet. There continues to be a slow resurgence of medical device, alternative energy, automotive, the hardware side of technology that are all out looking for space. We are seeing a few of these organizations looking at our Mountain view single-story product, which is plug-and-play ready.
In Santa Clara, we're going to be taking our 218,000 square foot Peterson Way building out of service when the lease expires in the second quarter of '21. This was a covered land play and contributed about $4.8 million of revenue in 2020. We have entitlements for a 630,000 square foot campus, permitted and improved, ready to go.
In spite of the challenging COVID-related conditions in California, in Santa Monica, we continue our renewal negotiations with our 2021 expirations. And as I said at the outset, we signed a 70,000 square foot LOI at Colorado Center from a new tenant. You may recall earlier this year, we actually did an expansion with another technology company at the Santa Monica Business Park.
I purposely didn't make any comments about market rents during my remarks. With very limited activity, any conjecture about where rents will settle out is pure opinion. What I can tell you is that there will be large differences between deals cut on sublet space and direct space. Sublet landlords will have less appetite for capital and more leeway with lowering face rents or giving free rent. There will be tenants, however, that simply don't want the risk of sublet space. Will that prime tenant actually pay their rent for the full term? Is that a risk worth taking? Or the as is conditions and other issues associated with that may make them very uncomfortable with those risks? There will be a very wide gap between the bid and the ask on direct space at the outset until we have a meaningful amount of direct deal comparable transactions for the market to understand.
Landlords with vacant space that are according tenants that want a new installation will use capital to entice users to this space, not necessarily space rent. And landlords working on renewals will be more aggressive with swing space where it can be made available or lower contractual rates if the installation that's there currently works for the user. However, there will be a flight to quality and the better buildings as tenants see value in paying less of a premium to be in the best assets in these markets. Conditions are going to value -- are going to vary submarket by submarket. I'm going to stop there and yield the rest of our time to Mike."
368278,700977355,2182526,"Boston Properties, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2021",2021-01-27,"Earnings Calls","BXP, Inc.","Executives","Excellent. Thanks, Doug. Good morning. So I'm going to cover the details of our earnings for the fourth quarter. I'll also explain our guidance for the first quarter that we provided and some insight into our expectations for the full year 2021.We've re",1403,"Excellent. Thanks, Doug. Good morning. So I'm going to cover the details of our earnings for the fourth quarter. I'll also explain our guidance for the first quarter that we provided and some insight into our expectations for the full year 2021.
We've reinstated quarterly FFO guidance, which we hope will be helpful and serve as an indicator of our increased confidence in the operating environment. Our office tenant collections remain strong, and we believe the write-offs are largely behind us. We also continue to execute on new and renewal office lease requirements as evidenced by the 1.2 million square feet of leasing in the fourth quarter and the 3.7 million square feet of leasing in 2020 overall, despite the pandemic-related shutdowns. We're encouraged by the rollout of the vaccine and are confident we will see a return of workers to the office in mass, but there remains uncertainty with respect to timing. We anticipate our ancillary revenues, such as parking and retail will continue to be weak until the population increases. Once we have better visibility into the timing, we expect to restore full year guidance as well.
Our fourth quarter results contained 2 charges that I would like to explain. The first is a $60 million noncash impairment of our equity investment in Dock 72. Our 670,000 square foot development we put into service in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. This investment is held in an unconsolidated joint venture, where we own 50%. Because the investment is unconsolidated, GAAP requires a mark-to-current fair value. Also, while the $0.35 per share charge is a deduction from net income, it is added back to arrive at FFO. So it has no impact on our reported FFO pursuant to NAREIT's definition.
Dock 72 is only 33% leased, as Doug said. And while we had some promising leasing activity pre-COVID, there's little activity today and the market conditions in Brooklyn have weakened. We have increased our projected costs to stabilize as well as modified and extended our anticipated lease-up. And the combination of this has resulted in a lower current fair value for the property. The extension of timing to achieve stabilization has a meaningful impact on fair value. We see Dock 72 as a unique situation, and we do not anticipate any additional impairments in the portfolio. The rest of our development pipeline is very well leased at 88%, our in-service portfolio is over 90% leased and, honestly, most of the assets have significant embedded gains.
The second charge is a $38 million or $0.22 per share noncash charge to net income and FFO for the write-off of all accrued rental income for tenants in the co-working industry. While these tenants are paying rent today, we believe the ongoing length of the pandemic is stressing the sector's revenue and liquidity. As such, we do not believe they meet the standard to maintain an accrued rent asset on our balance sheet. As we discussed in both our second and third quarter earnings calls, co-working is the remaining tenant sector that we've been monitoring closely. It is possible we could face a few individual credit situations this year due to the impact of the pandemic across the portfolio, but we don't anticipate additional significant accrued rent write-offs to other sectors of tenants like we've experienced with retail and with co-working in 2020.
For the fourth quarter, our reported FFO was $1.37 per share. If you exclude the accrued rent charge, our fourth quarter FFO would have been $1.59 per share and in line with consensus and the expectations that we shared with you last quarter.
Now I'd like to look forward to 2021. We have provided first quarter 2021 guidance for FFO of $1.53 to $1.57 per share. At the midpoint, this is $0.04 per share lower than our fourth quarter 2020 FFO before charges. The decline is entirely due to approximately $0.10 per share of seasonally higher anticipated G&A. The first quarter is always our highest quarter for G&A due to accounting for compensation.
If you look back historically, we typically recorded 30% of our annual G&A expense in the first quarter. The increase in G&A expense is anticipated to be partially offset by higher revenue contribution from our portfolio, including the commencement of revenue for a portion of the signed leases that Doug described. We also expect lower interest expenses. We are redeeming our $850 million bond issuance in mid-February with cash on hand. These bonds have a yield of 4.3%, and there will be no prepayment charge. We're currently earning close to 0 on our cash. So we will see the full benefit of lower interest expense for the second half of this quarter and for the rest of 2021.
So as we think about the full year 2021, there's a few things to consider. If you simply annualize the midpoint of our first quarter guidance, you get to about $6.20 per share. But that does not account for the seasonality of our G&A, the reduction of interest expense from our bond redemption or the incremental impact of leased developments coming online during the year.
For modeling purposes, we suggest you consider adding the following to the Q1 annualized FFO of $6.20 per share: $0.19 per share for the impact of lower G&A for the rest of the year; $0.08 per share from lower interest expense due to the bond redemption; and $0.05 per share of incremental FFO from new developments coming online, including 159 East 53rd Street, which is 96% leased to NYU and where we expect to commence revenue in the second quarter; 100 Causeway Street in Boston, which is 94% leased with projected revenue phasing in starting in the third quarter; and 200 West Street, our life science development in Waltham, which is 100% leased and is projected to deliver in December.
So adjusting our first quarter annualized run rate for these known items gets to approximately $6.52 per share for 2021. That said, we are not providing full year guidance for FFO because there remains uncertainty than our variable income streams, including our ancillary income and our same-property leasing, both of which impact revenues and occupancy.
The timing of recovery from the pandemic is still unknown. It could have a material impact on the recovery of revenues from our parking, retail and hotel. Currently, these income streams are depressed. Their contribution is nearly $30 million lower on a quarterly basis than what we saw prepandemic. We are hopeful that a portion of this revenue will start to return in the back half of 2021, but the timing is really reliant on the success of the COVID vaccines and return to a safe and healthy environment in our cities. We also have lease expirations in 2021 that will impact our occupancy and same-property NOI.
Our rollover for 2021 is 3.2 million square feet. As Doug described, we already have 610,000 square feet of leases signed that will take occupancy of currently vacant space this year. We're also actively working on over 1 million square feet of new leases and renewals across the portfolio. Overall, we expect our year-end 2021 occupancy to be flat to down 100 basis points compared to current occupancy.
It's also worth noting that we have a meaningful amount of free rent that burned off in 2020 that will boost our cash same-property performance and AFFO in 2021, specifically at 399 Park Avenue, we had 450,000 square feet of space in build out and under free rent for 9 months in 2020 that is now in cash rent. And at the General Motors Building, 160,000 square feet of office space and a portion of our retail was under free rent for most of 2020 and are now paying cash rent. This showed up in our results in the fourth quarter with a $10 million increase in same-property cash NOI sequentially from Q3 to Q4.
In summary, we're excited about the prospects for revenue and FFO growth. Our portfolio cash flow is expected to grow in 2021. The success of the vaccine program should give rise to the recovery of our ancillary revenue streams. And we have $2.2 billion of leased developments coming online over the next couple of years, all of which should drive future earnings growth and value.
That completes our formal remarks. If you could open the lines up for questions, operator, that would be great."

But our method of sort of coming up with that number is to understand the amount of space that we have rolling over. And while we have a probability on renewals, the real variability is on how much of the vacant space that we currently have is going to, A, be leased and, B, be revenue producing. Because it has to be revenue producing, meaning we have to have delivered it and ""as a ready space"" or in second generation and not tamales. And so it's -- that's what's really driving the number to sort of flat to negative because we just don't know what we're going to be asked to do relative to the delivery conditions of that space and when revenue is going to start.
And as again, we sit here today with a 134 basis points of lease space that's not revenue recognizing right now. And we just don't know where we're going to be as we get to the end of the year. And honestly, we expect our transaction volumes going to pick up as the year goes on, it's going to be slow in the first half of the year. And our expectation is if the vaccine rollout goods as we believe it will, that there will be a significant pickup at activity once people are back in school from a population perspective and people are back in their desks and people are feeling very confident about their business prospects. And so the third and fourth quarters are going to be back weighted, which again, impacts the revenue number."

And then I guess in terms of when you're talking about the 652 base, Mike, and then you talked about some uncertainty on variable income streams and same-property leasing, I guess since you did give a year-end sort of occupancy range, I guess I'm trying to just think about the same-property leasing and whether that ends up being a negative adjustment to that base on FFO that you talked about based on your year-end occupancy number."

And look, we're trying to provide as much assistance as we can but there are some variable pieces that are pretty big that would require a wide range, I would say.
On the same-store, every 50 basis points of occupancy based upon our current kind of rental rates is about $15 million. So that's $0.09 a share is every 50 basis points of occupancy. The variable income streams that I talked about could add $30 million a quarter. So we just don't know when that's going to come in. I think that the hotel portion of that, which is minor, it is only $5 million a quarter that we think it's going to take longer. But the parking and the retail components of that, it could snap back more quickly. It could be third quarter, it could be fourth quarter. And it's just really hard for us to say when that's going to happen.
So providing a meaningful guidance range to you all is just difficult at this time. So we've chosen not to do that. But I think I've given you a sense just on these comments of what our expectation is. If our occupancy is going to go down, then after you pull out the charges we incurred in 2020 from the same-store and you just think about run rate, if our occupancy goes down by 50 basis points on average, I would expect our same-store to be down very slightly. We look at these -- our lease-up on a lease by lease basis, so we've looked at all of our units.
Our renewal retention has gone up, and you've seen it quarter-over-quarter during the pandemic. It was, I think, 56%, 57% this quarter, which is pretty good. So we've done that analysis to come up with kind of the occupancy views that we have based upon the activity that we're seeing today in the portfolio. Hopefully, that's helpful."

I think the reason for that is, most importantly, we're in a recession. And in all recessions, leasing activity slows down, businesses have more uncertain outcomes and CEOs are less likely to make major financial commitments, which are leases. So this is no different from prior recessions. I think office lags a bit. So I think you're going to -- we're probably not going to get more stronger leasing activity until later in the year when the virus dissipates, people come back to the office and the economy is clearly in improvement.
As I said in my remarks, we acknowledge the impact of work from home and do believe that workers in America and possibly around the world will want to work from home on a part-time basis more frequently. So we acknowledge that impact, but we also see with our -- and we also see with CEOs, I think, the importance that they see an in-person work and their strong interest in getting their employees back to the office. So then the issue is, okay, what's the impact of the additional part-time work on office demand? And again, to save space by having with people working at home on a part-time basis, you really need to do 2 things. You need to schedule when that time out of the office is because everybody can't be at an office on Monday or Friday; and two, you have to go to flexible workstations and move people around. And again, if you're looking at employee preferences, one of them is they want to work from home more. And as I said in my remarks, 90% of the survey -- in the Gensler survey said they wanted a fixed workstation. So which employee preference will be accommodated? So again, we acknowledge there's an impact from work from home, but we think it's overblown for those."

So hot desking seems to us a potential solution, especially in an A, B or week on, week off model that allows deep cleaning over the weekend. So I guess, like what data from business leader conversations lead you to believe that hot desking is ultimately unlikely?"

Look, I think you have to say, I mean, look, we all, as employers, want to accommodate our talented workforces. And that survey expressed employee preference. So I think business leaders across the country are going to have to sort out which employee preferences they want to try to accommodate. I talked about the fixed workstation, working from home more is also an employee preference.
I do think strongly in talking with other business leaders, there's a strong interest in having employees return to the office because of all of the diminution that's going on in terms of culture, competitiveness, creativity, onboarding employees. So again, I think this is a question that business leaders are going to have to sort out which employee preferences are they going to try to accommodate."

We do have significant capital, but we also have significant ambition in terms of growing the company and making new investments that make sense for shareholders. So we do think it makes sense to extend the equity capital we have with partners. We have a rich tradition of doing this in the company. We have a reasonably significant portfolio that's already partnered with global leading real estate investors like Norges and CPP, and we think extending that type of business makes a lot of sense.
Selling assets is not an efficient way for us to raise capital. Most, if not all, of our major assets have a significant tax gain, which requires a cash or it requires a special dividend. And therefore, the retention of capital is much lower. So for all those reasons, we think the joint ventures make sense. And the other thing I would say on the JVs is we are providing property services to those joint ventures, so we do enhance our yields as a result of providing those services to the joint venture partners."

So we've basically been approached by every operator in our portfolio regardless of the market about relief. And we saw Regis this last quarter all over the country put units into bankruptcy. So we're now 11 months into this pandemic, and it's pretty clear that the flexible space operators, customers, obviously, many of which had short-term leases, and then many of those leases are probably expired, they've been very slow to come back to work. But really not dissimilar from the census we've seen. And our census, as we said before, is somewhere in the high single digits to the low double digits, right? So this industry is simply just facing revenue challenges. And we decided that given the credit deterioration, we should be recognizing rent on a cash basis. So that was the reason we did what we did when we did it.
And with regard to our own portfolio, we have, I think, 13 units across the country, 3 in California, the rest in other portfolio in Washington, D.C. and in Boston. Nothing in New York. We have 1 in New Jersey. And in total, it's about $50 million. And we've actually reduced our exposure by about 100,000 square feet over the last year to leases that have expired. So we don't have any specific concerns about any particular unit. We're current on everything right now.

And if you think about it, basically, $12 million is parking, $12 million is retail, some of which is vacated, but some of which is just not paying us right now. And the $5 million is hotel, which again might take a little bit further to get back.
So depending on the timing of when that stuff comes back, it could clearly outstrip any kind of reduction we might have in occupancy from the same-store. We do have -- I think what you're getting is, we had some tenants that are on abatements right now, they're actually in occupancy. So we had $19 million this quarter of those tenants. So we think that those tenants who are in occupancy and open will start paying rent again. Some of those were recognizing GAAP rent. Right now, some of them were not. It's probably about 50-50 on that. So those tenants are in place and an occupancy, and we're hoping to get back to more of a contract rent basis next year as part of that overall $30 million increase."

And then two, look, I do -- I think we all acknowledge Austin is a computer science cluster. There's no doubt about it. But the -- and this is true in South Florida as well. The market dynamics for office investment are very different. The level of new construction and existing vacancy, even with Class A space is very high, and it's much more elevated than the markets that we operate in.

And so with the vaccine progress, I think we see and I think the world sees a pretty obvious correction in this over the next 6 months. Again, knock on wood, maybe something goes wrong with the vaccines or there's a slower rollout or there's something that goes on.
But in essence, unlike an economic recovery, which perhaps is harder to predict, again, if this is all about vaccinations, maybe this one is easier to predict. And I think as all of us come out of the isolation that we're getting really tired of and return to the world into our offices, into restaurants and to theater and to each other, the economy is going to reopen and I think jobs are going to come back. I think of all the small businesses that we'll get to reopen and restart is part of all this. So we do think this year, we're going to have a significant improvement in economic activity. Look, office leasing tends to lag that. So it's not -- so we do think by the later quarters of this year that the office activity will also elevate as a result."

So there's a lot of that stuff that's there this time as well that people are all looking at and saying, ""Oh, it must be a change in philosophy for the workforce management of that organization, and they're going to have more people working from home."" I just don't think that there's as much of that as people think there is in the marketplaces. Sure, you can look at Dropbox and what Dropbox has decided to do in San Francisco.

And therefore, the infection rate needs to drop precipitously from where it is now. And I think it will as more people get vaccinated and more people are immune because they've recovered from infection.
So when I think it's deemed to be safe, I do think then companies are going to be faced with the dilemma, Michael, that you described, which is, ""Okay, we want people back and how hard are we going to push it? Because our employee base, some of these employees do like the work from home and they want to be out of the office."" I don't think they want to be out of the office full time, but they certainly want to be out of the office more. So these employers are going to have to decide what are we comfortable with? What do we need to do to be competitive in our industry in terms of in-person work and what kind of policies should we put up to balance this competitiveness issue with the retention of talent? And I think each company is going to make those decisions differently.
But again, I think as the infection rate goes down, and my assumption is that will be over the summer, I do think you'll see a lot more companies requiring employees to come back to work. And I think different companies will have different policies around work from home."

If you're a believer in the efficacy of the vaccine and the vaccine does what it really is designed to do, which is you don't get sick if you're in contact with the virus, I think there's going to be a stronger desire for people to come back. Again, once we've solved those other issues, which are we've now put people in a position where there are children are going back to school, where they're comfortable going on public transportation, where all of the things that have been impediments to at least intellectually, people coming to work and we have a governmental programmatic desire to get people back in seats, right, as opposed to saying, we think that people should remain as far apart as possible because we're trying to keep this pandemic in containment, which is where we are and have been for the last 11 months."

In New York City, I am sure that assessments are going to go way down. We won't know what's going to happen with the tax rate.

So year-to-year, it's not a very big change, 8-K versus what it would have been were we not in this valuation challenge.
In a market like Boston, there's been so much addition to the supply that we actually don't expect to see much in the way of significant rises in real estate taxes because the assessments have gone up, but there's more base. The cities have actually reduced the tariff rate so it hasn't been significant. And similarly, I think in the greater D.C. area, we'll obviously see -- they have tri-year valuations in the district, and you don't see much difference unless your building is being revalued.
But net-net, I mean, it's quite clear that to the extent that a jurisdiction has some physical issues, it's going to be looking to its real estate taxpayers to bear a portion of that.

The BXP team is joining you today from our offices all over the country where we're beginning to see renewed signs of life as our cities reopen with increasing activity on the street, in-shop and restaurants, on public transportation, and yes, even in office buildings, where building census is picking up and tour activity is accelerating. 
U.S. GDP is growing at 4.3%, over 1.6 million jobs were created in the first quarter. Weekly jobless claims are in decline and unemployment has dropped to 6%, only 2.5 percentage points above pre-pandemic levels of February last year. Professional service employment has remained healthy, which is important given our tenancy. U.S. retail sales surged 9.8% in March and air travel, as measured by TSA checkpoints is up 10x over a year ago, but still only 50% of pre-pandemic level. The U.S. and global economic recoveries continue to follow the course of the virus and vaccination rollout. While new COVID-19 cases have remained sticky at around 60,000 per day since late February, all data including 3 million daily vaccinations, 43% of Americans having received at least 1 shot and the J&J vaccine reinstatement suggest the trajectory for a highly vaccinated population and fewer new COVID infections remains positive. 
The U.S. economy will likely continue to surge, given the financial health of most industry sectors, the significant federal fiscal stimulus provided to individuals and small business, accommodative monetary policy and pent-up consumption sparked by the pandemic reopening. This recovery is starting to bring positive momentum to the office markets and BXP's result. 
For the buildings we can track, our census last week was, depending on the city, at or above the post-pandemic peak established last October. In the first quarter, we completed 592,000 square feet of leasing, 84% of the leasing volume we achieved in the first quarter of last year and 46% of our longer-term first quarter average. These leases had a weighted average term of 7.6 years. Our leases that commenced this quarter demonstrated a 15% roll-up of net rent for second-generation space. We exceeded our FFO per share forecast for the first quarter and the tenant charges we experienced in 2020 largely disappeared. 
More broadly, tenant requirements in our target markets in March, based on data provided by VTS, were up 33% versus the prior month and 51% versus the prior year, though we're only down though are still down 40% from pre-pandemic levels. Office markets are lagging other asset classes because very few employers are currently mandating in-person work. That is now changing rapidly as many large employers, such as Google, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Ernst & Young, Facebook, Amazon, Apple and others have announced return-to-work plans for this summer. We continue to see Labor Day as a key tipping point for employees returning to the office, with forecast low COVID infection rates, high vaccination levels, the end of summer and schools reopening. 
We hear repeatedly from our clients as well as in interviews we have completed with large occupiers that the key to future success and competitiveness is to successfully reintroduce in-person work. Unlike most recessions, most of our clients are thriving and have not reduced headcount. In our leasing activity and renewal conversations with clients, we have not seen material reductions in space requirements. 
Now moving to private equity market conditions. There were $15 billion of significant office assets sold in the first quarter, though volumes were down 37% from the first quarter of last year. Assets with limited lease rollover and anything life science related currently receive the best pricing, often better than before the pandemic. There were again several deals of note completed in our markets, including in San Francisco, the exchange on 16th located in the Mission Bay District sold for $1.1 billion or $14.40 per square foot, a record price per square foot in San Francisco, and it represented a 4.9% cap rate. This 750,000 square foot recently developed building is 100% leased to a tenant trying to sublease the entire building. The asset was sold to a fund manager, which may attempt a life science conversion. 
In Seattle, 300 the Macy's building sold for $600 million or $779 per square foot and a 4.4% cap rate. The majority of this 770,000 square foot asset was recently converted to office space, which is 100% leased by Amazon, and the remainder is undergoing further renovation. The building was purchased by a joint venture between a fund manager and a real estate operator. 
And in the Washington, D.C. CBD, a 49% interest in Midtown Center was sold to an offshore buyer. The building comprises 870,000 square feet, and is substantially leased to Fannie Mae as its headquarters. The gross sale price was $980 million, $1,129 a square foot and a 4.7% cap rate. 
Moving to BXP investment activities, let's start with our growing life science business. BXP currently has over 3 million square feet leased to life science clients, approximately 2 million square feet of current and future office to lab conversion projects, and sites for approximately 4 million square feet of life science ground-up development, primarily located in among the strongest life science markets in the U.S., namely Cambridge, Waltham and South San Francisco. We recently received 1 million square feet of new entitlements at Kendall Center in Cambridge, and our joint venture at Gateway Commons is in discussions with local authorities in San Francisco to increase entitlements by 1.5 million square feet. 
We had a very active first quarter launching 3 new lab developments and redevelopment projects. 180 CityPoint, a 330,000 square foot ground-up development and part of our larger CityPoint campus in Waltham, with strong visibility from I95. Second, 880 Winter Street is a 224,000 square foot Class A office asset we acquired in 2019 for $270 a square foot, and we'll redevelop into a lab building; and 751 Gateway, a 229,000 square foot ground-up lab development as part of our Gateway Commons joint venture in which we own a 49% interest. 
Though all 3 projects are being commenced speculatively, we are seeing many new life science requirements in both the Waltham and South San Francisco markets and have made multiple lease proposals to potential tenants. 
A large portion of our active development pine is now lab and currently comprises 920,000 square feet and $560 million of projected investment for our share with projected cash yield at stabilization approximately 8%. BXP has a rich history of success serving the life science industry. We have the land and building inventory in the strongest life science clusters in the U.S. as well as the execution skill and client relationships to make life sciences an even more meaningful component of our overall business. 
Moving to the balance of our development pipeline. We delivered into service this quarter, 159 East 53rd Street with 195,000 square feet of office fully leased to NYU, and as well as the which will open after Labor Day and serve as a unique culinary amenity for our 3 building, 53rd in Lexington Campus. We remain on track to deliver our 100 Causeway development in Boston later this year, which is pre-leased to Verizon, and we have 4 additional and significant projects related to deliver in 2022. This pipeline is 86% pre-leased with aggregate projected cash yield stabilization projected to be approximately 7%. 
To maintain our external growth, in addition to adding the 3 life science projects, we also are investing approximately $182 million into an observatory redevelopment project on the top of the Prudential Tower in Boston. When complete, the observatory will have 3 levels, comprise 59,000 square feet and will be a world-class attraction, featuring both indoor and outdoor, 360-degree viewing decks as well as exhibit and amenity spaces. The project will be the only observatory in Boston, and we expect it will generate strong return BXP after delivery in the spring of 2023. 
Net of all these movements, our active development pipeline currently stands at 10 development and redevelopment projects comprising 4.3 million aggregate square feet and $2.7 billion in total investment for our share. We expect these projects, along with the lease-up of 2 residential buildings delivered in 2020 as well as 159 East 53rd Street to contribute 3.5% of annual and external growth to our NOI over the next 3 years. 
We continue to actively pursue value-added acquisitions in our core markets in Seattle. Despite the impacts of the pandemic, office investment opportunities in our core markets remain highly competitive. To enhance our financial resources, execution speed and returns, we have reached an agreement with 2 large-scale sovereign investors to pursue select acquisitions together. The partners, including BXP, will commit up to $1 billion, and we'll have the opportunity to invest 1/3 of the equity in each identified deal at their discretion. BXP will provide all real estate services and has agreed to commit its acquisition deal flow to the partnership, subject to specific carve-out. We believe this venture with approximately $2 billion of investment capacity provides the financial resources and return enhancements to be an even more nimble and competitive participant in the acquisitions market. We will announce the completion of the partnership, including the participants once documentation is complete, likely in the next month. 
Moving to dispositions. We recently completed the sale of our 50% interest in Annapolis Junction, buildings 6 and 7, our last 2 remaining properties in the Fort Meade, Maryland market. The buildings totaled approximately 247,000 square feet and sold for a gross price of $66 million, which is $267 a square foot. We have under contract 3 buildings in our VA 95 Business Park in Springfield, Virginia for a gross sale price of $70 million. And we also have under letter of intent, the sale of several stabilized suburban buildings for another approximately $190 million. Additional asset sales are being evaluated, and we believe our gross disposition volume in 2021 will exceed $500 million. 
To conclude, BXP is emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic with strength and momentum. Leasing volumes and requirements are rising, office collections exceed 99%. Our clients are healthy, if not thriving. Tenant credit charges have largely disappeared. Our $30 million per quarter of lost variable revenue is poised to return with offices reopening. We've launched new life science development. Our active development pipeline is expected to deliver strong external growth, and we've raised the war chest for new acquisitions to add even further growth. I remain confident in both our near-term and long-term growth prospects. 
I'll turn it over to Doug."

I'm going to try and give you my best shot at describing the operating environment that we are seeing in our portfolio as we sit here in late April. So as Owen said, the office tenants are deep into planning for their return to the physical in-person work environment as we approach the back half of 2021. And while there are lots of announcements, as Owen said, of relaunches, and our building census is up, we're still pretty low levels. And I think you can see that most clearly from a financial perspective, when you look at our monthly or daily parking, which was basically flat in the first quarter to where it was in the fourth quarter of 2020. Although just yesterday, as an example, we had our meeting for our California parking, and we had 67 requests for additional monthly spaces, 42 of them which are hard. And to give you a perspective, we actually lost more than half of our monthly parking over 800 monthly spaces in Embarcadero Center. So things are picking up. 
When we spoke to you late in January, we said that the first half of '21 was going to have a low level of market leasing activity as defined by executed leases, and that statement still holds. The reports that are published by the commercial brokerage organizations describing broad market conditions and all the calls that are sponsored by the analysts that follow our sector, really didn't have any surprises in them. Leasing volumes were off their historical pace. There was modestly more sublet space, which was added to the market, and that translated into some negative absorption and increased availability. No surprise, no shock. 
Last quarter, I described the dynamics around sublet space, particularly opportunistic sublet space. Again, this is when tenants are listening there on higher premises, obviously at no cost. With an expectation that they'll decide what to do if they actually get an offer that they can actionably respond to down the road. But the reality of transactioning when push them to shove is that tenants may reoccupy, they may relocate and transact. And then a final way to sublet a portion of their space and not the whole space. So give you a couple of examples. 
In Boston, we had a 50,000 square foot tenant, 2 floors in our CBD portfolio list their entire space, this successfully relet -- sublet one floor and then they pulled the second floor off and they are reoccupying in July. We competed actually against the long-term fully furnished sublet space in Mountain View in the Silicon Valley, and the user began to negotiate on a sublease. But when the prime landlord refused to agree to recognize a lease, the user quickly walked away and took direct space. So I'm not going to downplay the fact that there is a lot of sublet based on the market, but a large portion of it is not actionable because of short-term unworkable existing conditions, or quite frankly, users is comfort with the lessors profile. And when you ask what percentage is, I don't know, but it's meaningful. And yesterday, JLL came out with a report saying there was about 1.5 million square feet of New York City sublet space that was brought -- pulled from the market by those sub tenants. 
Now the headwind from the sublet space are going to exist, but they're going to dissipate as companies return to in-person work. Obviously, we are also confronting the caution that some organizations are facing as they work through how they move beyond having their employees working from their homes and only interacting on video calls that are typically scheduled days in advance. 
This may delay decisions to increase space needs, even though companies have hired more staff as Owen said, during this COVID shutdown and now as the economy is reopening. This backdrop is obviously going to add some more short-term pressure on lease economics in some markets. It's not going to affect all the markets in the same way, and it's certainly not going to impact all the buildings in the same -- in those markets in the same way either. 
The potential impact on pricing of sublet space and work from home makes a real dramatic commentary, but it's not going to be driving Boston Properties' results. I hope the following analysis will illustrate that point. 
So the average gross rent on our expiring office space portfolio in 2021, 2022 and 2023, so the next almost 3 years, totals about 5.8 million square feet, and the average expiring rent is about $65.50 per square foot. So if you believe that pre-pandemic market rents on that space were $70 a square foot, and I'm just using that as an example, but it's close. And you wanted to measure the impact of some kind of a decline. And this is an example not a statement of where I think -- what we think is going on with rent. So let's use 10% as an example. Then you would get to about a 4% roll down in rent or $2.50 a square foot or approximately $4.8 million per year over 3 years. That's it. That's the impact of the decline in rents on our portfolio from weak conditions. 
And as a point of reference, the change in second-generation gross lease rents this quarter was positive 9.5%. Now that's sort of deals that started and were signed previous to this quarter. As I go through my remarks, I'm going to talk about where rents are on spaces that we've physically signed leases on this quarter or that we're working on now and how those rents compare to existing in place rents. So as I my remarks to the Boston Properties portfolio, I'm going to describe our level of activity, and I think it's going to be count a weak macro market conditions that you're hearing about in macro reports. 
So let's start with our occupancy. Our in-service portfolio occupancy, includes a 100% of our JVs, ended the quarter 140 basis points down or 640,000 square feet. Now 50% of that space that was added to our vacancy this quarter provided no revenue over the last 12 months. That is, it was a space that we were trying to recapture from defaulted tenants. In other words, much of this drop in occupancy doesn't reflect in any future revenue decline. This includes the Lord & Taylor Box, that's prudential center, where we are in active discussions that we expect will result in a dramatic increase in the revenue from that piece of space. The office space that was given back by Ascena at Times Square Tower, and their Anntaylor retail outlets at Prudential Center. Next quarter, we're going to have another one of these as we take that the arc like cinema space since they've officially cease to operate. That's a 66,000 square foot lease at the hub on Causeway joint venture. And again, they never paid rent. 
Also this quarter, we took back 62,000 square feet in a recapture, so we could expand a growing tenant that we are negotiating a lease extension and expansion at Colorado Center. But that lease hasn't been executed yet to the space is in vacancy. We did have one disappointment, which was the 200,000 square foot departure at the Santa Monica Business Park. 
We, however, today, as I sit here talking to you, have 640,000 square feet of signed leases that have yet to commence, and they are not included in our occupied in-service portfolio. Unless we're actually booking revenue, we don't consider it occupied. 
On a relative basis, my view of the ranking and the activity in our portfolio. So this is active lease negotiations, tours, RFPs, is as follows, from top to bottom: Boston Waltham, we don't really have any space in Cambridge, so I don't include that; Midtown Manhattan is second; the San Francisco CBD is third; northern Virginia is fourth, followed by the Silicon Valley Peninsula, West L.A., Princeton and the DC CBD. All of the transactions I am going to describe to you are post-COVID negotiations having begun in the latter half of 2020 or 2021. So let's start in Boston, which, by the way, represents over 1/3 of the company's total revenue. 
So during the first quarter in the Boston CBD, we did 5 leases totaling 37,000 square feet. And in every case, the starting rent represented a gross rent roll-up of between 12% and 25%. We continue to have additional activity in the CBD portfolio, albeit it's with a preponderance of smaller tenants since we don't have much in the way of blocks available, and we are working on 8 leases totaling over 60,000 square feet. Of the 13 leases we have done this quarter or in the works, none of those customers are contracting and 5 are expanding and more than doubling their footprint. 
In the suburban portfolio, we completed 124,000 square foot of new leasing. The cash rent on those leases was up by 50%. We continue to have additional activity in suburban Boston. In Waltham, we're negotiating 6 more transactions totaling over 60,000 square feet. In the suburban portfolio, we have had some existing tenants expand and some contract. But we will be gaining occupancy with new tenants coming into the BXP portfolio, like our new tenants at 20 CityPoint and 195 West Street in Waltham. Again, those leases haven't commenced yet. 
Life science demand in Waltham continues to accelerate. We announced our plans to reposition [indiscernible] in early March that have had significant tour activity and have begun making proposals. This 220,000 square-foot building will be available for tenant buildout in the second quarter of '22. 
In New York, since the beginning of the year, we've had more physical tours than we had in the comparable period in 2020 and in 2019. We completed 3 leases during the quarter, totaling just 38,000 square feet, including a full floor expansion by a tenant at 399 Park. In total, the growth rents on this space was about 5% higher than the in-place rents. 
Now I said, New York City is our second most active region, and we're negotiating 14 office leases totaling over 170,000 square feet including a full 4 lease at Dock 72 in Brooklyn. We also have 2 other active proposals to Dock 72, each in excess of 100,000 square feet. The majority of these New York City leases will be terms in excess of 5 years, and more than half of those tenants are new to the portfolio. We've had one midtown tenant pull their space off the sublet market and another large tenant that is still has its entire space listed, has begun to repopulate. 5 of the 14 active deals represent tenants that are negotiating expansions. 
Activity at The Street plan of our buildings is also picking up. We're negotiating leases for food outlets at our 53rd Street, are eagerly anticipating the opening of the Hugh Culinary Collective at 601 Lex later this year, and we have a new lease negotiation for our vacancy on the Street at in Times Square tower. 
In Princeton, during the quarter, we completed 4 transactions, and we executed a fifth at the beginning of April, for a total of 28,000 square feet, and we're negotiating leases for another 29,000 square feet, all new tenants. 
Activity in the DC region was light during the quarter with only 50,000 square feet of office leasing. But as the calendar moved to April, we signed another 170,000 square feet. 210,000 square feet of this total leasing was completed on currently vacant space and included 2 large leases at Met Square in the district and an expanding tenant in Reston Town center. We have another 68,000 square feet of leases in process in the DC region, including 25,000 square feet in Reston from another expanding tenant. 
In the Town Center, rents are basically flat to slightly down 1% to 2% since the relet rents have been adjusted by the fact that the current rents have been increasing contractually by 2.5% to 3% for the last 5 to 10 years. I would also note that retail activity in Reston has picked up. We have now opened 4 new restaurants since November of '20. We're negotiating leases with new food outlets totaling 27,000 square feet. They're going to open in '22. Pedestrian activity in Reston Town Center is active. 
California has finally begun to reopen and allow for higher levels of office occupancy, although it's still way behind the rest of our markets. During the quarter, at Embarcadero Center, we settled rent arbitration on 2 multi-floor 5-year extensions and completed another 10-year full-floor renewal. The markup on these 3 deals totaling 125,000 square feet was 46%. Tour activity for small tenants, a floor or under, has picked up and grown about 40% sequentially month-to-month from January to April. I would characterize half of our San Francisco CBD activity is with expanding tenants and happens with tenants that are contracting. 
The uncertain level and the lack of pedestrian activity at the Street plant, particularly in the CBD of San Francisco has been more severe than anywhere else in our portfolio. This has affected tenants' appetite for making any decisions. But large tenants have started to begin to look for space. They're having a number of tours on the high-quality sublet offerings south the market. We see the activity and the proposals on the available sublet space we have at 680 Folsom. 
In South San Francisco, we signed a lease of 61,000 square feet at 601 Gateway. That's going to absorb about 50% of the expiration that's going to occur in the second quarter. We are underway at 751 Gateway, our first lab facility development in South San Francisco, and have begun responding to proposals for this early 2023 delivery. 651 Gateway will be taken out of service in the second quarter of '22 when the final tenant vacates, and we will commence a lab conversion of that 293,000 square foot building. 
In Mountain View, we continue to see a constant flow of medical device, alternative energy, battery storage, automotive and up R&D users looking for space. We're in renewal discussions with 24,000 square foot tenant and a commenced lead negotiation with a second tenant for 30,000 square feet on market-ready vacant space, and we have a tenant ready to go on a remaining floor of 18,000 square feet at 244 There are some large tech tenants in the market down in the valley today, looking for expansion space and we are certainly chasing those tenants if the timing were to match for our potential delivery at Platform 16. 
In spite of the challenging COVID conditions in California and Santa Monica, we continue our renewal negotiations with a 260,000 square foot tenant in Colorado Center. And as I said at the outset, we've recaptured about 60,000 square feet that's going to roll into that tenant's expansion. We've also signed a lease for 72,000 square feet at Colorado Center with Roku, who's new to the portfolio. And as you may recall, earlier late last year, we did an expansion with staff at the Santa Monica Business Park. 
So to summarize the takeaway from my comments. It's true that market fundamentals are weaker than they were a year ago. But what drives our same-store portfolio performance will be occupancy pickup, as well as the return of our parking income and the recovery of our retail activity in revenue. There are tenants in our portfolio that are expanding in every one of our markets. Conditions are going to vary dramatically by some market. Rents may or may not decline depending upon the submarket, but we will still have embedded markups in our portfolio. 
There will be a flight to quality as better buildings see more tenant demand and tenant value paying less of a premium to being the best assets, and this will improve our occupancy. Let me turn it to Mike."

I'm going to start my comments this morning with a little piece on our activity in the debt capital markets. We had a very busy quarter, and it impacted our results. As we guided last quarter, we redeemed the $850 million of our expiring unsecured bonds that had a 4% and 8% coupon using available cash. But in addition to that and not part of our prior guidance, we issued another $850 million of new 11-year unsecured green bond at an attractive coupon of 2.55%. The proceeds were used to repay our $500 million unsecured term loan that was due to expire next year, and we redeemed at par an expensive $200 million, 5.25% preferred equity security. We incurred noncash charges during the quarter of approximately $7 million or $0.04 per share related to writing off unamortized financing costs. 
Our next bond expiration is not until early 2023, when we have $1 billion expiring at an above-market interest rate of 3.95%. In advance of that in early '22, we have a $626 million mortgage expiring on 601 Lexington Avenue in New York City. This loan also carries an above-market interest rate of 4.75%. 
So turning to our earnings results for the quarter. For the first quarter, we reported FFO of $1.56 per share, that was $0.01 above the midpoint of our guidance range. The variances to our guidance were comprised of $0.04 per share of higher NOI from the portfolio and $0.01 per share of higher fee income, partially offset by the $0.04 per share noncash charge related to our refinancing activity. The portfolio NOI outperformance included $0.02 per share of lower operating expenses during the quarter, much of which will be incurred later in the year. And on the revenue side, we collected delinquent 2020 rent from some of our retail tenants, whose rents are being recognized on a cash basis. These collections drove a significant portion of our $0.02 revenue beat. 
As we described last quarter, we believe the vast majority of our tenant credit charges are behind us. Our net write-offs this quarter were immaterial, and collections from our office clients continue to be consistent and very strong. 
We provided guidance for the second quarter 2021 FFO in our earnings release of $1.59 to $1.61 per share. At the midpoint, this is $0.04 per share better sequentially from the first quarter. The expected improvement emanates from lower seasonal G&A expense and the cessation of preferred dividends from our redemption. Also the first quarter financing charges are not expected to recur. 
Partially offsetting this, we project lower termination income in Q2. And as Doug explained, our occupancy declined by 140 basis points this quarter, which was expected, but results in a sequential drop in portfolio NOI from the half that was paying rent before. 
We expect another drop in occupancy next quarter, followed by a modest improvement in the back half of the year. Doug described 640,000 square feet of signed leases that have yet to commence occupancy. 460,000 square feet of this will take occupancy later this year, representing over 100 basis points of occupancy pickup. 
While we are still not providing full year specific guidance, given the uncertainty and timing of our ancillary revenue streams, we did provide you with a framework for 2021 in our last call. As you revisit your models for the full year, there are 3 other changes to consider: First, our financing activities during the first quarter have a net impact of increasing interest expense by $5 million for the year. Second, we have a loss of rental revenue from taking 880 Winter Street out of service for redevelopment into a life science facility. This has a negative impact of about $2 million. And lastly, the additional $260 million of dispositions that Owen described are expected to result in a loss of about $7 million of NOI. In aggregate, these items are expected to reduce FFO for the rest of 2021 by approximately $14 million or $0.08 per share. 
Looking further ahead to 2022, we've made substantial investments in pre-leased developments that will drive earnings growth. We anticipate delivering 100 Causeway Street in Boston and 200 West Street in Waltham late in 2021 representing $315 million of investment at our share that is collectively 95% leased. The contribution from these 2 development deliveries will not be that significant to 2021, but they will be at a full run rate in 2022. 
The bulk of the remaining pipeline is projected to deliver in 2022. This includes our building for Google and Cambridge; Reston Next for Fannie Mae in Volkswagen, the Marriott headquarters and 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue. This represents delivery of $1.7 billion of investment in 2022 at our share, and 2.7 million square feet that is currently 85% pre-leased. This $2 billion of investment in conjunction with the recovery of our ancillary income sources and improved leasing activity post-pandemic, sets us up for occupancy improvement in a period of solid future earnings growth. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Owen."

In addition, BXP had previously set a carbon emissions reduction goal in line with the most ambitious designation available under the science-based targets initiatives program. In 2020, BXP was one of 6 North American real estate companies with this distinction and the only North American office company. 
We also established a new board level sustainability committee to among other things increase the board oversight of an input for our sustainability issues. And lastly, we launched an internal diversity and inclusion committee last year, with the mission of pursuing greater diversity among our workforce and vendors as well as new programs supporting diversity and fairness in our communities. BXP is proud of its consistent recognition as an industry leader in sustainability and ESG, an area increasingly important to our clients, our communities, capital providers and employees. 
And then lastly, there's one important milestone that I want to mention. This will be Peter Johnston's last earnings call as he's retiring from Boston Properties next month after 33 years of service. Peter has been an outstanding leader in our Washington, D.C. business, and he will be greatly missed by all of us. Thank you very much, Peter.

But you just outlined about $0.08 of negative that is incremental to that. So is that $6.52 sort of now $6.45-ISH type number?

So yes, I want to describe those FFO drops for later this year. 
Now, we've given some guidance for second quarter, and it does show that we will have pickup later in the year. And I think that if you look at Q2, you're going to -- we expect to have a further drop in occupancy in Q2. And if you look at our rollover schedule, about 60% of the remaining rollover for the year is hitting in just Q2. So Q3 and Q4 has very light rollover exposure. So we do expect to have some pickup in occupancy and revenue in the back half of the year from that leasing activity. And we would expect occupancy by the end of the year to be somewhere between 88% and 89%. 
And then as I also said, we have 460,000 square feet signed that is going to occupy this year, so that's part of that number. So the improvement in the back half of the year is coming from a combination of some occupancy improvement in Q2 through Q4. And we also expect our parking to start to improve. Doug mentioned it, we're starting to see some green shoots with the parking, that will be helpful. And then we have a couple of the development deliveries that I talked about at 100 and at 200 West REIT, though that is later in the year.

With regards to net effective, none of the transactions that we have been working on have had much in the way of significant changes in either free rent or TIs. I would say we've been building more space, but we were building more space pre-COVID. So there hasn't been a pickup in the custom space, particularly on the TI side that we've seen yet, which is obviously good.

Most of those smaller tenants are in the financial asset management, professional services sector.

So there's a significant component of the market in terms of the transaction volume that is in that sector. 
The rest of the larger tenants have -- I think there is a whole spectrum of results that you're going to see. We had a tenant that took 75,000 square feet of space in Waltham, named in Provida that put a press release out with us a couple of weeks ago, and they basically said, we're obviously not putting a workstation in for every single person in our organization who lives in the Boston area, and we're anticipating that there are going to be some people who are working from home.

So I mean, I think that if you think about the amount of kind of lower portfolio NOI from that, it's probably $0.03 or $0.04 quarter-to-quarter. And then there's a couple of sense of lower termination income. And so that's the negative.

And we have a price point that's lower than the price points in New York City. And we have a long ramp up. And we looked at that relative to the visitors that were going to destinations like duck tours, the Freedom trail, the New England Aquarium, the Science Museum, the Museum of fine arts, and we kind of triangulated into a range of where we thought we would start and where we might get to.

So we are 60 days from that, and we are probably 40 days away out of sort of the worst of it relative to how much virus was around, it takes time for leases to get signed, right? There's a process. So that's why I said there should be no -- shouldn't have been any expectation that the activity in the first quarter was higher than what you saw relative to what was published by the brokerage houses because just -- there wasn't time to do things. We are seeing a lot of activity now that I tried to describe was significant amounts of expanding tenants, particularly on the smaller side, and then tenants that are looking to change their facilities and upgrade their premises. 
Now, it is absolutely true that there's musical chairs associated with those kinds of demand generators, right? Somebody is in an older building in 50,000 square feet and they move into a new building, it might be 45,000 square feet, it might be 55,000 square feet. There is no question that not a lot of positive incremental growth overall in the market today, but you've got to start someplace, and we're starting with tours, and we're starting with lease expirations, and we're starting with incremental smaller growth from smaller tenants. And as I said, we're seeing a few signs, particularly in California and some of the other West Coast markets of large-scale demand from some of the large, what we refer to as tech titans. I can't tell you if that's going to translate into additional absorption of growth from smaller technology companies, I think my comments were there's going to be a lot of, as we own and I talk, experimentation and figuring this out and there's going to be a delay relative to picking up incremental space while that goes on and people understand how they're going to be utilizing their physical environment and their human capital and how they mesh those 2 things together. But I think you're going to see a lot more activity. I don't necessarily think you're going to see a lot of positive absorption from growth, but you're going to see positive absorption from sublet space coming off the market."

There's not a discussion about lease-up and market rents and those types of things. And the bid and the ask can merge. I will say, I do think our pipeline of value-added deals is growing.

There's a lot of these -- there are a lot of owners of these kinds of assets that just want to sell for whatever reasons, and we're seeing it more of it come to the market.

If you ask me, will transaction volume and will concessions start to reduce in 2022? I think the answer is, sure, absolutely. I feel very confident that, that's going to happen. But I think the next couple of quarters, it's going to be -- we're going to be legging into the recovery of leasing volume. And as I said earlier, I think there's going to be not much in the way of positive absorption overall from new tenant growth, but there will be a positive absorption from sublet reduction. And so I think there's going to be concessionary pressure in certain kinds of buildings in certain kind of markets. I will tell you, that you could have a building in a market like New York or San Francisco or Boston, where rents are holding and concessions are not going up. And there may be 2 buildings next door that have a lot of available space, and they're being very aggressive about how they're positioning their space. So it's going to be very, very different from building to building and from submarket to submarket.

That exception is we are not negotiating any large leases with new office tenants on new buildings, okay? And that's a meaningful difference, right?

We -- New York has been up and running, people being able to go to work, people starting to do things for 9-plus months, and San Francisco really didn't open up until, call it, March. So it's just been slower going, but we are -- as I said, when I described the sublet activity that we are experiencing on the space -- piece of space that is available at 680 Folsom Street, which is a fabulous piece of space, there are a lot of tours from technology companies that are looking at that space. So it's slowly starting to happen in San Francisco, but it's behind New York City relative to recovery."

We're down roughly 30% already off a 2008 base year, and that's improving and electrifying in our buildings as well as some mixing in some new buildings. Second is converting our power sources from brown to green and we've been doing that with some limited increases in cost, but I've described them as limited, and that's probably gotten us another 1/3 of the way there. I think we will accomplish this goal. We'll continue to turn those dials, both in terms of energy intensity and green power. And then we may have to do some offsets to accomplish the final goal. There is some cost associated with it, but I wouldn't say it's material relative to the overall results of the company. And we think increasingly, it's important to be a leader in this area. Again, I always say it's the right thing to do, but it's also a smart thing to do because our customers care about it are -- certainly, our cities do. We're all in coastal cities. They're increasingly concerned about this topic, many have their own regulations. Our capital providers care about it. As you know, Vikram, we've seen more and more shareholders at ESG conferences. We did a green bond recently where we thought we got some small benefit from offering a green bond. And I can tell you our employees certainly care a lot about it. So that's the plan, and that's why we're doing it."

And as Doug mentioned, many of which are quite opportunistic. We have some opportunistic sublet space in our portfolio here. But if you go ask the decision-makers at our customers, they'll tell you that, yes, the space is on the sublet market, but we want to be open and flexible in case we capture a sublet tenant. If they come across someone that could backfill part of their space, it doesn't necessarily mean that they're going away. They just might need to downsize or rearrange. So I think that we -- a lot of the competing sub spaces out there that are not actually directly competitive with us and the other Westside landlords. 
As it relates to kind of what we're structuring with our prospective tenants right now, we're seeing it be the story of the haves and the have nots. Depending on the industry and the sector, you've got technology, entertainment and content companies that are continuing to grow in a big way. If you look at what we've done with Snapchat and a couple of the leases that we signed over at Colorado Center and the expansion that Doug mentioned with our existing tenant at Colorado, these groups are growing, and they're looking to grow right now. And so we're excited about the prospect of that, while we're being mindful of the need to potentially switch their space and really kind of focus on. Ray, I'll turn it over to you.

Santa Monica Business Park, a little bit different, little older product. We just lost a tenant that decided to shift out of the center, but internal demand from our existing tenants led by Snap and others, we're quite confident that, that park will return to a fully stabilized point very soon. And I have seen relative to reference to other markets, I think the West L.A. market may have had a pause, but it's coming back very strong, led by the same tech sectors, as John just elaborated on.

And the markets are being led by demand growth. And it's the demand growth that gives us the comfort to be able to start these buildings on a speculative basis with a relatively short delivery time frame because they're fully permitted and we have construction drawing, then we bid the cost, so we know exactly what the cost side will look like, and we know what the delivery time is going to look like. And there are -- again, we literally just started the foundations at 751, and we have 2 RFPs that we're responding to, and that's a show-me market. And similarly, as soon as we announced that we were going forward with 880, we've been having about a tour a week, we've already actually responded to 2 proposals. We have 2 more proposals that are coming in over the next couple of days that I'm told. It's just the demand is there because the drug discovery and the changes in the way capital is flowing into the life science sector, particularly into new compound development and new technologies for compound development is concentrated in these 2 parts of the country, and there is just great demand, and it's the demand, Brett, Blaine, that's creating the confidence that we have to do what we're doing relatively speaking on a speculative basis.

And the reason I'm pointing that is because it actually happened. Everything else is conjecture at this point. And as we know, plans don't always turn into legislation. 
So look, I do think that higher taxes are not great for business. I do think that in New York, it does impact a smaller portion of the population because it's primarily the high earning population, which is not a large percentage of people. And a lot of the employers that are attracted to New York are employing broader parts of the population that are not necessarily impacted by those tax increases. But it's certainly not a positive overall for business. 
And then at the federal level, again, these are all plans. Nothing has been enacted. The things that we're paying attention to are obviously the capital gains tax change. The increase in taxes for high earners. Again, both of those are going to impact a pretty small percentage of the population. Don't really have a geographic overlay because it impacts the entire country. 
Then the other one that's in the most recent Biden plan is repeal of the exchange. And this has been talked about before by federal legislators and it generally doesn't pass. And I think at the end of the day, a lot of the  exchange transactions just don't occur if you get rid of the exchange benefit. So -- but we'll just have to see how that plays itself through the entire system. 
The other thing that we hear is being discussed in Washington is a repeal of the salt exemption cap we -- again, I have no idea. We have no idea whether something like that would pass. If it did, it would clearly be beneficial to our footprint."

The BXP team is joining you today from our offices all over the country where we're beginning to see renewed signs of life as our cities reopen with increasing activity on the street, in shop and restaurants, on public transportation, and yes, even in office buildings, where building census is picking up and tour activity is accelerating.
U.S. GDP is growing at 4.3%, over 1.6 million jobs were created in the first quarter. Weekly jobless claims are in decline and unemployment has dropped to 6%, only 2.5 percentage points above pre-pandemic levels of February last year. Professional service employment has remained healthy, which is important given our tenancy.
U.S. retail sales surged 9.8% in March and air travel, as measured by TSA checkpoints, is up 10x over a year ago, but still only 50% of pre-pandemic level. The U.S. and global economic recoveries continue to follow the course of the virus and vaccination rollout. While new COVID-19 cases have remained sticky at around 60,000 per day since late February, all data, including 3 million daily vaccinations, 43% of Americans having received at least 1 shot and the J&J vaccine reinstatement suggest the trajectory for a highly vaccinated population and fewer new COVID infections remains positive.
The U.S. economy will likely continue to surge, given the financial health of most industry sectors, the significant federal fiscal stimulus provided to individuals and small business, accommodative monetary policy and pent-up consumption sparked by the pandemic reopening. This recovery is starting to bring positive momentum to the office markets and BXP's result.
For the buildings we can track, our census last week was, depending on the city, at or above the post-pandemic peak established last October. In the first quarter, we completed 592,000 square feet of leasing, 84% of the leasing volume we achieved in the first quarter of last year and 46% of our longer-term first quarter average. These leases had a weighted average term of 7.6 years. Our leases that commenced this quarter demonstrated a 15% roll-up of net rent for second-generation space. We exceeded our FFO per share forecast for the first quarter and the tenant charges we experienced in 2020 largely disappeared.
More broadly, tenant requirements in our target markets in March, based on data provided by VTS, were up 33% versus the prior month and 51% versus the prior year, though we're only down -- though are still down 40% from pre-pandemic levels. Office markets are lagging other asset classes because very few employers are currently mandating in-person work. That is now changing rapidly as many large employers, such as Google, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Ernst & Young, Facebook, Amazon, Apple and others have announced return-to-work plans for this summer. We continue to see Labor Day as a key tipping point for employees returning to the office, with forecast low COVID infection rates, high vaccination levels, the end of summer and schools reopening.
We hear repeatedly from our clients as well as in interviews we have completed with large occupiers that the key to future success and competitiveness is to successfully reintroduce in-person work. Unlike most recessions, most of our clients are thriving and have not reduced headcount. In our leasing activity and renewal conversations with clients, we have not seen material reduction in space requirements.
Now moving to private equity market conditions. There were $15 billion of significant office assets sold in the first quarter, though volumes were down 37% from the first quarter of last year. Assets with limited lease rollover and anything life science related currently receive the best pricing, often better than before the pandemic. There were again several deals of note completed in our markets, including in San Francisco The Exchange on 16th located in the Mission Bay district sold for $1.1 billion or $1,440 per square foot, a record price per square foot in San Francisco and it represented a 4.9% cap rate. This 750,000 square foot recently developed building is 100% leased to a tenant trying to sublease the entire building. The asset was sold to a fund manager, which may attempt a life science conversion.
In Seattle, 300 Pine, the Macy's building sold for $600 million or $779 per square foot and a 4.4% cap rate. The majority of this 770,000 square foot asset was recently converted to office space, which is 100% leased by Amazon, and the remainder is undergoing further renovation. The building was purchased by joint venture between a fund manager and a real estate operator.
And in the Washington, D.C. CBD, a 49% interest in Midtown Center was sold to an offshore buyer. The building comprises 870,000 square feet and is substantially leased to Fannie Mae as its headquarters. The gross sale price was $980 million, $1,129 a square foot and a 4.7% cap rate.
Moving to BXP investment activities. Let's start with our growing life science business. BXP currently has over 3 million square feet leased to life science clients, approximately 2 million square feet of current and future office to lab conversion projects, and sites for approximately 4 million square feet of life science ground-up development, primarily located in among the strongest life science markets in the U.S., namely Cambridge, Waltham and South San Francisco. We recently received 1 million square feet of new entitlements at Kendall Center in Cambridge, and our joint venture at Gateway Commons is in discussions with local authorities in San Francisco to increase entitlements by 1.5 million square feet.
We had a very active first quarter launching 3 new lab developments and redevelopment projects. 180 CityPoint, a 330,000 square foot ground-up development and part of our larger CityPoint campus in Waltham with strong visibility from I-95. Second, 880 Winter Street is a 224,000 square foot Class A office asset we acquired in 2019 for $270 a square foot, and we'll redevelop into a lab building. And 751 Gateway, a 229,000 square foot ground-up lab development as part of our Gateway Commons joint venture in which we own a 49% interest.
Though all 3 projects are being commenced speculatively, we are seeing many new life science requirements in both the Waltham and South San Francisco markets and have made multiple lease proposals to potential tenants. A large portion of our active development pipeline is now lab and currently comprises 920,000 square feet and $560 million of projected investment for our share with projected cash yield at stabilization approximately 8%.
BXP has a rich history of success serving the life science industry. We have the land and building inventory in the strongest life science clusters in the U.S. as well as the execution skill and client relationships to make life sciences an even more meaningful component of our overall business.
Moving to the balance of our development pipeline. We delivered into service this quarter, 159 East 53rd Street with 195,000 square feet of office fully leased to NYU as well as the HU, which will open after Labor Day and serve as a unique culinary amenity for our 3 building, 53rd in Lexington Campus. We remain on track to deliver our 100 Causeway development in Boston later this year, which is pre-leased to Verizon, and we have 4 additional and significant projects slated to deliver in 2022. This pipeline is 86% pre-leased with aggregate projected cash yield stabilization projected to be approximately 7%.
To maintain our external growth, in addition to adding the 3 life science projects, we also are investing approximately $182 million into an observatory redevelopment project on the top of the Prudential Tower in Boston. When complete, the observatory will have 3 levels, comprise 59,000 square feet and will be a world-class attraction, featuring both indoor and outdoor, 360-degree viewing decks as well as exhibit an amenity spaces. The project will be the only observatory in Boston, and we expect it will generate strong return to BXP after delivery in the spring of 2023.
Net of all these movements, our active development pipeline currently stands at 10 development and redevelopment projects comprising 4.3 million aggregate square feet and $2.7 billion in total investment for our share. We expect these projects, along with the lease-up of 2 residential buildings delivered in 2020 as well as 159 East 53rd Street to contribute 3.5% of annual and external growth to our NOI over the next 3 years.
We continue to actively pursue value-added acquisitions in our core markets in Seattle. Despite the impacts of the pandemic, office investment opportunities in our core markets remain highly competitive. To enhance our financial resources, execution speed and returns, we have reached an agreement with 2 large-scale sovereign investors to pursue select acquisitions together. The partners, including BXP, will commit up to $1 billion and we'll have the opportunity to invest 1/3 of the equity in each identified deal at their discretion.
BXP will provide all real estate services and has agreed to commit its acquisition deal flow to the partnership, subject to specific carve-out. We believe this venture with approximately $2 billion of investment capacity provides us the financial resources and return enhancements to be an even more nimble and competitive participant in the acquisitions market. We will announce the completion of the partnership, including the participants once documentation is complete, likely in the next month.
Moving to dispositions. We recently completed the sale of our 50% interest in Annapolis Junction, Buildings 6 and 7, our last 2 remaining properties in the Fort Meade, Maryland market. The buildings totaled approximately 247,000 square feet and sold for a gross price of $66 million, which is $267 a square foot. We have under contract 3 buildings in our VA 95 Business Park in Springfield, Virginia for a gross sale price of $70 million. And we also have under letter of intent, the sale of several stabilized suburban buildings for another approximately $190 million. Additional asset sales are being evaluated, and we believe our gross disposition volume in 2021 will exceed $500 million.
To conclude, BXP is emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic with strength and momentum. Leasing volumes and requirements are rising, office collections exceed 99%. Our clients are healthy, if not thriving. Tenant credit charges have largely disappeared. Our $30 million per quarter of lost variable revenue is poised to return with offices reopening. We've launched new life science development. Our active development pipeline is expected to deliver strong external growth, and we've raised the war chest for new acquisitions to add even further growth. I remain confident in both our near-term and long-term growth prospects.
I'll turn it over to Doug."

I'm going to try and give you my best shot at describing the operating environment that we are seeing in our portfolio as we sit here in late April. So as Owen said, the office tenants are deep into planning for their return to the physical in-person work environment as we approach the back half of 2021.
And while there are lots of announcements, as Owen said, of relaunches, and our building census is up, we're still pretty low levels. And I think you can see that most clearly from a financial perspective, when you look at our monthly or daily parking, which was basically flat in the first quarter to where it was in the fourth quarter of 2020. Although just yesterday, as an example, we had our meeting for our California parking, and we had 67 requests for additional monthly spaces, 42 of them which are hard. And to give you a perspective, we actually lost more than half of our monthly parking over 800 monthly spaces in Embarcadero Center. So things are picking up.
When we spoke to you late in January, we said that the first half of '21 was going to have a low level of market leasing activity as defined by executed leases and that statement still holds. The reports that are published by the commercial brokerage organizations describing broad market conditions and all the calls that are sponsored by the analysts that follow our sector, really didn't have any surprises in them. Leasing volumes were off their historical pace. There was modestly more sublet space, which was added to the market, and that translated into some negative absorption and increased availability. No surprise, no shock.
Last quarter, I described the dynamics around sublet space, particularly opportunistic sublet space. Again, this is when tenants are listing their entire premises, obviously, at no cost with an expectation that they'll decide what to do if they actually get an offer that they can actionably respond to down the road. But the reality of transactioning when push comes to shove is that tenants may reoccupy, they may relocate and transact. And then they may find a way to sublet a portion of their space, but not the whole space. So giving you a couple of examples.
In Boston, we had a 50,000 square foot tenant, 2 floors in our CBD portfolio list their entire space. This successfully relet -- sublet one floor and then they pulled the second floor off and they are reoccupying in July. We competed actually against the long-term fully furnished sublet space in Mountain View in the Silicon Valley, and the user began to negotiate on a sublease. But when the prime landlord refused to agree to recognize the lease, the user quickly walked away and took direct space.
So I'm not going to downplay the fact that there is a lot of sublets based on the market, but a large portion of it is not actionable because of short-term unworkable existing conditions or, quite frankly, users' discomfort with the lessors profile. And when you ask what percentage is, I don't know, but it's meaningful. And yesterday, JLL came out with a report saying there was about 1.5 million square feet of New York City sublet space that was brought -- pulled from the market by those subtenants.
Now the headwind from the sublet space are going to exist, but they're going to dissipate as companies return to in-person work. Obviously, we are also confronting the caution that some organizations are facing as they work through how they move beyond having their employees working from their homes and only interacting on video calls that are typically scheduled days in advance.
This may delay decisions to increase space needs, even though companies have hired more staff as Owen said, during this COVID shutdown and now as the economy is reopening. This backdrop is obviously going to add some more short-term pressure on lease economics in some markets. It's not going to affect all the markets in the same way, and it's certainly not going to impact all the buildings in the same -- in those markets in the same way either.
The potential impact on pricing of sublet space and work from home makes a really dramatic commentary, but it's not going to be driving Boston Properties' results. I hope the following analysis will illustrate that point.
So the average gross rent on our expiring office space portfolio in 2021, 2022 and 2023, so the next almost 3 years, totals about 5.8 million square feet and the average expiring rent is about $65.50 per square foot. So if you believe that pre-pandemic market rents on that space were $70 a square foot, and I'm just using that as an example but it's close, and you wanted to measure the impact of some kind of a decline. And this is an example, not a statement of where I think -- what we think is going on with rent, so let's use 10% as an example, then you would get to about a 4% roll down in rent or $2.50 a square foot or approximately $4.8 million per year over 3 years. That's it. That's the impact of the decline in rents on our portfolio from weak conditions.
And as a point of reference, the change in second-generation gross lease rents this quarter was positive 9.5%. Now that's sort of deals that started and were signed previous to this quarter. As I go through my remarks, I'm going to talk about where rents are on spaces that we've physically signed leases on this quarter or that we're working on now and how those rents compare to existing in place rents. So as I pivot my remarks to the Boston Properties' portfolio, I'm going to describe our level of activity, and I think it's going to be counter to weak macro market conditions that you're hearing about in macro reports.
So let's start with our occupancy. Our in-service portfolio occupancy includes a 100% of our JVs, ended the quarter 140 basis points down or 640,000 square feet. Now 50% of that space that was added to our vacancy this quarter provided no revenue over the last 12 months. That is, it was a space that we were trying to recapture from defaulted tenants. In other words, much of this drop in occupancy doesn't reflect in any future revenue decline. This includes the Lord & Taylor Box, that's Prudential Center, where we are in active discussions that we expect will result in a dramatic increase in the revenue from that piece of space.
The office space that was given back by Ascena at Times Square Tower and their Ann Taylor retail outlets at the Prudential Center. Next quarter, we're going to have another one of these as we take back the ArcLight cinema space since they've officially ceased to operate. That's a 66,000 square foot lease at the hub on Causeway joint venture. And again, they never paid rent.
Also this quarter, we took back 62,000 square feet in a recapture, so we could expand a growing tenant that we are negotiating a lease extension on and expansion at Colorado Center. But that lease hasn't been executed yet to the spaces in vacancy. We did have one disappointment, which was the 200,000 square foot departure at the Santa Monica Business Park.
We, however, today, as I sit here talking to you, have 640,000 square feet of signed leases that have yet to commence, and they are not included in our occupied in-service portfolio. Unless we're actually booking revenue, we don't consider it occupied.
On a relative basis, my view of the ranking and the activity in our portfolio. So this is active lease negotiations, tours, RFPs, is as follows, from top to bottom: Boston Waltham, we don't really have any space in Cambridge, so I don't include that; Midtown Manhattan is second; the San Francisco CBD is third; Northern Virginia is fourth, followed by the Silicon Valley Peninsula, West L.A., Princeton and the D.C. CBD. All of the transactions I am going to describe to you are post-COVID negotiations having begun in the latter half of 2020 or 2021. So let's start in Boston, which, by the way, represents over 1/3 of the company's total revenue.
So during the first quarter in the Boston CBD, we did 5 leases totaling 37,000 square feet. And in every case, the starting rent represented a gross rent roll-up of between 12% and 25%. We continue to have additional activity in the CBD portfolio, albeit it's with a preponderance of smaller tenants since we don't have much in the way of blocks available, and we are working on 8 leases totaling over 60,000 square feet. Of the 13 leases we have done this quarter or in the works, none of those customers are contracting and 5 are expanding and more than doubling their footprint.
In the suburban portfolio, we completed 124,000 square foot of new leasing. The cash rent on those leases was up by 50%. We continue to have additional activity in suburban Boston. In Waltham, we're negotiating 6 more transactions totaling over 60,000 square feet. In the suburban portfolio, we have had some existing tenants expand and some contract. But we will be gaining occupancy with new tenants coming into the BXP portfolio, like our new tenants at 20 CityPoint and 195 West Street in Waltham. Again, those leases haven't commenced yet.
Life science demand in Waltham continues to accelerate. We announced our plans to reposition 880 Winter Street in early March and have had significant tour activity and have begun making proposals. This 220,000 square-foot building will be available for tenant build-out in the second quarter of '22.
In New York, since the beginning of the year, we've had more physical tours than we had in the comparable period in 2020 and in 2019. We completed 3 leases during the quarter totaling just 38,000 square feet, including a full floor expansion by a tenant at 399 Park. In total, the growth rents on this space was about 5% higher than the in-place rents.
Now I said, New York City is our second most active region, and we're negotiating 14 office leases totaling over 170,000 square feet, including a full floor lease at Dock 72 in Brooklyn. We also have 2 other active proposals at Dock 72, each in excess of 100,000 square feet. The majority of these New York City leases will be termed in excess of 5 years, and more than half of those tenants are new to the portfolio. We've had one midtown tenant pull their space off the sublet market and another large tenant that is still has its entire space listed, has begun to repopulate. 5 of the 14 active deals represent tenants that are negotiating expansions.
Activity at The Street plane of our buildings is also picking up. We're negotiating leases for food outlets at our 53rd Street, are eagerly anticipating the opening of the HU Culinary Collective at 601 Lex later this year, and we have a new lease negotiation for our vacancy on The Street at -- in Times Square Tower.
In Princeton, during the quarter, we completed 4 transactions and we executed a fifth at the beginning of April for a total of 28,000 square feet, and we're negotiating leases for another 29,000 square feet, all new tenants.
Activity in the D.C. region was light during the quarter with only 50,000 square feet of office leasing. But as the calendar moved to April, we signed another 170,000 square feet. 210,000 square feet of this total leasing was completed on currently vacant space and included 2 large leases at Met Square in the district and an expanding tenant in Reston Town Center. We have another 68,000 square feet of leases in process in the D.C. region, including 25,000 square feet in Reston from another expanding tenant.
In the Town Center, rents are basically flat to slightly down 1% to 2% since the relet rents have been adjusted by the fact that the current rents have been increasing contractually by 2.5% to 3% for the last 5 to 10 years. I would also note that retail activity in Reston has picked up. We have now opened 4 new restaurants since November of '20. We're negotiating leases with new food outlets totaling 27,000 square feet. They're going to open in '22. Pedestrian activity in Reston Town Center is active.
California has finally begun to reopen and allowed for higher levels of office occupancy, although it's still way behind the rest of our markets. During the quarter, at Embarcadero Center, we settled rent arbitration on 2 multi-floor 5-year extensions and completed another 10-year full-floor renewal. The markup on these 3 deals totaling 125,000 square feet was 46%. Tour activity for small tenants, a floor or under, has picked up and grown about 40% sequentially month-to-month from January to April. I would characterize half of our San Francisco CBD activity is with expanding tenants and half is with tenants that are contracting.
The uncertain level and the lack of pedestrian activity at The Street plane, particularly in the CBD of San Francisco, has been more severe than anywhere else in our portfolio. This has affected tenants' appetite for making any decisions. But large tenants have started to begin to look for space. There have been a number of tours on the high-quality sublet offerings south the market. We see the activity and the proposals on the available sublet space we have at 680 Folsom.
In South San Francisco, we signed a lease of 61,000 square feet at 601 Gateway. That's going to absorb about 50% of the expiration that's going to occur in the second quarter. We are underway at 751 Gateway, our first lab facility development in South San Francisco and have begun responding to proposals for this early 2023 delivery. 651 Gateway will be taken out of service in the second quarter of '22 when the final tenant vacates, and we will commence a lab conversion of that 293,000 square foot building.
In Mountain View, we continue to see a constant flow of medical device, alternative energy, battery storage, automotive and other R&D users looking for space. We're in renewal discussions with 24,000 square foot tenant and has commenced lease negotiation with a second tenant for 30,000 square feet on market-ready vacant space, and we have a tenant ready to go on a remaining floor of 18,000 square feet at 2440 El Camino. There are some large tech tenants in the market down in the valley today looking for expansion space, and we are certainly chasing those tenants if the timing were to match for our potential delivery at Platform 16.
In spite of the challenging COVID conditions in California and Santa Monica, we continue our renewal negotiations with a 260,000 square foot tenant at Colorado Center. And as I said at the outset, we've recaptured about 60,000 square feet that's going to roll into that tenant's expansion. We've also signed a lease for 72,000 square feet at Colorado Center with Roku, who's new to the portfolio. And as you may recall, earlier late last year, we did an expansion with staff at the Santa Monica Business Park.
So to summarize the takeaway from my comments. It's true that market fundamentals are weaker than they were a year ago. But what drives our same-store portfolio performance will be occupancy pickup as well as the return of our parking income and the recovery of our retail activity in revenue. There are tenants in our portfolio that are expanding in every one of our markets. Conditions are going to vary dramatically by some market. Rents may or may not decline depending upon the submarket, but we will still have embedded markups in our portfolio. There will be a flight to quality as better buildings see more tenant demand and tenant value paying less of a premium to being the best assets, and this will improve our occupancy. 
Let me turn it to Mike."
368278,711346399,2261032,"Boston Properties, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2021",2021-04-28,"Earnings Calls","BXP, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Doug. Great summary. Good morning, everybody. I'm going to start my comments this morning with a little piece on our activity in the debt capital markets. We had a very busy quarter, and it impacted our results. As we guided last quarter, w",851,"Great. Thanks, Doug. Great summary. Good morning, everybody. I'm going to start my comments this morning with a little piece on our activity in the debt capital markets. We had a very busy quarter, and it impacted our results. As we guided last quarter, we redeemed the $850 million of our expiring unsecured bonds that had a 4% and 8% coupon using available cash.
But in addition to that and not part of our prior guidance, we issued another $850 million of new 11-year unsecured green bonds at an attractive coupon of 2.55%. The proceeds were used to repay our $500 million unsecured term loan that was due to expire next year and we redeemed at par an expensive $200 million, 5.25% preferred equity security. We incurred noncash charges during the quarter of approximately $7 million or $0.04 per share related to writing off unamortized financing costs.
Our next bond expiration is not until early 2023, when we have $1 billion expiring at an above-market interest rate of 3.95%. In advance of that in early '22, we have a $626 million mortgage expiring on 601 Lexington Avenue in New York City. This loan also carries an above-market interest rate of 4.75%.
So turning to our earnings results for the quarter. For the first quarter, we reported FFO of $1.56 per share, that was $0.01 above the midpoint of our guidance range. The variances to our guidance were comprised of $0.04 per share of higher NOI from the portfolio and $0.01 per share of higher fee income, partially offset by the $0.04 per share noncash charge related to our refinancing activity.
The portfolio NOI outperformance included $0.02 per share of lower operating expenses during the quarter, much of which will be incurred later in the year. And on the revenue side, we collected delinquent 2020 rent from several of our retail tenants, whose rents are being recognized on a cash basis. These collections drove a significant portion of our $0.02 revenue beat. As we described last quarter, we believe the vast majority of our tenant credit charges are behind us. Our net write-offs this quarter were immaterial, and collections from our office clients continue to be consistent and very strong.
We provided guidance for the second quarter 2021 FFO in our earnings release of $1.59 to $1.61 per share. At the midpoint, this is $0.04 per share better sequentially from the first quarter. The expected improvement emanates from lower seasonal G&A expense and the cessation of preferred dividends from our redemption. Also the first quarter financing charges are not expected to recur. Partially offsetting this, we project lower termination income in Q2. And as Doug explained, our occupancy declined by 140 basis points this quarter, which was expected, but results in a sequential drop in portfolio NOI from the half that was paying rent before.
We expect another drop in occupancy next quarter, followed by a modest improvement in the back half of the year. Doug described 640,000 square feet of signed leases that have yet to commence occupancy. 460,000 square feet of this will take occupancy later this year, representing over 100 basis points of occupancy pickup.
While we are still not providing full year specific guidance, given the uncertainty and timing of our ancillary revenue streams, we did provide you with a framework for 2021 in our last call. As you revisit your models for the full year, there are 3 other changes to consider. First, our financing activities during the first quarter have a net impact of increasing interest expense by $5 million for the year. Second, we have a loss of rental revenue from taking 880 Winter Street out of service for redevelopment into a life science facility. This has a negative impact of about $2 million. And lastly, the additional $260 million of dispositions that Owen described are expected to result in a loss of about $7 million of NOI. In aggregate, these items are expected to reduce FFO for the rest of 2021 by approximately $14 million or $0.08 per share.
Looking further ahead to 2022, we've made substantial investments in pre-leased developments that will drive earnings growth. We anticipate delivering 100 Causeway Street in Boston and 200 West Street in Waltham late in 2021, representing $315 million of investment at our share that is collectively 95% leased. The contribution from these 2 development deliveries will not be that significant to 2021, but they will be at a full run rate in 2022.
The bulk of the remaining pipeline is projected to deliver in 2022. This includes our building for Google in Cambridge; Reston Next for Fannie Mae in Volkswagen; the Marriott Headquarters in 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue. This represents delivery of $1.7 billion of investment in 2022 at our share and 2.7 million square feet that is currently 85% pre-leased. This $2 billion of investment in conjunction with the recovery of our ancillary income sources and improved leasing activity post-pandemic sets us up for occupancy improvement in a period of solid future earnings growth.
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Owen."

Last week, on Earth Day, we published our 2020 ESG report where we made several important commitments. And those include, we set a goal to achieve carbon neutral operations by 2025. In addition, BXP had previously set a carbon emissions reduction goal in line with the most ambitious designation available under the science-based targets initiatives program. In 2020, BXP was one of 6 North American real estate companies with this distinction and the only North American office company.
We also established a new board level sustainability committee to among other things, increase the board oversight of an input for our sustainability issues. And lastly, we launched an internal diversity and inclusion committee last year with the mission of pursuing greater diversity among our workforce and vendors as well as new programs supporting diversity and fairness in our communities. BXP is proud of its consistent recognition as an industry leader in sustainability and ESG, an area increasingly important to our clients, our communities, capital providers and employees.
And then lastly, there's one important milestone that I want to mention. This will be Peter Johnston's last earnings call as he's retiring from Boston Properties next month after 33 years of service. Peter has been an outstanding leader in our Washington, D.C. business, and he will be greatly missed by all of us. Thank you very much, Peter.
Operator, we're ready for questions."

On the last quarter, you talked about sort of an unofficial $6.52 when you took sort of the run rate and then maybe changes for the G&A and the various items that you guys had planned, that would suggest that $0.20 pickup with the second half of this year. But you just outlined about $0.08 of negative that is incremental to that. So is that $6.52 sort of now $6.45-ish type number? Or are there some other things that may impact where we should be thinking about where this year will end up?"

So yes, I want to describe those FFO drops for later this year.
Now, we've given some guidance for second quarter, and it does show that we will have pickup later in the year. And I think that if you look at Q2, you're going to -- we expect to have a further drop in occupancy in Q2. And if you look at our rollover schedule, about 60% of the remaining rollover for the year is hitting in just Q2. So Q3 and Q4 has very light rollover exposure. So we do expect to have some pickup in occupancy and revenue in the back half of the year from that leasing activity. And we would expect occupancy by the end of the year to be somewhere between 88% and 89%.
And then as I also said, we have 460,000 square feet signed that is going to occupy this year, so that's part of that number. So the improvement in the back half of the year is coming from a combination of some occupancy improvement in Q2 through Q4. And we also expect our parking to start to improve. Doug mentioned it, we're starting to see some green shoots with the parking that will be helpful. And then we have a couple of the development deliveries that I talked about at 100 Causeway and at 200 West Street, though that is later in the year. So those are really the things that are the pickup in the back half."

With regards to net effective, none of the transactions that we have been working on have had much in the way of significant changes in either free rent or TIs. I would say we've been building more space, but we were building more space pre-COVID. So there hasn't been a pickup in the cost of space, particularly on the TI side that we've seen yet, which is obviously good.

That's -- but space per employee is going down because you're not going to have employees for every -- that have desk for every employee.
And so I guess I'm wondering -- and this is a trend we've seen not only for firm, a mature firm, kind of downsizing, but also for a smaller tech firm who's expanding, but not expanding at the rate as it would have been in the past because it's doing more on the side and seating.

And particularly on the smaller size, they're not making any changes to the way they're utilizing their space. Most of those smaller tenants are in the financial asset management, professional services sector. And they are building out perimeter offices and/or larger workstation areas and everyone is getting a workstation, and nobody is sharing anything, okay? So there's a significant component of the market in terms of the transaction volume that is in that sector.
The rest of the larger tenants have -- I think there is a whole spectrum of results that you're going to see. We had a tenant that took 75,000 square feet of space in Waltham, named Imprivata that put a press release out with us a couple of weeks ago and they basically said, we're obviously not putting a workstation in for every single person in our organization who lives in the Boston area, and we're anticipating that there are going to be some people who are working from home.
I have a daughter who's working for a tech company in New York City. And their mandate was, if you're not prepared to Work X number of days per week, you're not getting a permanent workstation, and you're going to have to work on the hoteling side, right?

We had both tenants paying us for delinquency and also we had some termination income in the first quarter that we don't expect to repeat. And our termination income was about $4.5 million for the quarter, so that's more than what it normally would be.
So I think that about half of the occupancy that we lost in the first quarter was nonrent paying last year, but half of it was. And then again, we expect to lose some more occupancy this quarter because we have some rollover coming. So I mean, I think that if you think about the amount of kind of lower portfolio NOI from that, it's probably $0.03 or $0.04 quarter-to-quarter. And then there's a couple of cents of lower termination income. And so that's the negative.
And then you've got -- the positives for the quarter are, obviously, our G&A seasonal -- the preferred dividend is only about $0.01, and the financing charges were $0.04. So overall, we're sequentially up. And then again, I think the second quarter should be the bottom and that's when our kind of exposure to roll over really, really slows for the last 2 quarters and we've got signed leases coming on, and we do have some renewals and some other activity we're working on.

And we have a price point that's lower than the price points in New York City.
And we have a long ramp up. And we looked at that relative to the visitors that were going to destinations like Duck Tours, the Freedom trail, the New England Aquarium, the Science Museum, the Museum of Fine arts and we kind of triangulated into a range of where we thought we would start and where we might get to. And obviously, there's an expense load that we will be able to ramp up or down depending upon volumes. And so we don't expect to be cash flow positive in the first 6 months of this thing.

So we are 60 days from that, and we are probably 40 days away out of sort of the worst of it relative to how much virus was around, it takes time for leases to get signed, right? There's a process.
So that's why I said there should be no -- shouldn't have been any expectation that the activity in the first quarter was higher than what you saw relative to what was published by the brokerage houses because just -- there wasn't time to do things. We are seeing a lot of activity now that I tried to describe was significant amounts of expanding tenants, particularly on the smaller side, and then tenants that are looking to change their facilities and upgrade their premises.
Now, it is absolutely true that there's musical chairs associated with those kinds of demand generators, right? Somebody is in an older building in 50,000 square feet and they move into a new building, it might be 45,000 square feet, it might be 55,000 square feet. There is no question that there's not a lot of positive incremental growth overall in the market today, but you've got to start someplace, and we're starting with tours and we're starting with lease expirations and we're starting with incremental smaller growth from smaller tenants.
And as I said, we're seeing a few signs, particularly in California and some of the other West Coast markets of large-scale demand from some of the large, what we refer to as, tech titans. I can't tell you if that's going to translate into additional absorption of growth from smaller technology companies. I think my comments were there's going to be a lot of, as we own and I talk, experimentation and figuring this out and there's going to be a delay relative to picking up incremental space while that goes on and people understand how they're going to be utilizing their physical environment and their human capital and how they mesh those 2 things together.
But yes, I think you're going to see a lot more activity. I don't necessarily think you're going to see a lot of positive absorption from growth, but you're going to see positive absorption from sublet space coming off of the market.
One anecdote from Boston, this just may be specific to Boston, but I can't think of one example of tours that we've had over the last, let's say, 6 months that are descriptive of what you talked about, where it's just you're looking at open houses. When you think of the significance of what it takes to get a tour going, let's say, 5 or 6 months ago, for the client and the broker, et cetera, to get them out of homes and coordinate, it's significant.
And one of the things that's been really interesting is the quality information that we get on each of these, call it, prospective assignments and these are all very definitive in terms of what kind of square footage they need. And they have no quality of representative of what you're talking about, where they're just out kind of taking a look at around at what might be out there. These are very specific requirements."

That's sort of not what I think you would want to buy, but maybe those sovereigns would buy. So in those conversations that you're having with them, is this going to be a targeting value-add type stuff? Is it more the types of assets that we have seen trading?

And these 2 sovereign groups like our plans and also forecast that there will be opportunities.
As I've mentioned in previous quarters, it is true that most of the deal flow, most of the things that are happening are in the more core like assets because there's liquidity for those, there's not a discussion about lease-up and market rents and those types of things. And the bid and the ask can merge.
I will say, I do think our pipeline of value-added deals is growing. We are looking at more of these deals today. COVID has been going on now for over a year. There's a lot of these -- there are a lot of owners of these kinds of assets that just want to sell for whatever reasons, and we're seeing it more of it come to the market. So we'll see if the bid and the ask will narrow on those deals, but our pipeline is definitely elevated in the last month or 2."

So there seems to be a change in the offering composition relative to it being more of a service as opposed to a transaction where someone is trying to arbitrage retail and wholesale rents, right, where you're taking the space at wholesale and there you're leasing in a retail.
So there's going to be some change. And there -- presumably, the landlords that have gotten space back will work with these operators to figure out better ways to market and to achieve occupancy. I think that the really interesting question, and I wish we had an answer to it is, how profitable can it be? And what are the economics of the transactions that are being signed by the tenants? And obviously, the densities are going to change to some degree because of the nature of how tight those -- many of those operators were packing people in. And will the users pay the premium in order to give the operators the margin necessary to make it work? And I think that we'll see what happens."

And there's a lot more activity now. The real estate transaction leasing market is a relatively long sales cycle. And I don't think we're going to see dramatic changes and the economics in our marketplaces over the next couple of quarters.
If you ask me, will transaction volume and will concessions start to reduce in 2022? I think the answer is, sure, absolutely. I feel very confident that, that's going to happen. But I think the next couple of quarters, it's going to be -- we're going to be legging into the recovery of leasing volume. And as I said earlier, I think there's going to be not much in the way of positive absorption overall from new tenant growth, but there will be a positive absorption from sublet reduction.
And so I think there's going to be concessionary pressure in certain kinds of buildings in certain kind of markets. I will tell you that you could have a building in a market in like New York or San Francisco or Boston, where rents are holding and concessions are not going up. And there may be 2 buildings next door that have a lot of available space and they're being very aggressive about how they're positioning their space. So it's going to be very, very different from building to building and from submarket to submarket.

That exception is we are not negotiating any large leases with new office tenants on new buildings, okay? And that's a meaningful difference, right?

And from an operational perspective, getting to carbon neutral, do you think that brings some benefits?"

One is in reducing the energy intensity of our assets, which we have been doing for years. We're down roughly 30% already off a 2008 base year and that's improving and electrifying  equipment in our buildings as well as some mixing in some new buildings.
Second is converting our power sources from brown to green and we've been doing that with some limited increases in cost, but I've described them as limited and that's probably gotten us another 1/3 of the way there. I think we will accomplish this goal. We'll continue to turn those dials, both in terms of energy intensity and green power.
And then we may have to do some offsets to accomplish the final goal. There is some cost associated with it, but I wouldn't say it's material relative to the overall results of the company. And we think increasingly, it's important to be a leader in this area. Again, I always say it's the right thing to do, but it's also a smart thing to do because our customers care about it. Our -- certainly, our cities do. We're all in coastal cities. They're increasingly concerned about this topic. Many have their own regulations. Our capital providers care about it.
As you know, Vikram, we've seen more and more shareholders at ESG conferences. We did a green bond recently where we thought we got some small benefit from offering a green bond. And I can tell you, our employees certainly care a lot about it. So that's the plan and that's why we're doing it."

Given that you guys saw a pretty substantial occupancy drop at both assets in LA this quarter, can you just touch on whether you think that sublease space is competitive to your vacancy? Or is it mostly opportunistic like Doug was describing? And then can you talk about any additional prospects you might have, the profile of those tenants that might be kicking the tires in that market?

And as Doug mentioned, many of which are quite opportunistic. We have some opportunistic sublet space in our portfolio here. But if you go ask the decision-makers at our customers, they'll tell you that, yes, the space is on the sublet market. But we want to be open and flexible in case we capture a sublet tenant.
If they come across someone that could backfill part of their space, it doesn't necessarily mean that they're going away. They just might need to downsize or rearrange. So I think that we see a lot of the competing sublet spaces out there that are not actually directly competitive with us and the other West side landlords.
As it relates to kind of what we're structuring with our prospective tenants right now, we're seeing it be the story of the haves and the haves nots. Depending on the industry and the sector, you've got technology, entertainment and content companies that are continuing to grow in a big way. If you look at what we've done with Snapchat and a couple of the leases that we signed over at Colorado Center and the expansion that Doug mentioned with our existing tenant at Colorado, these groups are growing, and they're looking to grow right now.
And so we're excited about the prospect of that, while we're being mindful of the need to potentially switch their space and really kind of focus on. Ray, I'll turn it over to you. I want to be cognizant of commentary of what you're seeing and what we're seeing from our tech tenants."

Santa Monica Business Park, a little bit different, little older product. We just lost a tenant that decided to shift out of the center, but the internal demand from our existing tenants led by Snap and others, we're quite confident that, that park will return to a fully stabilized point very soon.
And I have seen relative to reference to other markets, I think the West L.A. market may have had a pause, but it's coming back very strong, led by the same tech sectors, as John just elaborated on.

We do have a lot of start-up companies that are taking a look that are venture-backed and growing here in West LA. But the other companies, the large-scale tech firms and the large-scale content firms, it's a bit of a race to lock down the quality space.

And the markets are being led by demand growth. And it's the demand growth that gives us the comfort to be able to start these buildings on a speculative basis with a relatively short delivery time frame because they're fully permitted and we have construction drawings and we bid the cost, so we know exactly what the cost side will look like, and we know what the delivery time is going to look like.
And there are -- again, we literally just started the foundations at 751, and we have 2 RFPs that we're responding to and that's a show-me market. And similarly, as soon as we announced that we were going forward with 880, we've been having about a tour a week. We've already actually responded to 2 proposals. We have 2 more proposals that are coming in over the next couple of days that I'm told.
It's just the demand is there because the drug discovery and the changes in the way capital is flowing into the life science sector, particularly into new compound development and new technologies for compound development is concentrated in these 2 parts of the country, and there is just great demand and it's the demand, Brett -- Blaine, that's creating the confidence that we have to do what we're doing relatively speaking on a speculative basis.
We also are sitting in markets that have, I don't know, the vacancy rate for first lab space in Boston is under 5%, and it's probably in the 5% to 7% range in the South San Francisco, Brisbane market when you add in all of the space that's been committed on the new developments."

And the reason I'm pointing that is because it actually happened. Everything else is conjecture at this point. And as we know, plans don't always turn into legislation.
So look, I do think that higher taxes are not great for business. I do think that in New York, it does impact a smaller portion of the population because it's primarily the high earning population, which is not a large percentage of people. And a lot of the employers that are attracted to New York are employing broader parts of the population that are not necessarily impacted by those tax increases. But it's certainly not a positive overall for business.
And then at the federal level, again, these are all plans. Nothing has been enacted. The things that we're paying attention to are obviously the capital gains tax change, the increase in taxes for high earners. Again, both of those are going to impact a pretty small percentage of the population. Don't really have a geographic overlay because it impacts the entire country.
Then the other one that's in the most recent Biden plan is repeal of the like-kind exchange. And this has been talked about before by federal legislators and it generally doesn't pass. And I think at the end of the day, a lot of the like-kind exchange transactions just don't occur if you get rid of the like-kind exchange benefit. So -- but we'll just have to see how that plays itself through the entire system.
The other thing that we hear is being discussed in Washington is a repeal of the SALT exemption cap. We -- again, I have no idea. We have no idea whether something like that would pass. If it did, it would clearly be beneficial to our footprint."

I'm delighted to report that for the first time since the pandemic, I'm together with Doug, Mike, Sara, and our Boston team for this earnings call, and all BXP employees returned to the office on July 6.",2298,"Okay. Thank you, Sara, and good morning, everyone. I'm delighted to report that for the first time since the pandemic, I'm together with Doug, Mike, Sara, and our Boston team for this earnings call, and all BXP employees returned to the office on July 6. 
BXP is emerging from the pandemic with strength and momentum as evidenced by improving financial results and rapidly elevating leasing and investment activity. This morning, I will cover the economic recovery that is underway in the U.S.; BXP's momentum in terms of financial results and leasing; private equity capital market conditions, particularly for office real estate; and BXP's capital allocation activities focusing on 4 new investments we announced this quarter including our official entry into several new markets. 
So the U.S. economy, a wash with fiscal and monetary stimulus is roaring back as we exit the pandemic. U.S. GDP growth was 6.4% in the first quarter and predicted to be higher for the second quarter and for all of 2021. Over 850,000 jobs were created in June and aggregate unemployment decreased to 5.9%. Industries that use offices have been less impacted by the pandemic and the employment rate for their workers is lower. Despite the annual inflation rate rising to 5.4% in June, the 10-year U.S. treasury rate has dropped to around 1.3% and the Federal Reserve's rhetoric remains distinctly dovish given it believes recent inflation is driven by transitory factors. High economic growth and low interest rates create the ideal environment for strong real estate investment performance. 
Now BXP's financial results for the second quarter reflect the impacts of this recovery and an increasingly favorable economic environment. Our FFO per share this quarter was $0.10 above market consensus and $0.12 above our own forecast, which Mike will detail shortly. We completed 1.2 million square feet of leasing, more than double the volume we achieved in the first quarter and only 10% below our long-term second quarter averages. 
Our clients are making long-term commitments, the leases signed in the second quarter at a weighted average term of 7.5 years. Many are expanding as was the case with 2 large media and tech clients in L.A. and building quality is increasingly important as evidenced by strong tour and leasing activity at the GM Building, Reston Town Center, Colorado Center and the view floors at Embarcadero Center. We believe this activity and performance supports our repeatedly stated position that tenants are committed to the office as their location of choice to collaborate, innovate and train all critical for their long-term success, and that concerns about the work from anywhere impact on the BXP footprint are overstated. 
Moving to private equity market conditions, $15.7 billion of significant office assets were sold in the second quarter, flat to last quarter, up 77% from the second quarter a year ago and down approximately 44% from 2019 pre-pandemic levels, and it remains 23% of commercial real estate transaction activity. Cap rates are arguably declining for assets with limited lease rollover and anything life science related given lower interest rates. 
Notably in Cambridge this last quarter, a REIT agreed to purchase Charles Park vacant though with identified tenants for $815 million or $2,200 a square foot. Also One Memorial Drive in Cambridge, a fully-leased 409,000 square foot office asset is under agreement to sell for $825 million or over $2,000 a square foot and a 3.8% initial cap rate. 
Moving to BXP's capital market activity. We had a very active and successful quarter with acquisitions. All of the investment strategies we have described to you over the last several quarters are represented in the 4 new investments we recently announced, which aggregate almost 2 million square feet. These strategies are: grow in life sciences, enter the Seattle market, acquire high-quality assets that need redevelopment or refreshment at discounted valuations due to the pandemic and acquire office assets in partnership with private equity investors through a joint venture investment program we set up with GIC and CPP, 2 leading global real estate investors. 
So let's start with our official entry into the Seattle region with the acquisition of Safeco Plaza. We have previously discussed the Seattle areas having a strong real estate market as well as a logical expansion region for BXP's gateway strategy. The Puget Sound region is the headquarters location for leading global employers like Amazon and Microsoft and has one of the largest clusters of computer science workers in the U.S. Seattle has experienced high levels of population and rent growth given its expanding technology and life science employment base and is much more affordable than other major technology markets, given no state of Washington income taxes and lower real estate costs for both office space and housing.  Rent, land values and building values are lower in Seattle than any of our other core gateway markets. 
The broader Puget Sound market has the scale and growth potential to afford us opportunities to both acquire and develop in multiple districts of Seattle, Bellevue and other Eastside markets. We have had a BXP executive, Kelly Lasan, who's joined the call this morning, based in Seattle for well over a year. We have an attractive pipeline of additional investment opportunities currently under review and will build out a full-service real estate execution team over time. 
Safeco Plaza comprises 800,000 square feet, has a lead platinum certification and is located in the center of the Seattle CBD with convenient access to rail, ferry and highway transit option. The building is currently 90% leased with 6 years of weighted average lease term at rents that are approximately 30% below market. Safeco Plaza offers generous ceiling heights, 360-degree views and timeless architectural features, and our strategy is to refresh the ground plane lobby and amenities and re-lease the building at market rates in the coming years. Liberty Mutual, which acquired Safeco, is the anchor tenant leasing 68% of the building. BXP will own either 51% or 33.3% of the property depending on whether 1 or 2 private equity investors join the partnership. We believe our basis in the acquisition, which is $465 million or $581 a square foot is very favorable relative to replacement costs and recent office trading activity in the Seattle market. We believe Safeco Plaza to be a very attractive investment opportunity with a future redevelopment play given the quality and location of the building, or going in basis as well as the cash flow we receive from existing tenants during the refreshment process. We have a nonrefundable deposit posted and intend to close the acquisition in early September. 
We are also entering a new submarket for BXP, Midtown South and New York City, with the acquisition of 360 Park Avenue South. Midtown South has become New York's strongest submarket in terms of rent growth and vacancy given it is the preferred location for many technology occupiers. New York City's most rapidly growing business segment. 360 Park Avenue South comprises 450,000 square feet and is in a prime location at the corner of 26th Street, 1 block from Madison Square Park. The transaction will close and the building will be vacated by a long-term corporate user later this year, which provides us the opportunity to plan in advance and subsequently execute a complete refreshment of the building. With generous ceiling heights and a unique elevator configuration, allowing for 2 separate dedicated lobbies, we believe the building will appeal to both large and medium-sized users seeking marketing and brand expression opportunities with their space. 
In terms of economics, we're paying $300 million for the building or $667 a square foot, which leaves us significant latitude relative to comparable sales to budget generous building enhancements. The acquisition structure is also creative and we think favorable for BXP. Consideration for the purchase will be the assumption of a $202 million mortgage on the property and the issuance of $98 million of OP units in BXP's operating partnership. We are committed to complete the transaction on December 1 of this year, and the number of OP units issued at closing will be determined by BXP stock price at that time, but with a floor of $111 a share. 
In other words, we would benefit by issuing fewer units if our share price continues to rise through the closing date, but our downside is capped by a floor. Most importantly, the tax deferral inherent in our contribution structure distinguished our proposal such that it did not have to be the highest price to yield the seller the highest after-tax value. One of our joint venture investment program partners will likely join this investment by funding all of the capital needed for the refreshment resulting in their owning up to a 50% interest in the project over time. 
Next on acquisitions, we added to our Life Science business and entered the Montgomery County, Maryland Life Science market through the acquisition of a 7-building 435,000 square foot office park located in close proximity to the Shady Grove Life Sciences Center, the premier cluster for life sciences in the Washington, D.C. region. Montgomery County is the fourth largest life science market in the U.S. and home or proximate to several large biomedical institutions such as NIH, FDA, John Hopkins University and the University of Maryland. The 4 million square foot Shady Grove submarket at the epicenter is currently 3% vacant with rising rents. We are paying $116.5 million for the asset or $267 a square foot and intend to convert the entire park to lab and life science use over time. There are 7 buildings in total, 3 of which are vacant and will be converted to lab immediately. The remaining 4 buildings are 63% leased and will be converted to lab use as leases expire and office tenants vacate over the next few years. 
The entire site is 31 acres and can accommodate additional ground-up development depending on demand. There is a strong backlog of space requirements in the market, and we are already competing for a large build-to-suit in addition to other requirements. We have a nonrefinable deposit posted and plan to close the acquisition in August. 
And lastly, in the second quarter, we completed another life science acquisition, 153 and 211 Second Avenue in Waltham, Massachusetts. These 2 existing lab buildings comprising 154,000 square feet and 100% leased to Sanofi are located immediately adjacent to our 200 West Street lab conversion property, which is almost complete and expected to deliver in the fourth quarter of this year. This was an off-market transaction completed at a price of $100 million or $650 a square foot and a 6.4% initial cap rate. Sanofi's lease is short term and below market. The site comprises 14 acres and has 120,000 square feet of additional development rights, which could be increased when combined with the excess development capacity of our adjacent 200 West Street site. 
Life Sciences is a rapidly growing segment of our overall business. Today, Life Sciences at BXP is 3 million square feet, representing 6.4% of our total revenue. We have 920,000 square feet of lab redevelopment and development projects currently underway that are experiencing strong user demand and expected to deliver in the next 36 months. And we have approximately 5.5 million square feet of future conversion and development opportunities under our control in the Cambridge, Waltham, Lexington, South San Francisco and now markets. Within 5 years, assuming continued strong market conditions, we could more than double the amount of BXP's revenue that is generated from the life science sector. 
Regarding dispositions, we have an agreement to sell our Spring Street office park in Lexington, Mass, for $192 million or $575 a square foot. We expect the sale to close in September as part of an exchange with the 2 life science acquisitions mentioned previously. Year-to-date, we have completed or committed to dispositions aggregating $225 million in our share of gross proceeds and are considering additional asset sales in 2021. 
And as a reminder on investment activities, though we did not add to or deliver from our active development pipeline this quarter, we have 4.3 million square feet of development underway that is 71% pre-leased and projected to add approximately $190 million to our NOI and 3.7% to our annual NOI growth over the next 3 years. 
On a final and important personnel note, John Powers, who, as you know, is the Head of our New York region, told us he would like to retire at the end of this year. We conducted a thorough external and internal search and are very excited to have Hillary Span join BXP as an Executive Vice President. Hillary has many years of real estate, management and investment experience as a senior officer of CPP and prior at JPMorgan Investment Management, having completed $12 billion in investments in New York City alone. Hillary will join BXP after Labor Day and commenced her duties as New York Regional Manager at the beginning of 2022. 
So in summary, we had a very active and successful second quarter with strong financial results and multiple new business wins in the leasing and investment markets. BXP has a strong growth ramp driven by improving economic conditions and leasing activity, the recovery of our variable revenue streams, delivery of a well-leased development pipeline, completion now of 4 new acquisitions, a strong balance sheet and capital allocated from large-scale private equity partners to pursue new investment opportunities as the pandemic recedes, a rapidly expanding life science portfolio in the nation's hottest life science markets, as well as low interest rates and decreasing capital costs. 
Finally, I want to express my sincere appreciation for the BXP team, which is back at the office, serving our clients and winning new mandates with great care, expertise and enthusiasm. 
Over to Doug."

I'm sure there'll be some questions on that, but I do want to spend a few minutes talking about the leasing markets and the activity that we're seeing",2866,"Thanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. Obviously, we have a lot to talk about on the transactional side. I'm sure there'll be some questions on that, but I do want to spend a few minutes talking about the leasing markets and the activity that we're seeing. There's certainly no question that we're on the precipice of significant change in the atmosphere around in-person work. But more announcements come out every day. The fact remains, there's still some uncertainty, and there's some repetition about COVID-19, the Delta variant and whatever the next thing is going to be. 
So the transition period that we are now in, as many organizations like ours encourage or require their employees to come back to work, it's going to take some time. So there are going to be some ramifications to that. Many of you participated in our NAREIT meetings and my comments this morning about impact on work from home, I think you're going to be pretty consistent with what we talked about during that conference. 
The impacts on space needs are going to really -- vary depending upon the size of organizations, which we like to put in 3 categories: So the first are the really large employers. Honestly, they are moving forward with plans for space based on long-term growth plans, hiring that's occurred over the last 16 months and thousands of open job requirements that they are trying to fill right now. Then you have really small organizations that are very stable. And they have all recognized that very little is going to change regarding how they utilize the real estate. Maybe some will work more from outside the office, but everyone is going to continue to have a dedicated workspace in their facilities, and they're really not impacting the amount of space they have. And then there's a third group, which is an important group. And the third group of midsized organizations or younger companies that are experiencing growth, but where it's very unclear is how their organizational culture is effectively going to be built, if people are or aren't in physical contact. And I think those companies are going to have to take some time to figure that out. Will it work or won't it work. And we don't believe that this is going to happen immediately. We think it's going to take 6 to 12 months, and it's going to really depend quite frankly, on how they're doing from a competitive perspective? How are their peers doing in their industries? And does it matter that they're not in contact with each other all the time? 
When surveyed, most employers prefer to have their teams together as much as possible to enhance efficiency and collaboration and serendipitous idea generation, et cetera, while many employees declare their preferences for some or more remote work. Well with a tight labor market, employers are acknowledging the reality. There will be an increase of work that takes place outside the office, and this will incrementally moderate some space growth in the short term. But these same companies may over time add collaborative spaces to accommodate their teams when they're all getting together and they may eventually decide that people need to be back more frequently. 
Unlike any other prior recession, there have been thousands and thousands of new positions created and there are lots and lots of job openings across the service sectors, the technology sectors, the life science sectors, the generators of office demand in our markets, and we believe many of these jobs are going to lead to space absorption over the coming years. 
Employees are returning to their offices with very few reminders of COVID restrictions and they're getting together formally in meeting rooms and collaboration areas and they're taking the time to reconnect their breakfast and lunch and dinner in restaurants. In many of our CBD assets, we have access control, so we can sort of see what's been going on in our competitive building set. So comparing to February of 2020 in New York City, about 50% of the employees who had cards are now coming to the office at least once a week, and that number is about 34% in Boston and 20% in San Francisco, so it's very different from market to market. 
Our sequential parking income grew about 20% from the first quarter. And while we've not seen monthly parking permits pick up, tenants are driving in and paying for daily parking. We actually think that monthly parking permits will be a good indicator for the increase of office frequency in Boston and San Francisco. In Boston, true transient parking is actually up and we've actually had to close portions of the Peninsula Center garage around lunchtime every day, during a couple of days in July, due to lack of capacity, believe it or not. At Embarcadero Center, we've seen about a 20% pickup from the low point on monthly parking, but we're still only at 60% of our historical high. So we have a long ways to go on parking. We expect to see improvements during the rest of the year. And at the end of the year, we think we're going to be at about 70% of where we were in 2019 on a full year comparative basis. 
As you listen to the apartment company calls, you're hearing about the dramatic increase in occupancy in urban areas. The employees are moving back into the cities into those same apartments, which, by the way, didn't grow during the pandemic. And so unlikely they're planning on working at home in those apartments on a frequent basis. And we're seeing this in our portfolio as we move from 51% occupancy in January to 82% at the Hub House project, that's The Hub on Causeway project, from 10% to 41% at Skyline in Oakland, and from 79% to 93% at Reston Signature. 
And then our restaurant activity is up materially, and only is really being limited now by the challenges that the operators are having with labor, both in the front and the back of house. We have begun to move away from percentage rent assistance to our retail tenants and that to contractual fixed rent. Believe it or not, in Reston, we actually had a tenant requests a modification back to fixed rent because the percentage rent was creating a higher payment to us. 
Sublet space continues to be a major topic during many of our conversations with investors. Last quarter, I described the dynamics of opportunistic sublet space and discuss our belief that many of the visceral announcements made by tenants that we're putting space on them would reverse as organizations begin to plan their in-person work strategy again. This quarter at 535 Mission, a tech company without subletting any space with through 40% of their 100,000 square foot availability. In Manhattan, CBRE is reporting that there's been a drop of about 5.9 million square feet out of a total of 19.3 million square feet that was put on post COVID and about 67% of that was backfilled by the prime tenant. 
Yes, there is a lot of sublets based on the market. But a large portion is going to be reoccupied. Some is not actionable because of short terms. It has unworkable existing conditions or quite frankly, users just don't like the comfort of the lessors profile and some of it is getting leased, like the 3 floors that were completed at 680 Folsom in San Francisco that macys.com had on a sublet market. The headwinds from sublet space exists, but they are going to dissipate as companies begin to come back to work. 
Now as I pivot my remarks to the Boston Properties, office and life science portfolio specifically, I'm going to describe a level of activity that I think is counter to the headlines of weak market conditions across the office sector in the United States. The BXP portfolio includes a number of iconic, high-quality, well-maintained and continually upgraded assets. When there is market weakness, our assets outperform. We spent a lot of time discussing our portfolio vacancy last quarter and our forward expectations. We experienced quicker-than-expected revenue commencement on signed leases and saw basically flat vacancy relative to the prior quarter, we were down 10 basis points on a 45 million square foot portfolio. And this included taking back 66,000 square feet of nonrevenue space that I talked about last quarter at The Hub on Causeway from the cinema that had never opened. 
We now have new signed leases for 640,000 square feet of space that have yet to commence and are not included in our occupied in-service portfolio. So on a relative basis, here's my view of the markets, and I'm making it based upon activity in the portfolio, active lease negotiations, tours, RFPs from best to least. 
Boston Waltham, we don't have any available space in Cambridge, so we have no activity there. San Francisco CBD, Northern Virginia, Midtown Manhattan, Peninsula Silicon Valley, West L.A., Princeton and finally, DC CBD. All the transactions I'm going to talk about are post COVID negotiations, meaning they all began in the latter half of '20 or into 2021. So just to change things up this quarter, let's start with L.A. 
Last quarter, I acknowledge our disappointment that we were unable to keep a 200,000 square foot tenant at the Santa Monica Business Park. Less than 30 days later, we had a signed lease for 140,000 square feet of that space to a growing tech company. During May, we completed a 350,000 square foot long-term extension and expansion at Colorado Center with a media company. In total, this 490,000 square feet had a weighted average expiring rent that was effectively equal to the starting rent of that space, and 200,000 square feet of the expiring rents were at above-market holdovers. 
This follows our immediate release of the 70,000 square feet vacancy that we had from a defaulting tenant in the first quarter. We have a number of smaller deals in negotiation in Santa Monica Business Park, and we're responding to a request from tenants that would prefer to go direct on some of the sublet availability at Colorado Center. 
In Boston, during the second quarter, in the CBD, we signed 6 leases totaling 55,000 square feet and the average rent starting represented a gross roll-off of about 20%. In each case, the tenant was either renewing or expanding. We have 7 additional leases in the works totaling 70,000 square feet. Obviously, most of them are small since we don't have much in the way of availability in our Boston portfolio. 
In the suburban Boston portfolio, we completed 60,000 square feet. The average weighted cash rent on those leases was up 17%. Life science organizations are dominating activity in this market. We commenced construction on 880 Winter Street. That's the lab life science renovation that we're doing in Waltham and have signed an LOI for 16,000 square feet. We started the building on July 5. And are exchanging proposals with over 180,000 square feet of tenants for the 220,000 square foot building, and it will be delivering in August of next year. We've been responding to new inquiries just about every week on that space. Asking rents in the market for lab space are in the high 60s to mid-70s triple net, which are well above our underwriting when we planned this project about 15 months ago. 
Many of you have been asking about inflation and construction costs. When we do our construction budgeting, we always include in an escalation expectation. So those numbers are baked into those numbers in our supplemental. It varies depending upon the labor market conditions, subcontractor availability and material costs. We bid in our on budget for both 880 Winter Street and 180 City Point. So we figured out what the escalation would be and we hit it. Currently, we're carrying about a 4% to 6% escalation for base building jobs that we would bid in 12 months. 
Now turning back to leasing. In Waltham, we're negotiating leases for another 70,000 square feet of space with life science companies at Bay Colony, that's adjacent to 880 Ware Street and our Reservoir Place building. Our new acquisitions at 211, 153 Second, which Owen described, have a lease expiration in late '22, and the current rental rates on the space are dramatically below market. The expirations will land right in the sweet spot of the current demand in the Boston and the Waltham and the Lexington submarkets. There is some pure office demand in the market and with more and more buildings being converted to life science, we actually expect the office market is going to tighten dramatically over the next few years. 
In New York, we continue to have significantly more tours than we had in comparable periods in 2019, and the second quarter is up significantly on a sequential basis from the first. We completed 10 office leases totaling 90,000 square feet including another full floor expansion at 399. In total, gross rent on leases signed this quarter were about 20% lower than the in-place rents. 
We are negotiating over 400,000 square feet of additional leases including almost 250,000 square feet at Dock 72. The majority of the New York City leases will be for terms in excess of 10 years, and we include 2 more expanding tenants at 399 Park Avenue. Activity at the street plane of the buildings is also picking up. We signed up a new fitness provider at 601 Lex, a new fast casual restaurant at 399, and we're negotiating a lease for all of the available restaurant base at Times Square Tower, and we plan on opening the Hugh Culinary collective at 601 Lexington in September. 
In Reston, our buildings continue to have extensive activity. This quarter, we completed over 170,000 square feet of leasing, of which more than 100,000 square feet was on vacant space. In addition, we have active negotiations on another 72,000 square feet including almost 60,000 square feet of currently vacant space. Reston Next is moving towards completion with the first tenant expected to take occupancy by the end of 2021. We have another 85,000 square feet of office renewals in negotiation in Springfield, Virginia. Retail leasing is roaring back in Reston Town Center. We've negotiated 35,000 square feet of restaurant transactions and have almost 100,000 square feet of cinema, fitness and soft good transactions in the Town Center. 
Pedestrian activity in Reston Town Center is as active as any location in our portfolio. Office rents are basically flat to slightly down on the re-let since the expiring cash rents have been contractually increasing by 2.5% to 3% for the last 10 years. 
In San Francisco CBD, we completed 5 transactions totaling 54,000 square feet with an average roll up of 8%. Why is it so low this quarter? While the square footage was impacted by a full floor transaction, it starts in the mid-90s where the tenant elected to forgo any TIs for a lower rent. If you exclude that transaction, the mark-to-market would have been 17%. In addition, we have 8 active lease negotiations involving 143,000 square feet with an average rent starting of over $100 a square foot. That's over $100 a square foot in this purportedly terrible market in San Francisco. Look of these spaces are in the higher floors in Embarcadero Center, and they all have used. Pedestrian activity at the Street plane, particularly in the CBD of San Francisco has improved over the last quarter, but it's still well behind Boston, Reston and New York. And this has affected tenant's appetite for making space decisions. However, medium-sized technology users have begun to look for space. Sublease absorption has picked up in the city with about 1 million square feet of withdrawals or completed transactions. And as I said earlier, macys.com did 104,000 square feet at 680 Folsom building. 
In Mountain View, we continue to see a constant flow of medical device and alternative energy and automotive and other R&D users looking for space. We completed a full building lease with an energy company with a healthy 60% markup in rent, and we have another 21,000 square foot lease in negotiation. There are some large tech tenants in the market today looking for expansion space and on recently executed leases for about 700,000 square feet of availability that was in Santa Clara. We are certainly pursuing those tenants for Platform 16, and we have begun internal discussions about the appropriate time for the speculative restart of this building. 
So to summarize, our leasing activity in the second quarter accelerated. Our portfolio is in great shape in L.A. We continue to see strong economic transactions in the CBD of Boston, our suburban Boston portfolio and the CBD of San Francisco. We have significant activity in Reston and are covering our vacancy. New York Tour activity is strong. We're doing deals, but economic terms are weaker. We are expanding our life science investments across the company and in Greater Boston and South San Francisco, our new construction is seeing strong demand at escalating rents. Mike?"
368278,1673289519,2352820,"Boston Properties, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2021",2021-07-28,"Earnings Calls","BXP, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Doug. I'm going to start my comments by describing our earnings results, which, as Owen mentioned, significantly beat our expectations. We reported FFO for the quarter of $1.72 per share, which is $0.12 per share better than the midpoint of our",1174,"Thank you, Doug. I'm going to start my comments by describing our earnings results, which, as Owen mentioned, significantly beat our expectations. We reported FFO for the quarter of $1.72 per share, which is $0.12 per share better than the midpoint of our guidance. About $0.06 of our outperformance came from earlier than anticipated leasing and better parking, retail and hotel performance, which I would consider core revenue outperformance. The other $0.06 is from unbudgeted termination income and expense deferrals that we expect to incur in the third quarter. Our office portfolio beat our expectations by approximately $0.02 per share from accelerated leasing. We have several larger leases commenced earlier than we expected, including our 350,000 square foot renewal and expansion with a large media tenant in L.A., a 65,000 square foot health care firm in suburban Boston, and 3 technology tenants in Reston totaling over 100,000 square feet. All of these leases were in our full year assumptions and were completed faster than we anticipated. 
Leasing in our residential portfolio also improved this quarter, exceeding our revenue projections by $0.01. The improvement was across the board with our stabilized residential buildings exceeding our occupancy assumptions by 100 to 200 basis points, and the recently delivered projects at the Hub House in Boston and in Oakland, seeing even stronger absorption. While market rents continue to be below pre-pandemic levels, concessions are starting to dissipate. 
Our parking, hotel and retail income exceeded our expectations by $0.03 per share. As Doug detailed, these components of our income stream have started to improve, which should continue as activity levels grow in our cities. The other 2 areas where we exceeded expectations were in termination income and lower operating expenses. Our termination income totaled $6.1 million, which was $0.03 above our budget. It came from 2 sources: First, at 399 Park Avenue, the building is full, and we have more demand than available space. This quarter, we were able to accommodate one of our expanding financial services tenants by recapturing 50,000 square feet from another tenant. The transaction resulted in $2 million of termination income in the quarter. And second, we received about $4 million in unexpected settlement income from tenants who defaulted on their leases last year. We category this as termination income. While we anticipate a modest amount of termination income every quarter, we do not assume receiving any additional settlement income this year. 
Finally, in our operating expense line, our maintenance expenses came in $0.03 per share lower than we anticipated. We've deferred these costs and expect that will be incurred in the third quarter. 
One other item I'd like to point out is that we reported second quarter same property NOI growth of 8.9% on a GAAP basis and 7.5% on a cash basis over the second quarter 2020. The strong increase honestly, is primarily due to the charges for accrued rent and accounts receivable we took in 2020 related to tenants impacted by the pandemic. If you net out last year's charges, our GAAP same-property NOI dropped by 1% year-over-year due to lower occupancy. However, our cash same property NOI grew by 3.8% year-over-year, as free rent periods expired and we've converted those to cash rents in 2021. 
This quarter's leasing statistics also require explanation. The total company in New York City leasing and particularly were negatively impacted by 2 retail leases in New York City. Excluding retail, the mark-to-market on our New York City office leases was positive 6% on a gross basis and positive 8% on a net basis. And office leases in the total portfolio demonstrated strong rental increases of 14% growth and 21% net. 
Now I'd like to turn to our expectations for the rest of 2021. For the third quarter, we provided guidance of $1.68 to $1.70 per share, $0.03 above consensus estimates at the midpoint. At the midpoint, our third-party guidance -- our third quarter guidance is $0.03 per share lower than our second quarter FFO. Again, this is due to the outsized termination income and expense deferrals from the second quarter. Net of those 2 items, our third quarter guidance is $0.02 to $0.04 per share higher than the second quarter. 
In the office portfolio, our occupancy exceeded expectations in the second quarter due to early lease commencements. For the rest of 2021, we anticipate occupancy will be relatively steady. As Doug mentioned, we have 640,000 square feet of signed leases that have not yet commenced occupancy. We expect 450,000 square feet of these leases to occupy before year-end. In addition, we have another approximate 600,000 square feet of both renewal and new leases in the works for 2021 occupancy. This activity, combined with already signed leases are expected to cover the 1.1 million square feet of lease expirations that remain in 2021. With stable occupancy, the current run rate for the in-service portfolio is a good proxy for the rest of 2021. 
We are expecting consistent quarterly improvement from our other income sources, primarily from our parking and the continued lease-up of our recently delivered residential properties. Our assumptions result in $0.02 of projected incremental NOI growth from -- in the third quarter from these sources. 
We also expect growth from the acquisitions that Owen described. Acquisition activity, net of dispositions, will add approximately $0.01 to our third quarter NOI and $0.02 to the fourth quarter. 
So in summary, after adjusting for $0.06 of higher termination income and deferred expenses from the second quarter, we project our in-service portfolio for the third quarter to be higher by $0.02 at the midpoint and our net acquisition and disposition activity to contribute $0.01. 
While we are not delivering any developments into service in the third quarter, we anticipate incremental growth from developments in the fourth quarter that will accelerate in 2022. We anticipate that we will start to recognize revenue as the first tenants commenced occupancy at our $270 million Hub on Causeway office tower in Boston in the fourth quarter. And by mid-'22, we expect this project that is currently 95% leased to be generating a stabilized NOI. We also expect to deliver our $50 million life science lab conversion at 200 West Street that is 100% leased in December of this year. It will be at its full run rate in 2022. Our development deliveries will accelerate and be more meaningful to our earnings growth in 2022. In addition to the deliveries in Q4 of this year, next year, we have $1.7 billion of developments slated for delivery and initial occupancy, and they're 85% leased in the aggregate. 
Overall, we're thrilled with our results this quarter as the markets continue to recover. Our leasing activity is exceeding our expectations. Our variable income streams are improving. Our development pipeline is on track to add future growth, and we're taking advantage of opportunities to acquire some unique assets at favorable prices that we expect will generate additional future earnings growth and value creation. 
Operator, that completes our formal remarks. Can you please open the line for questions?"

Kelly who's on the call moved to Seattle in February of 2020. And with her help on the ground, it's been a very active pipeline. I think it's robust because it's: one, both acquisitions and development; and two, as you're suggesting, it's in multiple geographies. So we've been looking in the CBD of Seattle where Safeco is. We've been looking at South Lake Union. We've been looking at the Bellevue area and to the east of there. So -- we think there -- it's a robust pipeline, and I think we will have success in growing out our region in Seattle in the near and medium term. 
And regarding Safeco  look, we are not looking to buy stabilized beautiful assets that are achieving a stabilized return of 3.5% to 5%, okay? That's not what we're doing. We're looking to find assets where we can create value through our operating prowess. And if you look at Safeco Plaza, it's an 800,000 square foot building that was built in the late 60s. It's got great bones, it's got great ceiling highs. It's got great views, and it's fine from an architectural perspective in the interior, but it's not fabulous. And our goal is to do what we did at 100 Federal Street with that asset, which was make that building something that it wasn't, which was a building that tenants wanted to go to as opposed to just another nice building in a CBD that was sort of moving one way or the other with the market. And we are actually -- we got to figure out exactly what it is we think we can do and economically how to do that. And honestly, I would say that we are -- while there is a little bit of vacancy in the building, we're not in a rush to lease the space in the building tomorrow because we want to make sure we understand what the building could become and sell what it will be, not what it is. And so we're going to be thoughtful and constructive with how we do that. And obviously, it's a weaker market today than we believe it will be in 12 months and 18 months. And we hope when we're at a point where we've done the work, the building is going to have a very different reputation and they're very different positioning in the building, and we're going to use the Boston Property skill set to do that."

I could argue cap rates are going down. And as Doug just said, that's just not -- we don't see that value creation for our shareholders. What we want to do are things like Safeco that are not stabilized, great bones, and we think the competitive landscape for those kinds of assets is less than it is for the leased assets. 
And I think if our thesis holds true, which we obviously think it is, which is people are going to return to the office, I think the capital will follow what we're doing. And I think those transactions will get more competitive. But Jamie, I wouldn't leave you with the impression that there are not other bidders for these assets.

And the reason I provide you with the information I do is because it is an indication of what is going on with the spaces that we leased today, which unfortunately, may not hit our supplemental statistics from a revenue perspective for 2 quarters, 3 quarters or 6 quarters. So I'm just trying to sort of give you a flavor of what is going on a relative basis, right? So it's very hard to sort of predict what's going to happen because I don't know which spaces we're going to lease and what the rent was versus what the rent might be on those spaces until it happens. 
So again, on average, everything I said was as basically down in New York City of 20%. That doesn't mean the market is down by 20%. It may mean that those leases might have had a negative mark-to-market in 2019, because the rent went way up in a particular building and the market just never got to where the increases were. But so things were down in New York, and they were flat in Los Angeles, again, on the portfolio of space we leased based upon what was being paid and what will be being paid on a cash basis. And then the other places in Bosto and in San Francisco, we were up about 20%; in Mountain View, we were up 60%; and in Reston, we were down, call it, 5% to 7%. And -- but again, a lot of the space in Reston was vacant. So there wasn't down. It's actually 100% increase because that space had been vacant for more than 12 months, right? So that's the reason that we give you what we give you in terms of the data, so you can have a sense of what's going on a current basis."

And it's very difficult to get a building in that market with good bones, and this has pretty good floor plates and also get it back all vacant at the same time. So we're in the visioning stage now of this and putting it together. We had a session yesterday and went very well. We think we're going to do some very interesting and different things in the lobby space there. And we're -- we think there'll be a lot of interest from different types of tenants. It's very difficult to get identity if you're a 100,000-foot tenant or 150,000- or 20,000-foot tenant. Certainly, that's the case in many of our buildings, which are much larger. So this, I think, will be a very good branding opportunity, as Owen said in his comments for some tenants. Rents, it really depends upon the size of the lease-up, and we're budgeting some downtime, obviously, next year. And we may convert quicker. We don't know how the leasing is going to go on this. But I would say if you think of something with the 9%, that would be consistent with our underwriting, and we may do better than that, and we hope we will. Thank you."

And all those projects are in the nation's hottest life science markets, they are in Chambridge, they're in Waltham, they're in South San Francisco, they're now in Montgomery County, Maryland. So again, we don't have to go create the raw material to build our business. We already control it. 
Now that being said, fortunately, this last quarter, we did find some things that we thought were interesting. We bought a smaller existing lab building that's adjacent to a project we already had in Waltham, which we thought was a terrific attractively priced tuck-in opportunity. And then our DC team got very comfortable with the Montgomery County market and found a very interesting transaction to open up basically a new life science market for Boston Properties. And we're in the process of closing the deal, and we're already in discussions with a number of users for that site. So we have high hopes. So anyway, I think that's the big difference is you hear a lot of people ""getting into life science or growing in life science."" We're going to do it by just executing on what we already control."

Look, I think we have said we don't -- we believe there will be some impact on the office market due to work from anywhere, but we just think it's overstated. If you look at the recovery of the office companies relative to other property companies and overall industry, it's much lower. So clearly, the market is concerned. It's not just about Boston Properties, it's about the whole sector and what this return-to-office profile looks like for office companies. So we acknowledge that's the case. In terms of BXP's differentiation, I would say 2 things are very important: One, we like our gateway footprint. We would acknowledge that in the short term, cities in the Southeast, Southwest, they're opening more rapidly. And perhaps in the short term, they might have better performance. But we believe over the long term, our gateway markets that are increasingly driven by tech and life sciences demand and have some barriers to entry are long term, the best place to be. 
And then the second thing that both Doug and I talked about in our remarks is a flight to quality. If you look at the tour activity in high-quality building, our tour activity in New York is much higher in terms of number of tours this year-to-date than it was in 2019. If you look at assets like the GM building, there's a lot of not only tour activity, but leases getting signed. And as Doug said in his remarks, when you're in a soft market, people want to upgrade their buildings and they want to go to quality. I also think a lot of the future in terms of work from home is I do believe corporate leadership wants to have their employees return to the office. And one of the ways they're going to do that is to have great offices. They're going to want to be in great locations, and they're going to want to have great space in place, and that's what we try to do."

And that's why I said, if you think about that, we also have these 2 new buildings that we've acquired at -- on Second Avenue with a lease expiration in the fourth quarter of 2022, right in the sweet spot of where all this activity is. 
I think -- if you listen to the market commentary on demand for life science, particularly in the greater Boston market, there's way more demand than there are existing opportunity to lease space. Lots of people are talking about building these supply. Most of that supply are larger projects that won't be completed until 2024 to 2026. So the sweet spot of the market from our perspective over the next couple of years has a significant amount of demand and very little competitive supply."

So the reason that the numbers are as poor as they are in the retail portfolio in New York is because we took some space back or we released some space on an as-is basis in 2019, okay, not in 2020, at the General Motors building on Avenue, and the rents were dramatically lower than what the in-place rents were. That's the reason for change, and that's effectively what happened. So we are now leasing vacant space and the vacant space is obviously all going to be incremental. The rents are market rents. They're depending upon where the spaces are. They're commensurate with what you would hear from a retail team. I don't want to negotiate rents on this call. But the spaces that we're negotiating, the fitness center in the basement of an office building or a high-quality restaurant in Times Square are very, very different because of the nature of the spaces and the marketplaces.

I'm delighted to report that for the first time since the pandemic, I'm together with Doug, Mike, Sara and our Boston team for this earnings call, and all BXP employees returned to the office on July 6.",2294,"Okay. Thank you, Sara, and good morning, everyone. I'm delighted to report that for the first time since the pandemic, I'm together with Doug, Mike, Sara and our Boston team for this earnings call, and all BXP employees returned to the office on July 6.
BXP is emerging from the pandemic with strength and momentum as evidenced by improving financial results and rapidly elevating leasing and investment activity. This morning, I will cover the economic recovery that is underway in the U.S.; BXP's momentum in terms of financial results and leasing; private equity capital market conditions, particularly for office real estate; and BXP's capital allocation activities focusing on 4 new investments we announced this quarter, including our official entry into several new markets.
So the U.S. economy, awash with fiscal and monetary stimulus, is roaring back as we exit the pandemic. U.S. GDP growth was 6.4% in the first quarter and predicted to be higher for the second quarter and for all of 2021. Over 850,000 jobs were created in June, and aggregate unemployment decreased to 5.9%. Industries that use offices have been less impacted by the pandemic and the employment rate for their workers is lower.
Despite the annual inflation rate rising to 5.4% in June, the 10-year U.S. treasury rate has dropped to around 1.3% and the Federal Reserve's rhetoric remains succinctly dovish, given it believes recent inflation is driven by transitory factors. High economic growth and low interest rates create the ideal environment for strong real estate investment performance.
Now BXP's financial results for the second quarter reflect the impacts of this recovery and an increasingly favorable economic environment. Our FFO per share this quarter was $0.10 above market consensus and $0.12 above our own forecast, which Mike will detail shortly. We completed 1.2 million square feet of leasing, more than double the volume we achieved in the first quarter and only 10% below our long-term second quarter averages.
Our clients are making long-term commitments, the leases signed in the second quarter at a weighted average term of 7.5 years. Many are expanding as was the case with 2 large media and tech clients in L.A. And building quality is increasingly important as evidenced by strong tour and leasing activity at the GM Building, Reston Town Center, Colorado Center and the view floors at Embarcadero Center.
We believe this activity and performance supports our repeatedly stated position that tenants are committed to the office as their location of choice to collaborate, innovate and train all critical for their long-term success and that concerns about the work-from-anywhere impact on the BXP footprint are overstated.
Moving to private equity market conditions. $15.7 billion of significant office assets were sold in the second quarter, flat to last quarter, up 77% from the second quarter a year ago and down approximately 44% from 2019 pre-pandemic levels, and it remains 23% of commercial real estate transaction activity. Cap rates are arguably declining for assets with limited lease rollover and anything life science related, given lower interest rates.
Notably in Cambridge this last quarter, a REIT agreed to purchase Charles Park vacant, though, with identified tenants for $815 million or $2,200 a square foot. Also One Memorial Drive in Cambridge, a fully-leased 409,000 square foot office asset, is under agreement to sell for $825 million or over $2,000 a square foot and a 3.8% initial cap rate.
Moving to BXP's capital market activity. We had a very active and successful quarter with acquisitions. All of the investment strategies we have described to you over the last several quarters are represented in the 4 new investments we recently announced, which aggregate almost 2 million square feet. These strategies are: grow in life sciences, enter the Seattle market, acquire high-quality assets that need redevelopment or refreshment at discounted valuations due to the pandemic; and acquire office assets in partnership with private equity investors through a joint venture investment program we set up with GIC and CPP, 2 leading global real estate investors.
So let's start with our official entry into the Seattle region with the acquisition of Safeco Plaza. We have previously discussed the Seattle areas having a strong real estate market as well as a logical expansion region for BXP's gateway strategy. The Puget Sound region is the headquarters location for leading global employers like Amazon and Microsoft and has one of the largest clusters of computer science workers in the U.S.
Seattle has experienced high levels of population and rent growth, given its expanding technology and life science employment base, and is much more affordable than other major technology markets, given no state of Washington income taxes and lower real estate costs for both office space and housing. Rent, land values and building values are lower in Seattle than any of our other core gateway markets.
The broader Puget Sound market has the scale and growth potential to afford us opportunities to both acquire and develop in multiple districts of Seattle, Bellevue and other Eastside markets. We have had a BXP executive, Kelley Lovshin, who's joined the call this morning, based in Seattle for well over a year. We have an attractive pipeline of additional investment opportunities currently under review and will build out a full-service real estate execution team over time.
Safeco Plaza comprises 800,000 square feet, has a LEED-Platinum certification and is located in the center of the Seattle CBD with convenient access to rail, ferry and highway transit option. The building is currently 90% leased with 6 years of weighted average lease term at rents that are approximately 30% below market. Safeco Plaza offers generous ceiling heights, 360-degree views and timeless architectural features. And our strategy is to refresh the ground plane lobby and amenities and re-lease the building at market rates in the coming years.
Liberty Mutual, which acquired Safeco, is the anchor tenant leasing 68% of the building. BXP will own either 51% or 33.3% of the property, depending on whether 1 or 2 private equity investors join the partnership. We believe our basis in the acquisition, which is $465 million or $581 a square foot, is very favorable relative to replacement costs and recent office trading activity in the Seattle market.
We believe Safeco Plaza to be a very attractive investment opportunity with a future redevelopment play, given the quality and location of the building, our going-in basis as well as the cash flow we receive from existing tenants during the refreshment process. We have a nonrefundable deposit posted and intend to close the acquisition in early September.
We are also entering a new submarket for BXP, Midtown South in New York City with the acquisition of 360 Park Avenue South. Midtown South has become New York's strongest submarket in terms of rent growth and vacancy, given it is the preferred location for many technology occupiers, New York City's most rapidly growing business segment. 360 Park Avenue South comprises 450,000 square feet and is in a prime location at the corner of 26th Street, 1 block from Madison Square Park.
The transaction will close and the building will be vacated by a long-term corporate user later this year, which provides us the opportunity to plan in advance and subsequently execute a complete refreshment of the building. With generous ceiling heights and a unique elevator configuration, allowing for 2 separate dedicated lobbies, we believe the building will appeal to both large and medium-sized users seeking marketing and brand expression opportunities with their space.
In terms of economics, we're paying $300 million for the building or $667 a square foot, which leaves us significant latitude relative to comparable sales to budget generous building enhancements. The acquisition structure is also creative and we think favorable for BXP. Consideration for the purchase will be the assumption of a $202 million mortgage on the property and the issuance of $98 million of OP units in BXP's operating partnership.
We are committed to complete the transaction on December 1 of this year, and the number of OP Units issued at closing will be determined by BXP stock price at that time, but with a floor of $111 a share. In other words, we would benefit by issuing fewer units if our share price continues to rise through the closing date, but our downside is capped by a floor. Most importantly, the tax deferral inherent in our contribution structure distinguished our proposal such that it did not have to be the highest price to yield the seller the highest after-tax value.
One of our joint venture investment program partners will likely join this investment by funding all of the capital needed for the refreshment resulting in their owning up to a 50% interest in the project over time.
Next on acquisitions, we added to our life science business and entered the Montgomery County, Maryland life science market through the acquisition of a 7-building 435,000 square foot office park located in close proximity to the Shady Grove Life Sciences Center, the premier cluster for life sciences in the Washington, D.C. region. Montgomery County is the fourth largest life science market in the U.S. and home or proximate to several large biomedical institutions such as NIH, FDA, John Hopkins University and the University of Maryland.
The 4 million square foot Shady Grove submarket at the epicenter is currently 3% vacant with rising rents. We are paying $116.5 million for the asset or $267 a square foot and intend to convert the entire park to lab and life science use over time. There are 7 buildings in total, 3 of which are vacant and will be converted to lab immediately. The remaining 4 buildings are 63% leased and will be converted to lab use as leases expire and office tenants vacate over the next few years.
The entire site is 31 acres and can accommodate additional ground-up development depending on demand. There is a strong backlog of space requirements in the market, and we are already competing for a large build-to-suit in addition to other requirements. We have a nonrefundable deposit posted and plan to close the acquisition in August.
And lastly, in the second quarter, we completed another life science acquisition, 153 and 211 Second Avenue in Waltham, Massachusetts. These 2 existing lab buildings comprising 154,000 square feet and 100% leased to Sanofi are located immediately adjacent to our 200 West Street lab conversion property, which is almost complete and expected to deliver in the fourth quarter of this year.
This was an off-market transaction completed at a price of $100 million or $650 a square foot and a 6.4% initial cap rate. Sanofi's lease is short term and below market. The site comprises 14 acres and has 120,000 square feet of additional development rights, which could be increased when combined with the excess development capacity of our adjacent 200 West Street site.
Life sciences is a rapidly growing segment of our overall business. Today, Life sciences at BXP is 3 million square feet, representing 6.4% of our total revenue. We have 920,000 square feet of lab redevelopment and development projects currently underway that are experiencing strong user demand and expected to deliver in the next 36 months. And we have approximately 5.5 million square feet of future conversion and development opportunities under our control in the Cambridge, Waltham, Lexington, South San Francisco and now Montgomery County markets. Within 5 years, assuming continued strong market conditions, we could more than double the amount of BXP's revenue that is generated from the life science sector.
Regarding dispositions, we have an agreement to sell our Spring Street Office Park in Lexington, Mass, for $192 million or $575 a square foot. We expect the sale to close in September as part of an exchange with the 2 life science acquisitions mentioned previously. Year-to-date, we've completed or committed to dispositions aggregating $225 million in our share of gross proceeds and are considering additional asset sales in 2021.
And as a reminder on investment activities, though we did not add to or deliver from our active development pipeline this quarter, we have 4.3 million square feet of development underway that is 71% pre-leased and projected to add approximately $190 million to our NOI and 3.7% to our annual NOI growth over the next 3 years.
On a final and important personnel note, John Powers, who, as you know, is the Head of our New York region, told us he would like to retire at the end of this year. We conducted a thorough external and internal search and are very excited to have Hilary Spann join BXP as an Executive Vice President. Hilary has many years of real estate, management and investment experience as a senior officer of CPP and prior at JPMorgan Investment Management, having completed $12 billion in investments in New York City alone. Hilary will join BXP after Labor Day and commence her duties as New York Regional Manager at the beginning of 2022.
So in summary, we had a very active and successful second quarter with strong financial results and multiple new business wins in the leasing and investment markets. BXP has a strong growth ramp, driven by improving economic conditions and leasing activity, the recovery of our variable revenue streams, delivery of a well-leased development pipeline, completion now of 4 new acquisitions, a strong balance sheet and capital allocated from large-scale private equity partners to pursue new investment opportunities as the pandemic recedes, a rapidly expanding life science portfolio in the nation's hottest life science markets as well as low interest rates and decreasing capital costs.
Finally, I want to express my sincere appreciation for the BXP team, which is back at the office, serving our clients and winning new mandates with great care, expertise and enthusiasm.
Over to Doug."

Obviously, we have a lot to talk about on the transactional side. I'm sure there'll be some questions on that, but I do want to spend a few minutes talking about the leasing markets and the activity that we're seeing",2868,"Thanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. Obviously, we have a lot to talk about on the transactional side. I'm sure there'll be some questions on that, but I do want to spend a few minutes talking about the leasing markets and the activity that we're seeing.
There's certainly no question that we're on the precipice of significant change in the atmosphere around in-person work. But more announcements come out every day. The fact remains, there's still some uncertainty and there's some repetition about COVID-19, the Delta variant and whatever the next thing is going to be.
So the transition period that we are now in, as many organizations like ours encourage or require their employees to come back to work, it's going to take some time. So there are going to be some ramifications to that. Many of you participated in our NAREIT meetings, and my comments this morning about impact on work from home, I think, are going to be pretty consistent with what we talked about during that conference.
The impacts on space needs, they are going to really vary depending upon the size of organizations, which we like to put in 3 categories. So the first are the really large employers. And honestly, they are moving forward with plans for space based on long-term growth plans, hiring that's occurred over the last 16 months and thousands of open job requirements that they are trying to fill right now.
Then you have really small organizations that are very stable. And they have all recognized that very little is going to change regarding how they utilize the real estate. Maybe some will work more from outside the office, but everyone is going to continue to have a dedicated workspace in their facilities, and they're really not impacting the amount of space they have.
And then there's a third group, which is an important group. And the third group of midsized organizations or younger companies that are experiencing growth, but where it's very unclear is how their organizational culture is effectively going to be built, if people are or aren't in physical contact. And I think those companies are going to have to take some time to figure that out. Will it work or won't it work? And we don't believe that this is going to happen immediately. We think it's going to take 6 to 12 months. And it's going to really depend, quite frankly, on how they're doing from a competitive perspective, how are their peers doing in their industries and does it matter that they're not in contact with each other all the time.
When surveyed, most employers prefer to have their teams together as much as possible to enhance efficiency and collaboration and serendipitous idea generation, et cetera, while many employees declare their preferences for some or more remote work. Well, with a tight labor market, employers are acknowledging the reality. There will be an increase of work that takes place outside the office, and this will incrementally moderate some space growth in the short term. But these same companies may over time add collaborative spaces to accommodate their teams when they're all getting together, and they may eventually decide that people need to be back more frequently.
Unlike any other prior recession, there have been thousands and thousands of new positions created and there are lots and lots of job openings across the service sectors, the technology sectors, the life science sectors, the generators of office demand in our markets. And we believe many of these jobs are going to lead to space absorption over the coming years.
Employees are returning to their offices with very few reminders of COVID restrictions, and they're getting together formally in meeting rooms and collaboration areas, and they're taking the time to reconnect their breakfast and lunch and dinner in restaurants. In many of our CBD assets, we have access control, so we can sort of see what's been going on in our competitive building set. So comparing to February of 2020 in New York City, about 50% of the employees who had cards are now coming to the office at least once a week. And that number is about 34% in Boston and 20% in San Francisco. So it's very different from market to market.
Our sequential parking income grew about 20% from the first quarter. And while we've not seen monthly parking permits pick up, tenants are driving in and paying for daily parking. We actually think that monthly parking permits will be a good indicator for the increase of office frequency in Boston and San Francisco. In Boston, true transient parking is actually up, and we've actually had to close portions of the Prudential Center garage around lunchtime every day during a couple of days in July due to lack of capacity, believe it or not.
At Embarcadero Center, we've seen about a 20% pickup from the low point on monthly parking, but we're still only at 60% of our historical high. So we have a long ways to go on parking. We expect to see improvements during the rest of the year. And at the end of the year, we think we're going to be at about 70% of where we were in 2019 on a full year comparative basis.
As you listen to the apartment company calls, you're hearing about the dramatic increase in occupancy in urban areas. The employees are moving back into the cities, into those same apartments, which, by the way, didn't grow during the pandemic. And so unlikely they're planning on working at home in those apartments on a frequent basis. And we're seeing this in our portfolio as we move from 51% occupancy in January to 82% at the Hub House project, that's the Hub on Causeway project, from 10% to 41% at Skyline in Oakland and from 79% to 93% at Reston Signature.
And then our restaurant activity is up materially and only is really being limited now by the challenges that the operators are having with labor, both in the front and the back of the house. We have begun to move away from percentage rent assistance to our retail tenants and back to contractual fixed rent. Believe it or not, in Reston, we actually had a tenant request a modification back to fixed rent because the percentage rent was creating a higher payment to us.
Sublet space continues to be a major topic during many of our conversations with investors. Last quarter, I described the dynamics of opportunistic sublet space and discussed our belief that many of the visceral announcements made by tenants that we're putting space on the market would reverse as organizations begin to plan their in-person work strategy again. This quarter at 535 Mission, a tech company without subletting any space, withdrew 40% of their 100,000 square foot availability. In Manhattan, CBRE is reporting that there has been a drop of about 5.9 million square feet out of a total of 19.3 million square feet that was put on post-COVID, and about 67% of that was backfilled by the prime tenant.
Yes, there is a lot of sublet space on the market, but a large portion is going to be reoccupied. Some is not actionable because of short terms. It has unworkable existing conditions or, quite frankly, users just don't like the comfort of the lessor's profile. And some of it is getting leased, like the 3 floors that were completed at 680 Folsom in San Francisco that Macys.com had on a sublet market. The headwinds from sublet space exists, but they are going to dissipate as companies begin to come back to work.
Now as I pivot my remarks to the Boston Properties office and life science portfolio specifically, I'm going to describe a level of activity that I think is counter to the headlines of weak market conditions across the office sector in the United States. The BXP portfolio includes a number of iconic, high-quality, well-maintained and continually upgraded assets. When there is market weakness, our assets outperform. We spent a lot of time discussing our portfolio vacancy last quarter and our forward expectations. We experienced quicker-than-expected revenue commencement on signed leases and saw basically flat vacancy relative to the prior quarter.
We were down 10 basis points on a 45 million square foot portfolio. And this included taking back 66,000 square feet of nonrevenue space that I talked about last quarter at The Hub on Causeway from the cinema that had never opened. We now have new signed leases for 640,000 square feet of space that have yet to commence and are not included in our occupied in-service portfolio. So on a relative basis, here's my view of the markets, and I'm making it based upon activity in the portfolio, active lease negotiations, tours, RFPs from best to least.
Boston Waltham, we don't have any available space in Cambridge, so we have no activity there. San Francisco CBD, Northern Virginia, Midtown Manhattan, Peninsula, Silicon Valley, West L.A., Princeton and finally, D.C. CBD. All the transactions I'm going to talk about are post-COVID negotiations, meaning they all began in the latter half of '20 or into 2021. So just to change things up this quarter, let's start with L.A.
Last quarter, I acknowledged our disappointment that we were unable to keep a 200,000 square foot tenant at the Santa Monica Business Park. Less than 30 days later, we had a signed lease for 140,000 square feet of that space to a growing tech company. During May, we completed a 350,000 square foot long-term extension and expansion at Colorado Center with a media company. In total, this 490,000 square feet had a weighted average expiring rent that was effectively equal to the starting rent of that space, and 200,000 square feet of the expiring rents were at above-market holdovers.
This follows our immediate release of the 70,000 square feet vacancy that we had from a defaulting tenant in the first quarter. We have a number of smaller deals in negotiation in Santa Monica Business Park, and we're responding to requests from tenants that would prefer to go direct on some of the sublet availability at Colorado Center.
In Boston, during the second quarter, in the CBD, we signed 6 leases totaling 55,000 square feet, and the average rent starting represented a gross roll-off of about 20%. In each case, the tenant was either renewing or expanding. We have 7 additional leases in the works totaling 70,000 square feet. Obviously, most of them are small, since we don't have much in the way of availability in our Boston portfolio.
In the suburban Boston portfolio, we completed 60,000 square feet. The average weighted cash rent on those leases was up 17%. Life science organizations are dominating activity in this market. We commenced construction on 880 Winter Street, that's the lab life science renovation that we're doing in Waltham, and have signed an LOI for 16,000 square feet. We started the building on July 5 and are exchanging proposals with over 180,000 square feet of tenants for the 220,000 square foot building, and it will be delivering in August of next year. We've been responding to new inquiries just about every week on that space. Asking rents in the market for lab space are in the high 60s to mid-70s triple net, which are well above our underwriting when we planned this project about 15 months ago.
Many of you have been asking about inflation and construction costs. When we do our construction budgeting, we always include an escalation expectation. So those numbers are baked into those numbers in our supplemental. It varies depending upon the labor market conditions, subcontractor availability and material costs. We bid and our on budget for both 880 Winter Street and 180 CityPoint. So we figured out what the escalation would be and we hit it. Currently, we're carrying about a 4% to 6% escalation for base building jobs that we would bid in 12 months.
Now turning back to leasing. In Waltham, we're negotiating leases for another 70,000 square feet of space with life science companies at Bay Colony, that's adjacent to 880 Winter Street, and our Reservoir Place building. Our new acquisitions at 211, 153 Second, which Owen described, have a lease expiration in the late '22, and the current rental rates on the space are dramatically below market. The expirations will land right in the sweet spot of the current demand in the Boston and the Waltham and the Lexington submarkets. There is some pure office demand in the market. And with more and more buildings being converted to life science, we actually expect the office market is going to tighten dramatically over the next few years.
In New York, we continue to have significantly more tours than we had in comparable periods in 2019, and the second quarter is actually up significantly on a sequential basis from the first. We completed 10 office leases totaling 90,000 square feet, including another full floor expansion at 399. In total, gross rents on leases signed this quarter were about 20% lower than the in-place rents. We are negotiating over 400,000 square feet of additional leases, including almost 250,000 square feet at Dock 72.
The majority of the New York City leases will be for terms in excess of 10 years, and we include 2 more expanding tenants at 399 Park Avenue. Activity at the street plane of the buildings is also picking up. We signed up a new fitness provider at 601 Lex, a new fast casual restaurant at 399. And we're negotiating a lease for all of the available restaurant base at Times Square Tower, and we plan on opening The Hugh culinary collective at 601 Lexington in September.
In Reston, our buildings continue to have extensive activity. This quarter, we completed over 170,000 square feet of leasing, of which more than 100,000 square feet was on vacant space. In addition, we have active negotiations on another 72,000 square feet, including almost 60,000 square feet of currently vacant space. Reston Next is moving towards completion with the first tenant expected to take occupancy by the end of 2021. We have another 85,000 square feet of office renewals in negotiation in Springfield, Virginia. Retail leasing is roaring back in Reston Town Center. We've negotiated 35,000 square feet of restaurant transactions and have almost 100,000 square feet of cinema, fitness and soft good transactions in the Town Center.
Pedestrian activity in Reston Town Center is as active as any location in our portfolio. Office rents are basically flat to slightly down on the re-let, since the expiring cash rents have been contractually increasing by 2.5% to 3% for the last 10 years.
In San Francisco CBD, we completed 5 transactions totaling 54,000 square feet with an average roll up of 8%. Why is it so low this quarter? While the square footage was impacted by a full floor transaction, it starts in the mid-90s where the tenant elected to forgo any TIs for a lower rent. If you exclude that transaction, the mark-to-market would have been 17%. In addition, we have 8 active lease negotiations involving 143,000 square feet with an average rent starting of over $100 a square foot. That's over $100 a square foot in this purportedly terrible market in San Francisco.
The bulk of these spaces are in the higher floors in Embarcadero Center, and they all have used.
Pedestrian activity at the street plane, particularly in the CBD of San Francisco, has improved over the last quarter, but it's still well behind Boston, Reston and New York. And this has affected tenants' appetite for making space decisions. However, medium-sized technology users have begun to look for space. Sublease absorption has picked up in the city with about 1 million square feet of withdrawals or completed transactions. And as I said earlier, Macys.com did 104,000 square feet at 680 Folsom, our building.
In Mountain View, we continue to see a constant flow of medical device and alternative energy and automotive and other R&D users looking for space. We completed a full building lease with an energy company with a healthy 60% markup in rent. And we have another 21,000 square foot lease in negotiation. There are some large tech tenants in the market today looking for expansion space, and one recently executed leases for about 700,000 square feet of availability that was in Santa Clara. We are certainly pursuing those tenants for Platform 16, and we have begun internal discussions about the appropriate time for the speculative restart of this building.
So to summarize, our leasing activity in the second quarter accelerated. Our portfolio is in great shape in L.A. We continue to see strong economic transactions in the CBD of Boston, our suburban Boston portfolio and the CBD of San Francisco. We have significant activity in Reston and are covering our vacancy. New York tour activity is strong. We're doing deals, but economic terms are weaker. We are expanding our life science investments across the company. And in Greater Boston and South San Francisco, our new construction is seeing strong demand at escalating rents. Mike?"
368278,1673289519,2353125,"Boston Properties, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2021",2021-07-28,"Earnings Calls","BXP, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Doug. I'm going to start my comments by describing our earnings results, which, as Owen mentioned, significantly beat our expectations. We reported FFO for the quarter of $1.72 per share, which is $0.12 per share better than the midpoint of our",1172,"Thank you, Doug. I'm going to start my comments by describing our earnings results, which, as Owen mentioned, significantly beat our expectations. We reported FFO for the quarter of $1.72 per share, which is $0.12 per share better than the midpoint of our guidance. About $0.06 of our outperformance came from earlier-than-anticipated leasing and better parking, retail and hotel performance, which I would consider core revenue outperformance. The other $0.06 is from unbudgeted termination income and expense deferrals that we expect to incur in the third quarter.
Our office portfolio beat our expectations by approximately $0.02 per share from accelerated leasing. We had several larger leases commence earlier than we expected, including our 350,000 square foot renewal and expansion with a large media tenant in L.A., a 65,000 square foot health care firm in suburban Boston and 3 technology tenants in Reston totaling over 100,000 square feet. All of these leases were in our full year assumptions and were completed faster than we anticipated.
Leasing in our residential portfolio also improved this quarter, exceeding our revenue projections by $0.01. The improvement was across the board with our stabilized residential buildings exceeding our occupancy assumptions by 100 to 200 basis points and the recently delivered projects at The Hub House in Boston and Skyline in Oakland seeing even stronger absorption. While market rents continue to be below pre-pandemic levels, concessions are starting to dissipate.
Our parking, hotel and retail income exceeded our expectations by $0.03 per share. As Doug detailed, these components of our income stream have started to improve, which should continue as activity levels grow in our cities. The other 2 areas where we exceeded expectations were in termination income and lower operating expenses. Our termination income totaled $6.1 million, which was $0.03 above our budget. It came from 2 sources. First, at 399 Park Avenue, the building is full, and we have more demand than available space. This quarter, we were able to accommodate one of our expanding financial services tenants by recapturing 50,000 square feet from another tenant. The transaction resulted in $2 million of termination income in the quarter.
And second, we received about $4 million in unexpected settlement income from tenants who defaulted on their leases last year. We categorized this as termination income. While we anticipate a modest amount of termination income every quarter, we do not assume receiving any additional settlement income this year.
Finally, in our operating expense line, our maintenance expenses came in $0.03 per share lower than we anticipated. We've deferred these costs and expect it will be incurred in the third quarter.
One other item I'd like to point out is that we reported second quarter same property NOI growth of 8.9% on a GAAP basis and 7.5% on a cash basis over the second quarter 2020. The strong increase, honestly, is primarily due to the charges for accrued rent and accounts receivable we took in 2020 related to tenants impacted by the pandemic. If you net out last year's charges, our GAAP same-property NOI dropped by 1% year-over-year due to lower occupancy. However, our cash same-property NOI grew by 3.8% year-over-year, as free rent periods expired, and we've converted those to cash rents in 2021.
This quarter's leasing statistics also require explanation. The total company in New York City leasing in particularly were negatively impacted by 2 retail leases in New York City. Excluding retail, the mark-to-market on our New York City office leases was positive 6% on a gross basis and positive 8% on a net basis. And office leases in the total portfolio demonstrated strong rental increases of 14% growth and 21% net.
Now I'd like to turn to our expectations for the rest of 2021. For the third quarter, we provided guidance of $1.68 to $1.70 per share, $0.03 above consensus estimates at the midpoint. At the midpoint, our third-party guidance -- our third quarter guidance is $0.03 per share lower than our second quarter FFO. Again, this is due to the outsized termination income and expense deferrals from the second quarter. Net of those 2 items, our third quarter guidance is $0.02 to $0.04 per share higher than the second quarter.
In the office portfolio, our occupancy exceeded expectations in the second quarter due to early lease commencements. For the rest of 2021, we anticipate occupancy will be relatively steady. As Doug mentioned, we have 640,000 square feet of signed leases that have not yet commenced occupancy. We expect 450,000 square feet of these leases to occupy before year-end.
In addition, we have another approximate 600,000 square feet of both renewal and new leases in the works for 2021 occupancy. This activity, combined with already signed leases, are expected to cover the 1.1 million square feet of lease expirations that remain in 2021. With stable occupancy, the current run rate for the in-service portfolio is a good proxy for the rest of 2021.
We are expecting consistent quarterly improvement from our other income sources, primarily from our parking and the continued lease-up of our recently delivered residential properties. Our assumptions result in $0.02 of projected incremental NOI growth from -- in the third quarter from these sources.
We also expect growth from the acquisitions that Owen described. Acquisition activity, net of dispositions, will add approximately $0.01 to our third quarter NOI and $0.02 to the fourth quarter.
So in summary, after adjusting for $0.06 of higher termination income and deferred expenses from the second quarter, we project our in-service portfolio for the third quarter to be higher by $0.02 at the midpoint and our net acquisition and disposition activity to contribute $0.01.
While we are not delivering any developments into service in the third quarter, we anticipate incremental growth from developments in the fourth quarter that will accelerate in 2022. We anticipate that we'll start to recognize revenue as the first tenants commence the occupancy at our $270 million Hub on Causeway office tower in Boston in the fourth quarter. And by mid-'22, we expect this project that is currently 95% leased to be generating a stabilized NOI.
We also expect to deliver our $50 million life science lab conversion at 200 West Street that is 100% leased in December of this year. It will be at its full run rate in 2022. Our development deliveries will accelerate and be more meaningful to our earnings growth in 2022. In addition to the deliveries in Q4 of this year, next year, we have $1.7 billion of developments slated for delivery and initial occupancy, and they're 85% leased in the aggregate.
Overall, we're thrilled with our results this quarter as the markets continue to recover. Our leasing activity is exceeding our expectations. Our variable income streams are improving. Our development pipeline is on track to add future growth. And we're taking advantage of opportunities to acquire some unique assets at favorable prices that we expect will generate additional future earnings growth and value creation.
Operator, that completes our formal remarks. Can you please open the line for questions?"

That's not what we're doing. We're looking to find assets where we can create value through our operating prowess. And if you look at Safeco Plaza, it's an 800,000 square foot building that was built in the late 60s. It's got great bones. It's got great ceiling highs. It's got great views. And it's fine from an architectural perspective in the interior, but it's not fabulous.
And our goal is to do what we did at 100 Federal Street with that asset, which was make that building something that it wasn't, which was a building that tenants wanted to go to as opposed to just another nice building in a CBD that was sort of moving one way or the other with the market.

And honestly, I would say that we are -- while there is a little bit of vacancy in the building, we're not in a rush to lease the space in the building tomorrow because we want to make sure we understand what the building could become and sell what it will be, not what it is.

And the reason I provide you with the information I do is because it is an indication of what is going on with the spaces that we lease today, which unfortunately, may not hit our supplemental statistics from a revenue perspective for 2 quarters, 3 quarters or 6 quarters. So I'm just trying to sort of give you a flavor of what is going on, on a relative basis, right? So it's very hard to sort of predict what's going to happen because I don't know which spaces we're going to lease and what the rent was versus what the rent might be on those spaces until it happens.
So again, on average, everything I said was as basically down in New York City of 20%. That doesn't mean the market is down by 20%. It may mean that those leases might have had a negative mark-to-market in 2019 because the rent went way up in a particular building and the market just never got to where the increases were. But so things were down in New York, and they were flat in Los Angeles, again, on the portfolio of space we leased based upon what was being paid and what will be paid on a cash basis.
And then the other places in Boston and in San Francisco, we were up about 20%. In Mountain View, we were up 60%. And in Reston, we were down, call it, 5% to 7%. But again, a lot of the space in Reston was vacant. So it wasn't down. It's actually 100% increase because that space had been vacant for more than 12 months, right? So that's the reason that we give you what we give you in terms of the data, so you can have a sense of what's going on, on a current basis."

And it's very difficult to get a building in that market with good bones, and this has pretty good floor plates, and also get it back all vacant at the same time. So we're in the visioning stage now of this and putting it together. We had a session yesterday. It went very well. We think we're going to do some very interesting and different things in the lobby space there.
And we're -- we think there'll be a lot of interest from different types of tenants. It's very difficult to get identity if you're a 100,000-foot tenant or 150,000- or 20,000-foot tenant. Certainly, that's the case in many of our buildings, which are much larger. So this, I think, will be a very good branding opportunity, as Owen said in his comments, for some tenants.
Rents, it really depends upon the size of the lease-up. And we're budgeting some downtime, obviously, next year. And we may convert quicker. We don't know how the leasing is going to go on this. But I would say if you think of something with the 9%, that would be consistent with our underwriting. And we may do better than that, and we hope we will. Thank you."

So I think the most important differentiation, Manny, is that we already control most of the conversion and land that we're going to develop. I mentioned in my remarks, we already have 5.5 million square feet under control. So we don't have to go out and buy anything. And all those projects are in the nation's hottest life science markets. They're in Cambridge. They're in Waltham. They're in South San Francisco. They're now in Montgomery County, Maryland. So again, we don't have to go create the raw material to build our business. We already control it.
Now that being said, fortunately, this last quarter, we did find some things that we thought were interesting. We bought a smaller existing lab building that's adjacent to a project we already had in Waltham, which we thought was a terrific, attractively priced tuck-in opportunity. And then our D.C. team got very comfortable with the Montgomery County market and found a very interesting transaction to open up basically a new life science market for Boston Properties.
And we're in the process of closing the deal, and we're already in discussions with a number of users for that site. So we have high hopes. So anyway, I think that's the big difference is you hear a lot of people ""getting into life science or growing in life science."" We're going to do it by just executing on what we already control."

Look, I think we have said we don't -- we believe there will be some impact on the office market due to work-from-anywhere, but we just think it's overstated. If you look at the recovery of the office companies relative to other property companies and overall industry, it's much lower. So clearly, the market is concerned. It's not just about Boston Properties, it's about the whole sector and what this return-to-office profile looks like for office companies. So we acknowledge that's the case.
In terms of BXP's differentiation, I would say 2 things are very important. One, we like our gateway footprint. We would acknowledge that in the short term, cities in the Southeast, Southwest, they're opening more rapidly. And perhaps in the short term, they might have better performance. But we believe, over the long term, our gateway markets that are increasingly driven by tech and life sciences demand and have some barriers to entry are long term the best place to be.
And then the second thing that both Doug and I talked about in our remarks is applied to quality. If you look at the tour activity in high-quality building, our tour activity in New York is much higher in terms of number of tours this year-to-date than it was in 2019. If you look at assets like the GM Building, there's a lot of not only tour activity, but leases getting signed.
And as Doug said in his remarks, when you're in a soft market, people want to upgrade their buildings and they want to go to quality. I also think a lot of the future in terms of work from home is I do believe corporate leadership wants to have their employees return to the office. And one of the ways they're going to do that is to have great offices. They're going to want to be in great locations, and they're going to want to have great space in place. And that's what we try to do."

Unless the vaccination rate increases meaningfully, it's going to be hard to get rid of COVID and all the protections and things that are happening that all sort of got relaxed a little bit when we had this euphoria that we were done with COVID.

And we're also going to engage a factory program on an additional 30,000 square feet, so -- which has been very successful in the Reston market to date. So really good activity, hoping to convert a few of those opportunities to leases here soon."

And then we actually are -- we are in discussions with some tenant at 180 CityPoint. These are not discussions that have gotten to the point where we have a letter of intent that we've said is close to being executable. That building also is later.
So the sequencing is 880 is delivered and ready for people to be working in it in August of 2022. And then about a year later, 180 CityPoint is available. And that's why I said, if you think about that, we also have these 2 new buildings that we've acquired at -- on Second Avenue with a lease expiration in the fourth quarter of 2022 to right in the sweet spot of where all this activity is.
I think -- if you listen to the market commentary on demand for life science, particularly in the greater Boston market, there's way more demand than there are existing opportunity to lease space. Lots of people are talking about building this supply. Most of that supply are larger projects that won't be completed until 2024 to 2026. So the sweet spot of the market, from our perspective over the next couple of years, has a significant amount of demand and very little competitive supply."

And the rents were dramatically lower than what the in-place rents were. That's the reason for the change, and that's effectively what happened. So we are now leasing vacant space, and the vacant space is obviously all going to be incremental.
The rents are market rents. They're depending -- upon where the spaces are, they're commensurate with what you would hear from a retail team. I don't want to negotiate rents on this call. But the spaces that we're negotiating, a fitness center in the basement of an office building or a high-quality restaurant in Times Square are very, very different because of the nature of the spaces and the marketplaces.

But again, the leases that are in active negotiation right now are all on average 10 years or more, all the activity that I described, including the life science stuff.
And I would tell you that tenants would like -- as I said, would like to have more ability to be flexible in their space and buy their way out of leases. And occasionally, we are giving some of that flexibility after longer periods of time. You sign a 10-year lease, and you can terminate after the seventh year or something like that.

This morning, I will cover the economic recovery that's underway in the U.S. BXP's momentum in terms of financial results and leasing private equity capital market conditions for office real estate and BXP's capital allocation activities and growth potential. The U.S. economy continues to exhibit strong growth as we emerge from the COVID pandemic. U.S. GDP grew 6.7% in the second quarter but is expected to slow in the third quarter due to the surge in infections caused by the Delta variant. However, daily COVID infection levels have dropped over 50% from highs in September which bodes well for strong economic growth in future quarters. The relatively low unemployment rate at 4.8% is being driven by both new job creation, which recently has been tepid and workers withdrawing from the workforce. There are over 10 million job openings across the U.S. and virtually every employer, including BXP, is experiencing a highly competitive labor market. Annual inflation remains high at [ 5.4% ] in September, driven largely by energy prices, which are up 25% versus 1 year ago. Supply chain challenges are a primary topic this earnings season for many companies, and Doug will cover BXP's experiences in his remarks. 
Lastly, the 10-year U.S. treasury rate has increased approximately 40 basis points to 1.6% since our last earnings call. Given the prospect of further interest rate increases, we've been very active refinancing our corporate and specific asset level debt. Interest rates remain extremely low relative to office cap rates and the yields we are achieving on our developments, creating the potential for lower cap rates and higher value creation in the quarters ahead. 
DXP's financial results for the third quarter continue to reflect the impact of this recovery and an increasingly favorable economic environment. Our FFO per share this quarter was $0.03 above market consensus and $0.04 above the midpoint of our guidance, which Mike will detail shortly. We completed over 1.4 million square feet of leasing significantly more than double the volume achieved in the first quarter, well above the leasing achieved in the second quarter and just under our long-term third quarter average. 
Our clients continue to make even longer-term commitments as the leases signed in the third quarter had a weighted average term of 9.3 years versus 7.5 years in the second quarter. Year-to-date, we have completed 3.3 million square feet of leasing with an average lease term of 8.3 years. This success can be attributed to not only our execution but also the enhanced velocity and economics achieved in the current marketplace for premium quality, well-amenitized assets, which are the hallmark of BXP's strategy and portfolio. 
In addition to our leasing activity, which included a 524,000 square foot long-term renewal with Wellington at Atlantic Wharf, Google purchased a 1.3 million square foot building in New York for its use. In the Silicon Valley alone, Apple completed a 720,000 square foot new requirement. Facebook is looking for 700,000 square feet -- additional square feet. And ByteDance is searching for approximately 250,000 to 300,000 square feet. In the Seattle region, Facebook is pursuing a 0.5 million square foot requirement in South Lake Union and Amazon has executed on enormous growth in Bellevue. I could go on. 
These examples support our repeatedly stated position that tenants are committed to the office as their location of choice to collaborate, innovate and train, all critical for their long-term success. Measurable census in our portfolio also continues to improve. Our leading region is New York City, which hit 52% occupied last week. Our lagging region is San Francisco, which is increasing, but currently at 18%, and the remaining regions are in between. From watching on television, stadiums packed with unmasked people, to trying to park at busy shopping centers to experiencing difficulties in making restaurant reservations in our core markets, it appears to us, people are undoubtedly more comfortable with in-person activities. Liquidity fueled strong business performance, and a tight labor market are clearly factoring into remote work decisions by businesses. However, as time progresses and the shortcomings of remote-work become more apparent, we increasingly hear concerns from business leaders about the decaying cultures of their companies, inadequate training and difficulties in onboarding new professionals as well as the potential for deterioration in innovation and competitiveness. We believe it's only a matter of time before employers more strongly encourage their teams to return to in-person work. 
Record levels of commercial real estate sold in the third quarter, and private capital market activity for office assets is also recovering rapidly. $26 billion of significant -- $26 billion of significant office assets were sold in the third quarter up 38% from last quarter and up 165% from the third quarter a year ago. Cap rates are arguably declining for assets with limited lease rollover in anything life science related given low interest rates and activity is increasing for assets facing near-term lease expirations. Of note this past quarter in all of our markets, one Canal Park and empty 112,000 square foot office building in Cambridge sold to a REIT for $131 million or $11.70 a square foot. 
As mentioned, Google exercised its option to purchase St. John's terminal in New York City, which is a 1.3 million square foot office building that fully occupies and the price was $2.1 billion or $1,620 a foot. Coleman High Line, which is a 660,000 square foot office complex under construction in North San Jose and fully leased to Verizon sold for $775 million, which is $1,180 a square foot and a 4.2% initial cap rate to a non-U.S. buyer. 153 Townsend Street, which is 179,000 square foot office building in San Francisco sold for $231 million or $1,290 a square foot to a local operator and fund manager. This asset is fully leased to a single user, which has put the entire building on the sublease market. 
West 8th is a a 540,000 square foot office building in the Denny Triangle Seattle, sold for $490 million or [ $910 ] a square foot to REIT. The building is fully leased, but faces significant rollover through 2023. 49% interest in 655 New York Avenue in Washington, D.C. sold for a gross price of $805 million or $1,060 a square foot and a 4.7% cap rate. The building comprises over 760,000 square feet is 93% leased and sold to a non-U.S. investor with a domestic adviser. And lastly, The Post, which is 100,000 square foot fully leased office building in Beverly Hills, sold for $153 million, which is $1,530 a square foot and a 4.8% initial cap rate to a domestic fund manager. 
Now moving to BXP's capital market activity. We closed on the acquisition of Safeco Plaza and entered the Seattle market. BXP will own a 1/3 interest in the asset along with 2 partners in our strategic capital program. We also closed the Shady Grove Biotech Campus acquisition and entered the Montgomery County, Maryland life science market. We're also on track to close the 360 -- 360 Park Avenue South acquisition with Strategic Capital Program Partners on December 1, thereby entering the Midtown South market in New York City. I described the economics for all these acquisitions last quarter. 
Regarding dispositions, we completed the sale of our Spring Street Office Park in Lexington Mass this week, bringing our share of gross sale proceeds from dispositions year-to-date to $225 million. We're also marketing for sale 2 additional buildings, which, if completed, are projected to yield approximately $200 million in gross proceeds. 
On development activities, this quarter, we delivered 0.5 million square feet of Verizon and other tenant space at 100 Causeway and 285,000 square feet of Fannie Mae space at Reston Next. In the aggregate, we have 4.3 million square feet of development underway that is 72% pre-leased. These future deliveries plus the stabilization of recently delivered projects are projected to add approximately $190 million to our NOI and 3.8% to our annual NOI over growth the next few years. So in summary, we had another active and successful quarter with strong leasing and financial results and entered several new geographic markets. 
We believe BXP is about to experience a strong growth ramp, which we project to be approximately 13% in FFO per share in 2022, driven by improving economic conditions and leasing activity, recovery of variable revenue streams, delivery of a well-leased development pipeline, completion of 4 new acquisitions, a strong balance sheet combined with capital allocated from large-scale private equity partners to pursue additional new investment opportunities as the pandemic recedes, a rapidly expanding life science portfolio in the nation's hottest life science markets and low interest rates and decreasing capital costs. 
Finally, I'd like to welcome Hillary Span, who is joining this call this morning to BXP's executive team. Hillary joined BXP right after Labor Day and will become our regional head in New York when John Powers retires in January. Let me turn our remarks over to Doug."

I'm going to begin my remarks this morning with a few comments on the supply chain and its impact on our capital expenditures, both for new construction and our existing assets. So the impacts of the supply chain are",2540,"Thanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. I'm going to begin my remarks this morning with a few comments on the supply chain and its impact on our capital expenditures, both for new construction and our existing assets. So the impacts of the supply chain are both in time and money. Schedule is 1 of the criteria we use when we bid our jobs. And to date, we've been able to award bids while maintaining the schedules necessary to get our tenants in their spaces as required. The supply chain challenges have made the process much harder but we are still able to deliver the current development pipeline on time and within budget. And as you all know, we have contingencies that are in our budget and to some -- at some point, we are using those contingencies. However, in the near term, as we look at new jobs, there are fewer material choices, and we are working closely with our consultants and our contractors to make sure that they are not specifying critical path items that could impact schedules. Our construction teams are working a lot harder at figuring out exactly how the key and the parts are put together. 
We are intentionally minimizing oversee items that and we're releasing our material packages as early as possible. Trucking issues are real. And at times, we are being forced to air freight as well as stockpile materials offsite, hence the use of some of our contingencies. There's no single answer to how much more is it going to cost. But when we're budgeting jobs that will start 8 to 12 months from now, we're using a 5% to 6% escalation in our total construction costs. We are in the process of rebidding our Platform 16 base building project, which was previously budgeted in late 2019 with an eye towards our 2022 restart. And we will have a real-time perspective in mid-November. But as today, we just don't know what that's going to be. Supply shortages are also impacting our operating budgets. 
Energy is a material input into our operating expenses. While our largest utility cost is electricity, we are mostly hedged for 2022, and and we have been successfully increasing our procurement from green power. We are still exposed to the marginal cost of electrical generation in the Boston region where we expect double-digit increases from last year. Cost for security, cleaning and engineering labor continues to increase due to labor shortages across all those trades. However, our lease contracts take 2 forms. We have net leases under which 100% of the operating expense and real estate taxes are paid by the tenant, and we have gross leases with a base year that is set upon the lease commencement with increases in expenses over that base year added to the rental obligation of the tenant. 
In other words, our exposure is on our vacant space and for new or renewal leases where we are setting a base. This is a pretty small percentage of the total, so it really doesn't have a material impact on our actual operating results as we look at 2022. 
As you saw in our supplemental, our second-generation leasing statistics were weak this quarter, and they need some finer explanation. I wish we could put all this into our press release, but we simply can't. The universe of square footage that is encompassed in the statistics is about 500,000 square feet and it includes 105,000 square feet of short-term transactions 18 to 24 months that we signed in the heart of the pandemic with tenants that were not in a position to make a long-term commitment but they were prepared to extend for a negotiated discounted as-is deal. 
One of those tenants has since agreed to lease space for 13 years, where the interim rent was $60 a square foot and they'll be paying $103 a square foot, and this is in a New York asset. If you eliminate that 105,000 square feet, the statistics that we would have shown you changed dramatically, going from down 14% to effectively flat. You should also note that our transaction costs were also significantly below our run rate since there were no TIs involved in any of these short-term deals. 
Our life science and office portfolio make up 91% of our revenues. As we look towards 2022, we currently have more than 800,000 square feet of signed leases that have not commenced. In 2022, lease expirations for the whole portfolio, not just our share, totaled about 2.9 million square feet, and we already have renewal conversations underway on over 25% of that space. Historically, we have leased well over 1 million square feet a quarter each and every year. The question will be when those new expected leases will commence. Occupancy should slowly edge up in 2022. The changes in the quarter occupancy this quarter are due to the addition of the Shady Grove and Seattle acquisitions, not a degradation in our occupancy in our existing portfolio. 
Now let me give you a sense of what's going on in our portfolio today. New York is a good place to start. Tour activity, proposals and ultimately, leases continue to be very consistent with the commentary we've been providing during the last few quarters. The high-end buildings are seeing good activity. Brokers that advise the small and midsized financial firms and professional services firms are very busy and their clients are taking action. Many of those users are incrementally increasing their space requirements as they continue to acquire people and AUM. Sublease space continues to gradually melt from the statistics. You may remember that we were asked about a 200,000 square foot sublet at 399 Park Avenue during various conference calls in 2020. That space has been taken off the market as the user reoccupies. 
Now there still is significant supply of direct and sublease space in New York City and our view is that net effective rents remain down 10% to 15% from pre-pandemic levels. 
During the quarter, we completed 8 deals totaling [ 113,000 ] square feet in the CBD portfolio. Many of these spaces were vacant, but the 2 largest had a roll up of 8% in 1 case and a roll down of 4% in another. About 70,000 square feet of leases are in the category of leases that will not have a revenue commencement until sometime in mid '22. Last week, we signed a lease at Dock 72 for 42,000 square feet. We don't anticipate this tenant completing their buildout until the latter half of '22. We have an additional 340,000 square feet of leases under negotiation in New York right now, including almost 200,000 square feet at Dock 72. We don't anticipate revenue commencement on [ 65% ] of that space until 2023. 
One of the themes for next year is going to be a pickup and sign leases with contribution to occupancy or revenue flow-through occurring when tenants complete their installations in late '22 or '23, and we don't necessarily control those times. At Carnegie Center down in Princeton, we did 8 leases for 38,000 square feet and have another 106,000 square feet in active lease documentation. One final note on New York before I turn to the other markets. Our culinary collective The Hugh has opened at our 53rd Street campus in 601 Lex. This is as good an example of placemaking as we can point to in our portfolio. As users who want to encourage their employees to come back to work this type of experience will dramatically enhance their physical space offering. It's why we do what we do. In Northern Virginia, our leasing team is seeing a consistent flow of inquiries, tours, lease proposals and ultimately, completed transactions. 
During the quarter, we completed 7 leases totaling 70,000 square feet in Reston, and we're in lease negotiation on another 7 deals totaling 125,000 square feet. The tech tenants that have identified the DC metro market as a fertile area for workforce expansion are continuing to grow, and their growth is going to be in Northern Virginia. In addition, the contractors that service the defense and the homeland security are also expanding. There are significant vacancy in northern Virginia. But the urban market core Reston is under 10% vacant, and it continues to dramatically outperform with starting rents in the high 40s to low 50s gross and with our Reston Next project opening up this week, the rents are starting to hit the low [ 60s ]. 
The rest of the next development is welcoming Fannie Mae into the building this month, and we are actively marketing and leasing the remaining 160,000 square feet of available space. Our Reston Town Center retail place making is also very active. During the quarter, we completed a lease with a new theater operator for 50,000 square feet. Last week, we signed a 20,000 square foot lease with a local restaurant distillery. And yesterday, a new 20,000 square foot fitness operator. We have 3 more restaurants totaling 22,000 square feet that are close to execution. This 115,000 square feet of leased retail is not expected to have any revenue contribution until 2023. In the District of Columbia, we continue to chip away at our current availability at Net Square 901 New York Avenue and Market Square North. We completed 7 leases for 49,000 square feet during the third quarter and signed another -- and have signed another 32,000 square feet during October. 
Just as an aside, we completed a major repositioning of Next Square this year. And year-to-date, we've signed 162,000 square feet over 8 transactions when we do our work, our buildings lease. The urban downtown recovery in San Francisco continues to lag our other markets. 
Very few businesses have commenced their return to work. downtown streets remain quiet, much of the ground plane remains closed, and the city has had a very restrictive mass mandate. As Owen pointed out, daily consensus continues to be significantly below all our other urban markets. There's been a reduction of sublease space in the market stemming from active lease commitments and re-occupancy plans, but overall availability continues to be elevated. This description while accurate overlooked important subtleties in the market. Pre-pandemic, there was very little available space in high-quality, multi-tenanted buildings, particularly those with views. Broadly speaking, those conditions still exist for that segment of the market. The bulk of the demand in the last 18 months has come from traditional financial asset management and professional services firms that have focused on the best space in the best buildings. This has resulted in very little change to leasing economics in the best buildings, particularly in spaces we've used. We've discussed this on recent calls, and it continues today. 
This quarter, we've completed over 100,000 square feet of leases, including full floor transactions in Embarcadero. The average starting rent was just over $100 a square foot on those full floor deals, a 21% increase over expiring rents. We are negotiating leases on another 106,000 square feet right now. And from what we've seen, these experiences are being repeated in a competitive set north of market. In contrast, sublet transactions are being closed at significant concessions to pre-pandemic economics, but with no capital. 
Life science activity at our Gateway development continues to be healthy. The BXP ARE joint venture has signed an LOI with a full building user for 751 Gateway, 230,000 square feet and we're actively responding to proposals for our anticipated redevelopment of 651 Gateway, about 300,000 square feet, which won't commence until the third quarter of next year. 
Further down the Peninsula and Mountain View, activity has picked up in the last 30 days. This quarter, we completed 2 full building deals totaling 58,000 square feet. We're seeing less information gathering exercises and a lot more active tours with RFPs and the need for immediate occupancy or early 2022 occupancy. There are, as Owen said, large tech requirements active in the Silicon Valley. For those of you who saw that the Tesla announcement that they're moving their headquarters to Texas, you may have missed that they leased 325,000 square feet in Palo Alto contemporaneously with that announcement. High-quality new construction availability is very limited in the valley, and we're actively considering when we should restart the construction of Platform 16 next to Diridon Station and the future of Google development in San Jose. 
Finally, let's touch on Boston. In the high-end market in the Boston CBD, particularly in the Back Bay, there is currently limited availability, particularly with us space. Rents have remained at pre-pandemic levels and concessions are only marginally higher. As we move closer to 2023, there will be additional new construction supply entering the market in the CBD, but not the Back Bay. As Owen mentioned, the big lease for the quarter was the early renewal with Wellington. They agreed to expand by 70,000 square feet at Atlantic Wharf, and we're going to terminate 156,000 square feet at 100 [indiscernible] Street in 2023. The space we're getting back is leased at a rate that's below market -- So we're optimistic that we can create additional value through this relay. We completed an additional 73,000 square feet of leases in our back pay portfolio, and we have about 50,000 square feet of leases under negotiation today in that same group of properties. 
The Boston retail portfolio is also very active. We have signed an LOI for the 118,000 square feet formerly occupied by Lord & Taylor as well as 40,000 square feet of in-line space that's currently vacant or in default. This 158,000 square feet will likely commence paying rent in early '23. As we move to the suburbs, life science is dominating our activities. Last week, we signed our first lease at 880 Winter Street, our lab conversion that we started 4 months ago, 37,000 square foot deal, which we'll deliver in the middle of next year, and we are in the final stages of negotiation on another 128,000 square feet which will bring that 224,000 square foot building to 74% leased, and we have active dialogue on the rest of the space. And during the quarter, we signed over 105,000 square feet of leases with life science tenants at 1,000 Winner, 1,100 winner and Reservoir Place traditional office buildings. As we move into '22, we're developing plans to convert additional available office space in Waltham into lab space. 
So to summarize, we've seen a recovery in employment, as Owen discussed. Employers are aggressively looking to hire, capital raising in the venture world is breaking through levels never seen an IBO takeouts are at a historically high levels. conditions are right for recovery in office absorption. Employers are going to want to use their physical space to encourage their teams to be together. Our mantra has been to create great places and spaces to allow our customers to use space as a way to attract and retain their talent. If you believe that employees may be spending less time in their offices, it's even more important to have the right space in place when they're present. And I'll stop there and give it over to Mike."
368278,1684382945,2414228,"Boston Properties, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2021",2021-10-27,"Earnings Calls","BXP, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everybody. Before I jump into the details of our third quarter earnings as well as our 2021 and 2022 guidance, I want to touch on our recent financing activities. This quarter, we took advantage of the low interest rate",1600,"Great. Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everybody. Before I jump into the details of our third quarter earnings as well as our 2021 and 2022 guidance, I want to touch on our recent financing activities. This quarter, we took advantage of the low interest rate environment and its very attractive credit spreads to issue $850 million of 12-year unsecured green bonds when the underlying 10-year treasury rate was 1.3%. We achieved a coupon of 2.45%, the lowest in the company's history. We utilized the proceeds to redeem $1 billion of 3.85% unsecured notes on October 15. Those notes were scheduled to expire in early 2023 and represented our largest debt maturity through 2025. The early prepayment will result in a redemption charge of $0.25 per share in the fourth quarter of 2021. We will benefit from the 140 basis point drop in the relative debt cost, and we are thrilled to issue such attractive long-term financing. The only other significant debt maturity we have in the next 18 months is our $620 million mortgage on 601 Lexington Avenue in New York City that expires in April of next year. Similar to the bond we redeemed, this loan also carries an above-market interest rate of 4.75%. Given the increase in the cash flows from the building, owing partially to the redevelopment we completed earlier this year, we anticipate that we will be able to increase the size of the financing and reduce the interest rate substantially. 
We're working on this now, and our assumptions include closing before the end of 2021. The impact of these financing activities will be accretive to our 2022 earnings through a meaningful drop in our interest expense from 2021 that I will touch on in a minute. 
First, I'd like to describe our third quarter 2021 results. For the third quarter, we announced FFO of $1.73 per share, that's $0.04 per share higher than the midpoint of our guidance and $0.03 ahead of consensus estimates. Our outperformance came from better portfolio NOI with $0.02 of higher rental and parking revenue and approximately $0.02 of lower-than-projected operating expenses. Looking at our parking revenues, they've started to accelerate sequentially as clients and visitors increase driving days into our properties. As Owen described, we're seeing building census grow and the results are evident in our parking. Our share of this quarter's parking revenue totaled $22 million. This compares to a comparable pre-COVID quarterly result from the third quarter 2019 of $28 million. At the bottom, in the second quarter of 2020, our share of parking revenue was $14 million, so we are over 50% of the way back. 
On an annualized basis, using the third quarter run rate, we have about $25 million of revenue or $0.14 per share to recover before we are back to pre-COVID annual parking levels of $113 million. 
Our Kendall Square hotel was profitable for the first time in 6 quarters contributing about $1 million of positive NOI. Given the hotel's location in the heart of Cambridge and adjacent to MIT, we expect that it will ultimately restabilize at or above the $15 million annual NOI generated in 2019, though certainly not in 2022. 
The third leg of our ancillary income is our retail income. Other than in San Francisco, nearly all of our retailers have returned to paying previous contract rents. This quarter, our share of retail rental revenue was $43.6 million. On an annualized basis, this is $16 million less than our share of 2019 retail revenue, which totaled $190 million. And as Doug mentioned, we have some vacancy in our retail due to the pandemic, but we're negotiating leases now on significant portions of that space. 
If you combine and annualize our third quarter hotel NOI and our share of parking and retail revenues, we have the opportunity to gain approximately $52 million or $0.30 per share to return to 2019 full-year levels. We believe that all 3 of these income streams will fully recover and ultimately exceed prior peaks over time. 
Looking at the rest of this year, we released fourth quarter 2021 guidance of $1.50 to $1.52 per share and full-year 2021 guidance of $6.50 to $6.52 per share. Our fourth quarter guidance includes the $0.25 share redemption charge related to our bond refinancing. Excluding the charge, our fourth quarter guidance would be sequentially higher than third quarter results by $0.03 per share at the midpoint. 
The improvement is primarily from Verizon taking occupancy of its 440,000 square foot lease at the Hub on Causeway office development this quarter and lower interest expense after our refinancing. And while we expect our same priority portfolio NOI will also grow sequentially, the growth is partially offset by the FFO dilution from the sale of our Spring Street office campus in suburban Boston that closed for $192 million this week. 
Turning to our assumptions for 2022. Last night, we released our 2022 FFO guidance. We have 3 major drivers that are all headed in the right direction, that provide for very strong FFO growth of 13% at the midpoint over 2021. The drivers include delivering a significant volume of leased new developments and acquisitions, growth in our same property portfolio, and our refinancing activities that lower our interest expense. The first growth driver is developments and acquisitions. We're delivering 5 of our development properties over the next 4 quarters totaling $1.6 billion of investment. These projects totaled 3 million square feet of additions to our portfolio and are 92% leased. 
They include the Hub on Causeway in Boston that is leased to Verizon, 325 Main Street in Cambridge that is leased to Google, the 200 West Street Life Science development in Waltham that is leased to Translate Bio; Marriott's new headquarters facility in Bethesda, Maryland; and Reston Next that is leased to Fannie Mae and Volkswagen in Reston. 
It is also possible that our Life Science conversion at 880 Winter Street in Waltham will begin to contribute in late 2022. In total, we expect our development deliveries to contribute an incremental $65 million to $70 million to our FFO in 2022. Additionally, we've layered in several acquisitions that we completed this year, most notably Safeco Plaza in Seattle and our Life Science project we acquired in Waltham. We expect these acquisitions will add $7 million to $10 million to our share of NOI next year. 
The second growth driver for 2022 is the projected growth in our same property portfolio NOI. Our guidance assumes that our share of same-property NOI will grow between 2% and 3.5% next year. The growth is expected to come from higher parking revenues, improvement in occupancy and pricing in our residential portfolio, higher NOI from our hotel and increased occupancy in our office portfolio. 
Our leasing velocity has picked up in the last 2 quarters where we've leased 2.7 million square feet of signed leases. Given the length of the typical leasing cycle, many of these leases we've signed or are negotiating will take occupancy either in late '22 or '23. We expect the improvement in our headline office occupancy to be gradual. As Doug described, we have several larger leases in the works for vacant space where we anticipate occupancy will occur in 2023. On a cash basis, we expect our share of 2022 same-property NOI growth to be much stronger at between 5.5% and 6.5% over 2021. This equates to between $90 million and $100 million of incremental cash NOI to 2022. Much of our cash NOI growth is coming from approximately [ $50 million ] of free rent that is burning off in contractual leases. 
Our third FFO growth driver is coming from lower interest expense. As I mentioned earlier, we will incur a debt redemption charge of $0.25 per share in the fourth quarter of '21. We do not expect that this will recur. Also, we are aggressively refinancing loans that were placed 5 to 10 years ago in a higher interest rate environment with low-cost current market financing. Partially offsetting this, we do expect to see higher interest expense in our joint venture portfolio. This is because we will cease capitalization of interest on the Marriott and Hub on Causeway projects when they are delivered into service. In aggregate, we expect that 2022 interest expense will be $52 million to $60 million less than in 2021. That equates to $0.30 to $0.34 of incremental positive impact on our 2022 FFO. 
So to summarize, our guidance for 2022 FFO was $7.25 to $7.45 per share. The midpoint of our range is $7.35, which is 13% or $0.84 a share higher than the midpoint of our 2021 guidance. At the midpoint, the incremental growth is coming from $0.43 from development and acquisitions, $0.25 from our same property portfolio and $0.32 from lower interest expense. This will be offset by $0.06 of dilution from our 2021 disposition activity, $0.06 of lower termination income and $0.04 of higher G&A. The past 18 months have brought challenges and uncertainty to so many, including our team at BXP. These past few months, it's been heartening to see our cities reopen, our colleagues and our clients starting to return to their offices and office leasing volumes picking up. As I spelled out, we anticipate very strong FFO growth in 2022 and beyond 2022, we have more developments underway that will deliver additional FFO. Plus, we have the highest quality portfolio of office buildings that we believe will generate higher occupancy rates and earnings in the future.

In San Francisco, which is the smallest retail portfolio we have because the tenants that just don't pay high rents. That's where the tenants haven't all returned to occupancy. And the vast majority of them are not paying rent. So that's the place where those deferrals are. I mean I think that's probably $2 million a year, something like that. that's not the most significant piece. The big chunks are some of the stuff Doug talked about, where we filed the Lord -- we're filling the Lord & Taylor space. That's a big 120,000 square feet. We've got a number of new retailers coming into the Peru where we had vacancy that was created by some bankruptcies there. And then in Reston as well.

And then again, if you look at our D.C. market, the deals that we're doing in Reston are modestly up or down on the rent level because of the question of how much growth there was in the rent over the last period of time that the existing tenant was in there. So if we had a deal that was done 10 years ago and we had 3% increases every year, there was probably a modest amount of negative rental rate growth.

But there are still lots of customers in this country who want new construction and want the best and brightest of the way buildings are built, potentially being very green carbon neutral, net zero, whatever you want to describe it as it's harder to do that with an older building. And so I think the question will be, what will the character of the leasing be and where will it occur? But I don't think it's going to necessarily stop new construction. I do think that speculative office development is a very, I'd say, challenging proposition today in most markets because of the amount of supply that exists. But remember that when you're starting a new building, you're talking about delivering somewhere between 36 and 48 months later if it's a high-rise. And then even if it's a low-rise building, it's a minimum of 24 months. So people's views on what the world will look like when we get to those periods of time. Will it be influential. And I mean, as Owen just suggested, we're looking at the Silicon Valley, and we're looking at Platform 16, and we're saying to ourselves, that's a really interesting market relative to the amount of demand that currently exists today. The lack of high-quality first-class Class A office product the potential location of the building that we would be building relative to transportation. and so we're pretty optimistic in certain instances, but clearly, it's not what it would have been 3 years ago."

And what we're seeing, I mean, we had 2 conversations yesterday with 1 with a tech company, 1 with a professional services company, and they both told us they've already sent out announcements to their folks that, hey, in 1 case, they want everybody to start coming back to the office on a hybrid model in November. And the other 1 is, hey, you better be near your office because we expect it to be back in January.

When San Francisco starts to have a significant return to the office wave, I think it will pick up rapidly and that we will start to see a significant recovery. Remember prepandemic, Manhattan, and New York had a supply problem, and San Francisco did not have a supply problem. So the opportunity from for San Francisco is will -- how much of that labor will want to come back and how quickly will those companies that have grown dramatically in terms of their own headcounts during the pandemic, want to bring those people into close proximity with each other on a day-to-day basis. And there's an opportunity for San Francisco to accelerate and to quickly return, it's got a challenge from a political perspective right now, and it's got a challenge from a statistical perspective because there's a lot more available space on a percentage basis than there was and has ever been from a sublet perspective. Manhattan is still way below where it once was, call it, 2002, 2003 from a sublet as a percentage of the market. San Francisco is way above where it's been historically. And again, a lot of that space could be reoccupied by the companies that chose to it on the sublet market.

And I mentioned a few minutes ago that we've done 100,000 square feet of new leases with life science companies, and we're actively looking at converting some of those buildings to full life science buildings. Carnegie Center is probably the most amenitized project in Central New Jersey, and we have a tremendous amount of investment that's been made and it's been very receptive. So I think that the -- and by the way, we are probably at the forefront of lead, not just silver, but platinum new lead standards, energy efficiency, indoor air quality. I mean we are doing those things as a road task today everywhere in our portfolio. So I would tell you that the portfolio doesn't have any of those issues that you might describe as challenges. And honestly, we have as much vacancy in a Class A office building today as we've had in other challenging time periods. And again, we are committed to picking up our occupancy rate, and we are doing that, as I described in my comments relative to the amount of leasing that we're doing today. So we feel really good about the whole portfolio. 
Now there are some markets that are less hard than others relative to the amount of leasing demand and San Francisco is obviously 1 of them. But as an example, you mentioned gateway. We're taking gateway out of service to convert it to life science. It's why it's got a [ 90,000 ] square foot lease and a 300,000 square foot building, right? We're trying to clear it out.

And those are the kind of companies that Owens was describing they're looking for space down in Silicon Valley, and have made major expansions in the urban areas of all our markets. And then on the small side, tenants that are less than a [ 4 ], they are back doing exactly what they were otherwise doing. And so there is plenty of volume in that sector. I think the challenge is the companies that are thinking about what it is that hybrid means and how hybrid will work for them. And those companies will need to get their people back into a consistent in-person environment or understand what those -- what their employees want to do and what they want them to do. And that's going to take some time. And so I believe that 2022 will be a lighter year relative to absorption than pre-pandemic. And then in 2023, when the experiments have all run their courses and companies understand what their expectations are for human capital and physical capital, that's when we will see, I believe, and I think Owen articulates as well the reasons why we'll see a very strong pickup in absorption and demand -- growth demand."

So there have been some very successful and interesting renovations of existing stock. I would say some of the best buildings in Midtown South are actually older buildings that have been renovated and we intend to make 360 Park Avenue South, 1 of them. So I think it's very dependent on the local market, I think a very high-quality older building that's been fully renovated in Midtown South is going to get equivalent pricing to something that's new."

So everything else can basically go. You can literally rip off the facade and put a brand new energy-efficient window system in, you can dramatically change the mechanical. You can even create new shafts for a larger Duct work and changed the mechanical equipment in the buildings. So if the building has a really challenged structural system, meaning locked in lot of columns or a very low slab to slab, I think those are the impediments to a renovated building relative to new construction where you're going to see many fewer columns, and you're going to see much larger volumes of space. But other than those 2 characteristics, a fabulous renovation of a building is going to get the same, I think, level of interest as a new construction building."

We've seen in our own portfolio, it's value to small companies that just want space, and they want it now and they want flexibility. And I also think larger corporates will see value in procuring a small percentage of their space on a flexible basis given their business often changes more rapidly than space can be delivered to them. But I think the first thing that has to happen in the market is roughly what, 2% to 3% of U.S. office space today is flexible. It needs to refill. I mean that's the first thing that needs to happen. And then the question will be, if it's going to grow, how is it going to get financed? 
I'm not sure that operators are going to be financing additional growth of flexible office space. I think it's going to be the landlords and where and when and how much will they elect to do going forward.

We don't want to think about anything other than can we be in the space tomorrow and we don't have to buy furniture. We don't have to buy technology services. We don't have to do anything other than bring our people in and go. And so that was the nature of the experiment that we have doing been with our spaces. I would tell you that we continue to see requests from small companies for, hey, what do you have for me? I'm looking for some short-term space. And that's exactly what our Flex product should be about. What we are not doing and don't have any intention of doing is taking large pieces of our space and converting it to flex space and competing with WeWork or any of the other flexible space operators for corporate users who are looking for large blocks of space because that's just part of their strategy. That's not what we're going to be doing. 
Relative to where our buildings are and the amenitization we have, that's the -- I think that's the attraction of why the companies that are in our spaces have gone there is because you can go to the Prudential Center or you can go to the Hub on Causeway or you can go to 100 Federal Street and get the advantage of all the amenitization and the great place and space making that we have done and do it on a short-term basis, if that's what your business strategy calls for."

One is what Doug is describing, which is, is this something we should just have to attract more customers, particularly where we have a high concentration of office space like at the Pru or at Reston or Embarcadero Center? If you're building an apartment building, you don't just build single bedrooms. You have studios and 2 bedrooms. So this is a different product and is it valuable to have that product at 1 of our facilities? And also, by the way, does it create tenants that might move, become successful and bigger and then like being at the Pru, for example, and become a longer-term customer? So that's 1 question. Then the second question is what's the math? And that's a big question because you have to do turnkey build-out, cost hundreds of dollars a square foot. You face vacancy because you don't have long-term leases and you have to understand what the math looks like."

In other locations, it's probably 50% to 60%. But it tends to be longer in term, not month-to-month. And then again, our Flex product is totally different than co-working. We're not doing co-working. These are spaces that are prebuilt, and we have no social aspects to the needs of our clients, they do that."

Boston and San Francisco spreads are going to be up in our view. And the deals that Doug talked about that we're doing in San Francisco this quarter and the things that we have under discussion are going to be rolled up. Same thing with Boston and Cambridge and the suburbs. I think Reston will be closer to flat, maybe slightly up on the leasing that we do. And New York City is going to be a little bit more volatile because it really depends on the space. We have certain spaces that are going to be rolled out in certain spaces that are going to be rolled up. So I think you will see more volatility in New York City there. 
With respect to kind of AFFO, if you look at '21, and we've got 3 quarters in the books, I mean, I think our AFFO is getting pretty close to where it was in 2019, honestly. We have a shot of getting to, I think it was [ $4.43 ] a share in 2019. So I think we have a shot of getting there. We may be slightly below. But looking out at 2022, I would say, on the CapEx side, probably pretty similar to what we're seeing this year, which is $100 million, maybe $120 million max in kind of CapEx. Leasing costs they're running somewhere in the mid-200s on an annual basis, which is not that significantly different than what they've been in '21 and prior years. And then we've got a lot of, obviously, free rent burning off. Our noncash rent is going to be slightly lower than we guided for [ 2021 ], and we gave that guidance is $90 million to $110 million of noncash rent. But there's a lot of free rent burning off. 
And then you have other noncash items that go the other way like stock comp and fair value ground lease rent and things like that, that's about $75 million the other way. So the way I kind of look at it is, if you want to add up all those adjustments, there's probably $370 million to $400 million of adjustments off of our FFO. So that's $2.25 a share. So that will drive you to 2022 to an AFFO that's around $5, which is up significantly from where it was -- where we'll be in '21, but also from where it was in 2019 pre-COVID because of all the cash NOI growth we've had and developments right, that have come in and are increasing our cash NOI. So I think it's a very positive story."

This morning, I will cover the economic recovery that's underway in the U.S. BXP's momentum in terms of financial results and leasing private equity capital market conditions for office real estate and BXP's c",1498,"Thank you, Laura, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will cover the economic recovery that's underway in the U.S. BXP's momentum in terms of financial results and leasing private equity capital market conditions for office real estate and BXP's capital allocation activities and growth potential. The U.S. economy continues to exhibit strong growth as we emerge from the COVID pandemic. U.S. GDP grew 6.7% in the second quarter but is expected to slow in the third quarter due to the surge in infections caused by the Delta variant. However, daily COVID infection levels have dropped over 50% from highs in September which bodes well for strong economic growth in future quarters. The relatively low unemployment rate at 4.8% is being driven by both new job creation, which recently has been tepid and workers withdrawing from the workforce. There are over 10 million job openings across the U.S. and virtually every employer, including BXP, is experiencing a highly competitive labor market. Annual inflation remains high at 5.4% in September, driven largely by energy prices, which are up 25% versus one year ago. Supply chain challenges are a primary topic this earnings season for many companies, and Doug will cover BXP's experiences in his remarks. 
Lastly, the 10-year U.S. treasury rate has increased approximately 40 basis points to 1.6% since our last earnings call. Given the prospect of further interest rate increases, we've been very active refinancing our corporate and specific asset level debt. Interest rates remain extremely low relative to office cap rates and the yields we are achieving on our developments, creating the potential for lower cap rates and higher value creation in the quarters ahead. 
BXP's financial results for the third quarter continue to reflect the impact of this recovery and an increasingly favorable economic environment. Our FFO per share this quarter was $0.03 above market consensus and $0.04 above the midpoint of our guidance, which Mike will detail shortly. We completed over 1.4 million square feet of leasing significantly more than double the volume achieved in the first quarter, well above the leasing achieved in the second quarter and just under our long-term third quarter average. 
Our clients continue to make even longer-term commitments as the leases signed in the third quarter had a weighted average term of 9.3 years versus 7.5 years in the second quarter. Year-to-date, we have completed 3.3 million square feet of leasing with an average lease term of 8.3 years. This success can be attributed to not only our execution but also the enhanced velocity and economics achieved in the current marketplace for premium quality, well amenitized assets, which are the hallmark of BXP's strategy and portfolio. 
In addition to our leasing activity, which included a 524,000 square foot long-term renewal with Wellington at Atlantic Wharf, Google purchased a 1.3 million square foot building in New York for its use. In the Silicon Valley alone, Apple completed a 720,000 square foot new requirement. Facebook is looking for 700,000 square feet -- additional square feet. And ByteDance is searching for approximately 250,000 square feet to 300,000 square feet. In the Seattle region, Facebook is pursuing a 0.5 million square foot requirement in South Lake Union and Amazon has executed on enormous growth in Bellevue. I could go on. 
These examples support our repeatedly stated position that tenants are committed to the office as their location of choice to collaborate, innovate and train, all critical for their long-term success. Measurable census in our portfolio also continues to improve. Our leading region is New York City, which hit 52% occupied last week. Our lagging region is San Francisco, which is increasing, but currently at 18%, and the remaining regions are in between. From watching on television, stadiums packed with unmasked people to trying to park at busy shopping centers to experiencing difficulties in making restaurant reservations in our core markets, it appears to us, people are undoubtedly more comfortable with in-person activities. Liquidity fueled strong business performance and a tight labor market are clearly factoring into remote work decisions by businesses. However, as time progresses and the shortcomings of remote-work become more apparent, we increasingly hear concerns from business leaders about the decaying cultures of their companies, inadequate training and difficulties in onboarding new professionals as well as the potential for deterioration in innovation and competitiveness. We believe it's only a matter of time before employers more strongly encourage their teams to return to in-person work. 
Record levels of commercial real estate sold in the third quarter, and private capital market activity for office assets is also recovering rapidly. $26 billion of significant -- $26 billion of significant office assets were sold in the third quarter up 38% from last quarter and up 165% from the third quarter a year ago. Cap rates are arguably declining for assets with limited lease rollover in anything life science related given low interest rates and activity is increasing for assets facing near-term lease expirations. Of note this past quarter in all of our markets, one Canal Park and empty 112,000 square foot office building in Cambridge sold to a REIT for $131 million or $11.70 a square foot. 
As mentioned, Google exercised its option to purchase St. John's terminal in New York City, which is a 1.3 million square foot office building that fully occupies and the price was $2.1 billion or $1,620 a foot. Coleman Highline, which is a 660,000 square foot office complex under construction in North San Jose and fully leased to Verizon sold for $775 million, which is $1,180 a square foot and a 4.2% initial cap rate to a non-U.S. buyer. 153 Townsend Street, which is 179,000 square foot office building in San Francisco sold for $231 million or $1,290 a square foot to a local operator and fund manager. This asset is fully leased to a single user, which has put the entire building on the sublease market. 
West 8th is a a 540,000 square foot office building in the Denny Triangle Seattle, sold for $490 million of 910 a square foot to REIT. The building is fully leased, but faces significant rollover through 2023. 49% interest in 655 New York Avenue in Washington, D.C. sold for a gross price of $805 million or $1,060 a square foot and a 4.7% cap rate. The building comprises over 760,000 square feet, is 93% leased and sold to a non-U.S. investor with a domestic adviser. And lastly, The Post, which is 100,000 square foot fully leased office building in Beverly Hills, sold for $153 million, which is $1,530 a square foot and a 4.8% initial cap rate to a domestic fund manager. 
Now moving to BXP's capital market activity. We closed on the acquisition of Safeco Plaza and entered the Seattle market. BXP will own a 1/3 interest in the asset along with 2 partners in our strategic capital program. We also closed the Shady Grove Biotech Campus acquisition and entered the Montgomery County, Maryland life science market. We're also on track to close the 360 -- 360 Park Avenue South acquisition with Strategic Capital Program Partners on December 1, thereby entering the Midtown South market in New York City. I described the economics for all these acquisitions last quarter. 
Regarding dispositions, we completed the sale of our Spring Street Office Park in Lexington Mass this week, bringing our share of gross sale proceeds from dispositions year-to-date to $225 million. We're also marketing for sale 2 additional buildings, which, if completed, are projected to yield approximately $200 million in gross proceeds. 
On development activities, this quarter, we delivered 0.5 million square feet of Verizon and other tenant space at 100 Causeway and 285,000 square feet of Fannie Mae space at Reston Next. In the aggregate, we have 4.3 million square feet of development underway that is 72% pre-leased. These future deliveries plus the stabilization of recently delivered projects are projected to add approximately $190 million to our NOI and 3.8% to our annual NOI growth over the next few years. So in summary, we had another active and successful quarter with strong leasing and financial results and entered several new geographic markets. 
We believe BXP is about to experience a strong growth ramp, which we project to be approximately 13% in FFO per share in 2022, driven by improving economic conditions and leasing activity, recovery of variable revenue streams, delivery of a well-leased development pipeline, completion of 4 new acquisitions, a strong balance sheet combined with capital allocated from large-scale private equity partners to pursue additional new investment opportunities as the pandemic recedes, a rapidly expanding life science portfolio in the nation's hottest life science markets and low interest rates and decreasing capital costs. 
Finally, I'd like to welcome Hillary Span, who is joining this call this morning, to BXP's executive team. Hillary joined BXP right after Labor Day and will become our regional head in New York when John Powers retires in January. Let me turn our remarks over to Doug."

I'm going to begin my remarks this morning with a few comments on the supply chain and its impact on our capital expenditures, both for new construction and our existing assets. So the impacts of the supply chain are",2535,"Thanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. I'm going to begin my remarks this morning with a few comments on the supply chain and its impact on our capital expenditures, both for new construction and our existing assets. So the impacts of the supply chain are both in time and money. Schedule is one of the criteria we use when we bid our jobs. And to date, we've been able to award bids while maintaining the schedules necessary to get our tenants in their spaces as required. The supply chain challenges have made the process much harder but we are still able to deliver the current development pipeline on time and within budget. And as you all know, we have contingencies that are in our budget and to some -- at some point, we are using those contingencies. However, in the near term, as we look at new jobs, there are fewer material choices, and we are working closely with our consultants and our contractors to make sure that they are not specifying critical path items that could impact schedules. Our construction teams are working a lot harder at figuring out exactly how the key and the parts are put together. 
We are intentionally minimizing oversea items that -- and we're releasing our material packages as early as possible. Trucking issues are real. And at times, we are being forced to air freight as well as stockpile materials offsite, hence the use of some of our contingencies. There's no single answer to how much more is it going to cost. But when we're budgeting jobs that will start 8 to 12 months from now, we're using a 5% to 6% escalation in our total construction costs. We are in the process of rebidding our Platform 16 base building project, which was previously budgeted in late 2019 with an eye towards our 2022 restart. And we will have a real-time perspective in mid-November. But as today, we just don't know what that's going to be. Supply shortages are also impacting our operating budgets. 
Energy is a material input into our operating expenses. While our largest utility cost is electricity, we are mostly hedged for 2022, and and we have been successfully increasing our procurement from green power. We are still exposed to the marginal cost of electrical generation in the Boston region where we expect double-digit increases from last year. Cost for security, cleaning and engineering labor continues to increase due to labor shortages across all those trades. However, our lease contracts take 2 forms. We have net leases under which a 100% of the operating expense and real estate taxes are paid by the tenant, and we have gross leases with a base year that is set upon the lease commencement with increases in expenses over that base year added to the rental obligation of the tenant. 
In other words, our exposure is on our vacant space and for new or renewal leases where we are setting a base. This is a pretty small percentage of the total, so it really doesn't have a material impact on our actual operating results as we look at 2022. 
As you saw in our supplemental, our second-generation leasing statistics were weak this quarter, and they need some finer explanation. I wish we could put all this into our press release, but we simply can't. The universe of square footage that is encompassed in the statistics is about 500,000 square feet and it includes 105,000 square feet of short-term transactions, 18 to 24 months that we signed in the heart of the pandemic with tenants that were not in a position to make a long-term commitment but they were prepared to extend for a negotiated discounted as-is deal. 
One of those tenants has since agreed to lease space for 13 years, where the interim rent was $60 a square foot and they'll be paying $103 a square foot, and this is in a New York asset. If you eliminate that 105,000 square feet, the statistics that we would have shown you changed dramatically, going from down 14% to effectively flat. You should also note that our transaction costs were also significantly below our run rate since there were no TIs involved in any of these short-term deals. 
Our life science and office portfolio make up 91% of our revenues. As we look towards 2022, we currently have more than 800,000 square feet of signed leases that have not commenced. In 2022, lease expirations for the whole portfolio, not just our share, totaled about 2.9 million square feet, and we already have renewal conversations underway on over 25% of that space. Historically, we have leased well over 1 million square feet a quarter each and every year. The question will be when those new expected leases will commence. Occupancy should slowly edge up in 2022. The changes in the quarter occupancy this quarter are due to the addition of the Shady Grove and Seattle acquisitions, not a degradation in our occupancy in our existing portfolio. 
Now let me give you a sense of what's going on in our portfolio today. New York is a good place to start. Tour activity proposals and ultimately leases continue to be very consistent with the commentary we've been providing during the last few quarters. The high-end buildings are seeing good activity. Brokers that advise the small and midsized financial firms and professional services firms are very busy and their clients are taking action. Many of those users are incrementally increasing their space requirements as they continue to acquire people and AUM. Sublease space continues to gradually melt from the statistics. You may remember that we were asked about a 200,000 square foot sublet at 399 Park Avenue during various conference calls in 2020. That space has been taken off the market as the user reoccupies. 
Now there still is significant supply of direct and sublease space in New York City and our view is that net effective rents remain down 10% to 15% from pre-pandemic levels. 
During the quarter, we completed 8 deals totaling 113,000 square feet in the CBD portfolio. Many of these spaces were vacant, but the 2 largest had a roll up of 8% in one case and a roll down of 4% in another. About 70,000 square feet of leases are in the category of leases that will not have a revenue commencement until sometime in mid '22. Last week, we signed a lease at Dock 72 for 42,000 square feet. We don't anticipate this tenant completing their buildout until the latter half of '22. We have an additional 340,000 square feet of leases under negotiation in New York right now, including almost 200,000 square feet at Dock 72. We don't anticipate revenue commencement on  65% of that space until 2023.  
One of the themes for next year is going to be a pickup and sign leases with contribution to occupancy or revenue flow-through occurring when tenants complete their installations in late '22 or '23, and we don't necessarily control those times. At Carnegie Center down in Princeton, we did 8 leases for 38,000 square feet and have another 106,000 square feet in active lease documentation. One final note on New York before I turn to the other markets. Our culinary collective, The Hugh has opened at our 53rd Street campus in 601 Lex. This is as good an example of placemaking as we can point to in our portfolio. As users who want to encourage their employees to come back to work, this type of experience will dramatically enhance their physical space offering. It's why we do what we do. In Northern Virginia, our leasing team is seeing a consistent flow of inquiries, tours, lease proposals and ultimately, completed transactions. 
During the quarter, we completed 7 leases totaling 70,000 square feet in Reston, and we're in lease negotiation on another 7 deals totaling 125,000 square feet. The tech tenants that have identified the DC metro market as a fertile area for workforce expansion are continuing to grow, and their growth is going to be in Northern Virginia. In addition, the contractors that service the defense and the homeland security are also expanding. There is significant vacancy in Northern Virginia, but the urban market core Reston is under 10% vacant and it continues to dramatically outperform with starting rents in the high 40s to low 50s growth and with our Reston Next project opening up this week, the rents are starting to hit the low 60s.
The Reston Next development is welcoming Fannie Mae into the building this month, and we are actively marketing and leasing the remaining 160,000 square feet of available space. Our Reston Town Center retail place making is also very active. During the quarter, we completed a lease with a new theater operator for 50,000 square feet. Last week, we signed a 20,000 square foot lease with a local restaurant distillery. And yesterday, a new 20,000 square foot fitness operator. We have 3 more restaurants totaling 22,000 square feet that are close to execution. This 115,000 square feet of leased retail is not expected to have any revenue contribution until 2023. In the District of Columbia, we continue to chip away at our current availability at Net Square 901 New York Avenue and Market Square North. We completed 7 leases for 49,000 square feet during the third quarter and signed another -- and have signed another 32,000 square feet during October. 
Just as an aside, we completed a major repositioning of Next Square this year. And year-to-date, we've signed 162,000 square feet over 8 transactions when we do our work, our buildings lease. The urban downtown recovery in San Francisco continues to lag our other markets. 
Very few businesses have commenced their return to work. downtown streets remain quiet, much of the ground plane remains closed, and the city has had a very restrictive mask mandate. As Owen pointed out, daily consensus continues to be significantly below all our other urban markets. There's been a reduction of sublease space in the market stemming from active lease commitments and re-occupancy plans, but overall availability continues to be elevated. This description while accurate overlooked important subtleties in the market. Prepandemic, there was very little available space in high-quality, multi-tenanted buildings, particularly those with views. Broadly speaking, those conditions still exist for that segment of the market. The bulk of the demand in the last 18 months has come from traditional financial asset management and professional services firms that have focused on the best space in the best buildings. This has resulted in very little change to leasing economics in the best buildings, particularly in spaces we've used. We've discussed this on recent calls, and it continues today. 
This quarter, we've completed over 100,000 square feet of leases, including 4 full floor transactions in Embarcadero. The average starting rent was just over $100 a square foot on those 4 floor deals, a 21% increase over expiring rents. We are negotiating leases on another 106,000 square feet right now. And from what we've seen, these experiences are being repeated in a competitive set north of market. In contrast, sublet transactions are being closed at significant concessions to pre-pandemic economics, but with no capital. 
Life science activity at our Gateway development continues to be healthy. The BXP-ARE joint venture has signed an LOI with a full building user for 751 Gateway, 230,000 square feet and we're actively responding to proposals for our anticipated redevelopment of 651 Gateway, about 300,000 square feet, which won't commence until the third quarter of next year. 
Further down the Peninsula and Mountain View, activity has picked up in the last 30 days. This quarter, we completed 2 full building deals totaling 58,000 square feet. We're seeing less information gathering exercises and a lot more active tours with RFPs and the need for immediate occupancy or early 2022 occupancy. There are, as Owen said, large tech requirements active in the Silicon Valley. For those of you who saw that the Tesla announcement that they're moving their headquarters to Texas, you may have missed that they leased 325,000 square feet in Palo Alto contemporaneously with that announcement. High-quality new construction availability is very limited in the valley, and we're actively considering when we should restart the construction of Platform 16 next to Diridon Station and the future of Google development in San Jose. 
Finally, let's touch on Boston. In the high-end market in the Boston CBD, particularly in the Back Bay, there is currently limited availability, particularly with used space. Rents have remained at pre-pandemic levels and concessions are only marginally higher. As we move closer to 2023, there will be additional new construction supply entering the market in the CBD, but not the Back Bay. As Owen mentioned, the big lease for the quarter was the early renewal with Wellington. They agreed to expand by 70,000 square feet at Atlantic Wharf, and we're going to terminate 156,000 square feet at 100 [ Devil ] Street in 2023. The space we're getting back is leased at a rate that's below market, so we're optimistic that we can create additional value through this relay. We completed an additional 73,000 square feet of leases in our Back Bay portfolio, and we have about 50,000 square feet of leases under negotiation today in that same group of properties. 
The Boston retail portfolio is also very active. We have signed an LOI for the 118,000 square feet formerly occupied by Lord & Taylor as well as 40,000 square feet of in-line space that's currently vacant or in default. This 158,000 square feet will likely commence paying rent in early '23. As we move to the suburbs, life science is dominating our activities. Last week, we signed our first lease at 880 Winter Street, our lab conversion that we started 4 months ago, 37,000 square foot deal, which we'll deliver in the middle of next year, and we are in the final stages of negotiation on another 128,000 square feet which will bring that 224,000 square foot building to 74% leased, and we have active dialogue on the rest of the space. And during the quarter, we signed over 105,000 square feet of leases with life science tenants at 1000 Winter, 1100 Winter and Reservoir Place traditional office buildings. As we move into '22, we're developing plans to convert additional available office space in Waltham into lab space. 
So to summarize, we've seen a recovery in employment, as Owen discussed. Employers are aggressively looking to hire, capital raising in the venture world is breaking through levels never seen and IBO takeouts are at a historically high levels. Conditions are right for recovery in office absorption. Employers are going to want to use their physical space to encourage their teams to be together. Our mantra has been to create great places and spaces to allow our customers to use space as a way to attract and retain their talent. If you believe that employees may be spending less time in their offices, it's even more important to have the right space in place when they're present. And I'll stop there and give it over to Mike."

Before I jump into the details of our third quarter earnings as well as our 2021 and 2022 guidance, I want to touch on our recent financing activities. This quarter, we took advantage of the low interest rate",1600,"Great. Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everybody. Before I jump into the details of our third quarter earnings as well as our 2021 and 2022 guidance, I want to touch on our recent financing activities. This quarter, we took advantage of the low interest rate environment and its very attractive credit spreads to issue $850 million of 12-year unsecured green bonds when the underlying 10-year treasury rate was 1.3%. We achieved a coupon of 2.45%, the lowest in the company's history. We utilized the proceeds to redeem $1 billion of 3.85% unsecured notes on October 15. Those notes were scheduled to expire in early 2023 and represented our largest debt maturity through 2025. The early prepayment will result in a redemption charge of $0.25 per share in the fourth quarter of 2021. We will benefit from the 140 basis point drop in the relative debt cost, and we are thrilled to issue such attractive long-term financing. The only other significant debt maturity we have in the next 18 months is our $620 million mortgage on 601 Lexington Avenue in New York City that expires in April of next year. Similar to the bond we redeemed, this loan also carries an above-market interest rate of 4.75%. Given the increase in the cash flows from the building, owing partially to the redevelopment we completed earlier this year, we anticipate that we will be able to increase the size of the financing and reduce the interest rate substantially. 
We're working on this now, and our assumptions include closing before the end of 2021. The impact of these financing activities will be accretive to our 2022 earnings through a meaningful drop in our interest expense from 2021 that I will touch on in a minute. 
First, I'd like to describe our third quarter 2021 results. For the third quarter, we announced FFO of $1.73 per share, that's $0.04 per share higher than the midpoint of our guidance and $0.03 ahead of consensus estimates. Our outperformance came from better portfolio NOI with $0.02 of higher rental and parking revenue and approximately $0.02 of lower-than-projected operating expenses. Looking at our parking revenues, they've started to accelerate sequentially as clients and visitors increase driving days into our properties. As Owen described, we're seeing building census grow and the results are evident in our parking. Our share of this quarter's parking revenue totaled $22 million. This compares to a comparable pre-COVID quarterly result from the third quarter 2019 of $28 million. At the bottom, in the second quarter of 2020, our share of parking revenue was $14 million, so we are over 50% of the way back. 
On an annualized basis, using the third quarter run rate, we have about $25 million of revenue or $0.14 per share to recover before we are back to pre-COVID annual parking levels of $113 million. 
Our Kendall Square hotel was profitable for the first time in 6 quarters contributing about $1 million of positive NOI. Given the hotel's location in the heart of Cambridge and adjacent to MIT, we expect that it will ultimately restabilize at or above the $15 million annual NOI generated in 2019, though certainly not in 2022. 
The third leg of our ancillary income is our retail income. Other than in San Francisco, nearly all of our retailers have returned to paying previous contract rents. This quarter, our share of retail rental revenue was $43.6 million. On an annualized basis, this is $16 million less than our share of 2019 retail revenue, which totaled $190 million. And as Doug mentioned, we have some vacancy in our retail due to the pandemic, but we're negotiating leases now on significant portions of that space. 
If you combine and annualize our third quarter hotel NOI and our share of parking and retail revenues, we have the opportunity to gain approximately $52 million or $0.30 per share to return to 2019 full-year levels. We believe that all 3 of these income streams will fully recover and ultimately exceed prior peaks over time. 
Looking at the rest of this year, we released fourth quarter 2021 guidance of $1.50 to $1.52 per share and full-year 2021 guidance of $6.50 to $6.52 per share. Our fourth quarter guidance includes the $0.25 share redemption charge related to our bond refinancing. Excluding the charge, our fourth quarter guidance would be sequentially higher than third quarter results by $0.03 per share at the midpoint. 
The improvement is primarily from Verizon taking occupancy of its 440,000 square foot lease at The Hub on Causeway office development this quarter and lower interest expense after our refinancing. And while we expect our same property portfolio NOI will also grow sequentially, the growth is partially offset by the FFO dilution from the sale of our Spring Street office campus in suburban Boston that closed for $192 million this week. 
Turning to our assumptions for 2022. Last night, we released our 2022 FFO guidance. We have 3 major drivers that are all headed in the right direction, that provide for very strong FFO growth of 13% at the midpoint over 2021. The drivers include delivering a significant volume of leased new developments and acquisitions, growth in our same property portfolio, and our refinancing activities that lower our interest expense. The first growth driver is developments and acquisitions. We're delivering 5 of our development properties over the next 4 quarters totaling $1.6 billion of investment. These projects totaled 3 million square feet of additions to our portfolio and are 92% leased. 
They include The Hub on Causeway in Boston that is leased to Verizon; 325 Main Street in Cambridge that is leased to Google; the 200 West Street Life Science development in Waltham that is leased to Translate Bio; Marriott's new headquarters facility in Bethesda, Maryland; and Reston Next that is leased to Fannie Mae and Volkswagen in Reston. 
It is also possible that our Life Science conversion at 880 Winter Street in Waltham will begin to contribute in late 2022. In total, we expect our development deliveries to contribute an incremental $65 million to $70 million to our FFO in 2022. Additionally, we've layered in several acquisitions that we completed this year, most notably Safeco Plaza in Seattle and our Life Science project we acquired in Waltham. We expect these acquisitions will add $7 million to $10 million to our share of NOI next year. 
The second growth driver for 2022 is the projected growth in our same property portfolio NOI. Our guidance assumes that our share of same-property NOI will grow between 2% and 3.5% next year. The growth is expected to come from higher parking revenues, improvement in occupancy and pricing in our residential portfolio, higher NOI from our hotel and increased occupancy in our office portfolio. 
Our leasing velocity has picked up in the last 2 quarters where we've leased 2.7 million square feet of signed leases. Given the length of the typical leasing cycle, many of these leases we've signed or are negotiating will take occupancy either in late '22 or '23. We expect the improvement in our headline office occupancy to be gradual. As Doug described, we have several larger leases in the works for vacant space where we anticipate occupancy will occur in 2023. On a cash basis, we expect our share of 2022 same property NOI growth to be much stronger at between 5.5% and 6.5% over 2021. This equates to be between $90 million and $100 million of incremental cash NOI to 2022. Much of our cash NOI growth is coming from approximately $50 million of free rent that is burning off in contractual leases. 
Our third FFO growth driver is coming from lower interest expense. As I mentioned earlier, we will incur a debt redemption charge of $0.25 per share in the fourth quarter of '21. We do not expect that this will recur. Also, we are aggressively refinancing loans that were placed 5 to 10 years ago in a higher interest rate environment with low-cost current market financing. Partially offsetting this, we do expect to see higher interest expense in our joint venture portfolio. This is because we will cease capitalization of interest on the Marriott and Hub on Causeway projects when they are delivered into service. In aggregate, we expect that 2022 interest expense will be $52 million to $60 million less, than in 2021. That equates to $0.30 to $0.34 of incremental positive impact on our 2022 FFO. 
So to summarize, our guidance for 2022 FFO was $7.25 to $7.45 per share. The midpoint of our range is $7.35, which is 13% or $0.84 a share higher than the midpoint of our 2021 guidance. At the midpoint, the incremental growth is coming from $0.43 from development and acquisitions, $0.25 from our same property portfolio and $0.32 from lower interest expense. This will be offset by $0.06 of dilution from our 2021 disposition activity, $0.06 of lower termination income and $0.04 of higher G&A. The past 18 months have brought challenges and uncertainty to so many, including our team at BXP. These past few months, it's been heartening to see our cities reopen, our colleagues and our clients starting to return to their offices and office leasing volumes picking up. As I spelled out, we anticipate very strong FFO growth in 2022 and beyond 2022, we have more developments underway that will deliver additional FFO. Plus, we have the highest quality portfolio of office buildings that we believe will generate higher occupancy rates and earnings in the future.

So most of that, honestly, is coming from filling vacant space. I would say that there's very little remaining in the way of kind of deferrals and things like that for retail tenants right now. In San Francisco, which is the smallest retail portfolio we have because the tenants there just don't pay high rents. That's where the tenants haven't all returned to occupancy. And the vast majority of them are not paying rent. So that's the place where those deferrals are. I mean I think that's probably a couple of million bucks a year, something like that. That's not the most significant piece. The big chunks are some of the stuff Doug talked about, where we filed the Lord -- we're filling the Lord & Taylor space. That's a big 120,000 square feet. We've got a number of new retailers coming into the Peru where we had vacancy that was created by some bankruptcies there. And then in Reston as well. 
So those are kind of the big ticket items where it's coming from. So I would say most of it is coming from filling vacant space, not from tenants that were deferring rents and are going to be paying contract going forward."

In the greater Boston market, virtually everything is up. And then again, if you look at our D.C. market, the deals that we're doing in Reston are modestly up or down on the rent level because of the question of how much growth there was in the rent over the last period of time that the existing tenant was in there. So if we had a deal that was done 10 years ago and we had 3% increases every year, there was probably a modest amount of negative rental rate growth. 
If the tenant was a shorter-term deal, it was -- it's probably positive because there's been a pickup in terms of the, I guess, the strength of the market over the last 12 to 18 months."

If there is significant inflation, then the rents that are necessary to justify new construction, assuming interest rates are also going up are going to need to rise. And there's no question that speculative development will be more challenging. But there are still lots of customers in this country who want new construction and want the best and brightest of the way buildings are built, potentially being very green carbon neutral, net zero, whatever you want to describe it as it's harder to do that with an older building. And so I think the question will be, what will the character of the leasing be and where will it occur? But I don't think it's going to necessarily stop new construction. I do think that speculative office development is a very, I'd say, challenging proposition today in most markets because of the amount of supply that exists. But remember that when you're starting a new building, you're talking about delivering somewhere between 36 and 48 months later if it's a high-rise. And then even if it's a low-rise building, it's a minimum of 24 months. So people's views on what the world will look like when we get to those periods of time. Will it be influential? And I mean, as Owen just suggested, we're looking at the Silicon Valley, and we're looking at Platform 16, and we're saying to ourselves, that's a really interesting market relative to the amount of demand that currently exists today. The lack of high-quality first-class -- Class A office product, the potential location of the building that we would be building relative to transportation, and so we're pretty optimistic in certain instances, but clearly, it's not what it would have been 3 years ago."

And what we're seeing, I mean, we had 2 conversations yesterday with -- one with a tech company and one with a professional services company, and they both told us they've already sent out announcements to their folks that, hey, in one case, they want everybody to start coming back to the office on a hybrid model in November. And the other one is, hey, you better be near your office because we expect it to be back in January. Those companies are companies that have also, we know publicly, have said we're not sure when we're coming back and we've delayed things, and they're not publicly stating what I just described. 
So I think there's more going on right now relative to companies starting to put pressure on their existing employee base that it's time to start to think real hard about moving yourself into the right location so that you can be in the office on a much more consistent basis going forward."

When San Francisco starts to have a significant return to the office wave, I think it will pick up rapidly and that we will start to see a significant recovery. Remember that prepandemic, Manhattan and New York had a supply problem, and San Francisco did not have a supply problem. So the opportunity for San Francisco is will -- how much of that labor will want to come back and how quickly will those companies that have grown dramatically in terms of their own headcounts during the pandemic, want to bring those people into close proximity with each other on a day-to-day basis. And there's an opportunity for San Francisco to accelerate and to quickly return. It's got a challenge from a political perspective right now, and it's got a challenge from a statistical perspective because there's a lot more available space on a percentage basis than there was and has ever been from a sublet perspective. Manhattan is still way below where it once was, call it, 2002, 2003 from a sublet as a percentage of the market. San Francisco is way above where it's been historically. And again, a lot of that space could be reoccupied by the companies that chose to put on the sublet market. And so I think that's what ultimately is going to be the thing that changes the trajectory of San Francisco in terms of its rate of recovery pace."

And I mentioned a few minutes ago that we've done 100,000 square feet of new leases with life science companies, and we're actively looking at converting some of those buildings to full life science buildings. Carnegie Center is probably the most amenitized project in Central New Jersey, and we have a tremendous amount of investment that's been made and it's been very receptive. So I think that the -- and by the way, we are probably at the forefront of lead, not just silver, but platinum new lead standards, energy efficiency, indoor air quality. I mean we are doing those things as a road task today everywhere in our portfolio. So I would tell you that the portfolio doesn't have any of those issues that you might describe as challenges. And honestly, we have as much vacancy in a Class A office building today as we've had in other challenging time periods. And again, we are committed to picking up our occupancy rate, and we are doing that, as I described in my comments relative to the amount of leasing that we're doing today. So we feel really good about the whole portfolio. 
Now there are some markets that are less hardy than others relative to the amount of leasing demand and San Francisco is obviously one of them. But as an example, you mentioned Gateway. We're taking 651 Gateway out of service to convert it to life science. It's why it's got a 90,000 square foot lease and a 300,000 square foot building, right? We're trying to clear it out.

I think the challenge is the companies that are thinking about what it is that hybrid means and how hybrid will work for them. And those companies will need to get their people back into a consistent in-person environment or understand what those -- what their employees want to do and what they want them to do. And that's going to take some time. And so I believe that 2022 will be a lighter year relative to absorption than pre-pandemic. And then in 2023, when the experiments have all run their courses and companies understand what their expectations are for human capital and physical capital, that's when we will see, I believe, and I think Owen articulates as well for the reasons why we'll see a very strong pickup in absorption and demand -- growth demand."

So there have been some very successful and interesting renovations of existing stock. I would say some of the best buildings in Midtown South are actually older buildings that have been renovated and we intend to make 360 Park Avenue South, one of them. So I think it's very dependent on the local market, I think a very high-quality older building that's been fully renovated in Midtown South is going to get equivalent pricing to something that's new."

So everything else can basically go. You can literally rip off the facade and put a brand new energy-efficient window system and you can dramatically change the mechanical, you can even create new shafts for a larger duct work and change the mechanical equipment in the buildings. So if the building has a really challenged structural system, meaning locked in lot of columns or a very low slab to slab, I think those are the impediments to a renovated building relative to new construction where you're going to see many fewer columns, and you're going to see much larger volumes of space. But other than those two characteristics, a fabulous renovation of a building is going to get the same, I think, level of interest as a new construction building."

We've seen in our own portfolio, it's value to small companies that just want space, and they want it now and they want flexibility. And I also think larger corporates will see value in procuring a small percentage of their space on a flexible basis given their business often changes more rapidly than space can be delivered to them. But I think the first thing that has to happen in the market is roughly what, 2% to 3% of U.S. office space today is flexible. It needs to refill. I mean that's the first thing that needs to happen. And then the question will be, if it's going to grow, how is it going to get financed? 
I'm not sure that operators are going to be financing additional growth of flexible office space. I think it's going to be the landlords and where and when and how much will they elect to do going forward.

I would tell you that we continue to see requests from small companies for, hey, what do you have for me? I'm looking for some short-term space. And that's exactly what our Flex product should be about. What we are not doing and don't have any intention of doing is taking large pieces of our space and converting it to flex space and competing with WeWork or any of the other flexible space operators for corporate users who are looking for large blocks of space because that's just part of their strategy. That's not what we're going to be doing. 
Relative to where our buildings are and the amenitization we have, that's the -- I think that's the attraction of why the companies that are in our spaces have gone there is because you can go to the Prudential Center or you can go to the Hub on Causeway or you can go to 100 Federal Street and get the advantage of all the amenitization and the great place and space making that we have done and do it on a short-term basis, if that's what your business strategy calls for."

One is what Doug is describing, which is, is this something we should just have to attract more customers, particularly where we have a high concentration of office space like at the Peru or at Reston or Embarcadero Center? If you're building an apartment building, you don't just build single bedrooms. You have studios and 2 bedrooms. So this is a different product and is it valuable to have that product at one of our facilities? And also, by the way, does it create tenants that might move, become successful and bigger and then like being at the Peru, for example, and become a longer-term customer? So that's one question. Then the second question is what's the math? And that's a big question because you have to do turnkey build-out, cost is hundreds of dollars a square foot. You face vacancy because you don't have long-term leases and you have to understand what the math looks like."

In other locations, it's probably 50% to 60%. But it tends to be longer in term, not month-to-month. And then again, our Flex product is totally different than co-working. We're not doing co-working. These are spaces that are prebuilt, and we have no social aspects to the needs of our clients, they do that."

Boston and San Francisco spreads are going to be up in our view. And the deals that Doug talked about that we're doing in San Francisco this quarter and the things that we have under discussion are going to be rolled up. Same thing with Boston and Cambridge and the suburbs. I think Reston will be closer to flat, maybe slightly up on the leasing that we do. And New York City is going to be a little bit more volatile because it really depends on the space. We have certain spaces that are going to be rolled down and certain spaces that are going to be rolled up. So I think you will see more volatility in New York City there. 
With respect to kind of AFFO, if you look at '21, and we've got 3 quarters in the books, I mean, I think our AFFO is getting pretty close to where it was in 2019, honestly. We have a shot of getting to, I think it was $4.43 a share in 2019. So I think we have a shot of getting there. We may be slightly below. But looking out at 2022, I would say, on the CapEx side, probably pretty similar to what we're seeing this year, which is $100 million, maybe $120 million max in kind of CapEx. Leasing costs, they're running somewhere in the mid-200s on an annual basis, which is not that significantly different than what they've been in '21 and prior years. And then we've got a lot of, obviously, free rent burning off. Our noncash rent is going to be slightly lower than we guided for 2021 and we gave that guidance, it's $90 million to $110 million of noncash rent. But there's a lot of free rent burning off. 
And then you have other noncash items that go the other way like stock comp and fair value ground lease rent and things like that, that's about $75 million the other way. So the way I kind of look at it is, if you want to add up all those adjustments, there's probably $370 million to $400 million of adjustments off of our FFO. So that's $2.25 a share. So that will drive you to 2022 to an AFFO that's around $5, which is up significantly from where it was -- where we'll be in '21, but also from where it was in 2019 pre-COVID because of all the cash NOI growth we've had and developments, right, that have come in and are increasing our cash NOI. So I think it's a very positive story."
