Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings conference call. We appreciate you joining us today and hope you're all staying safe and well.

We appreciate you joining us today and hope you're all staying safe and well. 
Our fourth quarter results reflect the benefit of our ongoing strategic actions despite the continued challenges of COVID-19. The GPC team was agile in adapting to dynamic conditions and executed on our initiatives to deliver customer value, operational efficiencies and strong financial results. We are grateful to our 50,000 associates for their unwavering commitment to excellence while responding to unprecedented business and economic conditions, which have continued for nearly 12 months. Our operational focus is on ensuring a safe work environment, supporting our talented workforce and further strengthening our strong culture. 
In January, we are pleased to promote Will Stengel, the President, and we now welcome Will to this quarterly call. As our Chief Transformation Officer since 2019, Will helped our business units work to achieve a variety of strategic initiatives and significant cost savings in 2020. Will's vast skill set and relevant experience in his previous career with HD Supply, have added tremendous value to our management team. His exceptional talent, proven leadership and experience make Will an excellent choice as our company's next president, and we look forward to his future contributions. You will hear from both Will and Carol later in the call, and then we'll take your questions. 
So now turning to our fourth quarter financial results. Total sales for the quarter were $4.3 billion, down 1% due in part to the continued challenges of COVID-19. While our automotive sales were strong in Asia Pac, the pace of recovery slowed in Europe and North America relative to the previous quarter. Industrial sales grew progressively stronger during the final 3 months of 2020 and were much improved from the prior 2 quarters. We further improved gross margin. And in fact, the fourth quarter was our 13th consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion. In addition, we successfully took action to reduce costs lowering our year-over-year operating expenses. 
For the quarter, we generated an additional $40 million in permanent cost savings and realized another $40 million in temporary savings related to our response to COVID-19. Our progress in these areas drove a 14% increase in total operating profit and an 8.8% operating margin. This 110 basis point improvement in operating margin from the fourth quarter of 2019 was supported by margin expansion in both the automotive and industrial segments. 
Our strong operating performance drove adjusted net income of $221 million and adjusted earnings per share of $1.52, up 20%. Due to ongoing working capital and debt financing initiatives, we also finished the quarter and year with a strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and robust cash flow with $2 billion in cash from operations in 2020. 
Turning now to our business segments. Automotive represented 66% of total sales in the fourth quarter, and industrial was 34%. By region, 73% of revenues were attributable to North America, with 16% in Europe and 11% in Asia Pac. Total sales for the global automotive group were $2.8 billion, a 1% increase from 2019 with comp sales down 2%. Segment profit margin was up 130 basis points, driven by improvement in each of our automotive operations. 
Fourth quarter sales were led by strong growth in Asia Pac, with continued retail and commercial sales momentum driving a second consecutive quarter of mid-teen sales comps. The Asia Pac team performed well all year and deserves a special shout out on their exceptional results. So congratulations and a big thank you to Rob Cameron and the entire automotive team down under. 
In Europe and North America, the surge in COVID cases led to more restrictions on mobility and mild weather through most of the quarter pressured sales of seasonal items. A second lockdown in November significantly slowed sales activity across Europe, although sales gradually improved through December, driving flat comps for the quarter. 
We would add as well that despite the challenging conditions in Europe overall, our U.K. operations continued to outperform with solid results for the quarter. Additionally, the positive impact of our cost savings initiatives more than offset the sales pressure, and the European team produced a 100 basis point operating margin improvement. This caps a strong recovery in Europe's operating performance over the second half of 2020. 
In North America, our U.S. automotive total sales and comp sales declined approximately 6%. Despite the sales decrease, the U.S. team generated a 200 basis point improvement in operating profit margin. In Canada, quarterly sales were down slightly. Comp sales declined 2% and operating margin improved by 40 basis points. Growth in sales to our retail customers continued to outperform expectations, while sales to the DIFM segment remain challenged. 
Through the quarter, DIY sales were strong, driven by COVID-related shifts in consumer behavior and stimulus payments and stronger NAPA sales positioning resulting from several key initiatives. These include our ongoing store refreshes, investment in retail specialists, the benefit of our NAPA Rewards program with 12.5 million active members, targeted promotions and enhanced merchandising initiatives. In addition, our growing omnichannel capabilities, including direct-to-customer shipping from select suppliers, enabled our team to double our online sales volume from pre-pandemic levels. 
DIFM sales were down from 2019 as a slow recovery in miles driven, mild temperatures, and continued pressure in our large fleet and government customer segment weighed on sales demand. To address these declines and build positive momentum in 2021, our team is focused on several initiatives, including: maximizing sales force effectiveness by repurposing our field resources and doubling the number of professional salespeople calling directly on our end customers do professional repair garages; continued enhancement of our industry-leading commercial programs and promotions for the professional customers, including NAPA AutoCare and AutoPro; improving our inventory availability, utilize and enhanced analytics to ensure more parts for more cars across our store networks; strengthening our supply chain, focusing on our global supplier relationships, as well as ensuring we have multiple suppliers by category. While we are seeing gradual improvement with supply chain service issues, there is more work yet to be done. And finally, further optimizing our network, including DC consolidations, increasing automation in our facilities and additional daily shuttles. 
In 2021, we will also continue to execute on several global initiatives and invest in our omnichannel strategy, both B2B and B2C; to enhance and build new digital catalog and search capabilities; implement strategic pricing initiatives; focused on value-added services; and continue our rollout of the NAPA brand in Europe and Australasia. 
We also have plans to expand our global store footprint with additional bolt-on acquisitions, changeovers and new greenfield stores to enhance our competitive positioning across our automotive operations. These initiatives are designed to deliver customer value, sell more parts and capture market share. 
To that end, we are pleased to report a strong start in 2021, with January average daily sales up low double digits in the U.S. and for our global automotive group. Backing out the positive impact of FX and acquisition revenues, comp sales were up high single digits in January. We would add that we continue to see little impact of price inflation in our sales although we expect to see more supplier increases in the coming months and quarters, possibly in the 1% to 3% range for the full year. 
So in summary, we believe the improving product availability, colder winter weather in North America and Europe, and the gradual reopening of the economy are current tailwinds for Automotive business. In addition, favorable industry fundamentals a growing total vehicle fleet, an increase in vehicles aged 6 to 12 years, and expectation for the gradual recovery in miles driven give us confidence in our growth expectations for 2021 and despite the ongoing uncertainties due to COVID-19. 
So now let's discuss the global Industrial Parts Group. Total sales for this group were $1.4 billion, down 3.3% from last year. Comp sales were down 4.4%, a significant improvement from the 9% decrease in Q3 and the 17% decrease we saw back in Q2. The steady recovery in sales over the last half of 2020 is consistent with the gradual improvement in the industrial economy, which is evident in indicators such as the Purchasing Managers Index and industrial production. 
Strengthening conditions, combined with our ongoing initiatives to drive growth and lower cost resulted in a 70 basis point improvement in segment profit margin and our strongest quarterly return on sales since the fourth quarter of 2007. 
Sales in North America and Australasia showed similar sales trends for the fourth quarter overall, although December was the strongest month in the quarter in North America. In addition, most key product categories achieved positive sales growth in December with improved month-to-month sales trends among virtually all the industries we serve. We expect to build on these favorable trends in 2021. 
As we move forward into 2021, which is Motion's 75th year in business, the Industrial team will continue to execute on strategic initiatives to drive profitable sales growth, improve operational productivity and deliver customer value. These initiatives include building out our omnichannel capabilities to drive organic sales; optimize the value of the Motion website and accelerate e-commerce growth; growing our services and solutions business to expand our expertise in areas such as repair, conveyance and automation; ongoing disciplined M&A to further boost our products and service offering, while expanding our global footprint and market presence; enhancing our global pricing and product category management strategies to ensure sales excellence, margin effectiveness and a product offering that evolves the Motion brand globally; and optimizing our global distribution network, the enhanced automation and facility rationalization to lower cost, improve productivity and deliver excellent customer service. 
We are confident that our focus on these key initiatives will optimize our competitive positioning as the industrial markets recover to full capacity. We are encouraged to see releases of capital project orders that were on hold throughout most of 2020, which is a positive sign for our greater plant activity in the months and quarters ahead. In addition, we are pleased that our supplier service levels are strong despite extended lead times on select items, and our inventories are in good position to meet expected growing demand. 
Finally, we currently expect another year of reasonable 1% to 2% price inflation from our suppliers, which compares to inflation of just under 1% in 2020. For additional perspective, we experienced positive sales momentum in January, with average daily sales up 2% for the month. This is better than the sales trends we reported in the third and fourth quarter of 2020 and is a testament to the great work done by the entire Industrial team. 
So despite the ongoing challenges of COVID-19 and its uncertain impact on the global economy and our markets, we are confident in our plans for the Industrial segment and look forward to a strong 2021. 
So let me conclude by providing an update on our ESG initiatives. At GPC, we embrace our responsibility to innovate in ways that also benefit our environment, our associates and the communities in which we operate. Our ESG practices, including human capital management and diversity and inclusion are discussed in our 2020 corporate sustainability report. In addition, our Board of Directors adopted a formal human rights policy which communicates the company's commitment to upholding human rights in every location in which we operate as well as our expectation that our suppliers, partners and affiliates also respect human rights. Our company-wide commitment to sustainability is integral to our corporate growth strategy. We invite you to visit our GPC website to view these documents and learn more about our ESG initiatives. So with that, I'll turn it over to Will for his remarks. Will?"

I'd like to thank Paul and",441,"Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. First, I want to say that I'm incredibly proud to be a part of Genuine Parts Company. The company has an impressive history of success, and it's an honor to be on the GPC leadership team. I'd like to thank Paul and the Board for their vote of confidence. As Paul mentioned, I joined the company in late 2019 as Chief Transformation Officer. Previously, I held executive leadership positions at HD Supply, including time as President and CEO of HD Supply Facilities Maintenance, and various other strategy and operating roles. My experience in distribution-related businesses fits well with GPC's portfolio, business model and strategic initiatives, where consistent profitable growth, operating leverage, strong cash conversion and disciplined capital allocation are all key value drivers, with the dividend, an especially important part of the GPC capital allocation strategy. 
I'm excited about the future potential of Genuine Parts Company. Each of our GPC businesses enjoy leadership positions within attractive fragmented markets with scale and capabilities to win. We have leading global brands and long-standing relationships based on reliable customer service and value-added expertise. And our unique culture that is based on a clear set of core values and purpose, serves as an important common foundation. 
Strategic actions taken in 2020 accelerated the transformation momentum built over recent years as we work to simplify the business and further define our critical focus areas. The global teams executed well as we navigated the pandemic and demonstrated an ability to act quickly and deliver results. Our strategic actions provided clarity for areas where we want to increase our focus, including profitable organic growth, driving operating productivity through simplification and integration, disciplined and strategic capital deployment and investments in talent to develop and build capabilities. 
Despite a challenging and unprecedented year, our diverse businesses proved resilient and built solid momentum as we enter 2021. In my new role, I look forward to working with Paul and the global leadership team as we align resources within our focus areas to execute these initiatives and deliver value as a team. I'm also looking forward to spending time in our operations and with our customers and suppliers. 
In addition, we'll continue to further refine and advance our longer-term strategic road map. We're excited about the numerous potential opportunities that new technologies and emerging trends could present for GPC. As we look to the future, we feel well positioned to execute our strategic priorities to the benefit of all our stakeholders, and I look forward to working with the leadership team to drive results. Thank you, and I'll now turn it to Carol for her comments."
275034,701650838,2213776,"Genuine Parts Company, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2021",2021-02-17,"Earnings Calls","Genuine Parts Company","Executives","Thank you, Will. As a reminder, our comments this morning primarily focus on adjusted results from continuing operations, which excludes restructuring, inventory, transaction and other costs and income. We will begin with a review of our key financial inf",1949,"Thank you, Will. As a reminder, our comments this morning primarily focus on adjusted results from continuing operations, which excludes restructuring, inventory, transaction and other costs and income. We will begin with a review of our key financial information and then provide our full year outlook for 2021. 
Total GPC sales were $4.3 billion in the fourth quarter, down 0.7% from 2019. For the full year, sales were $16.5 billion, down 5.6% or down 2.3%, excluding divestitures. Our adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 35%, a 40 basis point improvement compared to 34.6% in the fourth quarter last year. For the full year, adjusted gross margin improved 100 basis points to 34.5% from 33.5% in 2019. 
Our team has been focused on a number of margin-enhancing initiatives and the fourth quarter and full year gains represent the 13th consecutive quarter and the fifth consecutive year of improved gross margin for the company. 
Our steady progress in expanding gross margin in the quarter and the year reflects a variety of factors, including the favorable impact of sales mix shifts to higher gross margin operations, positive product mix shifts, strategic pricing tools and analytics, global sourcing advantages and strategic category management initiatives. In addition, the full year gross margin also benefited from acquisitions and divestitures, which impacted our results through the 9 months. We would add these positive factors were partially offset by a decrease in supplier incentives due to lower purchasing volumes. 
And finally, as we assess the pricing environment in the fourth quarter and 2020 overall, there was minimal impact of price inflation in our sales and gross margins. As Paul mentioned earlier, we'll see how this plays out in 2021, but we have not had any impact of inflation to this point in the year. 
Our adjusted selling, administrative and other expenses were $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, down 2.8% from last year and representing 26.6% of sales compared to 27.2% last year. For the year, these expenses were $4.4 billion, down 3.9% compared to last year and 26.5% of sales compared to 26% in 2019. The decrease in operating expenses for the fourth quarter and full year reflect the favorable impact of our permanent and COVID-related cost actions implemented throughout 2020, as previously discussed. 
As mentioned on our third quarter conference call, in accordance with our 2019 $100 million cost savings plan, we successfully achieved the $100 million annual target ahead of schedule. We are pleased to report an incremental $40 million in savings recognized in the fourth quarter and $150 million in permanent expense reductions for 2020. In addition, our team continued to execute on a number of additional savings initiatives in response to the impact of COVID-19. These initiatives contributed temporary cost savings of approximately $40 million in the fourth quarter and $300 million for the full year. 
Combined, we generated approximately $80 million in total savings during the fourth quarter and approximately $450 million for the full year driven by transformative reductions in payroll and facility costs as well as temporary savings from furloughs, reduced travel and entertainment, government subsidies and other initiatives in response to COVID. We expect our permanent cost savings to carry over into 2021, and we'll continue to manage our expenses to further improve our cost structure and operating performance. 
Our total operating and nonoperating expenses were an adjusted $1.2 billion for the fourth quarter, down 3.4% from last year. This represents 28.1% of sales, down 80 basis points from 28.9% in 2019. For the full year, these expenses were an adjusted $4.7 billion, down 3% from the prior year and representing 28.4% of sales. 
Our total segment profit in the fourth quarter was $374 million, up 14% on a 1% sales decrease and our segment profit margin was 8.8% compared to 7.7% last year for a strong increase of 110 basis points. For the full year, segment profit was $1.3 billion, up 3% compared to 2019, and our segment profit margin was 8.2% compared to 7.8% in the prior year. This represents our strongest full year segment profit margin since 2015. 
We had net interest expense of $21 million in the fourth quarter. And for 2020, net interest was $91 million, which is essentially flat from 2019. In 2021, we expect net interest of $70 million to $72 million, which is down from 2020 due to lower interest rates related to our new debt agreements negotiated in the fourth quarter as well as the expectation for lower debt levels. The corporate expense line was $33 million in the fourth quarter, down from $37 million in 2019 and for the year, these expenses were $150 million. We currently expect our corporate expense to be in the $150 million range again in 2021. 
Our adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was 25.1%, an increase from 24.6% in the prior year period. For the year, our adjusted tax rate was 24.5% and in line with 2019. We are planning for a full year tax rate for 2021 in the range of 24.5 to 25.5. 
Fourth quarter net income from continuing operations was $172 million with earnings per share of $1.18. Adjusted net income was $221 million or $1.52 per share which compares to $186 million or $1.27 per share in 2019 or a 20% increase. For the full year, reported net income was $163 million or $1.13 per share, and adjusted net income was $765 million or $5.27 per share. 
So now let's discuss our fourth quarter results by segment. Our Automotive revenue for the fourth quarter was $2.8 billion, up 1% from the prior year. Segment profit of $240 million was up 19%, with profit margin at 8.5% compared to a 7.2% margin in the fourth quarter of 2019. The 130 basis point increase in margin was driven by improved operating results across each of our Automotive businesses for the second consecutive quarter. So an excellent job of operating by our Automotive team, and we look forward to continued progress in 2021. 
Our Industrial sales were $1.4 billion in the quarter, a 3.3% decrease from Q4 of 2019 and significantly improved from the sales declines in the second and third quarter. Segment profit of $133 million was up 5% from 1 year ago. And the profit margin was up 70 basis points to 9.3% compared to 8.6% last year. The improved margin for Industrial reflects gains in both our North American and Australasian industrial businesses for the second consecutive quarter, so strong operating results for Industrial, which we expect to continue in 2021. 
So now I will turn our comments to the balance sheet. We continue to closely manage our accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable to improve our working capital position. In the fourth quarter, we sold $300 million in receivables for a total of $800 million sold in 2020 under an accounts receivable sales agreement. Our total accounts receivable is down 36% from 2019, and we remain pleased with the quality of our receivables. Our inventory at December 31, 2020, was up 2% from the prior year and accounts payable increased 5%, improving our AP to inventory ratio to 118% in 2020 from 114% in 2019. 
We are pleased with the progress our team is making to strengthen our supply chain. And in 2020, these key accounts were a source of cash from operations, and our total working capital was 7% of revenues. We repaid $230 million of debt in the fourth quarter and our total debt of $2.7 billion at December 31, 2020, is down $749 million or 22% from the $3.4 billion in 2019. During the fourth quarter, we further improved our debt position with new public debt and a new revolving credit agreement that provided for expanded credit capacity and more favorable rates. We closed the year with $2.9 billion in available liquidity, which is up from $1.3 billion at December 31, 2019. 
Through our efforts in these and other areas, we generated a robust $2 billion in cash from operations in 2020, which is up from $833 million in 2019. Our free cash flow was $1.9 billion, an increase from $555 million in 2019. While we selectively scaled back our near-term plans for capital deployment in early April of 2020 to conserve cash through COVID-19, we were very committed to several key priorities for cash, which we believe serves to maximize shareholder value. 
Our key priorities include the reinvestment in our businesses via capital expenditures, M&A, share repurchases and the dividend. We have deployed $4.7 billion in capital across these areas over the last 4 years. In 2020, we reduced our original $300 million in CapEx plan by 50% and invested $154 million in essential capital expenditures, which was down from $278 million in 2019. For 2021, we expect to resume more normal levels of our reinvestments in our businesses and are planning for total capital expenditures in the range of $275 million to $325 million for the year. 
We also pulled back on M&A activity in 2020, although strategic acquisitions remain an important component of our long-term growth strategy. In 2020, we used $69 million in cash to acquire several small businesses. And in 2021, we expect to make additional strategic bolt-on acquisitions to complement our global Automotive and Industrial segments. As a reminder, we have not considered any of these future acquisitions in our 2021 outlook. 
The company has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since going public in 1928. Earlier this week, our Board approved a $3.26 per share annual dividend for 2021, representing our 65th consecutive annual increase in the dividend. This represents a 3% increase from the $3.16 per share paid in 2020. In 2020, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of our common stock prior to suspending our share repurchases amid the pandemic. As of December 31, 2020, we were authorized to repurchase up to 14.5 million additional shares, and we expect to make additional opportunistic share repurchases again in 2021. 
Turning to our outlook for 2021, we are reinstating our practice of providing full year guidance. In arriving at our full year 2021 guidance, we considered several factors, including our past performance, current growth plans and strategic initiatives, recent business trends and the global economic outlook. In addition, we consider the continued uncertainty of COVID-19 and its potential impact on our results. 
With these factors in mind, we expect total sales for 2021 to be in the range of plus 4% to plus 6%. These growth rates assume a relatively neutral impact from foreign currency translation, minimal price inflation and as mentioned before, exclude the benefit of any unannounced future acquisitions. By business, we are guiding to plus 4% to plus 6% total sales growth for the Automotive segment, including plus 3% to plus 5% comp sales growth. And a total sales increase of plus 3% to plus 5% for the Industrial segment, including an increase in comp sales of plus 2% to plus 4%. 
On the earnings side, we currently expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.55 to $5.75. This represents a 5% to 9% increase compared to our adjusted diluted earnings per share in 2020. 
We move forward into 2021, confident in our strategic plans and initiatives to meet or exceed these targeted results and deliver value. In addition, we believe that the underlying industry fundamentals for our global Automotive and Industrial segments are favorable and will continue to provide us with sustained long-term growth opportunities. So that's our financial update, and we look forward to reporting on further improvement in our financial performance throughout 2021. Thank you, and I'll now turn it back over to Paul."

Our company stores slightly outperformed our independents in the quarter. We've seen that already reversed in the other direction in January. That'll flip month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter. So no real big news there. 
Regionality, what we saw in the quarter was kind of consistent with what we've been seeing. We saw really good performance out West. I'm really proud of our Western division and the job that group is doing. Our Mountain team, as they have all year, had a solid quarter. And the Mountain, Bret, just FYI, they stretch from Colorado, Montana, all the way down to Texas. We saw some softness in the Southeast, we saw a little softness in the Northeast as well. 
In relation to your question about the cadence of the quarter and December specifically, we started out the quarter okay. And I'm assuming that question was around U.S. automotive, Bret?"

We saw softness in December, and then we saw softness in December as well. I think the first couple of months we're probably more related to a little bit warmer weather than -- especially in November, plus we saw a little bit of a COVID resurgence in the U.S. 
December is a bit unique, Bret. And if you remember, we had a big December 1 year ago, 2019. We were going up against some pretty tough comps. So that certainly impacted December as well. But look, here is a good news, Bret, for us and the NAPA team is, we had a really strong rebound in January, both DIY and DIFM, which we're really pleased to see the commercial business bouncing back in January. And that's carrying into February as well."

Pleased to say, we're not seeing that in Europe. We have a strong battery business. We actually just launched the NAPA battery across Europe. We have our suppliers taking good care of us over there. And we're seeing really good business across Europe in the battery business. 
But that would be the call out. There's a couple of other suppliers that are impacting us. And look, these guys are battling labor shortages due to COVID, some shortages of raw materials. So I understand they got their challenges, and we're hoping to see improvement here as we roll into '21."

And then I'll make a few comments on SG&A and then maybe let Will add and talk about what we're going to see for 2021. And you're right, we did have the temporary cost savings, but more importantly, our permanent cost savings of $150 million do roll in to 2021. And we expect to -- while some of those, certainly, the temporary savings come back in. When you look at our outlook for 2021 on SG&A, we have improvement when you go back to, say, the 2019 levels. So we really have permanently reduced our cost structure, if you will, but having said that, there's still things we're working on that. We're going to see headwinds in terms of payroll and freight.

On the SG&A, there's really kind of 2 ways to think about it. First is the importance, as Carol alluded to, of keeping these temporary cost savings out. So converting them from temporary to permanent, and that's a daily activity that we work on with the teams here. But then obviously, very discrete productivity initiatives around the globe around SG&A, ranging from labor productivity in DCs, evaluating and analyzing indirect spend, low-cost country opportunities for back-office functions, et cetera.

And with that, there was actions that needed to be taken and it is related to reducing payroll, reducing positions. We had furloughs, we had deferred travel and entertainment. We looked at facility and lease reductions. We looked at our facility costs. We looked at -- I mean we looked at anything and everything. And it was -- again, we did that without impacting our service, but we did it to adjust to the lower volumes. 
And then as volumes have come back, we looked at those costs. Again, some of those costs had to come back in. During this time, we also didn't let up on our investments in productivity and automation. So we had a number of automation projects that we continue to work on that would help us with productivity improvements, where we rationalize facilities and put in more automated conveyor systems. That helped us as well. 
So again, we -- the permanent savings go back to a year ago. Those were largely payroll-related, the $150 million. Again, we were very comfortable to how those were done. The temporary ones were just that. They were temporary in nature. And remember, part of that temporary was government subsidies. So again, we had about $60 million in government subsidies that are nonrecurring. The fact of the matter is we go into 2021 with a lower overall cost base and excitement about the initiatives we have in place to keep our cost structure down."

I mean, look, our suppliers, as Paul mentioned, they're facing raw material increases, freight and ocean cargo and just the significant increases that our suppliers are facing, labor shortages, labor inflation. We are hearing that our suppliers are discussing price increases. We believe, certainly in automotive, it's been very rational. And as these price increases come, that they will get passed through. 
Also on the industrial side, our teams are trying to stay ahead of that and doing a lot of things to make sure that those can -- when they do get the pricing, they can pass them along. I would tell you that will probably be more second half weighted. Again, some of this is managing through the uncertainty right now, but probably more second half weighted. So the 1% to 2%, 1% to 3%, if you will, is on a full year basis, but probably more second half. But again, that's not in any of our numbers. 
And the last thing I would just add, and you heard Will talk about it, our teams have so many terrific initiatives going on in the gross margin area, especially in terms of pricing. So we're a lot more agile today. We have a lot more analytics and a lot more strategic pricing initiatives that will help us offset this as well."

We appreciate you joining us today and hope you're all staying safe and well.  
Our fourth quarter results reflect the benefit of our ongoing strategic actions despite the continued challenges of COVID-19. The GPC team was agile in adapting to dynamic conditions and executed on our initiatives to deliver customer value, operational efficiencies and strong financial results. We are grateful to our 50,000 associates for their unwavering commitment to excellence, while responding to unprecedented business and economic conditions, which have continued for nearly 12 months. Our operational focus is on ensuring a safe work environment, supporting our talented workforce and further strengthening our strong culture.  
In January, we are pleased to promote Will Stengel, the President, and we now welcome Will to this quarterly call. As our Chief Transformation Officer since 2019, Will helped our business units work to achieve a variety of strategic initiatives and significant cost savings in 2020. Will's vast skill set and relevant experience in his previous career with HD Supply, have added tremendous value to our management team. His exceptional talent, proven leadership and experience make Will an excellent choice as our company's next president, and we look forward to his future contributions. You will hear from both Will and Carol later in the call, and then we'll take your questions.  
So now turning to our fourth quarter financial results. Total sales for the quarter were $4.3 billion, down 1% due in part to the continued challenges of COVID-19. While our automotive sales were strong in Asia Pac, the pace of recovery slowed in Europe and North America relative to the previous quarter. Industrial sales grew progressively stronger during the final 3 months of 2020 and were much improved from the prior 2 quarters. We further improved gross margin. And in fact, the fourth quarter was our 13th consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion. In addition, we successfully took action to reduce costs, lowering our year-over-year operating expenses.  
For the quarter, we generated an additional $40 million in permanent cost savings and realized another $40 million in temporary savings related to our response to COVID-19. Our progress in these areas drove a 14% increase in total operating profit and an 8.8% operating margin. This 110 basis point improvement in operating margin from the fourth quarter of 2019 was supported by margin expansion in both the automotive and industrial segments.  
Our strong operating performance drove adjusted net income of $221 million and adjusted earnings per share of $1.52, up 20%. Due to ongoing working capital and debt financing initiatives, we also finished the quarter and year with a strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and robust cash flow with $2 billion in cash from operations in 2020.  
Turning now to our business segments. Automotive represented 66% of total sales in the fourth quarter, and industrial was 34%. By region, 73% of revenues were attributable to North America, with 16% in Europe and 11% in Asia Pac. Total sales for the global automotive group were $2.8 billion, a 1% increase from 2019 with comp sales down 2%. Segment profit margin was up 130 basis points, driven by improvement in each of our automotive operations.  
Fourth quarter sales were led by strong growth in Asia Pac, with continued retail and commercial sales momentum driving a second consecutive quarter of mid-teen sales comps. The Asia Pac team performed well all year and deserves a special shout out on their exceptional results. So congratulations and a big thank you to Rob Cameron and the entire automotive team down under.  
In Europe and North America, the surge in COVID cases led to more restrictions on mobility and mild weather through most of the quarter pressured sales of seasonal items. A second lockdown in November significantly slowed sales activity across Europe, although sales gradually improved through December, driving flat comps for the quarter.  
We would add as well that despite the challenging conditions in Europe overall, our U.K. operations continued to outperform with solid results for the quarter. Additionally, the positive impact of our cost savings initiatives more than offset the sales pressure, and the European team produced a 100 basis point operating margin improvement. This caps a strong recovery in Europe's operating performance over the second half of 2020.  
In North America, our U.S. automotive total sales and comp sales declined approximately 6%. Despite the sales decrease, the U.S. team generated a 200 basis point improvement in operating profit margin. In Canada, quarterly sales were down slightly. Comp sales declined 2% and and operating margin improved by 40 basis points. Growth in sales to our retail customers continued to outperform expectations, while sales to the DIFM segment remain challenged. Through the quarter, DIY sales were strong, driven by COVID-related shifts in consumer behavior and stimulus payments and stronger NAPA sales positioning, resulting from several key initiatives. These include our ongoing store refreshes, investment retail specialists, the benefit of our NAPA Rewards Program with 12.5 million active members, targeted promotions and enhanced merchandising initiatives. In addition, our growing omnichannel capabilities, including direct-to-customer shipping from select suppliers, enabled our team to double our online sales volume from pre pandemic levels. DIFM sales were down from 2019 as a slow recovery in miles driven, mild temperatures and continued pressure in our large fleet and government customer segment, weighed on sales demand. To address these declines and build positive momentum in 2021 and our team is focused on several initiatives, including maximizing sales force effectiveness by repurposing our field resources and doubling the number of professional salespeople calling directly on our end customers. The professional repair garages. 
Continued enhancement of our industry-leading commercial programs and promotions for the professional customer, including NAPA AutoCare and AutoPro. Improving our inventory availability, utilize and enhanced analytics to ensure more parts or more cars across our store network, strengthening our supply chain, focusing on our global supplier relationship as well as ensuring we have multiple suppliers by category. While we are seeing gradual improvement with supply chain service issues, there is more work yet to be done. And finally, further optimizing our network, including DC consolidations, increasing automation in our facilities and additional daily shuttles. 
In 2021, we will also continue to execute on several global initiatives and invest in our omnichannel strategy, both B2B and B2C to enhance and build new digital catalog and search capabilities, implement strategic pricing initiatives, focus on value-added services and continue our rollout of the NAPA brand in Europe and Australasia. We also have plans to expand our global store footprint with additional bolt-on acquisitions, changeovers and new greenfield stores to enhance our competitive positioning across our automotive operations. These initiatives are designed to deliver customer value, sell more parts and capture market share. 
To that end, we are pleased to report a strong start in 2021, with January, average daily sales up low double digits in the U.S. and for our global automotive group. Backing out the positive impact of FX and acquisition revenues, comp sales were up high single digits in January. We would add that we continue to see little impact of price inflation in our sales, although we expect to see more supplier increases in the coming months and quarters, possibly in the 1% to 3% range for the full year. 
So in summary, we believe improving product availability, colder winter weather in North America and Europe and the gradual reopening up the economy are current tailwinds for automotive business. In addition, favorable industry fundamentals, a growing total vehicle fleet, an increase in vehicles aged 6 to 12 years, and expectation for the gradual recovery in miles driven give us confidence in our growth expectations for 2021 despite the ongoing uncertainties due to COVID-19. 
So now let's discuss the global Industrial Parts Group. Total sales for this group were $1.4 billion, down 3.3% from last year. Comp sales were down 4.4%, a significant improvement from the 9% decrease in Q3 and the 17% decrease we saw back in Q2. The steady recovery in sales over the last half of 2020 is consistent with the gradual improvement in the industrial economy, which is evident in indicators such as the Purchasing Managers Index and industrial production. Strengthening conditions, combined with our ongoing initiatives to drive growth and lower cost resulted in a 70 basis point improvement in segment profit margin and our strongest quarterly return on sales since the fourth quarter of 2007.  
Sales in North America and Australasia showed similar sales trends for the fourth quarter overall, although December was the strongest month in the quarter in North America. In addition, most key product categories achieved positive sales growth in December with improved month-to-month sales trends among virtually all the industries we serve. We expect to build on these favorable trends in 2021.  
As we move forward into 2021, which is Motion's 75th year in business, the industrial team will continue to execute on strategic initiatives to drive profitable sales growth, improve operational productivity and deliver customer value. These initiatives include building out our omnichannel capabilities to drive organic sales, optimize the value of the Motion website and accelerate e-commerce growth, growing our services and solutions business to expand our expertise in areas such as repair, conveyance and automation; ongoing disciplined M&A to further boost our products and service offerings, while expanding our global footprint and market presence; enhancing our global pricing and product category management strategies to ensure sales excellence, margin effectiveness and a product offering that evolves the Motion brand globally; and optimizing our global distribution network, the enhanced automation and facility rationalization to lower cost, improve productivity and deliver excellent customer service.  
We are confident that our focus on these key initiatives will optimize our competitive positioning as the industrial markets recover to full capacity. We are encouraged to see releases of capital project orders that were on hold throughout most of 2020, which is a positive sign for our greater plant activity in the months and quarters ahead. In addition, we are pleased that our supplier service levels are strong despite extended lead times on select items, and our inventories are in good position to meet expected growing demand.  
Finally, we currently expect another year of reasonable 1% to 2% price inflation from our suppliers, which compares to inflation of just under 1% in 2020. For additional perspective, we experienced positive sales momentum in January, with average daily sales up 2% for the month. This is better than the sales trends we reported in the third and fourth quarter of 2020 and is a testament to the great work done by the entire industrial team. So despite the ongoing challenges of COVID-19 and its uncertain impact on the global economy and our markets, we are confident in our plans for the Industrial segment and look forward to a strong 2021.  
So let me conclude by providing an update on our ESG initiatives. At GPC, we embrace our responsibility to innovate in ways that also benefit our environment, our associates and the communities in which we operate. Our ESG practices, including human capital management and diversity and inclusion, are discussed in our 2020 corporate sustainability report. In addition, our Board of Directors adopted a formal human rights policy, which communicates the company's commitment to upholding human rights in every location in which we operate as well as our expectation that our suppliers, partners and affiliates also respect human rights. Our company-wide commitment to sustainability is integral to our corporate growth strategy. We invite you to visit our GPC website to view these documents and learn more about our ESG initiatives. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Will for his remarks. Will?"

The company has an impressive history of success, and it's an honor to be on the GPC leadership team. I'd like to thank Paul and the Board for their vote of confidence. As Paul mentioned, I joined the company in late 2019 as Chief Transformation Officer. Previously, I held executive leadership positions at HD Supply, including time as President and CEO of HD Supply facilities maintenance, and various other strategy and operating roles. My experience in distribution-related businesses fits well with GPC's portfolio, business model and strategic initiatives, where consistent profitable growth, operating leverage, strong cash conversion and disciplined capital allocation are all key value drivers, with the dividend an especially important part of the GPC capital allocation strategy.  
I'm excited about the future potential of Genuine Parts Company. Each of our GPC businesses enjoy leadership positions within attractive fragmented markets with scale and capabilities to win. We have leading global brands and long-standing relationships based on reliable customer service and value-added expertise. And our unique culture that is based on a clear set of core values and purpose, serves as an important common foundation.  
Strategic actions taken in 2020 accelerated the transformation momentum built over recent years as we work to simplify the business and further define our critical focus areas. The global teams executed well as we navigated the pandemic and demonstrated an ability to act quickly and deliver results. Our strategic actions provided clarity for areas where we want to increase our focus, including profitable organic growth, driving operating productivity through simplification and integration, disciplined and strategic capital deployment and investments in talent to develop and build capabilities.  
Despite a challenging and unprecedented year, our diverse businesses proved resilient and built solid momentum as we enter 2021. In my new role, I look forward to working with Paul and the global leadership team as we align resources within our focus areas to execute these initiatives and deliver value as a team. I'm also looking forward to spending time in our operations and with our customers and suppliers.  
In addition, we'll continue to further refine and advance our longer-term strategic road map. We're excited about the numerous potential opportunities that new technologies and emerging trends could present for GPC. As we look to the future, we feel well positioned to execute our strategic priorities to the benefit of all our stakeholders, and I look forward to working with the leadership team to drive results.

As a reminder, our comments this morning primarily focus on adjusted results from continuing operations, which excludes restructuring, inventory, transaction and other costs and income.

As a reminder, our comments this morning primarily focus on adjusted results from continuing operations, which excludes restructuring, inventory, transaction and other costs and income. We will begin with a review of our key financial information and then provide our full year outlook for 2021.  
Total GPC sales were $4.3 billion in the fourth quarter, down 0.7% from 2019. For the full year, sales were $16.5 billion, down 5.6% or down 2.3%, excluding divestitures. Our adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 35%, a 40 basis point improvement compared to 34.6% in the fourth quarter last year. For the full year, adjusted gross margin improved 100 basis points to 34.5% from 33.5% in 2019.  
Our team has been focused on a number of margin-enhancing initiatives and the fourth quarter and full year gains represent the 13th consecutive quarter and the fifth consecutive year of improved gross margin for the company.  
Our steady progress in expanding gross margin in the quarter and the year reflects a variety of factors, including the favorable impact of sales mix shifts to higher gross margin operations, positive product mix shifts, strategic pricing tools and analytics, global sourcing advantages and strategic category management initiatives. In addition, the full year gross margin also benefited from acquisitions and divestitures, which impacted our results through the 9 months. We would add these positive factors were partially offset by a decrease in supplier incentives due to lower purchasing volumes.  
And finally, as we assess the pricing environment in the fourth quarter and 2020 overall, there was minimal impact of price inflation in our sales and gross margins. As Paul mentioned earlier, we'll see how this plays out in 2021, but we have not had any impact of inflation to this point in the year.  
Our adjusted selling, administrative and other expenses were $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, down 2.8% from last year and representing 26.6% of sales compared to 27.2% last year. For the year, these expenses were $4.4 billion, down 3.9% compared to last year and 26.5% of sales compared to 26% in 2019. The decrease in operating expenses for the fourth quarter and full year reflect the favorable impact of our permanent and COVID-related cost actions implemented throughout 2020, as previously discussed.  
As mentioned on our third quarter conference call, in accordance with our 2019 $100 million cost savings plan, we successfully achieved the $100 million annual target ahead of schedule. We are pleased to report an incremental $40 million in savings recognized in the fourth quarter and $150 million in permanent expense reductions for 2020. In addition, our team continued to execute on a number of additional savings initiatives in response to the impact of COVID-19. These initiatives contributed temporary cost savings of approximately $40 million in the fourth quarter and $300 million for the full year.  
Combined, we generated approximately $80 million in total savings during the fourth quarter and approximately $450 million for the full year, driven by transformative reductions in payroll and facility costs as well as temporary savings from furloughs, reduced travel and entertainment, government subsidies and other initiatives in response to COVID. We expect our permanent cost savings to carry over into 2021, and we'll continue to manage our expenses to further improve our cost structure and operating performance.  
Our total operating and nonoperating expenses were an adjusted $1.2 billion for the fourth quarter, down 3.4% from last year. This represents 28.1% of sales, down 80 basis points from 28.9% in 2019. For the full year, these expenses were an adjusted $4.7 billion, down 3% from the prior year and representing 28.4% of sales.  
Our total segment profit in the fourth quarter was $374 million, up 14% on a 1% sales decrease and our segment profit margin was 8.8% compared to 7.7% last year for a strong increase of 110 basis points. For the full year, segment profit was $1.3 billion, up 3% compared to 2019, and our segment profit margin was 8.2% compared to 7.8% in the prior year. This represents our strongest full year segment profit margin since 2015.  
We had net interest expense of $21 million in the fourth quarter. And for 2020, net interest was $91 million, which is essentially flat from 2019. In 2021, we expect net interest of $70 million to $72 million, which is down from 2020 due to lower interest rates related to our new debt agreements negotiated in the fourth quarter as well as the expectation for lower debt levels. The corporate expense line was $33 million in the fourth quarter, down from $37 million in 2019 and for the year, these expenses were $150 million. We currently expect our corporate expense to be in the $150 million range again in 2021.  
Our adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was 25.1%, an increase from 24.6% in the prior year period. For the year, our adjusted tax rate was 24.5% and in line with 2019. We are planning for a full year tax rate for 2021 in the range of 24.5% to 25.5%.  
Fourth quarter net income from continuing operations was $172 million with earnings per share of $1.18. Adjusted net income was $221 million or $1.52 per share, which compares to $186 million or $1.27 per share in 2019 or a 20% increase. For the full year, reported net income was $163 million or $1.13 per share, and adjusted net income was $765 million or $5.27 per share.  
So now let's discuss our fourth quarter results by segment. Our automotive revenue for the fourth quarter was $2.8 billion, up 1% from the prior year. Segment profit of $240 million was up 19%, with profit margin at 8.5% compared to a 7.2% margin in the fourth quarter of 2019. The 130 basis point increase in margin was driven by improved operating results across each of our automotive businesses for the second consecutive quarter. So an excellent job of operating by our automotive team, and we look forward to continue progress in 2021.  
Our industrial sales were $1.4 billion in the quarter, a 3.3% decrease from Q4 of 2019 and significantly improved from the sales declines in the second and third quarter. Segment profit of $133 million was up 5% from 1 year ago. And the profit margin was up 70 basis points to 9.3% compared to 8.6% last year. The improved margin for industrial reflects gains in both our North American and Australasian industrial businesses for the second consecutive quarter, so strong operating results for industrial, which we expect to continue in 2021.  
So now I will turn our comments to the balance sheet. We continue to closely manage our accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable to improve our working capital position. In the fourth quarter, we sold $300 million in receivables for a total of $800 million sold in 2020 under an accounts receivable sales agreement. Our total accounts receivable is down 36% from 2019, and we remain pleased with the quality of our receivables. Our inventory at December 31, 2020, was up 2% from the prior year and accounts payable increased 5%, improving our AP to inventory ratio to 118% in 2020 from 114% in 2019.  
We are pleased with the progress our team is making to strengthen our supply chain. And in 2020, these key accounts were a source of cash from operations, and our total working capital was 7% of revenues. We repaid $230 million of debt in the fourth quarter and our total debt of $2.7 billion at December 31, 2020, is down $749 million or 22% from the $3.4 billion in 2019. During the fourth quarter, we further improved our debt position with new public debt and a new revolving credit agreement that provided for expanded credit capacity and more favorable rates. We closed the year with $2.9 billion in available liquidity, which is up from $1.3 billion at December 31, 2019.  
Through our efforts in these and other areas, we generated a robust $2 billion in cash from operations in 2020, which is up from $833 million in 2019. Our free cash flow was $1.9 billion, an increase from $555 million in 2019. While we selectively scaled back our near-term plans for capital deployment in early April of 2020 to conserve cash through COVID-19, we were very committed to several key priorities for cash, which we believe serves to maximize shareholder value.  
Our key priorities include the reinvestment in our businesses via capital expenditures, M&A, share repurchases and the dividend. We have deployed $4.7 billion in capital across these areas over the last 4 years. In 2020, we reduced our original $300 million in CapEx plan by 50% and invested $154 million in essential capital expenditures, which was down from $278 million in 2019. For 2021, we expect to resume more normal levels of our reinvestments in our businesses and are planning for total capital expenditures in the range of $275 million to $325 million for the year.
We also pulled back on M&A activity in 2020, although strategic acquisitions remain an important component of our long-term growth strategy. In 2020, we used $69 million in cash to acquire several small businesses. And in 2021, we expect to make additional strategic bolt-on acquisitions to complement our global automotive and industrial segments. As a reminder, we have not considered any of these future acquisitions in our 2021 outlook.  
The company has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since going public in 1928. Earlier this week, our Board approved a $3.26 per share annual dividend for 2021, representing our 65th consecutive annual increase in the dividend. This represents a 3% increase from the $3.16 per share paid in 2020. In 2020, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of our common stock prior to suspending our share repurchases amid the pandemic. As of December 31, 2020, we were authorized to repurchase up to 14.5 million additional shares, and we expect to make additional opportunistic share repurchases again in 2021.  
Turning to our outlook for 2021, we are reinstating our practice of providing full year guidance. In arriving at our full year 2021 guidance, we considered several factors, including our past performance, current growth plans and strategic initiatives, recent business trends and the global economic outlook. In addition, we consider the continued uncertainty of COVID-19 and its potential impact on our results.  
With these factors in mind, we expect total sales for 2021 to be in the range of plus 4% to plus 6%. These growth rates assume a relatively neutral impact from foreign currency translation, minimal price inflation and as mentioned before, exclude the benefit of any unannounced future acquisitions. By business, we are guiding to plus 4% to plus 6% total sales growth for the automotive segment, including plus 3% to plus 5% comp sales growth. And a total sales increase of plus 3% to plus 5% for the industrial segment, including an increase in comp sales of plus 2% to plus 4%.  
On the earnings side, we currently expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.55 to $5.75. This represents a 5% to 9% increase compared to our adjusted diluted earnings per share in 2020.  
We move forward into 2021, confident in our strategic plans and initiatives to meet or exceed these targeted results and deliver value. In addition, we believe that the underlying industry fundamentals for our global automotive and industrial segments are favorable and will continue to provide us with sustained long-term growth opportunities. So that's our financial update, and we look forward to reporting on further improvement in our financial performance throughout 2021. 
Thank you, and I'll now turn it back over to Paul."

I'm really proud of our Western division and the job that group is doing. Our mountain team, as they have all year, had a solid quarter.

December is a bit unique, Bret. And if you remember, we had a big December 1 year ago, 2019. We were going up against some pretty tough comps. So that certainly impacted December as well. But look, here is a good news, Bret, for us and the NAPA team is, we had a really strong rebound in January, both DIY and DIFM, which we're really pleased to see the commercial business bouncing back in January.

But that would be the call out. There's a couple of other suppliers that are impacting us. And look, these guys are battling labor shortages due to COVID, some shortages of raw materials. So I understand they got their challenges, and we're hoping to see improvement here as we roll into '21."

And we expect to -- while some of those, certainly, the temporary savings come back in. When you look at our outlook for 2021 on SG&A, we have improvement when you go back to, say, the 2019 levels.

So converting them from temporary to permanent, and that's a daily activity that we work on with the teams here. But then obviously, very discrete productivity initiatives around the globe around SG&A, ranging from labor productivity in DCs, evaluating and analyzing indirect spend, low-cost country opportunities for back-office functions, et cetera.

The -- as we look at ticket comps and we look across the globe, I'm really pleased with the trends we're seeing in Australia. Our Asia Pac business was up strong in both average ticket size and traffic. Canada, we were up both average ticket size and traffic. U.S., our average ticket was up, which has been a trend we've seen for a number of quarters now. Traffic was down a bit in the U.S., again, not a surprise because we saw a real surge in our digital online, deliver to store, to -- pick up at curbside. So folks are still a little bit reticent, I think, to walk into stores.  
And then the other question, Mike, you asked was around DIY, DIFM in the quarter, in Q4. What we saw was much like we had seen throughout the year with -- or the latter part of the year, I should say, with DIY held up strong and DIFM was certainly pressured in the quarter. But again, as I think I mentioned earlier in a question, really pleased to see both trending up in January. So we're cautiously optimistic that we're going to see our DIFM return to solid growth in 2021."

Yes. I think if I were to point to perhaps some of the lift that we're seeing early in the year. Look, the weather is a factor. There's just no 2 ways about it. And we're seeing a return to a more normalized winter that we haven't seen in a few years. What's unfortunate, Beth, and we don't want to take -- we don't want to take this lightly. There are lots of folks out there in the Texas region that are without power. They've been without power for a couple of days. So we don't mind seeing winter. I just wish it wasn't quite as extreme and the impact that it's having.  
We've got a number of distribution centers, branches, stores, that are closed throughout Texas, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama. So it's definitely taken a toll here this week.

Look, we -- as you look at our cost savings, and again, this was done early on in response to the very drastic declines in volume that we saw from Europe starting at the end of Q1 to North America and other geographies, we had -- Q2 was one of our worst quarters ever in the company's history. And with that, there was actions that needed to be taken and it is related to reducing payroll, reducing positions. We had furloughs, we had deferred travel and entertainment. We looked at facility and lease reductions. We looked at our facility costs. We looked at -- I mean we looked at anything and everything. And it was -- again, we did that without impacting our service, but we did it to adjust to the lower volumes.  
And then as volumes have come back, we looked at those costs. Again, some of those costs had to come back in. During this time, we also didn't let up on our investments in productivity and automation. So we had a number of automation projects that we continue to work on that would help us with productivity improvements, where we rationalize facilities and put in more automated conveyor systems. That helped us as well.  
So again, we -- the permanent savings go back to a year ago. Those were largely payroll-related, the $150 million. Again, we were very comfortable to how those were done. The temporary ones were just that. They were temporary in nature. And remember, part of that temporary was government subsidies. So again, we had about $60 million in government subsidies that are nonrecurring. The fact of the matter is we go into 2021 with a lower overall cost base and excitement about the initiatives we have in place to keep our cost structure down."

And as these price increases come, that they will get passed through.  
Also on the industrial side, our teams are trying to stay ahead of that and doing a lot of things to make sure that those can -- when they do get the pricing, they can pass them along. I would tell you that will probably be more second half weighted. Again, some of this is managing through the uncertainty right now, but probably more second half weighted. So the 1% to 2%, 1% to 3%, if you will, is on a full year basis, but probably more second half. But again, that's not in any of our numbers.  
And the last thing I would just add, and you heard Will talk about it, our teams have so many terrific initiatives going on in the gross margin area, especially in terms of pricing.

We appreciate you joining us today and hope you're staying safe and well. We are pleased with the strong start to 2021 and ongoing recovery in our automotive and industrial businesses.
The GPC team remain focused on solid execution and in delivering strong financial results through improving sales trends, increasing operational efficiencies and enhancing customer value. Through the quarter, we operated thoughtfully with the physical and mental well-being of our employees, the top priority as our 50,000-plus GPC teammates are the core of our success.
Turning now to our first quarter financial results. Total sales for the quarter were $4.5 billion, up 9% from last year and significantly improved from the 1% sales decrease in the fourth quarter of 2020. Gross margins was also a positive, representing our 14th consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin expansion. And our teams in the field continue to do a great job of managing our expenses through ongoing cost actions and the carryover of expense reductions implemented last year. These results drove a 41% increase in operating profit and an 8.1% operating margin, which is up 180 basis points from the first quarter of last year.
Our strong operating performance drove net income of $218 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.50, up 88%. We also continued to fortify our balance sheet, ensuring ample liquidity and solid cash flow. We are proud of our teams, and we are encouraged by our results, and we intend to build on this momentum throughout 2021.
Turning now to our business segments. Automotive represented 66% of total sales in the first quarter, and industrial was 34%. By region, 73% of revenues were attributable to North America, with 16% in Europe and 11% in Asia Pac.
Total sales for global automotive were $3 billion, a 14% increase from 2020 and much improved from a 1% increase in Q4 of 2020. Comp sales were up 8%, improved from a 2% decrease in the fourth quarter, and segment profit margin was up 250 basis points, driven by strong operating results in each of our automotive operations.
Sales were driven by positive sales comps across all our operations, with 15% comps in Europe and Asia Pac, 7% comps in the U.S. and 3% comps in Canada. The ongoing global economic recovery, including financial stimulus in the U.S. improving inventory availability, favorable weather conditions and our focus on key growth initiatives were all sales drivers in the quarter. We would add that while we continue to expect a reasonable level of inflation as we move through 2021, price inflation was not a factor in our first quarter sales.
In Europe, sales were much improved from Q4 as our team capitalized on the strengthening sales environment despite lockdowns throughout the region. In addition, initiatives to grow key accounts enhance inventory availability and the ongoing launch of the NAPA brand continue to prove effective in driving profitable growth and market share gains. For the quarter, our teams in France and the U.K. outperformed in the region with strong double-digit sales comps. We would also call out a much improved performance by our team in the Benelux region. The strong sales recovery, combined with excellent expense controls, produced a 500 basis point improvement in operating margin, so a terrific start to the year for our European operations.
In Asia Pac, our automotive sales remained in line with the mid-teens growth we experienced through the second half of 2020. For the quarter, both retail and commercial sales held strong as the region operated through multiple lockdowns associated with the pandemic.
Retail sales, which represent over 40% of our total sales volume through our Repco stores continue to outperform, posting a 33% increase in March and plus 24% in the quarter.
Our commercial sales continue to accelerate as well, posting double-digit sales growth in the quarter. We continue to benefit from the strength in online sales, which reached record highs at 3x pre-COVID levels. Finally, building on the NAPA brand name has been well received, and we remain focused on growing our NAPA presence in the region.
Summing it up, this group continues to perform at a very high level on both the top and bottom lines, resulting in 150 basis point improvement and profit margin for the quarter. In North America, comp sales in the U.S. were up 7%, helping this business post a 180 basis point increase in profit margins.
In Canada, we operated through a variety of regional lockdowns, which impacted our larger markets of Ontario and Québec. Comp sales were up 3% and operating margin was up 130 basis points.
Sales in the U.S., which posted its strongest quarterly comp since the first quarter of 2015 were driven by solid growth in both the retail and commercial segments. This was our first quarter of positive commercial comps since pre-pandemic, and our team produced record sales volumes in the month of March. In addition, both ticket and traffic counts were positive on both our retail and commercial transactions, marking our first increase in traffic counts in several quarters.
By region, the Atlantic, Midwest and West groups posted the strongest growth, although we would also call out our Northeast group, which produced solid growth in the quarter. This is notable that this region of the U.S. has been most affected by the COVID-19 lockdowns over the past 13 months. Likewise, we would add that product sales in categories such as batteries, tools and equipment and brakes were strong this quarter. We are especially encouraged to see the rebound in our brakes business, which generally is a positive indicator for our commercial business.
On the retail side, which continues to outperform with strong double-digit growth. We continued to drive sales via investments in retail specialists and store refreshes as well as targeted promotions. We would also call out our ongoing omnichannel investments and the increase in B2C online sales, which reached record levels in the quarter and were up 150% from the prior year.
For commercial sales, our other wholesale category of independent garage customers continued to generate strong growth. We have been encouraged by the number of new accounts we are serving. Clearly, our investments in increasing the number of professional salespeople on the Street has been effective in attracting new customers to NAPA.
We were also pleased to see improved sales with our NAPA Auto Care and major account customers, which posted positive sales growth for the first time in several quarters. Sales to the fleet and government group were down year-over-year, but sequentially improved from the fourth quarter. And we look for further improvement in sales to this segment.
As we look ahead, we are excited for the growth opportunities we see for our global automotive segment. We expect further improvement in aftermarket fundamentals such as increased miles driven, a growing vehicle fleet and an increase in vehicles age 6 to 12 years, all favorable for the industry. We can assure you we remain focused on our initiative to deliver customer value and ultimately, sell more parts for more cars. These plans include further enhancing our inventory availability, strengthening our supply chain, and investing in our omnichannel capabilities. In addition, we expect to expand our global store footprint with additional bolt-on acquisitions, changeovers and new greenfield stores to further enhance our competitive positioning.
So now let's discuss the global industrial parts group. Total sales for this group were $1.5 billion, flat with last year. Comp sales were down 2%, improved from a 4% decrease in Q4 and reflecting the third consecutive quarter of improving sales trends. March was a breakout month with the North American motion team, posting a 7% increase in average daily sales and achieving record sales volumes. This was a tremendous accomplishment and another turning point for GPC and our emergence from the pandemic.
The ongoing recovery over the last 9 months is in line with the continued improvement in the industrial economy, which you can see in several key indicators for our business. For perspective, PMI was 64.7% in March, an increase of 4.2 points from December 31. In addition, industrial production increased by 2.5% in the first quarter, the third consecutive quarter of expansion following the significant downturn in the second quarter of 2020.
Importantly, we can see these positive indicators translating to more activity with our customers, which are operating at higher run rates as well as releasing capital project orders. The strengthening sales environment, along with our initiatives to drive growth and control cost, produced an 80 basis point margin improvement with segment profit margin at 8.3% versus 7.5% last year.
Diving deeper into our Q1 sales, we would start by saying that inflation remains a nonfactor in our numbers thus far. That said, we are seeing more pricing activity and expect another year of 1% to 2% price inflation from our suppliers. For the quarter, we experienced improving sales trend among virtually all product categories and industries third.
We were especially encouraged by the recovery in the equipment and machinery aggregate and cement and wood and lumber sectors, all key industry groups for us. In addition, we continue to benefit from the build-out of our omnichannel capabilities, with digital sales up 2x from the first quarter in 2020. A key driver of our digital growth relates to our inside sales center, which is generating incremental sales to new motion customers. While still a relatively small percentage of total sales, we are excited about the potential for future sales growth.
We also remain focused on growing our services and solutions businesses to expand our expertise and sales opportunities in areas such as equipment repair, conveyance and automation. We have made several bolt-on acquisitions to build scale in these areas, and our services and solutions capabilities remain a key consideration in our overall M&A strategy for the industrial business.
To further ensure profitable sales growth, we continue to enhance our pricing and category management strategies. In addition, we plan to continue to optimize our supply chain network and further improve our productivity while delivering exceptional customer service.
Closing out our industrial comments. We remain bullish about our motion business, and we are excited to see this team moving back into a growth mode.
So now I'll conclude my remarks by providing a brief update on our ESG initiatives. As outlined in our corporate sustainability report, GPC embraces our responsibility to innovate in ways that provide for our environment, our associates and the communities in which we operate. In Q1, we expanded our training and development programs to ensure personal growth and enhance our comprehensive well-being program focused on the emotional, financial and physical health of our GPC teammates.
Additionally, we continue to make progress in the advancement of our corporate commitment to diversity and inclusion. We are actively recruiting talent that is representative of the communities we serve, training our teammates to mitigate unconscious bias and model inclusive behaviors while strengthening partnerships that support our D&I initiatives.
Finally, we remain focused on our mission to be good corporate citizens, where we both work and live. Since 1928, we have been giving back to communities and causes that make a difference, and that legacy continues in 2021.
So now I'll turn it over to Will for his remarks. Will?"

First, I want to congratulate the global GPC team on the performance this quarter. I'd also like to thank our customers for their loyalty and our suppliers for their partnership.As Paul mentioned, our team delive",1105,"Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. First, I want to congratulate the global GPC team on the performance this quarter. I'd also like to thank our customers for their loyalty and our suppliers for their partnership.
As Paul mentioned, our team delivered solid performance in the first quarter and had strong momentum. The environment has improved compared to 2020, but we remain cautious as global uncertainty continues to be a part of doing business each day. Areas of attention for us include COVID-19, inflation, global logistics and product and labor availability. We also have more challenging year-over-year comparisons that will require sustained momentum during the second half of the year. Despite the uncertainty, the GPC team is energized and focused to deliver performance.
I'll now share some additional perspective on our strategic initiatives in progress. The foundation of our priorities is based on the customer experience and understanding their needs and working to exceed their expectations. We are analyzing and listening to customer feedback and our corresponding strength and opportunities. In the simplest terms, our customers need us to be easy to do business with, reliable and helpful. This independent data reinforces our priorities and serves as a guiding principle in terms of required action and strategic investments.
To deliver a best-in-class customer experience, we have opportunities to simplify and integrate our existing operations. The global teams are executing multiyear plans to realign teams, streamline processes, improve operational productivity and reduce costs. These initiatives will not only create operating efficiency but also enable faster team executions, deliver a better customer experience and accelerate profitable growth. I'd like to highlight a few initiatives that illustrate our efforts to simplify and integrate. For example, we're working to optimize facilities footprint and coverage, simplify and integrate disparate legacy IT systems, streamlined back-office support functions, offshore noncustomer-facing functional activities and centralized GPC indirect sourcing processes as a few examples.
As we simplify and integrate, we're simultaneously investing in our core business and positioning for the future. Our strong cash flow, solid capital structure and disciplined capital allocation provide the flexibility needed to continue to make these investments. Key pillars of our core investments include talent, sales force effectiveness, digital, supply chain and emerging vehicle technologies.
A few highlights of our progress across the key pillars during the quarter include: 1, talent. We continue to take deliberate action across the globe to recognize high potential talent, infuse new capabilities into the organization and recruit diverse talent that is representative of the communities we serve. Examples include category management, digital, emerging vehicle technology and field leadership roles to name a few. Talent will always be a priority area of investment as we strive to be an employer of choice for teammates that share our DPC values and want to play a leadership role in our exciting future; 2, sales force effectiveness. Data and analytics to understand our unique customer segments, the different needs of each segment, and associated strategies to serve the segment is a foundational element of sales force effectiveness. The sales efforts reflect our omnichannel initiatives and include an increasing mix of both traditional selling and digital strategies. As an example, the U.S. automotive team revamped its sales intensity with new reporting and tools to track customer visits, digital tools to communicate with field sales teammates and enhanced virtual product and skills training. In addition, in 2021, the U.S. automotive team adjusted compensation programs to better align incentives with profitable growth; 3, digital. As I mentioned, digital is a foundational priority as we deliver a best-in-class customer experience and accelerate profitable growth. Our businesses delivered excellent performance via digital channels in the quarter. We continue to see strong increases versus prior year across our global digital channels. Digital still represents a relatively small portion of our total sales, and we're excited about the compelling digital vision our teams are executing. Related, we continue to invest in foundational digital elements, including catalog, search and other critical customer experience elements such as ease of ordering, pricing and analytics; 4, supply chain our supply chain initiatives are focused to ensure we have the right product available in the right market at the right time. We're continuously executing inventory, facility, productivity, logistics and technology strategies to achieve this goal. One solid example is the success the U.S. industrial team enjoyed with recent facility automation investments that delivered a 500% labor productivity improvement. Other select examples would be enhanced workforce management and delivery tracking tools in the U.S. automotive business; lastly, emerging vehicle technologies. We aspire to lead as it relates to the opportunities that emerging vehicle technologies present for our automotive industries. We believe we have a unique position to leverage, including our scaled global footprint, diverse portfolio, leading global brands, established customer supplier relationships and 1 GPC team approach. Through our planning process, we developed a multidimensional strategy to address electric vehicle trends. A few select highlights include: the alignment of talent 100% dedicated to developing and executing EV strategies, product and category management strategies with existing and new SKUs, global supplier councils with existing strategic partners, advisory groups leveraging our 25,000 global repair center relationships and partnerships with strategic EV market participants. While we acknowledge the focus on critical initiatives that deliver near and medium term performance, we're taking action to build out and act on an exciting future vision.
Lastly, strategic bolt-on acquisitions are a key part of our GPC growth strategy. We utilize acquisitions to acquire new customers, further penetrate existing priority markets and our new geographies, acquire product and service capabilities and acquire talent. We also believe our acquisition capabilities position us well as we selectively consider and test new business models. Our acquisition pipeline remains active and actionable given the fragmentation of our markets. We believe our scale, market-leading brands, global footprint and unique culture position us to be an acquirer of choice. We will remain selective and disciplined as we execute this important part of our strategy.
Similar to the approach utilized for our 2019 cost savings plan, the global teams developed tools in a monthly cadence to create visibility and status on initiatives. This approach not only helps drive performance, but also helps to share best practices around the globe as 1 GPC team.
In summary, I hope today's remarks reinforce our sense of focus and global teamwork. We will remain agile as the global environment continues to evolve, and we will remain focused on what we can control as we execute through the balance of the year and beyond. Thank you, and I'll now turn it to Carol to review the financial performance details."
275034,708698509,2255517,"Genuine Parts Company, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2021",2021-04-22,"Earnings Calls","Genuine Parts Company","Executives","Thank you, Will. We will begin with a review of our key financial information, and then we will provide an update on our full year outlook for 2021. Total GPC sales were $4.5 billion in the first quarter, up 9% from last year and improved from the 0.7% de",1647,"Thank you, Will. We will begin with a review of our key financial information, and then we will provide an update on our full year outlook for 2021. Total GPC sales were $4.5 billion in the first quarter, up 9% from last year and improved from the 0.7% decrease in the fourth quarter. Gross margin was 34.5%, a 60 basis point improvement compared to 33.9% in the first quarter last year. Our steady progress in improving gross margin continues to reflect the positive impact of a number of initiatives, including our pricing and global sourcing strategies, and we also benefited from a sales mix shift to higher gross margin operations. We would add that the level of supplier incentives in the quarter were in line with last year and neutral to gross margin. And as Paul mentioned earlier, there was minimal impact of price inflation in our first quarter sales, and this is true for gross margin as well.
As we move through the year, we will continue to execute on our initiatives to drive additional gross margin gains via positive product mix shift, strategic pricing tools and analytics global sourcing advantages and also strategic category management initiatives. Our selling, administrative and other expenses were $1.2 billion in the first quarter, up 4.6% from last year or up 5.3% from last year's adjusted SG&A. This reflects an improvement to 26.8% of sales this year, which is down nearly 100 basis points from 27.7% last year. So tremendous progress and primarily due to the favorable impact of our cost savings generated in 2020 as well as ongoing cost control measures and also improved leverage on our stronger sales growth. Our progress in these areas was slightly offset by rising costs in freight expenses, which we're closely managing and planned increases in our technology spend, which supports our strategic initiatives, as Will covered earlier.
Our total operating and nonoperating expenses were $1.3 billion in the first quarter, up 2.2% from last year or up 2.1% compared to last year's adjusted expenses. First quarter expenses include the benefit of approximately $20 million related to gains on the sale of real estate and favorable retirement plan valuation adjustments that are recorded to the other nonoperating income line.
All in, our total expenses for the quarter improved to 28.1% of sales, down 190 basis points from 30.0% in 2020. Total segment profit in the first quarter was $361 million, up a strong 41% on the 9% sales increase, and our segment profit margin was 8.1% compared to 6.3% last year, a 180 basis point increase. In comparison to 2019, our segment profit margin has improved by 100 basis points. So solid improvement and our strongest first quarter profit margin since 2015, a reflection of the positive momentum we're building in our businesses.
Our net interest expense of $18 million was down from $20 million in 2020 due to the decrease in total debt and more favorable interest rates relative to last year. The corporate expense line was $31 million in the quarter, down from $55 million in 2020 due primarily to the favorable real estate gains and retirement plan adjustment discussed earlier. Our tax rate for the first quarter was 23.8%, in line with the reported rate last year and improved from the prior year adjusted rate of 26.5%. This improvement primarily relates to the favorable tax impact of stock options exercise as well as the previously mentioned real estate gains and retirement plan adjustments.
Our first quarter net income from continuing operations was $218 million, with diluted earnings per share of $1.50. This compares to $0.84 per diluted share in the prior year or an adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.80 for an 88% increase.
So now let's turn to our first quarter results by segment. Our automotive revenue for the first quarter was $3 billion, up 14% from the prior year. Segment profit of $236 million was up a strong 65% with profit margin at 8.0% compared to 5.5% margin in the first quarter last year. The 250 basis point increase in margin was driven by the continued recovery in the automotive business and the execution of our growth and operating initiatives. We were pleased to have each of our automotive businesses expand their margins for the third consecutive quarter.
In addition, we're encouraged that our first quarter margin also compares favorably to the first quarter of 2019, up 120 basis points. So a broad recovery across our operations, and we look for continued progress in the quarters ahead.
Our industrial sales were $1.5 billion in the quarter, flat with last year, and improved sequentially for the third consecutive quarter, which is consistent with the strengthening industrial economy. Our segment profit of $125 million was up 10% from a year ago, and profit margin was up 80 basis points to 8.3% compared to 7.5% last year.
The improved margin for industrial reflects the third consecutive quarter of margin expansion in both our North American and Australasian Industrial businesses, and it's also up by 90 basis points from the first quarter of 2019. So another quarter of strong operating results for industrial, which we expect to continue with stronger sales growth projected through the remainder of the year.
So now let's turn our comments to the balance sheet. We continue to operate with a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity and the financial strength to support our growth strategy. At March 31, total accounts receivable is down 27% from last year, which is primarily a function of the $800 million in receivables sold in 2020. Our inventory was up 6% from the prior year, and accounts payable increased 14%, and our AP to inventory ratio improved to 124% from 116% in the last year. We are pleased with our progress in improving our overall working capital position, and we continue to believe we have opportunities for further improvement.
Our total debt is $2.6 billion at March 31, down $1 billion or 28% from last March and down $60 million from December 31, 2020. We significantly improved our debt position throughout the course of 2020 with the issuance of new public debt and a new revolving credit agreement that provides for expanded credit capacity and more favorable rates. With these positive changes to our debt structure, our total debt to adjusted EBITDA has improved to 1.8x from 2.5x last year. Additionally, we closed the first quarter with $2.6 billion in available liquidity, which is up from $1.1 billion at March 31 last year and in line with December 31.
We also continue to generate strong cash flow, generating $300 million in cash from operations in the first quarter, which is up from $28 million in the first quarter last year. With a strong start to the year, including the increase in net income and the improvement in working capital, we continue to expect cash from operations to be in the $1 billion to $1.2 billion range, and free cash flow of $700 million to $900 million.
Our key priorities for cash include the reinvestment in our businesses through capital expenditures, M&A, the dividend and share repurchases. We invested $48 million in capital expenditures in the first quarter, an increase from $39 million in 2020. Looking forward, we have plans for additional investments in our businesses to drive growth and improve efficiencies and productivity. We continue to expect total capital expenditures of approximately $300 million for the year.
As you heard from Will earlier, strategic acquisitions remain an important component of our long-term growth strategy. We continue to cultivate a strong pipeline of targeted names, and we expect to make additional strategic bolt-on acquisitions to complement both our global automotive and industrial segments in the months and quarters ahead.
In the first quarter, we paid a cash dividend of $114 million to our shareholders. The company has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since going public in 1928, and our 2021 dividend of $3.26 per share represents our 65th consecutive annual increase in the dividend.
We have actively participated in a share repurchase program since 1994. While there were no repurchases in the first quarter, the company is currently authorized to repurchase up to 14.5 million additional shares, and we will resume share repurchases in the months and quarters ahead.
Turning to our outlook for 2021. We are updating our full year guidance previously provided in our earnings release on February 17, 2021. In arriving at our updated guidance, we considered several factors, including our past performance, current growth plans and strategic initiatives, recent business trends, the potential for foreign currency fluctuations, inflation and the global economic outlook. In addition, we consider the continued uncertainties due to market disruptions such as with COVID-19 and its potential impact on our results.
With these factors in mind, we expect total sales for 2021 to be in the range of plus 5% to plus 7%, an increase from our previous guidance of plus 4% to plus 6%. As usual, these growth rates exclude the benefit of any unannounced future acquisitions. By business, we are guiding to plus 5% to plus 7% total sales growth for the Automotive segment an increase from plus 4% to plus 6% and a total sales increase of plus 4% to plus 6% for the industrial segment, an increase from plus 3% to plus 5%.
On the earnings side, we are raising our guidance for diluted earnings per share to a range of $5.85 to $6.05, which is up 11% to 15% from 2020. This represents an increase from our previous guidance of $5.55 to $5.75. We enter the second quarter focused on our initiatives to meet or exceed these targeted results and we look forward to reporting on our financial performance as we go through the year.
Thank you, and I'll now turn it back over to Paul."

In terms of the breakdown fleet, fleet did come back in Q1, which I think we referenced that in our last call, we did see an improvement.

What we were really encouraged by is seeing our both major accounts and NAPA AutoCare center business turn positive, both close to mid single-digit growth in those categories.
So yes, we really saw improvements across the board and are especially encouraged to see our heavy-duty fleet business government municipalities turning to a positive in Q2.
And as far as regionality, Kate, I think I called out our northern regions. I would also call out -- in that mix, it includes our Atlantic division. Our Atlantic division really led the way in Q1 for us. And Atlantic comes down to the Carolinas, Virginia. So that is close to the south.

And what I think I'm most encouraged by, Scot, is we had this kind of quarter despite still being in COVID related lockdowns in many parts of the world.

We appreciate you joining us today and hope you're staying safe and well. We are pleased with the strong start to 2021 and ongoing recovery in our automotive and industrial businesses. 
The GPC team remain focused on solid execution and in delivering strong financial results through improving sales trends, increasing operational efficiencies and enhancing customer value. Through the quarter, we operated thoughtfully, with the physical and mental well-being of our employees the top priority as our 50,000-plus GPC teammates are the core of our success. 
Turning now to our first quarter financial results. Total sales for the quarter were $4.5 billion, up 9% from last year, and significantly improved from the 1% sales decrease in the fourth quarter of 2020. Gross margins was also a positive, representing our 14th consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin expansion. And our teams in the field continue to do a great job of managing our expenses through ongoing cost actions and the carryover of expense reductions implemented last year. These results drove a 41% increase in operating profit and an 8.1% operating margin, which is up 180 basis points from the first quarter of last year. 
Our strong operating performance drove net income of $218 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.50, up 88%. We also continued to fortify our balance sheet, ensuring ample liquidity and solid cash flow. We are proud of our teams, and we are encouraged by our results, and we intend to build on this momentum throughout 2021. 
Turning now to our business segments. Automotive represented 66% of total sales in the first quarter, and industrial was 34%. By region, 73% of revenues were attributable to North America, with 16% in Europe and 11% in Asia Pac. 
Total sales for global automotive were $3 billion, a 14% increase from 2020 and much improved from a 1% increase in Q4 of 2020. Comp sales were up 8%, improved from a 2% decrease in the fourth quarter, and segment profit margin was up 250 basis points, driven by strong operating results in each of our automotive operations. 
Sales were driven by positive sales comps across all our operations, with 15% comps in Europe and Asia Pac, 7% comps in the U.S. and 3% comps in Canada. The ongoing global economic recovery, including financial stimulus in the U.S., improving inventory availability, favorable weather conditions and our focus on key growth initiatives were all sales drivers in the quarter. We would add that while we continue to expect a reasonable level of inflation as we move through 2021, price inflation was not a factor in our first quarter sales. 
In Europe, sales were much improved from Q4 as our team capitalized on the strengthening sales environment despite lockdowns throughout the region. In addition, initiatives to grow key accounts enhance inventory availability and the ongoing launch of the NAPA brand continue to prove effective in driving profitable growth and market share gains. For the quarter, our teams in France and the U.K. outperformed in the region with strong double-digit sales comps. We would also call out a much improved performance by our team in the Benelux region. The strong sales recovery, combined with excellent expense controls, produced a 500 basis point improvement in operating margin, so a terrific start to the year for our European operations. 
In Asia Pac, our automotive sales remained in line with the mid-teens growth we experienced through the second half of 2020. For the quarter, both retail and commercial sales held strong as the region operated through multiple lockdowns associated with the pandemic. Retail sales, which represent over 40% of our total sales volume through our Repco stores continue to outperform, posting a 33% increase in March and plus-24% in the quarter. 
Our commercial sales continue to accelerate as well, posting double-digit sales growth in the quarter. We continue to benefit from the strength in online sales, which reached record highs at 3x pre-COVID levels. Finally, building on the NAPA brand name has been well received, and we remain focused on growing our NAPA presence in the region. 
Summing it up, this group continues to perform at a very high level on both the top and bottom lines, resulting in 150 basis point improvement and profit margin for the quarter. In North America, comp sales in the U.S. were up 7%, helping this business post a 180 basis point increase in profit margins. In Canada, we operated through a variety of regional lockdowns, which impacted our larger markets of Ontario and Québec. Comp sales were up 3% and operating margin was up 130 basis points. 
Sales in the U.S., which posted its strongest quarterly comp since the first quarter of 2015, were driven by solid growth in both the retail and commercial segments. This was our first quarter of positive commercial comps since pre-pandemic, and our team produced record sales volumes in the month of March. In addition, both ticket and traffic counts were positive on both our retail and commercial transactions, marking our first increase in traffic counts in several quarters. 
By region, the Atlantic, Midwest and West groups posted the strongest growth, although we would also call out our Northeast group, which produced solid growth in the quarter. This is notable that this region of the U.S. has been most affected by the COVID-19 lockdowns over the past 13 months. Likewise, we would add that product sales in categories such as batteries, tools and equipment and brakes were strong this quarter. We are especially encouraged to see the rebound in our brakes business, which generally is a positive indicator for our commercial business. 
On the retail side, which continues to outperform with strong double-digit growth, we continue to drive sales via investments in retail specialists and store refreshes as well as targeted promotions. We would also call out our ongoing omnichannel investments and the increase in B2C online sales, which reached record levels in the quarter and were up 150% from the prior year. 
For commercial sales, our other wholesale category of independent garage customers, continued to generate strong growth. We have been encouraged by the number of new accounts we are serving. Clearly, our investments in increasing the number of professional salespeople on the Street has been effective in attracting new customers to NAPA. 
We were also pleased to see improved sales with our NAPA Auto Care and major account customers, which posted positive sales growth for the first time in several quarters. Sales to the fleet and government group were down year-over-year, but sequentially improved from the fourth quarter. And we look for further improvement in sales to this segment. 
As we look ahead, we are excited for the growth opportunities we see for our global automotive segment. We expect further improvement in aftermarket fundamentals such as increased miles driven, a growing vehicle fleet and an increase in vehicles age 6 to 12 years, all favorable for the industry. We can assure you we remain focused on our initiative to deliver customer value and ultimately, sell more parts for more cars. These plans include further enhancing our inventory availability, strengthening our supply chain, and investing in our omnichannel capabilities. In addition, we expect to expand our global store footprint with additional bolt-on acquisitions, changeovers and new greenfield stores to further enhance our competitive positioning. 
So now let's discuss the global Industrial Parts Group. Total sales for this group were $1.5 billion, flat with last year. Comp sales were down 2%, improved from a 4% decrease in Q4 and reflecting the third consecutive quarter of improving sales trends. March was a breakout month with the North American Motion team posting a 7% increase in average daily sales and achieving record sales volumes. This was a tremendous accomplishment and another turning point for GPC and our emergence from the pandemic. 
The ongoing recovery over the last 9 months is in line with the continued improvement in the industrial economy, which you can see in several key indicators for our business. For perspective, PMI was 64.7% in March, an increase of 4.2 points from December 31. In addition, industrial production increased by 2.5% in the first quarter, the third consecutive quarter of expansion following the significant downturn in the second quarter of 2020. 
Importantly, we can see these positive indicators translating to more activity with our customers, which are operating at higher run rates as well as releasing capital project orders. The strengthening sales environment, along with our initiatives to drive growth and control cost, produced an 80 basis point margin improvement with segment profit margin at 8.3% versus 7.5% last year. 
Diving deeper into our Q1 sales, we would start by saying that inflation remains a nonfactor in our numbers thus far. That said, we are seeing more pricing activity and expect another year of 1% to 2% price inflation from our suppliers. For the quarter, we experienced improving sales trend among virtually all product categories and industries third. We were especially encouraged by the recovery in the equipment and machinery, aggregate and cement, and wood and lumber sectors, all key industry groups for us. 
In addition, we continue to benefit from the build-out of our omnichannel capabilities, with digital sales up 2x from the first quarter in 2020. A key driver of our digital growth relates to our inside sales center, which is generating incremental sales to new Motion customers. While still a relatively small percentage of total sales, we are excited by the potential for future sales growth. 
We also remain focused on growing our services and solution businesses to expand our expertise and sales opportunities in areas such as equipment repair, conveyance and automation. We have made several bolt-on acquisitions to build scale in these areas, and our services and solutions capabilities remain a key consideration in our overall M&A strategy for the industrial business. 
To further ensure profitable sales growth, we continue to enhance our pricing and category management strategies. In addition, we plan to continue to optimize our supply chain network and further improve our productivity while delivering exceptional customer service. 
Closing out our industrial comments. We remain bullish about our Motion business, and we are excited to see this team moving back into a growth mode. 
So now I'll conclude my remarks by providing a brief update on our ESG initiatives. As outlined in our corporate sustainability report, GPC embraces our responsibility to innovate in ways that provide for our environment, our associates and the communities in which we operate. In Q1, we expanded our training and development programs to ensure personal growth and enhance our comprehensive well-being program focused on the emotional, financial and physical health of our GPC teammates. Additionally, we continue to make progress in the advancement of our corporate commitment to diversity and inclusion. We are actively recruiting talent that is representative of the communities we serve, training our teammates to mitigate unconscious bias and model inclusive behaviors while strengthening partnerships that support our D&I initiatives. 
Finally, we remain focused on our mission to be good corporate citizens where we both work and live. Since 1928, we have been giving back to communities and causes that make a difference, and that legacy continues in 2021. 
So now, I'll turn it over to Will for his remarks. Will?"

As Paul mentioned, our team deliver",1104,"Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. First, I want to congratulate the global GPC team on the performance this quarter. I'd also like to thank our customers for their loyalty and our suppliers for their partnership. As Paul mentioned, our team delivered solid performance in the first quarter and had strong momentum. The environment has improved compared to 2020, but we remain cautious as global uncertainty continues to be a part of doing business each day. Areas of attention for us include COVID-19, inflation, global logistics and product and labor availability. We also have more challenging year-over-year comparisons that will require sustained momentum during the second half of the year. Despite the uncertainty, the GPC team is energized and focused to deliver performance. 
I'll now share some additional perspective on our strategic initiatives in progress. The foundation of our priorities is based on the customer experience and understanding their needs and working to exceed their expectations. We are analyzing and listening to customer feedback and our corresponding strength and opportunities. In the simplest terms, our customers need us to be easy to do business with, reliable and helpful. This independent data reinforces our priorities and serves as a guiding principle in terms of required action and strategic investments. 
To deliver a best-in-class customer experience, we have opportunities to simplify and integrate our existing operations. The global teams are executing multiyear plans to realign teams, streamline processes, improve operational productivity and reduce costs. These initiatives will not only create operating efficiency but also enable faster team executions, deliver a better customer experience and accelerate profitable growth. I'd like to highlight a few initiatives that illustrate our efforts to simplify and integrate. 
For example, we're working to optimize facilities footprint and coverage, simplify and integrate disparate legacy IT systems, streamline back-office support functions, offshore noncustomer-facing functional activities and centralized GPC indirect sourcing processes as a few examples. As we simplify and integrate, we're simultaneously investing in our core business and positioning for the future. Our strong cash flow, solid capital structure and disciplined capital allocation provide the flexibility needed to continue to make these investments. Key pillars of our core investments include talent, sales force effectiveness, digital, supply chain and emerging vehicle technologies. 
A few highlights of our progress across the key pillars during the quarter include: one, talent. 
We continue to take deliberate action across the globe to recognize high-potential talent, infuse new capabilities into the organization and recruit diverse talent that is representative of the communities we serve. Examples include category management, digital, emerging vehicle technology and field leadership roles to name a few. Talent will always be a priority area of investment as we strive to be an employer of choice for teammates that share our DPC values and want to play a leadership role in our exciting future. 
Two, sales force effectiveness. Data and analytics to understand our unique customer segments, the different needs of each segment, and associated strategies to serve the segment is a foundational element of sales force effectiveness. The sales efforts reflect our omnichannel initiatives and include an increasing mix of both traditional selling and digital strategies. As an example, the U.S. automotive team revamped its sales intensity with new reporting and tools to track customer visits, digital tools to communicate with field sales teammates and enhanced virtual product and skills training. In addition, in 2021, the U.S. automotive team adjusted compensation programs to better align incentives with profitable growth. 
Three, digital. As I mentioned, digital is a foundational priority as we deliver a best-in-class customer experience and accelerate profitable growth. Our businesses delivered excellent performance via digital channels in the quarter. We continue to see strong increases versus prior year across our global digital channels. Digital still represents a relatively small portion of our total sales, and we're excited about the compelling digital vision our teams are executing. Related, we continue to invest in foundational digital elements, including catalog, search and other critical customer experience elements such as ease of ordering, pricing and analytics. 
Four, supply chain. Our supply chain initiatives are focused to ensure we have the right product available in the right market at the right time. We're continuously executing inventory, facility, productivity, logistics and technology strategies to achieve this goal. One solid example is the success the U.S. industrial team enjoyed with recent facility automation investments that delivered a 500% labor productivity improvement. Other select examples would be enhanced workforce management and delivery tracking tools in the U.S. automotive business. 
Lastly, emerging vehicle technologies. We aspire to lead as it relates to the opportunities that emerging vehicle technologies present for our automotive industries. We believe we have a unique position to leverage, including our scaled global footprint, diverse portfolio, leading global brands, established customer supplier relationships and One  GPC team approach. Through our planning process, we developed a multidimensional strategy to address electric vehicle trends. A few select highlights include: the alignment of talent 100% dedicated to developing and executing EV strategies, product and category management strategies with existing and new SKUs, global supplier councils with existing strategic partners, advisory groups leveraging our 25,000 global repair center relationships and partnerships with strategic EV market participants. While we acknowledge the focus on critical initiatives that deliver near and medium term performance, we're taking action to build out and act on an exciting future vision. 
Lastly, strategic bolt-on acquisitions are a key part of our GPC growth strategy. We utilize acquisitions to acquire new customers, further penetrate existing priority markets and our new geographies, acquire product and service capabilities and acquire talent. We also believe our acquisition capabilities position us well as we selectively consider and test new business models. Our acquisition pipeline remains active and actionable given the fragmentation of our markets. We believe our scale, market-leading brands, global footprint and unique culture position us to be an acquirer of choice. We will remain selective and disciplined as we execute this important part of our strategy. 
Similar to the approach utilized for our 2019 cost savings plan, the global teams developed tools in a monthly cadence to create visibility and status on initiatives. This approach not only helps drive performance, but also helps to share best practices around the globe as One GPC team. 
In summary, I hope today's remarks reinforce our sense of focus and global teamwork. We will remain agile as the global environment continues to evolve, and we will remain focused on what we can control as we execute through the balance of the year and beyond. 
Thank you, and I'll now turn it to Carol to review the financial performance details."
275034,708698509,2255717,"Genuine Parts Company, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2021",2021-04-22,"Earnings Calls","Genuine Parts Company","Executives","Thank you, Will. We will begin with a review of our key financial information, and then we will provide an update on our full year outlook for 2021. Total GPC sales were $4.5 billion in the first quarter, up 9% from last year and improved from the 0.7%",1635,"Thank you, Will. We will begin with a review of our key financial information, and then we will provide an update on our full year outlook for 2021. 
Total GPC sales were $4.5 billion in the first quarter, up 9% from last year and improved from the 0.7% decrease in the fourth quarter. Gross margin was 34.5%, a 60 basis point improvement compared to 33.9% in the first quarter last year. Our steady progress and improving gross margin continues to reflect the positive impact of a number of initiatives, including our pricing and global sourcing strategies, and we also benefited from a sales mix shift to higher gross margin operations. We would add that the level of supplier incentives in the quarter were in line with last year and neutral to gross margin. And as Paul mentioned earlier, there was minimal impact of price inflation in our first quarter sales, and this is true for gross margin as well. 
As we move through the year, we will continue to execute on our initiatives to drive additional gross margin gains via positive product mix shift, strategic pricing tools and analytics, global sourcing advantages and also strategic category management initiatives. Our selling, administrative and other expenses were $1.2 billion in the first quarter, up 4.6% from last year or up 5.3% from last year's adjusted SG&A. This reflects an improvement to 26.8% of sales this year, which is down nearly 100 basis points from 27.7% last year. So tremendous progress and primarily due to the favorable impact of our cost savings generated in 2020 as well as ongoing cost control measures and also improved leverage on our stronger sales growth. Our progress in these areas was slightly offset by rising costs in freight expenses, which we're closely managing; and planned increases in our technology spend, which supports our strategic initiatives, as Will covered earlier. 
Our total operating and nonoperating expenses were $1.3 billion in the first quarter, up 2.2% from last year or up 2.1% compared to last year's adjusted expenses. First quarter expenses include the benefit of approximately $20 million related to gains on the sale of real estate and favorable retirement plan valuation adjustments that are reported to the other nonoperating income line. All in, our total expenses for the quarter improved to 28.1% of sales, down 190 basis points from 30.0% in 2020. 
Total segment profit in the first quarter was $361 million, up a strong 41% on the 9% sales increase, and our segment profit margin was 8.1% compared to 6.3% last year, a 180 basis point increase. In comparison to 2019, our segment profit margin has improved by 100 basis points. So solid improvement and our strongest first quarter profit margin since 2015, a reflection of the positive momentum we're building in our businesses. 
Our net interest expense of $18 million was down from $20 million in 2020 due to the decrease in total debt and more favorable interest rates relative to last year. The corporate expense line was $31 million in the quarter, down from $55 million in 2020, due primarily to the favorable real estate gains and retirement plan adjustment discussed earlier. Our tax rate for the first quarter was 23.8%, in line with the reported rate last year and improved from the prior year adjusted rate of 26.5%. This improvement primarily relates to the favorable tax impact of stock options exercise as well as the previously mentioned real estate gains and retirement plan adjustments. 
Our first quarter net income from continuing operations was $218 million with diluted earnings per share of $1.50. This compares to $0.84 per diluted share in the prior year or an adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.80 for an 88% increase. 
So now let's turn to our first quarter results by segment. Our automotive revenue for the first quarter was $3 billion, up 14% from the prior year. Segment profit of $236 million was up a strong 65% with profit margin at 8.0% compared to 5.5% margin in the first quarter last year. The 250 basis point increase in margin was driven by the continued recovery in the automotive business and the execution of our growth and operating initiatives. We were pleased to have each of our automotive businesses expand their margins for the third consecutive quarter. In addition, we're encouraged that our first quarter margin also compares favorably to the first quarter of 2019, up 120 basis points. So a broad recovery across our operations, and we look for continued progress in the quarters ahead. 
Our industrial sales were $1.5 billion in the quarter, flat with last year, and improved sequentially for the third consecutive quarter, which is consistent with the strengthening industrial economy. Our segment profit of $125 million was up 10% from a year ago, and profit margin was up 80 basis points to 8.3% compared to 7.5% last year. The improved margin for industrial reflects the third consecutive quarter of margin expansion in both our North American and Australasian industrial businesses, and is also up by 90 basis points from the first quarter of 2019. So another quarter of strong operating results for industrial, which we expect to continue with stronger sales growth projected through the remainder of the year. 
So now let's turn our comments to the balance sheet. We continue to operate with a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity and the financial strength to support our growth strategy. At March 31, total accounts receivable is down 27% from last year, which is primarily a function of the $800 million in receivables sold in 2020. Our inventory was up 6% from the prior year, and accounts payable increased 14%. And our AP to inventory ratio improved to 124% from 116% in the last year. We are pleased with our progress in improving our overall working capital position, and we continue to believe we have opportunities for further improvement. 
Our total debt is $2.6 billion at March 31, down $1 billion or 28% from last March and down $60 million from December 31, 2020. We significantly improved our debt position throughout the course of 2020 with the issuance of new public debt and a new revolving credit agreement that provides for expanded credit capacity and more favorable rates. With these positive changes to our debt structure, our total debt to adjusted EBITDA has improved to 1.8x from 2.5x last year. Additionally, we closed the first quarter with $2.6 billion in available liquidity, which is up from $1.1 billion at March 31 last year and in line with December 31. 
We also continue to generate strong cash flow, generating $300 million in cash from operations in the first quarter, which is up from $28 million in the first quarter last year. With a strong start to the year, including the increase in net income and the improvement in working capital, we continue to expect cash from operations to be in the $1 billion to $1.2 billion range, and free cash flow of $700 million to $900 million. 
Our key priorities for cash include the reinvestment in our businesses through capital expenditures, M&A, the dividend and share repurchases. We invested $48 million in capital expenditures in the first quarter, an increase from $39 million in 2020. Looking forward, we have plans for additional investments in our businesses to drive growth and improve efficiencies and productivity. We continue to expect total capital expenditures of approximately $300 million for the year. 
As you heard from Will earlier, strategic acquisitions remain an important component of our long-term growth strategy. We continue to cultivate a strong pipeline of targeted names, and we expect to make additional strategic bolt-on acquisitions to complement both our global automotive and industrial segments in the months and quarters ahead. 
In the first quarter, we paid a cash dividend of $114 million to our shareholders. The company has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since going public in 1928, and our 2021 dividend of $3.26 per share represents our 65th consecutive annual increase in the dividend. We have actively participated in a share repurchase program since 1994. While there were no repurchases in the first quarter, the company is currently authorized to repurchase up to 14.5 million additional shares, and we will resume share repurchases in the months and quarters ahead. 
Turning to our outlook for 2021. We are updating our full year guidance previously provided in our earnings release on February 17, 2021. In arriving at our updated guidance, we considered several factors, including our past performance, current growth plans and strategic initiatives, recent business trends, the potential for foreign currency fluctuations, inflation and the global economic outlook. In addition, we consider the continued uncertainties due to market disruptions such as with COVID-19 and its potential impact on our results. 
With these factors in mind, we expect total sales for 2021 to be in the range of plus-5% to plus-7%, an increase from our previous guidance of plus-4% to plus-6%. As usual, these growth rates exclude the benefit of any unannounced future acquisitions. By business, we are guiding to plus-5% to plus-7% total sales growth for the automotive segment an increase from plus-4% to plus-6%; and a total sales increase of plus-4% to plus-6% for the industrial segment, an increase from plus-3% to plus-5%. 
On the earnings side, we are raising our guidance for diluted earnings per share to a range of $5.85 to $6.05, which is up 11% to 15% from 2020. This represents an increase from our previous guidance of $5.55 to $5.75. We enter the second quarter focused on our initiatives to meet or exceed these targeted results and we look forward to reporting on our financial performance as we go through the year. 
Thank you, and I'll now turn it back over to Paul."

It is a function of our initiatives. I mean, you heard Will and myself talk about the number of initiatives. So we have had some great progress in strategic pricing tools and analytics. Our category management, global sourcing. We've had some product mix shifts as well. Our industrial team has done a tremendous job of just quarter-after-quarter increases.

In terms of the breakdown, fleet did come back in Q1, which I think we referenced that in our last call, we did see an improvement. Our expectation is that fleet will turn positive in Q2 and remain positive through the balance of the year. As you break down the various segments, our retail business was off-the-charts strong. What we were really encouraged by is seeing our both major accounts and NAPA AutoCare center business turn positive, both close to mid single-digit growth in those categories. So yes, we really saw improvements across the board and are especially encouraged to see our heavy-duty fleet business government municipalities turning to a positive in Q2.
And as far as regionality, Kate, I think I called out our northern regions. I would also call out -- in that mix, it includes our Atlantic division. Our Atlantic division really led the way in Q1 for us. And Atlantic comes down to the Carolinas, Virginia. So that is close to the south. Our southeast performed just fine, but just was not as strong as what we saw in our northern regions as well as our western region."

And then I think the efforts that our NAPA team is making that Will touched on, with the many changes we made in our sales force and how we're going to market.
So I really think it's a combination of our sales strategy. Our inventory availability at the street-level has improved. So it's really -- it's not one thing that I would point to. It's really a combination of really positive factors hitting at once.
And what I think I'm most encouraged by, Scot, is we had this kind of quarter despite still being in COVID-related lockdowns in many parts of the world. Canada right now, Scot, is, as you would know, is in full lockdown. And yet our business still trended positive in the quarter. Our service levels and our supply from our suppliers is not where it would traditionally be.
So look, we're quite proud of the quarter we had, but I would tell you, I think there's even upside when a few of these more headwinds we put behind us."

So our expectation as we look forward with Motion is that we're going to have a solid year. And it's going to continue and should continue on really into 2022. And that's further verified, David, when we look at the PMI numbers and the industrial production numbers all just further support the kind of growth numbers that we believe we'll continue to produce in '21."

Welcome to our second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. We appreciate you joining us today. We are pleased to report terrific financial performance driven by the consistent execution of our strategic priorities and the ongoing recovery in the global markets. 
In summary, the quarter was highlighted by continued strong sales trends, which we believe led to market share gains, gross margin gains and improved operational efficiencies that drove margin expansion and record quarterly earnings and the effective deployment of capital for growth and productivity investments, bolt-on acquisitions, the dividend and share repurchases. 
Taking a look at our second quarter financial results. Total sales were $4.8 billion, up 25% from last year and improved sequentially from plus 9% in the first quarter. For your additional perspective, our second quarter sales were 12% higher than in Q2 2019. Gross margin was also strong, representing our 15th consecutive quarterly increase. and we further improved our productivity with the ongoing execution of our expense initiatives. As a result, segment profit increased 35% and our segment margin improved 65 basis points to 9.2%, which represents our strongest margin in 2 decades. 
Adjusted net income was $253 million, and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.74, up 32%. Total sales for Global Automotive were a record $3.2 billion, a 28% increase from 2020 and up 15% from the second quarter of 2019 and marks the first quarter in our 93-year history with auto sales exceeding the $3 billion mark. 
On a comp basis, sales were up 21%. And on a 2-year stack, comp sales were up 8.5%. Our comp sales in the second quarter were driven by double-digit year-over-year comp sales in each of our automotive operations. Automotive segment profit margin improved to 9.1%, up 30 basis points from 2020 and an increase of 90 basis points from 2019. 
This expansion was supported by strong operating results across all of our operations. The automotive recovery reflects our focus on key growth initiatives as well as several market tailwinds, and these include the broad economic recovery and strengthening consumer demand, favorable weather trends, inflation and our ability to pass along price increases to our customers. Finally, solid industry fundamentals, which have been further accelerated by a surging used car market and improving miles driven. 
While these market tailwinds are encouraging, we also see continued headwinds, which we continue to closely monitor. These would include the spread of the Delta coronavirus variant and its potential impact on the global economy, global supply chain disruptions, ongoing labor shortages in our operations, and the impact of inflation on our cost such as wages and freight. 
Turning next to our regional highlights. Our GPC teammates in Europe built on their excellent start to the year, achieving the strongest sales growth amongst our operations with comp sales up 34%. Each country posted substantial sales growth, while our U.K. team continues to outperform. The positive momentum in Europe reflects improving market conditions and favorable weather trends as well as our focus on key sales initiatives, inventory availability and excellent customer service. 
In particular, we have seen exceptional results from our key account partners and the ongoing expansion and rollout of the NAPA brand. In our Asia Pac business, sales were in line with the mid- to high-teen comps we have had in this market now for 4 consecutive quarters. Commercial sales outperformed retail although both customer segments posted strong growth. 
The Repco and NAPA brands performed well and collectively are capturing market share. The NAPA network continues to build, and we have now more than 50 NAPA locations operating across Australia and New Zealand in addition to our 400-plus Repco stores. 
In North America, comp sales increased 20% in the U.S. and were up 12% in Canada, where lockdowns in key markets such as Quebec and Ontario have been headwinds for several quarters now. Sales in the U.S. were driven by strong growth in both the commercial and retail segments with DIFM sales outperforming DIY for the first time since before the pandemic began to take hold in Q1 of 2020. 
The strengthening commercial sales environment is significant for us as it accounts for 80% of our total U.S. automotive revenue. The strong recovery in the commercial sector contributed to record average daily sales volume in our U.S. automotive business in June. 
Our sales drivers by product category include brakes, tools and equipment and undercar, which all outperformed. In addition, both retail and commercial ticket and traffic counts were strong for the second consecutive quarter to another really positive trend. 
By customer segment, retail sales remained strong throughout the quarter, with low double-digit sales growth on top of a healthy sales increase in the second quarter of last year. While the DIY market is pulling back from the highs of 2020, we are optimistic our ongoing investments will create sustainable retail growth. 
For commercial sales, each of our customer segments posted double-digit growth, which we attribute to the broad automotive recovery and investments in our sales team, our sales programs and our supply chain amongst other initiatives. This quarter, our strongest growth was with our major account partners and NAPA AutoCare Centers. 
We were also pleased with the growth in sales to our fleet and government accounts. This was the first quarter of positive year-over-year sales growth for this group since before the pandemic as they lag the overall automotive recovery in the U.S. We view this improvement as a meaningful indicator for further growth in the quarters ahead. 
As the automotive recovery continues, we expect our commercial sales opportunities to outpace retail consistent with the long-term growth outlook for the aftermarket industry. We are confident in our growth strategy and our initiatives to deliver customer value and sell more parts for more cars across our global automotive operations. 
We also remain focused on enhancing our inventory availability, strengthening our supply chain and investing in our omnichannel capabilities, while expanding our global store footprint to further strengthen our competitive positioning. 
So now let's discuss the global Industrial Parts Group. Total sales for this group were $1.6 billion, a 20% increase from last year and up 7% from 2019. Comp sales rose 16% and reflect the fourth consecutive quarter of improving sales trends. A strong sales environment, combined with the execution of our operational initiatives drove a 9.5% segment margin, which is up 130 basis points from both 2020 and 2019. 
The ongoing market recovery over the last 12 months is in line with the strengthening industrial economy and the overall increase in activity we have seen across much of our customer base. The Purchasing Managers Index measured 60.6 in June, reflecting healthy levels of industrial expansion and mirroring trends we have seen throughout the majority of this year. Likewise, industrial production increased by 5.5% in the second quarter, representing the fourth consecutive quarter of expansion. 
Diving deeper into our Q2 sales, we experienced strong sales trends across each of our industries served and our product categories, other than safety supplies, which adds extraordinary sales in 2020 due to the pandemic. Several industry sectors stood out as their sales increased by 30% or more over last year, including equipment and machinery, automotive, aggregate and cement, equipment rental and oil and gas. In addition, our newly added fulfillment and logistics industry sector experienced tremendous growth. 
In the past several years of expanding this segment, we have found our broad offering of products and services fits well with the needs of these customers. To drive this growth, we remain focused on several strategic initiatives, which include: the build-out of our industrial omnichannel capabilities with solid growth in digital sales via motion.com; our new inside sales center, which was established in 2019 is generating incremental sales from new Motion customers and we see room for further growth; the expansion of our services and value-add solutions businesses in areas such as equipment repair, conveyance and automation. 
Over the last few years, we have made several bolt-on acquisitions to build scale and continue to target additional M&A opportunities to further enhance our capabilities in these key areas. Enhanced pricing and product category management strategies to maximize profitable growth. The further optimization and automation of our supply chain network to improve operational productivity while delivering exceptional customer service. 
We are encouraged by industrial's strong financial performance in the second quarter and the positive momentum we see in the overall industrial market. We believe the Motion team is well positioned to capitalize on this momentum and enhance our market leadership position. 
So in summary, each of our businesses did an exceptional job of operating through the quarter, and we couldn't be more proud and grateful for their strong Q2 performance. So now I'll turn the call over to Will. Will?"

I'd like to personally congratulate the entire global GPC team for the hard work and impressive results. The teams continue to build momentum and execute well. We remain focused on our defined strategic initiatives and despite the global uncertainties that continue to impact our operations, we're pleased with the strong sales growth, operating leverage and cash flow performance this quarter. 
Last quarter, we outlined our plans to create value as we leverage GPC global capabilities to simplify and integrate our operations. We do so to improve the customer experience to increase the speed and efficiency of execution and to deliver winning performance. This includes continuous investments to position GPC for near- and long-term profitable growth. 
The key pillars of our investments include talent, sales effectiveness, digital, supply chain and emerging technologies. Around the globe, the teams executed well against our strategic priorities. For example, on talent, we announced last month that Naveen Krishna joined the company as Chief Information and Digital Officer. Naveen will help lead our strategy and execution for all technology and digital initiatives. He comes to GPC with more than 25 years of technology experience with companies such as Macy's, Home Depot, Target and FedEx. We're excited to welcome Naveen as we continue to innovate on the customer experience accelerate the pace of technology execution and build capabilities that advance our long-term strategy. 
Other examples of recent talent investments include category management, field sales and services indirect sourcing, pricing, diversity, equity, inclusion, digital, data and inventory leadership to name a few. Investment in our people is always a priority as we execute our mission to be an employer of choice. 
To highlight other examples of our initiative momentum in local execution, Paul and I recently had the opportunity to spend time in person with our European teammates. And they showcased great examples of the strategic initiatives and winning team performance. 
For example, we discussed details of the growth plans for a recent bolt-on investment, Win Parts, an online leader of automotive parts and accessories.  We expect this investment to provide new capabilities and accelerate our European digital vision. 
We visited a best-in-class distribution facility in the Netherlands that increased operating productivity by approximately 20% over the past few years with automation investments and process excellence initiatives. We received an update on the consolidation of 10 back-office shared service centers in France to 1 national location in France to drive cost and process efficiencies and we saw firsthand the power and differentiation of the NAPA brand in the local market. 
Although these are only a few select examples in Europe, in each of our automotive and industrial businesses, we see similar examples of focused strategic execution that are delivering results. We also executed well on our acquisition strategy during the quarter. The M&A environment is active, and we remain disciplined to pursue strategic and value-creating transactions. 
For example, in addition to win parts, we completed several other bolt-on acquisitions to deliver growth, add capabilities and create value. The North American and European automotive teams completed various store acquisitions that increase our position in key strategic geographies and extend existing customer relationships. Our automotive team in Asia Pac also executed 2 bolt-on strategic acquisitions, including rare spares a market leader in the niche segment of automotive restoration parts and accessories; and Park BB, a leading cloud-based product and supplier data platform that will enhance our e-commerce and data capabilities. 
We entered the third quarter with strong momentum as our automotive and industrial markets recover and we execute our plans. We continue to analyze and respond to areas that challenge our daily operations, such as COVID-19, inflation, global logistics and product and labor availability. For example, the global and local procurement teams partner closely with all levels of our suppliers to effectively assess product availability and delivery trends. 
We have processes in place backed with data and analytics to create visibility into direct and indirect inflation trends. We utilize GPC's scale and relationships, including dedicated GPC resources in Asia to address our global logistics needs. And we continue to address labor challenges with competitive pay and benefits, flexible work programs, creative incentives to attract talent, a differentiated culture and compelling career opportunities. We believe our team is well positioned to remain agile as we focus on what we can control and navigate these macro global headwinds. 
Overall, we're very pleased with our performance through the first half of the year and look forward to sharing our continued progress next quarter. I'll now turn the call over to Carol to review the financial details."

Total GPC sales were $4.8 billion in the second quarter, up 25%. Our gross margin improved to 35.3%, an increase from 33.8% last year or up 120 basis points from an adjusted gross margin of 34.1%. Our improvement in gross margin was prima",1360,"Thank you, Will. Total GPC sales were $4.8 billion in the second quarter, up 25%. Our gross margin improved to 35.3%, an increase from 33.8% last year or up 120 basis points from an adjusted gross margin of 34.1%. Our improvement in gross margin was primarily driven by the increase in supplier incentives although we also continue to benefit from channel and geographical mix shifts, positive product mix, strategic category management initiatives, including pricing and global sourcing strategies. 
In the second quarter, there was significant pricing activity with our suppliers, resulting in product cost inflation. We were positioned to pass these increases on to our customers and the impact of price inflation was neutral to gross margin. We estimate a 1.5% impact of inflation in automotive sales for the quarter and a 1% impact in industrial. 
Based on the current environment, we expect this to increase further through the second half of the year. Our total adjusted operating and nonoperating expenses were $1.3 billion in the second quarter, up 28% from last year and 28.1% of sales. The increase from last year reflects the impact of several factors, including the prior year benefit of approximately $150 million in temporary savings related to the pandemic. 
The balance primarily relates to the increase in variable costs on the $1 billion in additional year-over-year sales. And to a lesser extent, we experienced rising cost pressures in areas such as wages, incentive compensation, freight, rents and health insurance, which we are managing. We also invested in projects associated with our transformation and other strategic initiatives to drive growth and enhance productivity. So overall, we continue to operate in line with our plans for the year, and we remain focused on gaining additional efficiency in the quarters ahead, as you heard from Paul and Will. 
On a segment basis, our total segment profit in the second quarter was $441 million, up a strong 35%. Our segment profit margin was 9.2% compared to 8.6% last year, a 65 basis point year-over-year improvement and up 100 basis points from 2019. So strong operating results and a reflection of the work we have done to streamline our operations and optimize our portfolio over the last several years. 
We would add that for the full year, we continue to expect our segment profit margin to improve by 20 to 30 basis points from 2020 or 60 to 70 basis points from 2019. This would represent our strongest margin in 5 years. 
Our tax rate for the second quarter was 27.2% on an adjusted basis, up from 24.1% last year. The increase in rate primarily reflects a higher U.K. tax rate, partially offset by stock compensation excess tax benefits. Second quarter net income from continuing operations was $196 million with diluted earnings per share of $1.36. 
Our adjusted net income was $253 million or $1.74 per share which compares to $191 million or $1.32 per share in the prior year, a 32% increase. Turning to our second quarter results by segment. Our automotive revenue was $3.2 billion, up 28% from last year. 
Segment profit was $291 million, up 33%, with profit margin improved to 9.1%, up 30 basis points from 2020 and a 90 basis point increase from 2019. We attribute the margin gain to the positive market conditions in our automotive business and our team's intense focus on the execution of our growth and operating initiatives. 
We're encouraged by the positive momentum we will carry into the balance of the year. Our industrial sales were $1.6 billion in the quarter, up 20% from 2020. Segment profit of $150 million was up 38% from a year ago, and profit margin improved to a strong 9.5%, a 130 basis point increase from both 2020 and 2019. 
So with the strengthening sales environment and continued operational improvements, this group continues to post excellent operating results, and we expect Industrial to perform well through the balance of the year. Now let's turn our comments to the balance sheet. 
At June 30, our total accounts receivable is up 4%.  Despite the strong sales increase, this is primarily due to the additional sale of $300 million in receivables in the second half of 2020. Inventory was up 10%, consistent with our commitment to provide for inventory availability and our accounts payable increased 26%. 
Our AP to inventory ratio improved to 129% from 112% last year. We remain pleased with our progress in improving our overall working capital position. Our total debt is $2.5 billion, down $700 million or 22% from June of 2020 and down $160 million from December 31, 2020. 
We closed the second quarter with $2.5 billion in available liquidity and our total debt to adjusted EBITDA has improved to 1.6x from 2.9x last year. Our team has done an excellent job of improving our capital structure over the last year. We continue to generate strong cash flow with another $400 million in cash from operations in the second quarter and $700 million for the 6 months. 
For the full year, we expect our earnings growth and working capital to drive $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion in cash from operations and free cash flow of $900 million to $1.1 billion. Our key priorities for cash remain the reinvestment in our businesses through capital expenditures, M&A, the dividend and share repurchases. 
We have invested $90 million in capital expenditures thus far in the year, and we expect these investments to pick up further in the quarters ahead as we execute on additional investments to drive organic growth and improve efficiencies and productivity in our operations. As Will mentioned earlier, strategic acquisitions remain an important component of our long-term growth strategy. 
We've used approximately $97 million in cash for acquisitions through the 6 months and we continue to cultivate a strong pipeline of targeted names and expect to make additional strategic and bolt-on acquisitions to complement both our global automotive and industrial segments as we move forward. 
Consistent with our long-standing dividend policy, we have also paid a total cash dividend of more than $232 million to our shareholders through the first half of this year. This reflects a 2021 annual dividend of $3.26 per share and represents our 65th consecutive annual increase in the dividend. 
Finally, as part of our share repurchase program, we have been active with share buybacks since 1994. In the second quarter, we used $184 million to acquire 1.4 million shares. The company is currently authorized to repurchase up to 13 million additional shares, and we expect to remain active in this program in the quarters ahead. 
Turning to our outlook for 2021. We are updating our full year guidance previously provided in our earnings release on April 22, 2021. In arriving at our updated guidance, we considered several factors, including our past performance and recent business trends, current growth plans and strategic initiatives the potential for foreign exchange fluctuations, inflation and the global economic outlook. 
We also consider the continued uncertainties due to the market disruption such as with COVID-19 and its potential impact on our results. With these factors in mind, we expect total sales for 2021 to be in the range of plus 10% to plus 12%, an increase from our previous guidance of plus 5% to plus 7%. 
As usual, this excludes the benefit of any unannounced future acquisitions. By business, we are guiding to plus 11% to plus 13% total sales growth for the Automotive segment, an increase from the plus 5% to plus 7%. And and a total sales increase of plus 6% to plus 8% for the Industrial segment, an increase from the plus 4% to plus 6%. 
On the earnings side, we are raising our guidance for adjusted diluted earnings per share to a range of $6.20 to $6.35, which is up 18% to 20% from 2020. This represents an increase from our previous guidance of $5.85 to $6.05. We entered the third quarter focused on our initiatives to meet or exceed these targeted results, and we look forward to reporting on our financial performance as we go through the year. Thank you, and I'll now turn it back over to Paul."

This quarter's 25% total sales growth reflects the benefits of the strengthening global economy and positive sales environment in both our automotive and industrial businesses. Importantly, this dual recovery allows us to leverage the full scale of 1 GTC, which we believe creates significant value. 
Our team also executed well and produced our 15th consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion, while further improving our productivity via ongoing expense initiatives. Our global team network and disciplined focus in these areas enabled us to report strong operating results and record quarterly earnings. 
Our exceptional balance sheet provides us with the financial flexibility to pursue strategic growth opportunities, be investments and organic and acquisitive growth while also returning capital to shareholders through the dividend and share repurchases.

We haven't seen this kind of activity for a decade, if you will. And it is, as you mentioned, it's sort of similar to tariffs and at the pace that they're coming.

And our teams work very closely from a category management perspective to work with the suppliers to look at commodity tracking and the cost model and the supplier line reviews. And while we don't break out specifically how much is each component, trust me, the teams work with the suppliers on that. On the industrial side, it's more normal. So I would tell you their inflation is definitely more normal. And so what we do think is that second half will be more active than Q2. So we could see as much as 2x the second quarter inflation rate in our second half. But again, couldn't be happier with the teams and all of our businesses and the work they're doing to pass those through to our customers and be able to get greater gross profit dollars but maintain our gross margin rate.

And I think when you look at our margin improvement, I mean, it's the 2-year basis, when you go back to 2019, having that stronger margin improvement year-over-year is something that we expect to deliver. So I think, again, we have a little bit of cautiousness as we look ahead, but it's still improved margin for 2020. And on a 2-year basis, it's 70 to 80 basis points for 2019."

So this quarter, the comparison to last year was our highest level of temporary cost savings. We had over $150 million cost -- temporary cost savings last year in Q2, a significant portion was government subsidies, payroll reduction, delayed merit increases, furloughs. So we knew this would be our toughest quarter on those. So that's honestly about half of the increase in the dollar increase in SG&A. The increase in variable costs, as I mentioned, I mean, we have incremental $1 billion more in sales. So about 1/3 of the increase was related to bringing back the variable cost to handle the volume. And then the investments in projects, a relatively small amount, but an important amount. So that is investments. Will mentioned some of the productivity improvements we're doing, we've got in our industrial business, automation and their warehouses in our automotive business, consolidating facilities and putting in further automation, investments in pricing and digital initiatives. So that was roughly, say, 5% of the dollar increase. And then the remaining amount, roughly 10% of the dollar increase was the rising cost and inflation. What I would tell you is we have kept the permanent cost savings that we had last year, which ended up being $150 million on a target of $100 million. And in bringing back these costs, I mean, we had just a surge in growth. And so you do have to bring in those variable costs. What we didn't really expect was the rising cost and inflation, but thank goodness, we did the work we did on the transformation team. And again, we continue to see some investments in projects as we look ahead."

Welcome to our second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. We appreciate you joining us today. We are pleased to report terrific financial performance driven by the consistent execution of our strategic priorities and the ongoing recovery in the global markets. 
In summary, the quarter was highlighted by continued strong sales trends, which we believe led to market share gains, gross margin gains and improved operational efficiencies that drove margin expansion and record quarterly earnings and the effective deployment of capital for growth and productivity investments, bolt-on acquisitions, the dividend and share repurchases. 
Taking a look at our second quarter financial results. Total sales were $4.8 billion, up 25% from last year and improved sequentially from plus 9% in the first quarter. For your additional perspective, our second quarter sales were 12% higher than in Q2 2019. Gross margin was also strong, representing our 15th consecutive quarterly increase. and we further improved our productivity with the ongoing execution of our expense initiatives. As a result, segment profit increased 35% and our segment margin improved 65 basis points to 9.2%, which represents our strongest margin in 2 decades. 
Adjusted net income was $253 million, and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.74, up 32%. Total sales for Global Automotive were a record $3.2 billion, a 28% increase from 2020 and up 15% from the second quarter of 2019 and marks the first quarter in our 93-year history with auto sales exceeding the $3 billion mark. 
On a comp basis, sales were up 21%. And on a 2-year stack, comp sales were up 8.5%. Our comp sales in the second quarter were driven by double-digit year-over-year comp sales in each of our Automotive operations. Automotive segment profit margin improved to 9.1%, up 30 basis points from 2020 and an increase of 90 basis points from 2019. 
This expansion was supported by strong operating results across all of our operations. The automotive recovery reflects our focus on key growth initiatives as well as several market tailwinds, and these include the broad economic recovery and strengthening consumer demand, favorable weather trends, inflation and our ability to pass along price increases to our customers. Finally, solid industry fundamentals, which have been further accelerated by a surging used car market and improving miles driven. 
While these market tailwinds are encouraging, we also see continued headwinds, which we continue to closely monitor. These would include the spread of the Delta coronavirus variant and its potential impact on the global economy, global supply chain disruptions, ongoing labor shortages in our operations, and the impact of inflation on our cost such as wages and freight. 
Turning next to our regional highlights. Our GPC teammates in Europe built on their excellent start to the year, achieving the strongest sales growth amongst our operations with comp sales up 34%. Each country posted substantial sales growth, while our U.K. team continues to outperform. The positive momentum in Europe reflects improving market conditions and favorable weather trends as well as our focus on key sales initiatives, inventory availability and excellent customer service. In particular, we have seen exceptional results from our key account partners and the ongoing expansion and rollout of the NAPA brand.
In our Asia Pac business, sales were in line with the mid- to high-teen comps we have had in this market now for 4 consecutive quarters. Commercial sales outperformed retail although both customer segments posted strong growth. 
The Repco and NAPA brands performed well and collectively are capturing market share. The NAPA network continues to build, and we have now more than 50 NAPA locations operating across Australia and New Zealand in addition to our 400-plus Repco stores. 
In North America, comp sales increased 20% in the U.S. and were up 12% in Canada, where lockdowns in key markets such as Quebec and Ontario have been headwinds for several quarters now. Sales in the U.S. were driven by strong growth in both the commercial and retail segments with DIFM sales outperforming DIY for the first time since before the pandemic began to take hold in Q1 of 2020. 
The strengthening commercial sales environment is significant for us as it accounts for 80% of our total U.S. automotive revenue. The strong recovery in the commercial sector contributed to record average daily sales volume in our U.S. Automotive business in June. 
Our sales drivers by product category include brakes, tools and equipment and undercar, which all outperformed. In addition, both retail and commercial ticket and traffic counts were strong for the second consecutive quarter -- so another really positive trend. 
By customer segment, retail sales remained strong throughout the quarter, with low double-digit sales growth on top of a healthy sales increase in the second quarter of last year. While the DIY market is pulling back from the highs of 2020, we are optimistic our ongoing investments will create sustainable retail growth. 
For commercial sales, each of our customer segments posted double-digit growth, which we attribute to the broad automotive recovery and investments in our sales team, our sales programs and our supply chain amongst other initiatives. This quarter, our strongest growth was with our major account partners and NAPA AutoCare Centers. 
We were also pleased with the growth in sales to our fleet and government accounts. This was the first quarter of positive year-over-year sales growth for this group since before the pandemic as they lag the overall automotive recovery in the U.S. We view this improvement as a meaningful indicator for further growth in the quarters ahead. 
As the automotive recovery continues, we expect our commercial sales opportunities to outpace retail, consistent with the long-term growth outlook for the aftermarket industry. We are confident in our growth strategy and our initiatives to deliver customer value and sell more parts for more cars across our global Automotive operations. 
We also remain focused on enhancing our inventory availability, strengthening our supply chain and investing in our omnichannel capabilities, while expanding our global store footprint to further strengthen our competitive positioning. 
So now let's discuss the global Industrial Parts Group. Total sales for this group were $1.6 billion, a 20% increase from last year and up 7% from 2019. Comp sales rose 16% and reflect the fourth consecutive quarter of improving sales trends. A strong sales environment, combined with the execution of our operational initiatives drove a 9.5% segment margin, which is up 130 basis points from both 2020 and 2019. 
The ongoing market recovery over the last 12 months is in line with the strengthening industrial economy and the overall increase in activity we have seen across much of our customer base. The Purchasing Managers Index measured 60.6 in June, reflecting healthy levels of industrial expansion and mirroring trends we have seen throughout the majority of this year. Likewise, industrial production increased by 5.5% in the second quarter, representing the fourth consecutive quarter of expansion. 
Diving deeper into our Q2 sales, we experienced strong sales trends across each of our industries served and our product categories, other than safety supplies, which adds extraordinary sales in 2020 due to the pandemic. Several industry sectors stood out as their sales increased by 30% or more over last year, including equipment and machinery, automotive, aggregate and cement, equipment rental and oil and gas. In addition, our newly added fulfillment and logistics industry sector experienced tremendous growth. 
In the past several years of expanding this segment, we have found our broad offering of products and services fits well with the needs of these customers. To drive this growth, we remain focused on several strategic initiatives, which include the build-out of our industrial omnichannel capabilities with solid growth in digital sales via motion.com; our new inside sales center, which was established in 2019 is generating incremental sales from new Motion customers and we see room for further growth; the expansion of our services and value-add solutions businesses in areas such as equipment repair, conveyance and automation. 
Over the last few years, we have made several bolt-on acquisitions to build scale and continue to target additional M&A opportunities to further enhance our capabilities in these key areas. Enhanced pricing and product category management strategies to maximize profitable growth. The further optimization and automation of our supply chain network to improve operational productivity while delivering exceptional customer service. 
We are encouraged by Industrial's strong financial performance in the second quarter and the positive momentum we see in the overall industrial market. We believe the Motion team is well positioned to capitalize on this momentum and enhance our market leadership position. 
So in summary, each of our businesses did an exceptional job of operating through the quarter, and we couldn't be more proud and grateful for their strong Q2 performance. So now I'll turn the call over to Will. Will?"

We do so to improve the customer experience, to increase the speed and efficiency of execution and to deliver winning performance. This includes continuous investments to position GPC for near- and long-term profitable growth. 
The key pillars of our investments include talent, sales effectiveness, digital, supply chain and emerging technologies. Around the globe, the teams executed well against our strategic priorities. For example, on talent, we announced last month that Naveen Krishna joined the company as Chief Information and Digital Officer. Naveen will help lead our strategy and execution for all technology and digital initiatives. He comes to GPC with more than 25 years of technology experience with companies such as Macy's, Home Depot, Target and FedEx. We're excited to welcome Naveen as we continue to innovate on the customer experience, accelerate the pace of technology execution and build capabilities that advance our long-term strategy. 
Other examples of recent talent investments include category management; field sales and services; indirect sourcing; pricing; diversity, equity, inclusion; digital; data and inventory; leadership, to name a few. Investment in our people is always a priority as we execute our mission to be an employer of choice. 
To highlight other examples of our initiative momentum in local execution, Paul and I recently had the opportunity to spend time in person with our European teammates. And they showcased great examples of the strategic initiatives and winning team performance. 
For example, we discussed details of the growth plans for a recent bolt-on investment, Winparts, an online leader of automotive parts and accessories.  We expect this investment to provide new capabilities and accelerate our European digital vision. 
We visited a best-in-class distribution facility in the Netherlands that increased operating productivity by approximately 20% over the past few years with automation investments and process excellence initiatives. We received an update on the consolidation of 10 back-office shared service centers in France to 1 national location in France to drive cost and process efficiencies and we saw firsthand the power and differentiation of the NAPA brand in the local market. 
Although these are only a few select examples in Europe, in each of our Automotive and Industrial businesses, we see similar examples of focused strategic execution that are delivering results. We also executed well on our acquisition strategy during the quarter. The M&A environment is active, and we remain disciplined to pursue strategic and value-creating transactions. 
For example, in addition to Winparts, we completed several other bolt-on acquisitions to deliver growth, add capabilities and create value. The North American and European automotive teams completed various store acquisitions that increase our position in key strategic geographies and extend existing customer relationships. Our automotive team in Asia Pac also executed 2 bolt-on strategic acquisitions, including Rare Spares a market leader in the niche segment of automotive restoration parts and accessories; and PARts DB, a leading cloud-based product and supplier data platform that will enhance our e-commerce and data capabilities. 
We entered the third quarter with strong momentum as our Automotive and Industrial markets recover and we execute our plans. We continue to analyze and respond to areas that challenge our daily operations, such as COVID-19, inflation, global logistics and product and labor availability. For example, the global and local procurement teams partner closely with all levels of our suppliers to effectively assess product availability and delivery trends. 
We have processes in place, backed with data and analytics to create visibility into direct and indirect inflation trends. We utilize GPC's scale and relationships, including dedicated GPC resources in Asia to address our global logistics needs. And we continue to address labor challenges with competitive pay and benefits, flexible work programs, creative incentives to attract talent, a differentiated culture and compelling career opportunities. We believe our team is well positioned to remain agile as we focus on what we can control and navigate these macro global headwinds. 
Overall, we're very pleased with our performance through the first half of the year and look forward to sharing our continued progress next quarter. I'll now turn the call over to Carol to review the financial details."

Total GPC sales were $4.8 billion in the second quarter, up 25%. Our gross margin improved to 35.3%, an increase from 33.8% last year or up 120 basis points from an adjusted gross margin of 34.1%. Our improvement in gross margin was prima",1359,"Thank you, Will. Total GPC sales were $4.8 billion in the second quarter, up 25%. Our gross margin improved to 35.3%, an increase from 33.8% last year or up 120 basis points from an adjusted gross margin of 34.1%. Our improvement in gross margin was primarily driven by the increase in supplier incentives although we also continue to benefit from channel and geographical mix shifts, positive product mix, strategic category management initiatives, including pricing and global sourcing strategies. 
In the second quarter, there was significant pricing activity with our suppliers, resulting in product cost inflation. We were positioned to pass these increases on to our customers and the impact of price inflation was neutral to gross margin. We estimate a 1.5% impact of inflation in Automotive sales for the quarter and a 1% impact in Industrial. 
Based on the current environment, we expect this to increase further through the second half of the year. Our total adjusted operating and nonoperating expenses were $1.3 billion in the second quarter, up 28% from last year and 28.1% of sales. The increase from last year reflects the impact of several factors, including the prior year benefit of approximately $150 million in temporary savings related to the pandemic. 
The balance primarily relates to the increase in variable costs on the $1 billion in additional year-over-year sales. And to a lesser extent, we experienced rising cost pressures in areas such as wages, incentive compensation, freight, rents and health insurance, which we are managing. We also invested in projects associated with our transformation and other strategic initiatives to drive growth and enhance productivity. So overall, we continue to operate in line with our plans for the year, and we remain focused on gaining additional efficiency in the quarters ahead, as you heard from Paul and Will. 
On a segment basis, our total segment profit in the second quarter was $441 million, up a strong 35%. Our segment profit margin was 9.2% compared to 8.6% last year, a 65 basis point year-over-year improvement and up 100 basis points from 2019. So strong operating results and a reflection of the work we have done to streamline our operations and optimize our portfolio over the last several years. 
We would add that for the full year, we continue to expect our segment profit margin to improve by 20 to 30 basis points from 2020 or 60 to 70 basis points from 2019. This would represent our strongest margin in 5 years. 
Our tax rate for the second quarter was 27.2% on an adjusted basis, up from 24.1% last year. The increase in rate primarily reflects a higher U.K. tax rate, partially offset by stock compensation excess tax benefits.
Second quarter net income from continuing operations was $196 million with diluted earnings per share of $1.36.  Our adjusted net income was $253 million or $1.74 per share which compares to $191 million or $1.32 per share in the prior year, a 32% increase. 
Turning to our second quarter results by segment. Our Automotive revenue was $3.2 billion, up 28% from last year.  Segment profit was $291 million, up 33%, with profit margin improved to 9.1%, up 30 basis points from 2020 and a 90 basis point increase from 2019. We attribute the margin gain to the positive market conditions in our Automotive business and our team's intense focus on the execution of our growth and operating initiatives. 
We're encouraged by the positive momentum we will carry into the balance of the year. Our Industrial sales were $1.6 billion in the quarter, up 20% from 2020. Segment profit of $150 million was up 38% from a year ago, and profit margin improved to a strong 9.5%, a 130 basis point increase from both 2020 and 2019. 
So with the strengthening sales environment and continued operational improvements, this group continues to post excellent operating results, and we expect Industrial to perform well through the balance of the year. Now let's turn our comments to the balance sheet. 
At June 30, our total accounts receivable is up 4%.  Despite the strong sales increase, this is primarily due to the additional sale of $300 million in receivables in the second half of 2020. Inventory was up 10%, consistent with our commitment to provide for inventory availability and our accounts payable increased 26%. 
Our AP to inventory ratio improved to 129% from 112% last year. We remain pleased with our progress in improving our overall working capital position. Our total debt is $2.5 billion, down $700 million or 22% from June of 2020 and down $160 million from December 31, 2020. 
We closed the second quarter with $2.5 billion in available liquidity and our total debt to adjusted EBITDA has improved to 1.6x from 2.9x last year. Our team has done an excellent job of improving our capital structure over the last year. We continue to generate strong cash flow with another $400 million in cash from operations in the second quarter and $700 million for the 6 months. 
For the full year, we expect our earnings growth and working capital to drive $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion in cash from operations and free cash flow of $900 million to $1.1 billion. Our key priorities for cash remain the reinvestment in our businesses through capital expenditures, M&A, the dividend and share repurchases. 
We have invested $90 million in capital expenditures thus far in the year, and we expect these investments to pick up further in the quarters ahead as we execute on additional investments to drive organic growth and improve efficiencies and productivity in our operations. As Will mentioned earlier, strategic acquisitions remain an important component of our long-term growth strategy. 
We've used approximately $97 million in cash for acquisitions through the 6 months and we continue to cultivate a strong pipeline of targeted names and expect to make additional strategic and bolt-on acquisitions to complement both our global Automotive and Industrial segments as we move forward. 
Consistent with our long-standing dividend policy, we have also paid a total cash dividend of more than $232 million to our shareholders through the first half of this year. This reflects a 2021 annual dividend of $3.26 per share and represents our 65th consecutive annual increase in the dividend. 
Finally, as part of our share repurchase program, we have been active with share buybacks since 1994. In the second quarter, we used $184 million to acquire 1.4 million shares. The company is currently authorized to repurchase up to 13 million additional shares, and we expect to remain active in this program in the quarters ahead. 
Turning to our outlook for 2021. We are updating our full year guidance previously provided in our earnings release on April 22, 2021. In arriving at our updated guidance, we considered several factors, including our past performance and recent business trends, current growth plans and strategic initiatives, the potential for foreign exchange fluctuations, inflation and the global economic outlook. 
We also consider the continued uncertainties due to the market disruption such as with COVID-19 and its potential impact on our results. With these factors in mind, we expect total sales for 2021 to be in the range of plus 10% to plus 12%, an increase from our previous guidance of plus 5% to plus 7%. 
As usual, this excludes the benefit of any unannounced future acquisitions. By business, we are guiding to plus 11% to plus 13% total sales growth for the Automotive segment, an increase from the plus 5% to plus 7%. And a total sales increase of plus 6% to plus 8% for the Industrial segment, an increase from the plus 4% to plus 6%. 
On the earnings side, we are raising our guidance for adjusted diluted earnings per share to a range of $6.20 to $6.35, which is up 18% to 20% from 2020. This represents an increase from our previous guidance of $5.85 to $6.05. We entered the third quarter focused on our initiatives to meet or exceed these targeted results, and we look forward to reporting on our financial performance as we go through the year. Thank you, and I'll now turn it back over to Paul."

We are pleased with our progress in capturing profitable growth, generating strong cash flow and driving shareholder value.

Our global team network and disciplined focus in these areas enabled us to report strong operating results and record quarterly earnings. 
Our exceptional balance sheet provides us with the financial flexibility to pursue strategic growth opportunities via investments in organic and acquisitive growth while also returning capital to shareholders through the dividend and share repurchases.

So I would tell you their inflation is definitely more normal. And so what we do think is that second half will be more active than Q2. So we could see as much as 2x the second quarter inflation rate in our second half.

So this quarter, the comparison to last year was our highest level of temporary cost savings. We had over $150 million cost -- temporary cost savings last year in Q2, a significant portion was government subsidies, payroll reduction, delayed merit increases, furloughs. So we knew this would be our toughest quarter on those. So that's honestly about half of the increase in the dollar increase in SG&A. The increase in variable costs, as I mentioned, I mean, we have incremental $1 billion more in sales. So about 1/3 of the increase was related to bringing back the variable cost to handle the volume. And then the investments in projects, a relatively small amount, but an important amount. So that is investments.
Will mentioned some of the productivity improvements we're doing, we've got in our Industrial business, automation in their warehouses. In our Automotive business, consolidating facilities and putting in further automation. Investments in pricing and digital initiatives. So that was roughly, say, 5% of the dollar increase. And then the remaining amount, roughly 10% of the dollar increase was the rising cost and inflation. 
What I would tell you is we have kept the permanent cost savings that we had last year, which ended up being $150 million on a target of $100 million. And in bringing back these costs, I mean, we had just a surge in growth. And so you do have to bring in those variable costs. What we didn't really expect was the rising cost and inflation, but thank goodness we did the work we did on the transformation team. And again, we continue to see some investments in projects as we look ahead."

Welcome to our second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. We appreciate you joining us today.

Welcome to our second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. We appreciate you joining us today. We are pleased to report terrific financial performance driven by the consistent execution of our strategic priorities and the ongoing recovery in the global markets. 
In summary, the quarter was highlighted by continued strong sales trends, which we believe led to market share gains, gross margin gains and improved operational efficiencies that drove margin expansion and record quarterly earnings and the effective deployment of capital for growth and productivity investments, bolt-on acquisitions, the dividend and share repurchases. 
Taking a look at our second quarter financial results. Total sales were $4.8 billion, up 25% from last year and improved sequentially from plus 9% in the first quarter. For your additional perspective, our second quarter sales were 12% higher than in Q2 2019. Gross margin was also strong, representing our 15th consecutive quarterly increase. and we further improved our productivity with the ongoing execution of our expense initiatives. As a result, segment profit increased 35% and our segment margin improved 65 basis points to 9.2%, which represents our strongest margin in 2 decades. 
Adjusted net income was $253 million, and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.74, up 32%. Total sales for global automotive were a record $3.2 billion, a 28% increase from 2020 and up 15% from the second quarter of 2019 and marks the first quarter in our 93-year history with auto sales exceeding the $3 billion mark. 
On a comp basis, sales were up 21%. And on a 2-year stack, comp sales were up 8.5%. Our comp sales in the second quarter were driven by double-digit year-over-year comp sales in each of our automotive operations. Automotive segment profit margin improved to 9.1%, up 30 basis points from 2020 and an increase of 90 basis points from 2019. 
This expansion was supported by strong operating results across all of our operations. The automotive recovery reflects our focus on key growth initiatives as well as several market tailwinds, and these include the broad economic recovery and strengthening consumer demand, favorable weather trends, inflation and our ability to pass along price increases to our customers. Finally, solid industry fundamentals, which have been further accelerated by a surging used car market and improving miles driven. 
While these market tailwinds are encouraging, we also see continued headwinds, which we continue to closely monitor. These would include the spread of the Delta coronavirus variant and its potential impact on the global economy, global supply chain disruptions, ongoing labor shortages in our operations, and the impact of inflation on our cost such as wages and freight. 
Turning next to our regional highlights. Our GPC teammates in Europe built on their excellent start to the year, achieving the strongest sales growth amongst our operations with comp sales up 34%. Each country posted substantial sales growth, while our U.K. team continues to outperform. The positive momentum in Europe reflects improving market conditions and favorable weather trends as well as our focus on key sales initiatives, inventory availability and excellent customer service. In particular, we have seen exceptional results from our key account partners and the ongoing expansion and rollout of the NAPA brand.
In our Asia Pac business, sales were in line with the mid- to high-teen comps we have had in this market now for 4 consecutive quarters. Commercial sales outperformed retail although both customer segments posted strong growth. 
The Repco and NAPA brands performed well and collectively are capturing market share. The NAPA network continues to build, and we have now more than 50 NAPA locations operating across Australia and New Zealand in addition to our 400-plus Repco stores. 
In North America, comp sales increased 20% in the U.S. and were up 12% in Canada, where lockdowns in key markets such as Quebec and Ontario have been headwinds for several quarters now. Sales in the U.S. were driven by strong growth in both the commercial and retail segments with DIFM sales outperforming DIY for the first time since before the pandemic began to take hold in Q1 of 2020. 
The strengthening commercial sales environment is significant for us as it accounts for 80% of our total U.S. automotive revenue. The strong recovery in the commercial sector contributed to record average daily sales volume in our U.S. automotive business in June. 
Our sales drivers by product category include brakes, tools and equipment and undercar, which all outperformed. In addition, both retail and commercial ticket and traffic counts were strong for the second consecutive quarter -- so another really positive trend. 
By customer segment, retail sales remained strong throughout the quarter, with low double-digit sales growth on top of a healthy sales increase in the second quarter of last year. While the DIY market is pulling back from the highs of 2020, we are optimistic our ongoing investments will create sustainable retail growth. 
For commercial sales, each of our customer segments posted double-digit growth, which we attribute to the broad automotive recovery and investments in our sales team, our sales programs and our supply chain amongst other initiatives. This quarter, our strongest growth was with our major account partners and NAPA AutoCare Centers. 
We were also pleased with the growth in sales to our fleet and government accounts. This was the first quarter of positive year-over-year sales growth for this group since before the pandemic as they lag the overall automotive recovery in the U.S. We view this improvement as a meaningful indicator for further growth in the quarters ahead. 
As the automotive recovery continues, we expect our commercial sales opportunities to outpace retail, consistent with the long-term growth outlook for the aftermarket industry. We are confident in our growth strategy and our initiatives to deliver customer value and sell more parts for more cars across our global automotive operations. 
We also remain focused on enhancing our inventory availability, strengthening our supply chain and investing in our omnichannel capabilities, while expanding our global store footprint to further strengthen our competitive positioning. 
So now let's discuss the global Industrial Parts Group. Total sales for this group were $1.6 billion, a 20% increase from last year and up 7% from 2019. Comp sales rose 16% and reflect the fourth consecutive quarter of improving sales trends. A strong sales environment, combined with the execution of our operational initiatives drove a 9.5% segment margin, which is up 130 basis points from both 2020 and 2019. 
The ongoing market recovery over the last 12 months is in line with the strengthening industrial economy and the overall increase in activity we have seen across much of our customer base. The Purchasing Managers Index measured 60.6 in June, reflecting healthy levels of industrial expansion and mirroring trends we have seen throughout the majority of this year. Likewise, industrial production increased by 5.5% in the second quarter, representing the fourth consecutive quarter of expansion. 
Diving deeper into our Q2 sales, we experienced strong sales trends across each of our industries served and our product categories, other than safety supplies, which adds extraordinary sales in 2020 due to the pandemic. Several industry sectors stood out as their sales increased by 30% or more over last year, including equipment and machinery, automotive, aggregate and cement, equipment rental and oil and gas. In addition, our newly added fulfillment and logistics industry sector experienced tremendous growth. 
In the past several years of expanding this segment, we have found our broad offering of products and services fits well with the needs of these customers. To drive this growth, we remain focused on several strategic initiatives, which include the build-out of our industrial omnichannel capabilities with solid growth in digital sales via motion.com; our new inside sales center, which was established in 2019 is generating incremental sales from new Motion customers and we see room for further growth; the expansion of our services and value-add solutions businesses in areas such as equipment repair, conveyance and automation. 
Over the last few years, we have made several bolt-on acquisitions to build scale and continue to target additional M&A opportunities to further enhance our capabilities in these key areas. Enhanced pricing and product category management strategies to maximize profitable growth. The further optimization and automation of our supply chain network to improve operational productivity while delivering exceptional customer service. 
We are encouraged by Industrial's strong financial performance in the second quarter and the positive momentum we see in the overall industrial market. We believe the Motion team is well positioned to capitalize on this momentum and enhance our market leadership position. 
So in summary, each of our businesses did an exceptional job of operating through the quarter, and we couldn't be more proud and grateful for their strong Q2 performance. So now I'll turn the call over to Will. Will?"

I'd like to personally congratulate the entire global GPC team for the hard work and impressive results. The teams continue to build momentum and execute well. We remain focused on our defined strategic initiatives and despite the global uncertainties that continue to impact our operations, we're pleased with the strong sales growth, operating leverage and cash flow performance this quarter. 
Last quarter, we outlined our plans to create value as we leverage GPC global capabilities to simplify and integrate our operations. We do so to improve the customer experience, to increase the speed and efficiency of execution and to deliver winning performance. This includes continuous investments to position GPC for near- and long-term profitable growth. 
The key pillars of our investments include talent, sales effectiveness, digital, supply chain and emerging technologies. Around the globe, the teams executed well against our strategic priorities. For example, on talent, we announced last month that Naveen Krishna joined the company as Chief Information and Digital Officer. Naveen will help lead our strategy and execution for all technology and digital initiatives. He comes to GPC with more than 25 years of technology experience with companies such as Macy's, Home Depot, Target and FedEx. We're excited to welcome Naveen as we continue to innovate on the customer experience, accelerate the pace of technology execution and build capabilities that advance our long-term strategy. 
Other examples of recent talent investments include category management; field sales and services; indirect sourcing; pricing; diversity, equity, inclusion; digital; data and inventory; leadership, to name a few. Investment in our people is always a priority as we execute our mission to be an employer of choice. 
To highlight other examples of our initiative momentum in local execution, Paul and I recently had the opportunity to spend time in person with our European teammates. And they showcased great examples of the strategic initiatives and winning team performance. 
For example, we discussed details of the growth plans for a recent bolt-on investment, Winparts, an online leader of automotive parts and accessories.  We expect this investment to provide new capabilities and accelerate our European digital vision. 
We visited a best-in-class distribution facility in the Netherlands that increased operating productivity by approximately 20% over the past few years with automation investments and process excellence initiatives. We received an update on the consolidation of 10 back-office shared service centers in France to 1 national location in France to drive cost and process efficiencies and we saw firsthand the power and differentiation of the NAPA brand in the local market. 
Although these are only a few select examples in Europe, in each of our automotive and Industrial businesses, we see similar examples of focused strategic execution that are delivering results. We also executed well on our acquisition strategy during the quarter. The M&A environment is active, and we remain disciplined to pursue strategic and value-creating transactions. 
For example, in addition to Winparts, we completed several other bolt-on acquisitions to deliver growth, add capabilities and create value. The North American and European automotive teams completed various store acquisitions that increase our position in key strategic geographies and extend existing customer relationships. Our automotive team in Asia Pac also executed 2 bolt-on strategic acquisitions, including Rare Spares a market leader in the niche segment of automotive restoration parts and accessories; and PARts DB, a leading cloud-based product and supplier data platform that will enhance our e-commerce and data capabilities. 
We entered the third quarter with strong momentum as our automotive and Industrial markets recover and we execute our plans. We continue to analyze and respond to areas that challenge our daily operations, such as COVID-19, inflation, global logistics and product and labor availability. For example, the global and local procurement teams partner closely with all levels of our suppliers to effectively assess product availability and delivery trends. 
We have processes in place, backed with data and analytics to create visibility into direct and indirect inflation trends. We utilize GPC's scale and relationships, including dedicated GPC resources in Asia to address our global logistics needs. And we continue to address labor challenges with competitive pay and benefits, flexible work programs, creative incentives to attract talent, a differentiated culture and compelling career opportunities. We believe our team is well positioned to remain agile as we focus on what we can control and navigate these macro global headwinds. 
Overall, we're very pleased with our performance through the first half of the year and look forward to sharing our continued progress next quarter. I'll now turn the call over to Carol to review the financial details."

Total GPC sales were $4.8 billion in the second quarter, up 25%. Our gross margin improved to 35.3%, an increase from 33.8% last year or up 120 basis points from an adjusted gross margin of 34.1%. Our improvement in gross margin was prima",1359,"Thank you, Will. Total GPC sales were $4.8 billion in the second quarter, up 25%. Our gross margin improved to 35.3%, an increase from 33.8% last year or up 120 basis points from an adjusted gross margin of 34.1%. Our improvement in gross margin was primarily driven by the increase in supplier incentives although we also continue to benefit from channel and geographical mix shifts, positive product mix, strategic category management initiatives, including pricing and global sourcing strategies. 
In the second quarter, there was significant pricing activity with our suppliers, resulting in product cost inflation. We were positioned to pass these increases on to our customers and the impact of price inflation was neutral to gross margin. We estimate a 1.5% impact of inflation in automotive sales for the quarter and a 1% impact in Industrial. 
Based on the current environment, we expect this to increase further through the second half of the year. Our total adjusted operating and nonoperating expenses were $1.3 billion in the second quarter, up 28% from last year and 28.1% of sales. The increase from last year reflects the impact of several factors, including the prior year benefit of approximately $150 million in temporary savings related to the pandemic. 
The balance primarily relates to the increase in variable costs on the $1 billion in additional year-over-year sales. And to a lesser extent, we experienced rising cost pressures in areas such as wages, incentive compensation, freight, rents and health insurance, which we are managing. We also invested in projects associated with our transformation and other strategic initiatives to drive growth and enhance productivity. So overall, we continue to operate in line with our plans for the year, and we remain focused on gaining additional efficiency in the quarters ahead, as you heard from Paul and Will. 
On a segment basis, our total segment profit in the second quarter was $441 million, up a strong 35%. Our segment profit margin was 9.2% compared to 8.6% last year, a 65 basis point year-over-year improvement and up 100 basis points from 2019. So strong operating results and a reflection of the work we have done to streamline our operations and optimize our portfolio over the last several years. 
We would add that for the full year, we continue to expect our segment profit margin to improve by 20 to 30 basis points from 2020 or 60 to 70 basis points from 2019. This would represent our strongest margin in 5 years. 
Our tax rate for the second quarter was 27.2% on an adjusted basis, up from 24.1% last year. The increase in rate primarily reflects a higher U.K. tax rate, partially offset by stock compensation excess tax benefits.
Second quarter net income from continuing operations was $196 million with diluted earnings per share of $1.36.  Our adjusted net income was $253 million or $1.74 per share which compares to $191 million or $1.32 per share in the prior year, a 32% increase. 
Turning to our second quarter results by segment. Our automotive revenue was $3.2 billion, up 28% from last year.  Segment profit was $291 million, up 33%, with profit margin improved to 9.1%, up 30 basis points from 2020 and a 90 basis point increase from 2019. We attribute the margin gain to the positive market conditions in our Automotive business and our team's intense focus on the execution of our growth and operating initiatives. 
We're encouraged by the positive momentum we will carry into the balance of the year. Our Industrial sales were $1.6 billion in the quarter, up 20% from 2020. Segment profit of $150 million was up 38% from a year ago, and profit margin improved to a strong 9.5%, a 130 basis point increase from both 2020 and 2019. 
So with the strengthening sales environment and continued operational improvements, this group continues to post excellent operating results, and we expect Industrial to perform well through the balance of the year. Now let's turn our comments to the balance sheet. 
At June 30, our total accounts receivable is up 4%.  Despite the strong sales increase, this is primarily due to the additional sale of $300 million in receivables in the second half of 2020. Inventory was up 10%, consistent with our commitment to provide for inventory availability and our accounts payable increased 26%. 
Our AP to inventory ratio improved to 129% from 112% last year. We remain pleased with our progress in improving our overall working capital position. Our total debt is $2.5 billion, down $700 million or 22% from June of 2020 and down $160 million from December 31, 2020. 
We closed the second quarter with $2.5 billion in available liquidity and our total debt to adjusted EBITDA has improved to 1.6x from 2.9x last year. Our team has done an excellent job of improving our capital structure over the last year. We continue to generate strong cash flow with another $400 million in cash from operations in the second quarter and $700 million for the 6 months. 
For the full year, we expect our earnings growth and working capital to drive $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion in cash from operations and free cash flow of $900 million to $1.1 billion. Our key priorities for cash remain the reinvestment in our businesses through capital expenditures, M&A, the dividend and share repurchases. 
We have invested $90 million in capital expenditures thus far in the year, and we expect these investments to pick up further in the quarters ahead as we execute on additional investments to drive organic growth and improve efficiencies and productivity in our operations. As Will mentioned earlier, strategic acquisitions remain an important component of our long-term growth strategy. 
We've used approximately $97 million in cash for acquisitions through the 6 months and we continue to cultivate a strong pipeline of targeted names and expect to make additional strategic and bolt-on acquisitions to complement both our global automotive and Industrial segments as we move forward. 
Consistent with our long-standing dividend policy, we have also paid a total cash dividend of more than $232 million to our shareholders through the first half of this year. This reflects a 2021 annual dividend of $3.26 per share and represents our 65th consecutive annual increase in the dividend. 
Finally, as part of our share repurchase program, we have been active with share buybacks since 1994. In the second quarter, we used $184 million to acquire 1.4 million shares. The company is currently authorized to repurchase up to 13 million additional shares, and we expect to remain active in this program in the quarters ahead. 
Turning to our outlook for 2021. We are updating our full year guidance previously provided in our earnings release on April 22, 2021. In arriving at our updated guidance, we considered several factors, including our past performance and recent business trends, current growth plans and strategic initiatives, the potential for foreign exchange fluctuations, inflation and the global economic outlook. 
We also consider the continued uncertainties due to the market disruption such as with COVID-19 and its potential impact on our results. With these factors in mind, we expect total sales for 2021 to be in the range of plus 10% to plus 12%, an increase from our previous guidance of plus 5% to plus 7%. 
As usual, this excludes the benefit of any unannounced future acquisitions. By business, we are guiding to plus 11% to plus 13% total sales growth for the automotive segment, an increase from the plus 5% to plus 7%. And a total sales increase of plus 6% to plus 8% for the Industrial segment, an increase from the plus 4% to plus 6%. 
On the earnings side, we are raising our guidance for adjusted diluted earnings per share to a range of $6.20 to $6.35, which is up 18% to 20% from 2020. This represents an increase from our previous guidance of $5.85 to $6.05. We entered the third quarter focused on our initiatives to meet or exceed these targeted results, and we look forward to reporting on our financial performance as we go through the year. Thank you, and I'll now turn it back over to Paul."

So we wrapped up Q1 with a record sales month for us in March. That momentum carried into Q2. We had a really solid quarter with May, June being our strongest, June being the strongest month and a record month again. And then as we moved into July, again, pleased to say that, that's holding up. 
So we're really, really encouraged by what we're seeing in U.S. automotive. And specifically to DIY, we're not seeing a pullback in our strong DIY business. We're up low double digits in Q2 and our 2-year stack, I think, Chris, is well over 20%. So our teams have -- as you know, and we've talked about this in the past, we've worked incredibly hard to get our retail footprint in what we believe to be much better -- in a much better selling mode than we've ever been. 
So -- could it pull back a little bit with the lack of stimulus money hitting the economy? It could be. I think we'll see that perhaps in some of the more retail-focused competitors. But now we feel good. We feel good about our DIFM business and our DIY business going forward."

Look, as we look at our inflation, I would tell you, first of all, it is a bit unique and unprecedented as it relates to U.S. automotive for inflation. We haven't seen this kind of activity for a decade, if you will. And it is, as you mentioned, it's sort of similar to tariffs and at the pace that they're coming. Look, it is driven by what you said, a combination of raw materials and freight and labor. And our teams work very closely from a category management perspective to work with the suppliers to look at commodity tracking and the cost model and the supplier line reviews. And while we don't break out specifically how much is each component, trust me, the teams work with the suppliers on that. 
On the Industrial side, it's more normal. So I would tell you their inflation is definitely more normal. And so what we do think is that second half will be more active than Q2. So we could see as much as 2x the second quarter inflation rate in our second half. But again, couldn't be happier with the teams and all of our businesses and the work they're doing to pass those through to our customers and be able to get greater gross profit dollars but maintain our gross margin rate. So we're working hard on that, and we are definitely optimistic as we look ahead that we'll be able to do that again in the second half."

I mean all companies are seeing rising costs and inflation, certainly in wages and freight -- freight and as we mentioned, some other categories. We do think when we looked at our SG&A this quarter that our inflation in our SG&A was certainly greater than the product inflation so more like a 2% in our cost. And that ended up being about 50 to 60 basis points on our SG&A. And we certainly didn't have that in Q1. So we did have that in Q2. 
But look, we're working hard with investments in projects and again, whether -- Will mentioned it -- whether it's transformation or strategic investments in productivity.

Can you provide any more color on what that is? 
And then a related question. Obviously, you removed a lot of costs last year with the business. How has the pace of bringing those costs back been this year relative to your expectations? Have you been able to keep some of those structural costs out?"

So when we look at our SG&A, and I'll go about it a couple of different ways for the quarter. So this quarter, the comparison to last year was our highest level of temporary cost savings. We had over $150 million cost -- temporary cost savings last y",299,"Yes. So when we look at our SG&A, and I'll go about it a couple of different ways for the quarter. So this quarter, the comparison to last year was our highest level of temporary cost savings. We had over $150 million cost -- temporary cost savings last year in Q2, a significant portion was government subsidies, payroll reduction, delayed merit increases, furloughs. So we knew this would be our toughest quarter on those. So that's honestly about half of the increase in the dollar increase in SG&A. 
The increase in variable costs, as I mentioned, I mean, we have incremental $1 billion more in sales. So about 1/3 of the increase was related to bringing back the variable cost to handle the volume. And then the investments in projects, a relatively small amount, but an important amount. So that is investments.
Will mentioned some of the productivity improvements we're doing, we've got in our Industrial business, automation in their warehouses. In our automotive business, consolidating facilities and putting in further automation. Investments in pricing and digital initiatives. So that was roughly, say, 5% of the dollar increase. And then the remaining amount, roughly 10% of the dollar increase was the rising cost and inflation. 
What I would tell you is we have kept the permanent cost savings that we had last year, which ended up being $150 million on a target of $100 million. And in bringing back these costs, I mean, we had just a surge in growth. And so you do have to bring in those variable costs. What we didn't really expect was the rising cost and inflation, but thank goodness we did the work we did on the transformation team. And again, we continue to see some investments in projects as we look ahead."

Welcome to our third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. We are pleased to report strong financial results again this quarter, which reflect the consistent execution of our strategic priorities as the global markets co",1895,"Thank you, Sid, and good morning. Welcome to our third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. We are pleased to report strong financial results again this quarter, which reflect the consistent execution of our strategic priorities as the global markets continue to recover. As we size up the business climate and how we are managing through the recovery, we can report the GPC team is generating positive momentum in both our sales and operating results, and we are well positioned for both near- and long-term growth.
Despite inflationary pressures, our margins reflect the success of our category management initiatives and cost-control efforts, which have offset these increases. And finally, our strategic efforts with our global supplier partners have prevented significant shortfalls in our overall inventory levels, allowing us to deliver quality customer service.
Taking a look at our third quarter financial results. Total sales were $4.8 billion, up 10% from last year and up 11% from Q3 of 2019. We also produced our 16th consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion, and we further improved our productivity and customer service capabilities with the ongoing execution of our operational initiatives. As a result, segment profit increased 14% and our segment margin improved 30 basis points to 9.3%. This represents our strongest margin in 2 decades and confirms our key initiatives are driving meaningful improvement.
Net income was $229 million or $1.59 per diluted share, and adjusted net income was $270 million or $1.88 per share. This is a 15% increase from 2020 and establishes a new record for GPC's quarterly earnings. So just an outstanding job by the GPC team.
Total sales for global automotive also set a new record at $3.2 billion for the quarter. This represents an 8% increase from Q3 2020 and a 15% increase from Q3 of 2019. On a comp basis, sales were up 5% from last year and up 7% on a 2-year stack, with our strongest year-over-year automotive comps coming from the U.S. business. In addition, from a cadence perspective, sales held up well through the quarter, with the strongest average daily sales volume in each of our geographies coming in September.
The broad strength in our global automotive sales reflects a number of factors. First, we are proud of our team's efforts to shore up our supply chain amidst the difficult backdrop of product delays and logistics challenges. Supply chain disruptions have been more substantial for U.S. automotive than in our international or industrial operations, and we continue to work closely with our global suppliers to manage through these issues and ensure we have the right inventory available for our customers. We are confident in the effectiveness of our global sourcing team and believe we are well positioned in the industry.
We also continue to benefit from our key growth initiatives and market tailwinds. Among our growth initiatives, our emphasis on innovative sales programs and sales force effectiveness are positively impacting commercial sales. As examples, we've recently finalized an exclusive partnership in the education space for technician recruitment, with over 10,000 active tech students in the process of earning their credentials. We are also excited that NAPA and AAA have executed an agreement for NAPA to be the exclusive auto parts supplier for the new AAA-branded premium battery. This battery will be available to all consumers with a focus on the over 62 million AAA cardholders and 5,400 approved auto repair centers.
We are also equipping our sales team with incremental resources, training and development, which have led to more productive customer-facing calls. In addition, our omnichannel investments continue to drive strong B2B and B2C digital sales. And finally, the international rollout of the NAPA brand is driving significant growth in both our European and Asia Pac operations.
So now turning to the market tailwinds. These macro drivers include the following: the ongoing reopening of the economy and improving miles driven, which generate the need for more repairs and more maintenance; a robust used car market that is keeping more cars on the road longer; and improving aftermarket fundamentals, such as the growing and aging vehicle fleet, which will continue to benefit the industry over the long term.
Looking next at our automotive highlights by region. Total U.S. sales were up 9%. Comp sales increased 8% from last year and are up 5% on a 2-year stack. In Canada, total sales were up 1%, with comp sales essentially flat both year-over-year and on a 2-year stack as lockdowns in major markets have slowed the recovery. It's been encouraging to see these restrictions easing of late, which should lead to stronger demand through the final 3 months of 2021.
Our U.S. sales were driven by strong demand for product categories such as exhaust, ride control, brakes, tools and equipment, which all outperformed. In addition, both retail and commercial ticket and traffic counts were positive for the third consecutive quarter.
By customer segment, sales to both commercial and retail customers held strong, with DIFM sales outperforming DIY for the second straight quarter. We do remain pleased, however, with the continued strength of our DIY business and believe we can drive additional growth with ongoing initiatives such as B2C digital investments. These include new search features, improving catalog functionality and enhanced payment options such as buy now and pay later. NAPA online B2C sales continue to grow at a rapid pace, up over 40% from the third quarter and up 2x from 2019.
The strength in commercial sales in the quarter was driven by several of the initiatives mentioned earlier as well as the ongoing economic recovery in the U.S. Sales to our major account partners were strongest with mid-teen growth, followed by sales to our NAPA AutoCare customers, which were up low double digits. We would add that our NAPA AutoCare membership has surged with the reopening of markets and includes nearly 400 shop upgrades thus far in 2021. So really terrific momentum for our premier independent garage program.
Rounding out our commercial segments. Fleet and government and other wholesale customers also posted high single-digit growth for the quarter. So really strong results across all of our commercial accounts. These are encouraging trends. And as we look ahead, we remain confident in our growth strategy and our key priorities to deliver customer value and ultimately sell more parts for more cars.
Our AAG team in Europe continue to perform well, with total Q3 sales up 8% or up a strong 23% on a 2-year stack. Comp sales increased 2.5% from last year and were up 14% on a 2-year stack. While the U.K. and Benelux continue to stand out with really strong results, we were pleased with the solid results in each of our 7 European markets, a reflection of stable market conditions and execution of our key sales initiatives. These include the continued rollout of the NAPA brand and ongoing emphasis on key account development, which are driving market share gains.
Now looking at our Asia Pac business. Total sales were up 2% from 2020 and up 18% on a 2-year stack. Comp sales were up slightly from last year and up 15% on a 2-year stack, with both commercial and retail sales up double digits, driven by positive growth with both the Repco and NAPA brands. We are really pleased with these results given the severe lockdowns in the major markets of Sydney, Melbourne and Auckland during much of the quarter. We are energized to see the reopening of these markets is finally getting underway, and we expect a surge in demand in the coming months.
So now let's discuss the global Industrial segment. Total sales for this segment were $1.6 billion, a strong 15% increase from last year and a 5% increase from 2019. Comp sales were up 13% and up 4% on a 2-year stack. Through the quarter, average daily sales in July and August were in line with the second quarter, while our strongest results were in the month of September. This quarter's positive momentum in Industrial exceeded our expectations, which is a reflection of the great work by our Motion team and the strengthening of the industrial economy. Both the PMI and industrial production were positive for the quarter, and these indicators correlate closely to the overall healthy state of the industrial sales climate.
For the second consecutive quarter, we had positive sales growth across each of our industries served. The industry sectors that stood out with double-digit growth include our largest customer segment, equipment and machinery, as well as iron and steel, automotive, aggregate and cement, lumber and wood, fabricated metals equipment rental and oil and gas. In addition, our newly added fulfillment and logistics industry experienced tremendous growth. So as you can see, the current growth in our Industrial business is quite broad across the markets we serve.
As we have conveyed in our prior calls and in our industrial deep-dive event on September 15, our Motion business is a market leader in the industrial distribution space in North America and Australasia. The MI team strive to be the preferred industrial solutions provider in the industries we serve. We partner with the best manufacturers in the industry to provide Tier 1 brands our customers' demand. In addition, we are constantly broadening our product offering as well as our service capabilities to maximize our sales potential and drive market share gains in a very large and fragmented market.
With these fundamentals of our business in mind, our focus on continued profitable growth in this segment remain grounded in 5 key initiatives: an omnichannel build-out to accelerate e-commerce growth and drive sales with new customers. As examples, motion.com and our inside sales center, which has grown from 15 to now 35 reps in just 6 months, continue to drive incremental sales from new Motion customers; the expansion of our industrial services and value-add solutions in areas such as equipment repair, conveyance and automation; strategic M&A to generate significant growth in new markets and new products and services as an industry consolidator; enhanced strategy to create a dynamic pricing environment that provides us a competitive advantage in the marketplace; and lastly, network optimization and automation to further improve our operating efficiencies and productivity. We are pleased with the progress from these initiatives thus far, and we are excited for the opportunities ahead.
Another third quarter highlight is the publication of our 2021 Sustainability Report update. Our initiatives and activities over the past year have led to continued progress toward our goal of promoting diversity, equity and inclusion. We've also taken steps to reduce the environmental footprint of our operations by reducing energy and emissions while increasing recycling opportunities across the globe. 2020 tested all of us and accentuated the importance of supporting our people and our communities. We are really proud of our GPC teammates around the world for their resilience and contributions to furthering our sustainability goals. We invite you to learn more about these initiatives in our full report, which you can find on the GPC website.
So in summary, we made great progress in several important areas during the third quarter. And we are very pleased with the strong results in our automotive and industrial businesses and the continued improvement in our sales and operations. We could not be more proud of the GPC team.
Now I'll turn the call over to Will. Will?"

First, let me reiterate Paul's comments and acknowledge the continued strong team performance this quarter. It's always a proud moment to have the opportunity to showcase our global team's hard work, relentless customer service and winning performance. It's a challenging environment, and teams have done an exceptional job to adjust and deliver results.
We continue to remain focused on our key pillars, including talent, sales effectiveness, digital, supply chain and emerging technology. Teams are executing initiatives well and consider strategic initiatives a central part of our operating cadence. The teams have rigor around measurement and progress visibility. We measure unique global initiatives and are ahead of our 2021 plan established at the beginning of the year.
As we execute our GPC strategic planning process for the upcoming year, we reflect on, learn from and refine our priority initiative execution. In addition, through the year, we share best practices around the globe for common strategies to help us continuously learn and improve as One GPC team. While our geographies and end markets are diverse, we share similar GPC global initiatives, all designed to deliver profitable growth in excess of market growth, operating leverage and free cash flow.
Despite a challenging environment, we're pleased to see more normal team activities and customer activities starting to be possible in most of our geographies. We recently had the opportunity to meet in person with the U.S. automotive executive and field management team in Atlanta. We listened to field feedback, shared performance trends, enjoyed team camaraderie, introduced new talent and collaborated on strategic priorities for the upcoming year.
Similarly, approximately 70 of our Motion executive and field leaders from around the country recently had the chance to meet in person for the first time since early 2020 to detail business performance and review strategic initiative priorities.
In Europe, our AAG executive leadership team recently met together in person for the first time in nearly 2 years. Our Atlanta-based GPC and U.S. NAPA field support team also hosted an employee appreciation event for 400 teammates that included a well-received visit from our celebrity NAPA racing teammates, including Chase Eli.
We're cautiously optimistic our teams in Australasia will soon be able to exit lockdown in November and also return to a more normal in-person routine. At each of these events, it's energizing to see the positive attitudes, strong team alignment and visible excitement about our GPC momentum and vision. It's also reassuring to see our differentiated GPC culture up close and intact.
Paul and I have also had the opportunity to spend time in person with customers and vendors this quarter. These discussions are critically important as we share our growth vision, listen to feedback and explore ways to deepen our strategic partnerships. These conversations not only reinforce our GPC core strategic priorities, talent, sales effectiveness, digital and tech, supply chain and emerging tech, but also always affirm the unique customer value propositions across our GPC businesses. Growth, technology solutions, supply chain excellence, product and technical expertise and long-standing local relationships are always key themes.
As an example, we recently visited with an industrial customer who is enjoying exponential growth. Our Motion teammates co-locate associates at the customer facility to provide real-time expertise on the plant floor to ensure the facility is operating to its potential. Part of the discussions with this customer explored the use of embedded technology solutions that will make customer ordering from Motion easier and faster. We're building plans to triple the size of this customer relationship over the next few years.
In our customer discussions, a recent common theme is the supply chain challenges that face our company. We explain, we believe our global scale, in-country resources, data and analytics, investments in our supply chain, strategic inventory actions and proactive daily team approach position us to navigate the headwinds relative to others. We're in constant discussion with highest levels of our supplier partners, many of which for whom GPC represents a large and important global customer. Over the past quarter, we've held numerous top-to-top meetings with our global executive leadership and vendor partners to review progress and jointly problem solve. It's a challenging environment but our global teams and partners are proactively acting each day to navigate it.
Turning to our focus on talent. We recently completed an end-to-end strategic review of our global GPC employee value proposition and talent initiatives. This disciplined work ensures we have the right capabilities aligned to our current and future business strategies. The work also ensures we're constantly striving to be an employer of choice in this dynamic and competitive talent environment.
Around the globe, we continue to take deliberate action to lead, recognize and ensure the well-being of our teams. For example, we recently streamlined recruiting processes to move faster to attract talent, introduced new wellness incentives, improved holiday schedules, enhanced vacation eligibility and flexibility, invested in health care costs to reduce the burden on our associates, improved tuition reimbursement programs and relaxed dress code policies, to name a few. As talent is our most important advantage, we'll always work to take care of and invest in our people.
We also continue to execute well against our broader digital and technology initiatives. During the quarter, the teams have made exciting progress under leadership of our new Chief Information and Digital Officer, Naveen Krishna. We're focused on building high-performing teams that engineer technology to solve customers' problems at scale. In addition, we'll optimize human and financial resources to focus on the most critical and impactful activities.
Our emerging technology initiatives, including electric vehicles and related technologies, also continue to advance. The global teams are partnering well to execute a disciplined and coordinated strategy. We're pleased with the team momentum, and we'll continue to dedicate resources to this exciting effort.
Last, the teams are executing our M&A strategy with discipline. For example, we added several store groups to our North American and European automotive network to increase local market density, and we announced the acquisition of J&S Automotive Distributors, a leading automotive parts distributor in Ireland. This new geography represents the 15th country in which GPC operates.
In addition, we were pleased to recently sign a definitive agreement to acquire Auto Accessories Garage, a leading U.S.-based digital platform specializing in automotive accessories. This strategic digital acquisition adds new capabilities and accelerates the strategic product category for the U.S. automotive team. The acquisition pipeline is active, and we remain disciplined to prioritize transactions we believe meet all of our GPC strategic and financial criterion. We are thrilled to welcome our newest teammates to the global GPC family.
Overall, we are really pleased with the record-setting team performance. Despite uncontrollable headwinds, the teams continue to rally together each day to service customers and deliver performance. We look forward to working hard to close the year strong and build on our solid momentum as we move forward into 2022.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Carol to review the financial details."

We are very pleased with our third quarter financial performance, and we look forward to sharing a few additional details with you.Recapping revenues. Total GPC sales were $4.8 billion in the",1366,"Thank you, Will, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. We are very pleased with our third quarter financial performance, and we look forward to sharing a few additional details with you.
Recapping revenues. Total GPC sales were $4.8 billion in the third quarter, up 10%. Gross margin improved to 35.5%, an increase of 50 basis points from 35.0% last year. Our improvement in gross margin was primarily driven by the increase in supplier incentives due to improved volumes and the positive impact of strategic category management initiatives.
In the third quarter, we had continued pricing activity with our suppliers as anticipated, resulting in additional product cost inflation. Our team was positioned to address these increases with effective pricing and global sourcing strategies, and price inflation proved neutral to gross margin.
On a total company basis, we estimate a 3% inflationary impact on Q3 sales, consisting of 3.5% inflation in global automotive and 1% to 2% in industrial. Based on current trends, we expect to see additional price inflation in the fourth quarter, and we will utilize our strategies to protect our gross margin as appropriate.
Our total adjusted operating and nonoperating expenses were $1.35 billion in the third quarter, up 11% from 2020 and 28% of sales. The increase from last year is due to several factors, including the prior year benefit of approximately $60 million in temporary savings related to the pandemic. Additionally, our third quarter expenses reflect the increase in variable costs on the $450 million in additional year-over-year sales as well as cost pressures in areas such as wages, incentive compensation, freight, rents and health insurance. We continue to execute on our ongoing initiatives to control expenses and improve our operations. While pleased with our progress thus far, we see room for further improvement in the quarters ahead.
Our total segment profit in the third quarter was $447 million, up 14%. Our segment profit margin was 9.3% compared to 9.0% last year, a 30 basis point year-over-year improvement and up 130 basis points from 2019. So we're really pleased with the continued improvement and the excellent work by our team.
Looking ahead, we raised our margin expectations for the full year, and we currently expect segment profit margin to improve 40 to 50 basis points from 2020 or 80 to 90 basis points from 2019. This would be our strongest full year margin in more than 20 years. Our tax rate for the third quarter was 24.9% on an adjusted basis, up from 23.4% last year, with the increase in rate primarily related to income mix shift to higher-tax jurisdictions.
Our third quarter net income from continuing operations was $229 million with diluted earnings per share of $1.59. Our adjusted net income was $270 million or $1.88 per diluted share, which compares to $237 million or $1.63 per adjusted diluted share in the prior year, a 15% increase.
So turning to our third quarter results by segment. Our total automotive revenue was $3.2 billion, up 8% from last year. Our segment profit increased 6% to $281 million with profit margin a solid 8.8%. While down 20 basis points from 2020 due to the prior year benefit of temporary savings, this represents an 80 basis point margin improvement over 2019 and reflects the underlying progress in our operations.
For the 9 months, profit margin is 8.6%, up 80 basis points from 2020 and up 90 basis points from 2019, driven primarily by margin expansion in our U.S. and European operations. Our Industrial sales were $1.6 billion, up 15% from 2020. Segment profit of $166 million was up a strong 32% from a year ago, and profit margin improved to 10.3%. This is 140 basis points from 2020 and up 220 basis points from 2019 and the first double-digit margin for Industrial since the fourth quarter of 2006. Year-to-date, profit margin for this segment is 9.4%, up 120 basis points from 2020 and up 150 basis points from 2019. So this group is executing very well and posting excellent operating results through the industrial recovery.
So now let's turn our comments to the balance sheet. At September 30, total accounts receivable is down 3.5%, primarily due to the timing of the $300 million in accounts receivables sold in October of 2020. Inventory was up 10%, in line with our sales increase and a reflection of our commitment to having the right parts in the right place at the right time. Accounts payable increased 20% from last year due to the increase in inventory and favorable payment terms with certain suppliers. Our AP-to-inventory ratio improved to 129% from 118% last year.
Our total debt is $2.4 billion, down $474 million or 16% from September of last year and down $245 million from December 31, 2020. We closed the third quarter with available liquidity of $2.4 billion, and our total debt to adjusted EBITDA improved to 1.5x from 2.2x last year. So our teams continue to do an outstanding job of optimizing our working capital and our capital structure.
We also continue to generate strong cash flow with another $300 million in cash from operations in the third quarter and $1 billion for the 9 months. For the full year, we expect our earnings growth and working capital to drive $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion in cash from operations and free cash flow of $950 million to $1.15 billion.
Our key priorities for cash remain the reinvestment in our businesses through capital expenditures, M&A, share repurchases and the dividend. For the 9 months, we have invested $138 million in capital expenditures, and we have plans for additional investments to drive organic growth and improve efficiencies and productivity in our operations through the balance of the year.
In addition, we have used approximately $143 million in cash for strategic acquisitions to accelerate growth. These investments include several automotive store groups across our markets, including the entry into Ireland discussed earlier. We continue to generate a robust pipeline of additional strategic and bolt-on acquisitions in both automotive and industrial segments. This would include Auto Accessories Garage, as mentioned before, which we expect to close in the fourth quarter.
Consistent with our long-standing dividend policy, we have also paid a total cash dividend of more than $349 million to our shareholders through the 9 months. The company has paid a dividend every year since going public in 1948 and has increased the dividend for 65 consecutive years. And as part of our share repurchase program, we have also been active with share buybacks dating back to 1994. In the third quarter, we used $100 million to purchase 800,000 shares, and year-to-date, we have used $284 million to purchase 2.2 million shares. The company is currently authorized to repurchase up to 12.2 million additional shares, and we expect to remain active in this program in the quarters ahead.
So turning to our current outlook for 2021. We are raising our full year guidance previously provided in our earnings release on July 22, 2021. We expect total sales for 2021 to be in the range of plus 12% to plus 13%, an increase from our previous guidance of plus 10% to plus 12%. As usual, this excludes the benefit of any unannounced future acquisitions.
By business, we are guiding to plus 14% to plus 15% total sales growth for the automotive segment, an increase from plus 11% to plus 13%; and a total sales increase of plus 10% to plus 11% for the industrial segment, an increase from plus 6% to plus 8%.
On the earnings side, we're raising our guidance for adjusted diluted earnings per share to a range of $6.60 to $6.65, which is up 25% to 26% from 2020. This represents an increase from our previous guidance of $6.20 to $6.35. So we're encouraged by the strength in our financial results for the third quarter and the 9 months, and we enter the fourth quarter focused on our initiatives to meet or exceed our outlook for the year. We look forward to reporting on our financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year in February.
Thank you, and I'll now turn it back over to Paul."

But quite honestly, in addition to that and especially when you look at the year-to-date numbers, it is the benefit -- the ongoing benefit of all our category management initiatives, which includes pricing and global sourcing.
So I think in the quarter, you did have more of an impact related to volume incentives. But I think, again, taking into account everything and inflation, quite honestly, was neutral to our rate. So as we look ahead, we're not concerned about gross margin in Q4. And in fact, contemplated in our guidance and our outlook is that we would continue to have a positive impact in Q4, which would have us be positive for the year and then also extremely positive on a 2-year stack basis."

But I think more important and more significant is just the true wage inflation that we're seeing. Having said that, though, again, we couldn't be more pleased with the team's hard work in really permanently reducing our cost structure and being able to offset a lot of that inflationary impact with some of our initiatives.

And the timing of when they go to market is a factor in that as well.
So there will be some that carries over into next year, certainly, but it's a day-to-day, week-to-week negotiation right now. It is more normal inflation in industrial, so keep that in mind. The 1% to 2% is just more normal inflation for them. It's really the U.S. automotive that's got the heightened inflation, again, international automotive a little more normal.
So we will have some that goes into next year, but again, teams are doing a great job to work through that and have improvement."

Welcome to our third quarter 2021 earnings conference call.

Welcome to our third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. We are pleased to report strong financial results again this quarter, which reflect the consistent execution of our strategic priorities as the global markets continue to recover. As we size up the business climate and how we are managing through the recovery, we can report the GPC team is generating positive momentum in both our sales and operating results, and we are well positioned for both near- and long-term growth. 
Despite inflationary pressures, our margins reflect the success of our category management initiatives and cost-control efforts, which have offset these increases. And finally, our strategic efforts with our global supplier partners have prevented significant shortfalls in our overall inventory levels, allowing us to deliver quality customer service. 
Taking a look at our third quarter financial results. Total sales were $4.8 billion, up 10% from last year and up 11% from Q3 of 2019. We also produced our 16th consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion, and we further improved our productivity and customer service capabilities with the ongoing execution of our operational initiatives. As a result, segment profit increased 14% and our segment margin improved 30 basis points to 9.3%. This represents our strongest margin in 2 decades and confirms our key initiatives are driving meaningful improvement. 
Net income was $229 million or $1.59 per diluted share, and adjusted net income was $270 million or $1.88 per share. This is a 15% increase from 2020 and establishes a new record for GPC's quarterly earnings. So just an outstanding job by the GPC team. 
Total sales for global automotive also set a new record at $3.2 billion for the quarter. This represents an 8% increase from Q3 2020 and a 15% increase from Q3 of 2019. On a comp basis, sales were up 5% from last year and up 7% on a 2-year stack, with our strongest year-over-year automotive comps coming from the U.S. business. In addition, from a cadence perspective, sales held up well through the quarter, with the strongest average daily sales volume in each of our geographies coming in September. 
The broad strength in our global automotive sales reflects a number of factors. First, we are proud of our team's efforts to shore up our supply chain amidst the difficult backdrop of product delays and logistics challenges. Supply chain disruptions have been more substantial for U.S. automotive than in our international or industrial operations, and we continue to work closely with our global suppliers to manage through these issues and ensure we have the right inventory available for our customers. We are confident in the effectiveness of our global sourcing team and believe we are well positioned in the industry. 
We also continue to benefit from our key growth initiatives and market tailwind. Among our growth initiatives, our emphasis on innovative sales programs and sales force effectiveness are positively impacting commercial sales. As examples, we've recently finalized an exclusive partnership in the education space for technician recruitment, with over 10,000 active tech students in the process of earning their credentials. We are also excited that NAPA and AAA have executed an agreement for NAPA to be the exclusive auto parts supplier for the new AAA-branded premium battery. This battery will be available to all consumers with a focus on the over 62 million AAA cardholders and 5,400 approved auto repair centers. 
We are also equipping our sales team with incremental resources, training and development, which have led to more productive customer-facing calls. In addition, our omnichannel investments continue to drive strong B2B and B2C digital sales. And finally, the international rollout of the NAPA brand is driving significant growth in both our European and Asia Pac operations. 
So now turning to the market tailwinds. These macro drivers include the following: the ongoing reopening of the economy and improving miles driven, which generate the need for more repairs and more maintenance; a robust used car market that is keeping more cars on the road longer; and improving aftermarket fundamentals, such as the growing and aging vehicle fleet, which will continue to benefit the industry over the long term. 
Looking next at our automotive highlights by region. Total U.S. sales were up 9%. Comp sales increased 8% from last year and are up 5% on a 2-year stack. In Canada, total sales were up 1%, with comp sales essentially flat both year-over-year and on a 2-year stack as lockdowns in major markets have slowed the recovery. It's been encouraging to see these restrictions easing of late, which should lead to stronger demand through the final 3 months of 2021. 
Our U.S. sales were driven by strong demand for product categories such as exhaust, ride control, brakes, tools and equipment, which all outperformed. In addition, both retail and commercial ticket and traffic counts were positive for the third consecutive quarter. 
By customer segment, sales to both commercial and retail customers held strong, with DIFM sales outperforming DIY for the second straight quarter. We do remain pleased, however, with the continued strength of our DIY business and believe we can drive additional growth with ongoing initiatives such as B2C digital investments. These include new search features, improving catalog functionality and enhanced payment options such as buy now and pay later. NAPA online B2C sales continue to grow at a rapid pace, up over 40% from the third quarter and up 2x from 2019. 
The strength in commercial sales in the quarter was driven by several of the initiatives mentioned earlier as well as the ongoing economic recovery in the U.S. Sales to our major account partners were strongest with mid-teen growth, followed by sales to our NAPA AutoCare customers, which were up low double digits. We would add that our NAPA AutoCare membership has surged with the reopening of markets and includes nearly 400 shop upgrades thus far in 2021. So really terrific momentum for our premier independent garage program. 
Rounding out our commercial segments. Fleet and government and other wholesale customers also posted high single-digit growth for the quarter. So really strong results across all of our commercial accounts. These are encouraging trends. And as we look ahead, we remain confident in our growth strategy and our key priorities to deliver customer value and ultimately sell more parts for more cars. 
Our AAG team in Europe continue to perform well, with total Q3 sales up 8% or up a strong 23% on a 2-year stack. Comp sales increased 2.5% from last year and were up 14% on a 2-year stack. While the U.K. and Benelux continue to stand out with really strong results, we were pleased with the solid results in each of our 7 European markets, a reflection of stable market conditions and execution of our key sales initiatives. These include the continued rollout of the NAPA brand and ongoing emphasis on key account development, which are driving market share gains. 
Now looking at our Asia Pac business. Total sales were up 2% from 2020 and up 18% on a 2-year stack. Comp sales were up slightly from last year and up 15% on a 2-year stack, with both commercial and retail sales up double digits, driven by positive growth with both the Repco and NAPA brands. We are really pleased with these results given the severe lockdowns in the major markets of Sydney, Melbourne and Auckland during much of the quarter. We are energized to see the reopening of these markets is finally getting underway, and we expect a surge in demand in the coming months. 
So now let's discuss the global industrial segment. Total sales for this segment were $1.6 billion, a strong 15% increase from last year and a 5% increase from 2019. Comp sales were up 13% and up 4% on a 2-year stack. Through the quarter, average daily sales in July and August were in line with the second quarter, while our strongest results were in the month of September. This quarter's positive momentum in industrial exceeded our expectations, which is a reflection of the great work by our Motion team and the strengthening of the industrial economy. Both the PMI and industrial production were positive for the quarter, and these indicators correlate closely to the overall healthy state of the industrial sales climate. 
For the second consecutive quarter, we had positive sales growth across each of our industries served. The industry sectors that stood out with double-digit growth include our largest customer segment, equipment and machinery, as well as iron and steel, automotive, aggregate and cement, lumber and wood, fabricated metals, equipment rental and oil and gas. In addition, our newly added fulfillment and logistics industry experienced tremendous growth. So as you can see, the current growth in our Industrial business is quite broad across the markets we serve. 
As we have conveyed in our prior calls and in our industrial deep-dive event on September 15, our Motion business is a market leader in the industrial distribution space in North America and Australasia. The MI team strive to be the preferred industrial solutions provider in the industries we serve. We partner with the best manufacturers in the industry to provide Tier 1 brands our customers' demand. In addition, we are constantly broadening our product offering as well as our service capabilities to maximize our sales potential and drive market share gains in a very large and fragmented market. 
With these fundamentals of our business in mind, our focus on continued profitable growth in this segment remain grounded in 5 key initiatives: an omnichannel build-out to accelerate e-commerce growth and drive sales with new customers. As examples, motion.com and our inside sales center, which has grown from 15 to now 35 reps in just 6 months, continue to drive incremental sales from new Motion customers; the expansion of our industrial services and value-add solutions in areas such as equipment repair, conveyance and automation; strategic M&A to generate significant growth in new markets and new products and services as an industry consolidator; enhanced strategy to create a dynamic pricing environment that provides us a competitive advantage in the marketplace; and lastly, network optimization and automation to further improve our operating efficiencies and productivity. We are pleased with the progress from these initiatives thus far, and we are excited for the opportunities ahead. 
Another third quarter highlight is the publication of our 2021 Sustainability Report update. Our initiatives and activities over the past year have led to continued progress toward our goal of promoting diversity, equity and inclusion. We've also taken steps to reduce the environmental footprint of our operations by reducing energy and emissions while increasing recycling opportunities across the globe. 2020 tested all of us and accentuated the importance of supporting our people and our communities. We are really proud of our GPC teammates around the world for their resilience and contributions to furthering our sustainability goals. We invite you to learn more about these initiatives and our full report, which you can find on the GPC website. 
So in summary, we made great progress in several important areas during the third quarter. And we are very pleased with the strong results in our automotive and industrial businesses and the continued improvement in our sales and operations. We could not be more proud of the GPC team. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Will. Will?"

First, let me reiterate Paul's comments and acknowledge the continued strong team performance this quarter. It's always a proud moment to have the opportunity to showcase our global team's hard work, relentless customer service and winning performance. It's a challenging environment, and teams have done an exceptional job to adjust and deliver results. 
We continue to remain focused on our key pillars, including talent, sales effectiveness, digital, supply chain and emerging technology. Teams are executing initiatives well and consider strategic initiatives a central part of our operating cadence. The teams have rigor around measurement and progress visibility. We measure unique global initiatives and are ahead of our 2021 plan established at the beginning of the year. 
As we execute our GPC strategic planning process for the upcoming year, we reflect on, learn from and refine our priority initiative execution. In addition, through the year, we share best practices around the globe for common strategies to help us continuously learn and improve as One GPC team. While our geographies and end markets are diverse, we share similar GPC global initiatives, all designed to deliver profitable growth in excess of market growth, operating leverage and free cash flow. 
Despite a challenging environment, we're pleased to see more normal team activities and customer activities starting to be possible in most of our geographies. We recently had the opportunity to meet in person with the U.S. automotive executive and field management team in Atlanta. We listened to field feedback, shared performance trends, enjoyed team camaraderie, introduced new talent and collaborated on strategic priorities for the upcoming year. 
Similarly, approximately 70 of our Motion executive and field leaders from around the country recently had the chance to meet in person for the first time since early 2020 to detail business performance and review strategic initiative priorities. 
In Europe, our AAG executive leadership team recently met together in person for the first time in nearly 2 years. Our Atlanta-based GPC and U.S. NAPA field support team also hosted an employee appreciation event for 400 teammates that included a well-received visit from our celebrity NAPA racing teammates, including Chase Elliott. 
We're cautiously optimistic our teams in Australasia will soon be able to exit lockdown in November and also return to a more normal in-person routine. At each of these events, it's energizing to see the positive attitudes, strong team alignment and visible excitement about our GPC momentum and vision. It's also reassuring to see our differentiated GPC culture up close and intact. 
Paul and I have also had the opportunity to spend time in person with customers and vendors this quarter. These discussions are critically important as we share our growth vision, listen to feedback and explore ways to deepen our strategic partnerships. These conversations not only reinforce our GPC core strategic priorities, talent, sales effectiveness, digital and tech, supply chain and emerging tech, but also always affirm the unique customer value propositions across our GPC businesses. Growth, technology solutions, supply chain excellence, product and technical expertise and long-standing local relationships are always key themes. 
As an example, we recently visited with an industrial customer who is enjoying exponential growth. Our Motion teammates co-locate associates at the customer facility to provide real-time expertise on the plant floor to ensure the facility is operating to its potential. Part of the discussions with this customer explored the use of embedded technology solutions that will make customer ordering from Motion easier and faster. We're building plans to triple the size of this customer relationship over the next few years. 
In our customer discussions, a recent common theme is the supply chain challenges that face our company. We explain, we believe our global scale, in-country resources, data and analytics, investments in our supply chain, strategic inventory actions and proactive daily team approach position us to navigate the headwinds relative to others. We're in constant discussion with highest levels of our supplier partners, many of which for whom GPC represents a large and important global customer. Over the past quarter, we've held numerous top-to-top meetings with our global executive leadership and vendor partners to review progress and jointly problem solve. It's a challenging environment but our global teams and partners are proactively acting each day to navigate it. 
Turning to our focus on talent. We recently completed an end-to-end strategic review of our global GPC employee value proposition and talent initiatives. This disciplined work ensures we have the right capabilities aligned to our current and future business strategies. The work also ensures we're constantly striving to be an employer of choice in this dynamic and competitive talent environment. 
Around the globe, we continue to take deliberate action to lead, recognize and ensure the well-being of our teams. For example, we recently streamlined recruiting processes to move faster to attract talent, introduced new wellness incentives, improved holiday schedules, enhanced vacation eligibility and flexibility, invested in health care costs to reduce the burden on our associates, improved tuition reimbursement programs and relaxed dress code policies, to name a few. As talent is our most important advantage, we'll always work to take care of and invest in our people. 
We also continue to execute well against our broader digital and technology initiatives. During the quarter, the teams have made exciting progress under leadership of our new Chief Information and Digital Officer, Naveen Krishna. We're focused on building high-performing teams that engineer technology to solve customers' problems at scale. In addition, we'll optimize human and financial resources to focus on the most critical and impactful activities. Our emerging technology initiatives, including electric vehicles and related technologies, also continue to advance. The global teams are partnering well to execute a disciplined and coordinated strategy. We're pleased with the team momentum, and we'll continue to dedicate resources to this exciting effort. 
Last, the teams are executing our M&A strategy with discipline. For example, we added several store groups to our North American and European automotive network to increase local market density, and we announced the acquisition of J&S Automotive Distributors, a leading automotive parts distributor in Ireland. This new geography represents the 15th country in which GPC operates. 
In addition, we were pleased to recently sign a definitive agreement to acquire Auto Accessories Garage, a leading U.S.-based digital platform specializing in automotive accessories. This strategic digital acquisition adds new capabilities and accelerates the strategic product category for the U.S. automotive team. The acquisition pipeline is active, and we remain disciplined to prioritize transactions we believe meet all of our GPC strategic and financial criterion. We are thrilled to welcome our newest teammates to the global GPC family. 
Overall, we are really pleased with the record-setting team performance. Despite uncontrollable headwinds, the teams continue to rally together each day to service customers and deliver performance. We look forward to working hard to close the year strong and build on our solid momentum as we move forward into 2022. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Carol to review the financial details."
275034,1682439420,2409097,"Genuine Parts Company, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2021",2021-10-21,"Earnings Calls","Genuine Parts Company","Executives","Thank you, Will, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. We are very pleased with our third quarter financial performance, and we look forward to sharing a few additional details with you. Recapping revenues.

We are very pleased with our third quarter financial performance, and we look forward to sharing a few additional details with you. 
Recapping revenues. Total GPC sales were $4.8 billion in the third quarter, up 10%. Gross margin improved to 35.5%, an increase of 50 basis points from 35.0% last year. Our improvement in gross margin was primarily driven by the increase in supplier incentives due to improved volumes and the positive impact of strategic category management initiatives. 
In the third quarter, we had continued pricing activity with our suppliers as anticipated, resulting in additional product cost inflation. Our team was positioned to address these increases with effective pricing and global sourcing strategies, and price inflation proved neutral to gross margin. 
On a total company basis, we estimate a 3% inflationary impact on Q3 sales, consisting of 3.5% inflation in global automotive and 1% to 2% in industrial. Based on current trends, we expect to see additional price inflation in the fourth quarter, and we will utilize our strategies to protect our gross margin as appropriate. 
Our total adjusted operating and nonoperating expenses were $1.35 billion in the third quarter, up 11% from 2020 and 28% of sales. The increase from last year is due to several factors, including the prior year benefit of approximately $60 million in temporary savings related to the pandemic. Additionally, our third quarter expenses reflect the increase in variable costs on the $450 million in additional year-over-year sales as well as cost pressures in areas such as wages, incentive compensation, freight, rents and health insurance. We continue to execute on our ongoing initiatives to control expenses and improve our operations. While pleased with our progress thus far, we see room for further improvement in the quarters ahead. 
Our total segment profit in the third quarter was $447 million, up 14%. Our segment profit margin was 9.3% compared to 9.0% last year, a 30 basis point year-over-year improvement and up 130 basis points from 2019. So we're really pleased with the continued improvement and the excellent work by our team. 
Looking ahead, we raised our margin expectations for the full year, and we currently expect segment profit margin to improve 40 to 50 basis points from 2020 or 80 to 90 basis points from 2019. This would be our strongest full year margin in more than 20 years. Our tax rate for the third quarter was 24.9% on an adjusted basis, up from 23.4% last year, with the increase in rate primarily related to income mix shift to higher-tax jurisdictions. 
Our third quarter net income from continuing operations was $229 million with diluted earnings per share of $1.59. Our adjusted net income was $270 million or $1.88 per diluted share, which compares to $237 million or $1.63 per adjusted diluted share in the prior year, a 15% increase. 
So turning to our third quarter results by segment. Our total automotive revenue was $3.2 billion, up 8% from last year. Our segment profit increased 6% to $281 million with profit margin a solid 8.8%. While down 20 basis points from 2020 due to the prior year benefit of temporary savings, this represents an 80 basis point margin improvement over 2019 and reflects the underlying progress in our operations. 
For the 9 months, profit margin is 8.6%, up 80 basis points from 2020 and up 90 basis points from 2019, driven primarily by margin expansion in our U.S. and European operations. Our industrial sales were $1.6 billion, up 15% from 2020. Segment profit of $166 million was up a strong 32% from a year ago, and profit margin improved to 10.3%. This is 140 basis points from 2020 and up 220 basis points from 2019 and the first double-digit margin for industrial since the fourth quarter of 2006. Year-to-date, profit margin for this segment is 9.4%, up 120 basis points from 2020 and up 150 basis points from 2019. So this group is executing very well and posting excellent operating results through the industrial recovery. 
So now let's turn our comments to the balance sheet. At September 30, total accounts receivable is down 3.5%, primarily due to the timing of the $300 million in accounts receivables sold in October of 2020. Inventory was up 10%, in line with our sales increase and a reflection of our commitment to having the right parts in the right place at the right time. Accounts payable increased 20% from last year due to the increase in inventory and favorable payment terms with certain suppliers. Our AP-to-inventory ratio improved to 129% from 118% last year. 
Our total debt is $2.4 billion, down $474 million or 16% from September of last year and down $245 million from December 31 of 2020. We closed the third quarter with available liquidity of $2.4 billion, and our total debt to adjusted EBITDA improved to 1.5x from 2.2x last year. So our teams continue to do an outstanding job of optimizing our working capital and our capital structure. 
We also continue to generate strong cash flow with another $300 million in cash from operations in the third quarter and $1 billion for the 9 months. For the full year, we expect our earnings growth and working capital to drive $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion in cash from operations and free cash flow of $950 million to $1.15 billion. 
Our key priorities for cash remain the reinvestment in our businesses through capital expenditures, M&A, share repurchases and the dividend. For the 9 months, we have invested $138 million in capital expenditures, and we have plans for additional investments to drive organic growth and improve efficiencies and productivity in our operations through the balance of the year. 
In addition, we have used approximately $143 million in cash for strategic acquisitions to accelerate growth. These investments include several automotive store groups across our markets, including the entry into Ireland discussed earlier. We continue to generate a robust pipeline of additional strategic and bolt-on acquisitions in both automotive and industrial segments. This would include Auto Accessories Garage, as mentioned before, which we expect to close in the fourth quarter. 
Consistent with our long-standing dividend policy, we have also paid a total cash dividend of more than $349 million to our shareholders through the 9 months. The company has paid a dividend every year since going public in 1948 and has increased the dividend for 65 consecutive years. And as part of our share repurchase program, we have also been active with share buybacks dating back to 1994. In the third quarter, we used $100 million to purchase 800,000 shares, and year-to-date, we have used $284 million to purchase 2.2 million shares. The company is currently authorized to repurchase up to 12.2 million additional shares, and we expect to remain active in this program in the quarters ahead. 
So turning to our current outlook for 2021. We are raising our full year guidance previously provided in our earnings release on July 22, 2021. We expect total sales for 2021 to be in the range of plus 12% to plus 13%, an increase from our previous guidance of plus 10% to plus 12%. As usual, this excludes the benefit of any unannounced future acquisitions. 
By business, we are guiding to plus 14% to plus 15% total sales growth for the automotive segment, an increase from plus 11% to plus 13%; and a total sales increase of plus 10% to plus 11% for the industrial segment, an increase from plus 6% to plus 8%. 
On the earnings side, we're raising our guidance for adjusted diluted earnings per share to a range of $6.60 to $6.65, which is up 25% to 26% from 2020. This represents an increase from our previous guidance of $6.20 to $6.35. So we're encouraged by the strength in our financial results for the third quarter and the 9 months, and we enter the fourth quarter focused on our initiatives to meet or exceed our outlook for the year. We look forward to reporting on our financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year in February. 
Thank you, and I'll now turn it back over to Paul."

But quite honestly, in addition to that and especially when you look at the year-to-date numbers, it is the benefit -- the ongoing benefit of all our category management initiatives, which includes pricing and global sourcing.
So I think in the quarter, you did have more of an impact related to volume incentives. But I think, again, taking into account everything and inflation, quite honestly, was neutral to our rate. So as we look ahead, we're not concerned about gross margin in Q4.

And in turn, they're taking their working capital improvements and reinvesting in additional product offerings and additional M&A, such as J&S that Paul and Will talked about earlier."
