Second quarter results reflect strong momentum across the company. Small Business and Self-Employed Group grew double digits. Credit Karma performed very well, and we are very encouraged by our early results this tax season. We're on track for Intuit to deliver another year of double-digit revenue growth. 
We are confident our game plan to win is durable, accelerated by digital tailwinds given the pandemic. Our platform is well positioned to help customers take advantage of a shift to virtual solutions, acceleration to online and omnichannel capabilities and new ways to reduce debt and save money. The velocity of our innovation is helping our customers at a time when they need us most and positions us to accelerate growth in light of these structural and behavioral changes. 
We closed the acquisition of Credit Karma on December 3 and welcomed 1,300 Credit Karma employees to the Intuit family. We bring together a large customer base of 110 million Credit Karma members and 57 million Intuit customers to help them unlock SMART Money decisions. Credit Karma data platform creates powerful network effects through personalized financial offers, benefiting members and partners while adding a new monetization engines into it. We are off and running, executing on our innovation road map, which I will touch on shortly. 
Since we're in the middle of tax season, let's start there. We're very confident in our strategy and momentum, extending our lead in the do-it-yourself category, and transforming the assisted segment. We're making great progress serving fast-growing underpenetrated Latinx, self-employed and investor segments. This season, we also expanded our free eligibility to better serve customers receiving unemployment benefits. We continue to aggressively transform the assisted segment by reshaping how 86 million filers can get their maximum refund with confidence virtually. We feel great about how the season is progressing. 
Let me now shift to our Big Bets. We're seeing strong momentum and accelerating innovation across the business with our AI-driven expert platform strategy and 5 Big Bets. These Big Bets are focused on the largest problems our customers face and represent durable growth opportunities for Intuit. I'll highlight our progress, covering Big Bet #1 last as it accelerates innovation across our platform and is foundational to the other Bet. 
Our second Big Bet is to connect people to experts. We're solving one of the largest problems our customers face, lack of confidence by connecting people to experts virtually with TurboTax Live and QuickBooks Live. With TurboTax Live, we're transforming the $20 billion assisted category by providing 86 million filers the opportunity to access tax experts on our platform. We continue to lead the way in shaping the category, helping customers understand how they get their taxes done in a new way with our marketing campaigns and for a limited time, offering free live expertise to filers with very simple returns to attract them into the category. We have significantly improved the TurboTax Live platform by making it easier for customers to access an expert throughout the filing experience. And now with our innovative full-service offering, our customers can hand off their return to an expert who will prepare and file it for them. 
We continue to make progress with QuickBooks Live, which is built on the same expert platform. Entering our second peak this season with QuickBooks Live, our customer base has doubled from a year ago and retention rates are improving. Although it's early days for QuickBooks Live, we're confident in the long-term opportunity to penetrate nonconsumption. 
Our third Big Bet is to unlock SMART Money decisions. We're making progress towards our goal of creating a personal financial assistance that helps consumers find the right financial products, puts more money in their pockets and access to financial experts and advice. Our strategic focus is to grow the core, including credit cards and personal loans, expand growth verticals, including home loans, auto loans and insurance, and develop emerging verticals focused on money innovation, including savings and checking accounts. As we make personalized financial offers to customers across our platform, Credit Karma provides an additional monetization engine, increasing our combined wallet share with both free and paying customers. 
We've made great initial progress combining our capabilities to fuel success of the Credit Karma platform. First, to create a complete financial profile for existing and prospective members. With customer consent, we've combined income data from 26 million TurboTax returns with Credit Karma. The combination of verified income data with credit history will enable Credit Karma to better personalize offers, driving engagement and creating a win-win-win for our members, partners and us over time. This enables us to grow in our core verticals for credit cards and personal loans and growth verticals for insurance and mortgages. 
Second, we integrated Credit Karma money into the TurboTax filing experience, providing approximately 36 million TurboTax customers ability to deposit up to 88 billion of tax refunds into a no-fee checking account. And third, we're migrating turbo users to Credit Karma. We're very excited about the journey ahead of us. 
Our fourth Big Bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get paid fast, manage capital pay employees with confidence and grow in an omnichannel world. 60% of small businesses struggle with cash flow, and we're innovating with velocity to create solutions for customers to overcome this challenge. We're making it even easier for customers to get paid fast with tools like payment enabled invoices by auto enabling new customers to accept payments immediately increasing our charge volume. We continue to innovate with QuickBooks Cash, a small business bank account that helps our customers manage working capital by providing visibility into their full financial picture, along with the ability to move money instantly and ensure their money is working for them, while taking advantage of the built-in accounting of QuickBooks. 
We integrated bill pay into the offering this quarter. We're seeing growing adoption and active users for QuickBooks Cash, including a meaningful increase in activation rates. 
We're making good progress with QuickBooks Commerce launched last September. QuickBooks Commerce is designed to better serve the 1 million product based businesses on our platform and 6.4 million product-based businesses in our core markets. The offering provides inventory and order management tools small businesses need to grow their businesses in an omnichannel world. 
We continue to add new partner integrations, enabling a streamlined experience. We're further bolstering the offering with the acquisition of 1 fast in early February. is an infrastructure platform that integrates data streams from multiple sources of e-commerce platforms. This will help our customers see a complete view in QuickBooks. It's still early for both QuickBooks Cash and QuickBooks Commerce, but we're encouraged by what we're seeing. 
Our fifth Big Bet is to disrupt small business mid-market with QuickBooks Online Advanced. The features we're introducing individually tailor the offering for the needs of small businesses with 10 to 100 employees at a disruptive price point. We continue to build out the offering and innovate to better serve these mid-market, small business customers by adding more deeply integrated partners important to both acquisition and retention. 
And finally, our first Big Bet, revolutionize speed to benefit enables us to put more money in our customers' pockets to eliminate friction and deliver confidence at every touch point by using AI and customer insights. 
In TurboTax, we're leveraging advanced models to proactively offer customers the right resources at the right time to keep them engaged and give them confidence to file their taxes. And in QuickBooks Advanced, we're using AI to detect anomaly in price and quantity on customer invoices, saving our customers' time and frustration of having to resend an invoice. Our Live offerings are benefiting from a common AI platform that's creating efficiencies at scale, driving profitable growth. Across all of our Big Bets, we're building momentum and accelerating innovation, which we believe positions us well for durable growth into the future. I'm excited about the opportunity we have ahead of us, and I'm proud of the progress we're making as a team. Now let me hand it over to Michelle."
21171,702620425,2219915,"Intuit Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2021",2021-02-23,"Earnings Calls","Intuit Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Sasan. Good afternoon, everyone. For the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we delivered revenue of $1.6 billion, GAAP operating loss of $25 million versus operating income of $270 million last year. Non-GAAP operating income of $235 million versus $3",1025,"Thanks, Sasan. Good afternoon, everyone. For the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we delivered revenue of $1.6 billion, GAAP operating loss of $25 million versus operating income of $270 million last year. Non-GAAP operating income of $235 million versus $384 million last year. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.07 versus $0.91 a year ago. The GAAP earnings include a $30 million gain from the sale of a note receivable that was previously written off. And non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.68 versus $1.16 last year. 
Turning to the business segments. Consumer Group revenue declined 71% in Q2, driven by the later IRS opening this year. We continue to focus on our strategy to expand our lead in DIY and transform the assisted segment with TurboTax Live. We remain confident in our plans and guidance of 9% to 10% growth in fiscal 2021. 
Turning to the ProConnect Group. Revenue declined 8% in Q2, reflecting a delay in forms availability. In the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 11% during the quarter, while Online Ecosystem revenue was up 22%. Our strategic focus within Small Business and Self-Employed is to grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. Our longer-term expectation remains 30% or greater Online Ecosystem revenue growth, driven by 10% to 20% growth in both customers and ARPC. 
First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 22% in fiscal Q2, driven mainly by customer growth and mix shift. We lapped a full quarter of a price increase last year, driving slower year-over-year growth versus last quarter. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue, which includes payments, payroll, time tracking and capital, grew 20% in fiscal Q2. Within payments, revenue growth reflects continued customer growth, along with an increase in charge volume per customer. Within payroll, we continue to see revenue tailwinds during the quarter from a mix shift to our full-service offering and growth in payroll customers. Third, our progress expanding globally added to the growth of Online Ecosystem revenue during fiscal Q2. Total international online revenue grew 44%. The slower growth from last quarter was driven by lapping price increases a year ago and the lingering impact from lower retention and customer acquisition at the beginning of the pandemic. 
Desktop ecosystem revenue declined 2% in the second quarter, in line with our expectations for the business to decline longer term. Within this, QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew mid-single digits. Small businesses are resilient, and we continue to help them put more money in their pockets when they need it most. We're pleased to see most QuickBooks indicators are back to or better than pre-pandemic levels. This includes growth in customer acquisition, the number of companies running payroll and payments charge volume. This reinforces the digital tailwinds and positioning of our platform and Big Bets Sasan touched on earlier. 
We closed the acquisition of Credit Karma on December 3, resulting in revenue of $144 million for the partial quarter. Our strategic focus with Credit Karma is to grow the core of credit cards and personal loans; expand growth verticals such as home loans, auto loans and insurance; and developed emerging verticals, focused on money innovation, including savings and checking accounts. I'll share more detail on each of these strategic focus areas. 
First, our focus is growing the core. We're seeing new credit card and personal loan partners onboarding, while overall partner activity continues to recover. Adoption of the industry-first light box continues to grow. Light box enables Credit Karma to more tightly integrate with its financial partners, which helps match members to the products that are right for them. This now represents approximately 40% of credit card transactions and approximately 30% of personal loan transactions, up substantially year-over-year. 
Second, our focus is expanding growth verticals. Although it's early days, we're seeing strong growth in auto insurance, followed by home loans and then auto loans. January revenue in the growth vertical is up over 1.5x year-over-year. It's a high watermark. During the quarter, we introduced Karma Drive, providing members an easy opportunity to qualify for an auto insurance discount based on actual driving habits. 
Third, our focus is developing emerging verticals, particularly money innovation, and we're just getting started with Credit Karma money. 
Turning to our financial principles. We remain committed to growing organic revenue double digits and growing operating income dollars faster than revenue. As I've shared before, as we lean into our platform strategy, we're starting to see the opportunity for faster margin expansion over time, and I'm proud of the progress the team is making. We take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investment greater than 15%. We continue to focus on reallocating resources to top priorities, with an emphasis of becoming an AI-driven expert platform. These principles remain our long-term commitment. 
Our first priority for the cash we generate is investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. We consider acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product road map. We return excess cash that we can't invest profitably in the business to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends. We finished the quarter with approximately $2.7 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet. We repurchased $175 million of stock during the second quarter. We have approximately $2.2 billion remaining on our authorization, and we expect to be in the market each quarter this year. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per share payable April 19, 2021. This represents an 11% increase versus last year. 
Moving on to guidance. While macro uncertainty continues, we remain confident in how our business is performing in the current environment. Our guidance for third quarter fiscal 2021 includes revenue growth of 53% to 55%, GAAP earnings per share of $5.85 to $5.95 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $6.75 to $6.85. You can find our full Q3 and reiterated fiscal 2021 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. With that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan."

And the other element, of course, is about transforming the assisted segment, which also helps us serve that community well if they need expertise or if they want us to do their taxes for them. And what I would tell you, we all see the same stats. There's been really a significant increase in retail investors using all the different tools that are out there and not just in the United States, but particularly in Brazil, India and the U.S. And so I feel good that we're very well positioned. And all of those segments that I mentioned, Latinx, Self-Employed and Premier, we are actually experiencing the kind of growth that we expected. And probably a tick up on our Premier offering, which really serves our investment community. So we are experiencing an accelerated growth, and it's really all sort of in context of what we had declared. And we'll have to see how the season plays out. And when we tally up our results, what it all looks like, but we're very, very pleased with the fact that we really positioned ourselves to serve this segment a few years ago.

And we expect to be able to grow our share of the total number of returns and particularly because of our focus on the underpenetrated segments that I mentioned and transforming the assisted segment with our live platform. So really, for us, it's about growing our share of the entire category. And as you know, we have such a massive opportunity with 86 million filers that today go to somebody else to do their taxes. And the fact that we have an opportunity to help them get their taxes done with the expert at their fingertips with any time that they needed. So really, our role is about growing the category and in context of a flattish IRS returns. 
All of our guidance just -- we made the assumption that it's April 15 finish. We contemplated the Texas announcement that was made yesterday. We're really just looking at past situations where there's been a disaster where IRS has extended the filing date. The behaviors are very different. Net-net, we feel very good about our progress. We feel very good about our momentum and really good about the potential that we have this season in the context of the guidance that we provided."

It's important just to remind ourselves that we're in the assisted segment, the biggest problem that we're solving is confidence. These 86 million filers need to know that they can ask a question from an expert at any time that they need to and have the ability to turn over their return if they so choose. And we are getting very good traction with Full-Service, but it really plays, I would say, a halo effect. What customers want to know is that they can come in and if they choose to ask for help that they can get it. And somewhere in the experience that they choose to just say here, let me give you all of my documents digitally that we can do it for them or even if they choose to make that choice upfront. So full service beyond the actual number of customers that will end up using Full-Service really is playing a halo effect, which is what we learned in our test results last year, it really builds confidence for filers that come in from the assisted category that I can get my questions answered. There's always going to be an expert at my side. And as a reminder, last year, we experienced 70% plus growth in TurboTax Live. And a majority of those customers actually came from the assisted category. So it's playing the role exactly as we had assumed that it would.

So with the metrics that we have right now, we'll have to see how those trend over time. We're very excited about it.

And then you have places like Michigan, Washington and California and New York that are lagging. And then within that, you have industries that have come back all the way and the industries that have and it's the natural ones that you would assume, it's fitness, restaurants, travel. 
I bring that up in context of yet another data point, which is when we look across the data points that we see, about 25% of our customers, their net dollars in their bank account is down and nearly 50%. So I give you those data points just to say that small businesses are still working hard to come back to where they were, and they're not all the way back. That's really important context relative to how our trends are doing and what you heard from Michelle, which is we watch acquisition, we watch retention, of course. We watch our payments charge volume, the number of companies running payroll, the number of employees, core companies using payroll, time tracking, et cetera. And all of those indicators are at or above pre-COVID levels, except the number of employees at small businesses. 
And that really tells you a lot about just the innovation that's happening on our platform, the power of our platform, and the fact that in times where small businesses are actually doing worse than they were prior to COVID, our actually platform metrics are at or better than pre-COVID. And so that actually really bodes well for us to not only deliver for our customers, but the growth rates that we would expect as we look ahead. So good momentum and actually bullish about where we are in the opportunities for the future."

And in context of being a subscription business, a lot of the growth rate we're experiencing now is the things that were happening almost a year ago this time. And in context of slower acquisition, retention, dropping a couple of points starting in March of last year. And also, there are a number of things that have huge benefits for customers that we paused, things like payroll, full-service migration we have a line for where you have to upgrade to QuickBooks Advanced. We sort of dropped that line for a while. So it was the combination of acquisition, retention, along with very intentional decisions we made around pricing and migration that has had an impact on the growth rates that we're seeing now. And in addition to all of that, we're lapping price increases that we had done the same time last year. So the long answer to your short question is what we are starting to see now, we should expect the growth rates to be impacted in the year ahead because a lot of the metrics and the trends that we're experiencing now, we'll see the follow-on benefits in the quarters ahead. But I would say, almost think about a year out or so is the way -- is the best way to think about it."

This year, we expect margins to expand approximately 110 basis points once you're excluding Credit Karma. And that is really us continuing to evolve to being more of a platform company and seeing those areas for us to drive margin expansion across the company, everything from technology to customer success to go-to-market.

Based on research and work that we did several years ago, one of the learnings that we had is over 70 million of these 86 million customers are actually w",837,"Sure, Kash. Let me start with live and the 86 million customers that today go to an assisted method. Based on research and work that we did several years ago, one of the learnings that we had is over 70 million of these 86 million customers are actually willing to use a digital platform as long as they can get help and expertise to be able to file their taxes with confidence. And in fact, they would like to get help beyond taxes, which is where Credit Karma comes in. 
And so to your question of what we have learned with our -- beginning our fourth year with the live platform, we're more bullish about the opportunity ahead of us than we were even 4 years ago when we launched TurboTax Live. Because in essence, what we've learned, and that's informing what we're executing this season is, one, we have 86 million folks that we need to get to consider the fact that there's a digital platform with an expert at their fingertips and the fact that they can actually hand everything off digitally for an expert, which is where you see what we're doing in our marketing campaigns. And you may only see what we're doing off-air on TV, but we've got an incredible campaign in educating our customers in multiple different digital channels to help them understand how this works because we're really shaping and reshaping the category. So one is about education, which is where a lot of our investment is going. 
The second is when they come in, really nailing the first-time use. Immediately when they come in to help them understand how to get access to an expert, engaging with an expert, exchanging a document visually and seeing how easy it is. And then with now the launch of Full-Service, if you choose to upgrade the Full-Service or if you come in and choose Full-Service, how do we deliver instant benefit to you? An instant benefit, by the way, is confidence that there's an expert there. 
Now which gets me to the other side of the equation, which I haven't mentioned, and that is our expert platform. That's really where we have advantage. A lot of our AI investments are actually improving our expert platform around scheduling, document exchange, making sure that we connect the right expert to the right customer, ensuring that we deliver insights to the expert because of our machine learning capabilities so that when the expert is talking to the customer, it actually they deliver confidence with their know-how and their knowledge. And then being able to, by the way, the culture we're creating with the experts that we have on our platform that love the Intuit culture, the income that they make and love the fact that they get to deliver for our customers in the comfort of their home. So those are the areas that we are focused on. And frankly, every day and season, we learn and we adjust and we love our momentum and the opportunities ahead. 
And what we'll learn over time is we're launching TurboTax Live as part of the Credit Karma platform. And what's unique in launching that as part of the Credit Karma platform is we'll actually be able to deliver a personalized experience because we'll know that you were a prior year assisted customer. And that, again, will pay off in the long-term but those are the things that we're testing now. 
In terms of your question around disrupting the mid-market with QuickBooks Advanced, I mean, there's a couple of things that we've learned. Frankly, we believe that we can even go higher in the market beyond 10 to 100 employees. Now our focus right now is 10 to 100 employees. But as we see the power of our platform and the ability for us to scale, we believe that we can actually serve even bigger mid-market customers at a disruptive price. And to your question, the things that we're continuing to add are things around like workflow management, automated invoice approval, batch increasing, getting very deep integration of critical apps that these customers need to be able to grow their business and run their business, some of which Michelle actually mentioned in the script around like DocuSign, HubSpot, Salesforce as just a few examples. And every day, we're learning what we need to add to the platform. 
But it's a lot of what we do today, just a much, much higher scale. And the confidence it's given us is not only being able to go upmarket, but we're actually -- we have now 70% of the customers that we're getting are upgraders and 30% that are new to the franchise. And we're actually seeing our new to the franchise growing even at a faster rate than what we thought without the focus yet in place to be able to go after new to the franchise. So those are the few elements that I think are worth sharing, Kash."

And that's really what we saw in Q2, is very consistent with what we expected. And it's consistent with what we expected on a couple of fronts. One, because this time last year or starting in March for several months, both acquisition slowed, but also our attrition popped. But in addition to that, there are things that, as I mentioned a few moments ago that we paused, like Full-Service migration, we paused our QuickBooks Advanced lineup for those upgraders that we didn't ask them to move up because we didn't want to have them experience that in the early COVID times. And so what your -- what we're experiencing now is just a reflection of some of those key indicators that we experienced earlier in the year. And we are, on top of that, lapping a price increase that we did last year that we didn't do this year. So you put all of that together. We're actually quite pleased with the growth rate that we experienced in the quarter, although we expected it to be lower than last quarter. And then as we look ahead, as I mentioned, in the coming quarters and year ahead, a lot of the indicators that Michelle and I shared will start turning into revenue growth.

It's growing the core, which is credit cards and personal loans. It's expanding our growth verticals, which is auto and home loans and insurance. And then emerging verticals, which is really all around assets, which is money innovation. And none of this growth is really coming from that third bucket. And the second point I would make is we sort of have a 75, 25. About 75% of the revenue is coming from credit cards and personal loans and 25% coming from the growth verticals, which is auto and home loans and insurance, which has actually really improved versus about a year ago where it was 95% credit cards and personal loans. 
And specifically, with that context to answer your question, we're seeing more partners come back on the platform. We're seeing new partners come on. We're starting to see higher spend and because of just the innovation with Lightbox and the better matching, we're getting more customers to actually get connected to the financial products that are right for them and partners benefiting from it. So the performance we experienced this quarter is just we're seeing stronger momentum when it comes to credit cards, personal loans, and then the growth vertical, specifically around auto insurance. 
And when we look ahead, our overall guidance was just based on the trajectory that we assumed for the year, and we'll just have to continue to see how these verticals play out, but we like the momentum that we see. But that could be the reason in the long-term for overperformance, to your question. Specifically around margin, really important to note that, one, we manage margins at the company level. And so really pay attention to the guidance that we provide at the company level. Two, we are investing in Credit Karma. It is a -- we see it in the long-term as a big growth engine for the company. The penetration, when you think about the 110 million members that Credit Karma has, the penetration with all these different financial products that I mentioned is actually still quite low. So it's actually quite exciting as we look ahead, the possibilities of increasing penetration. 
And so we are investing dollars in Credit Karma, all within the context of the guidance and margin expansion guidelines that we have provided. So I wouldn't get too anchored on the current quarter margin rate. It was more because it performed better than what we thought, and some of the investments and hiring shifted between quarters. I would more focus on company level operating income that we provided and margin rates that we provided."

There's, first, the fact that the economic indicators have improved, but maybe not everything is back to pre-COVID levels. And then there's also sort of this lagging effect some of the subscription businesses or some of the pauses that you took as everyone sort of navigated a very uncertain time. So I just want to clarify, if you think about the 30%-plus type aspirations for the Online Ecosystem component, is that something you can get back to in the current environment and it's just a function of working through some of these sort of leftover impacts from the last 6 to 12 months? Or do you need to see continued improvement in the broader small business economy as well to get back to pre-pandemic levels to support that 30%?"

It's more our own indicators and the performance of our platform that has bounced back, and in many cases, better than the pre-COVID levels, which gets, I think the essence of your question, and that is, our goal in the long-term has not changed. We believe that we will get this business, specifically the Online revenue growth back above 30%. And we just need to keep executing our game plan. And I would tell you that we don't think it's heavily relied upon how the economy bounces back. Because if you look at where we are today versus 6 months ago, a lot of the performance that we are talking about is based on the performance of the platform and our execution and the innovation on our platform. Now at the end of the day, this economy does need stimulus -- fiscal stimulus to get people back into jobs. But that is not the anchor for us to get back to the growth rates that we believe we can get back to. It will just take some time."

And the acquisition we just made with One SaaS actually allows us to bring data into the platform from marketplaces, from POS providers, from fulfillment apps. And so it really actually helps us help a customer understand how they're doing and their profitability, which is what's most important for the customers. 
We actually had to restrict at the top of the funnel to ensure that we can nail the customer experience. And so our focus first was ensuring that we can serve new customers that don't use our inventory today. Our next focus will be existing QBO customers that don't use any of our inventory capabilities. And then third will be existing QBO customers that actually do use our inventory capabilities. And the reason that's important is we want to ensure that if a customer already has inventory that we can easily think all the product catalogs and their product numbers and to keep their books clean. So net-net, we're just getting started. We had to restrict the top of the funnel because of the demand and the excitement that was out there because we want to be very intentional in terms of building out the capability. Very early indicators are positive with the number of customers that we have on our platform.

The biggest thing -- well, first of all, it's very early days. So we look at more cohort of customers versus the aggregate numbers.

There are customers that come in that want us to provide them advice, and they're just -- they're looking for bookkeeping advice. And there our customers actually want us to do their taxes for them and run their books for them. 
And what we're really being intentional about is understanding what are the needs, what are the experience that we need to deliver? And what does that look like on the platform, which is why you heard me mention retention. Retention right now is more focused on cohorts and it is lower than QBO only because we're looking at different cohorts of customers and their needs are very different.

Proportionality is the same thing within the Credit Karma base. So that's the point that I was making earlier. 
To your second question about RAL is really the biggest driver of getting a customer to use a digital platform is actually confidence are not early access to their money. They have to first have confidence that they can get their taxes done right with you, which is where our experts and expertise comes in. And that's really where a lot of our investments are going.

Second quarter results reflect strong momentum across the company. Small Business and Self-Employed Group grew double digits. Credit Karma performed very well, and we are very encouraged by our early results this tax season. We're on track for Intuit to deliver another year of double-digit revenue growth. 
We are confident our game plan to win is durable, accelerated by digital tailwinds given the pandemic. Our platform is well positioned to help customers take advantage of a shift to virtual solutions, acceleration to online and omnichannel capabilities and new ways to reduce debt and save money. The velocity of our innovation is helping our customers at a time when they need us most and positions us to accelerate growth in light of these structural and behavioral changes. 
We closed the acquisition of Credit Karma on December 3 and welcomed 1,300 Credit Karma employees to the Intuit family. We bring together a large customer base of 110 million Credit Karma members and 57 million Intuit customers to help them unlock SMART Money decisions. Credit Karma data platform creates powerful network effects through personalized financial offers, benefiting members and partners while adding a new monetization engines into it. We are off and running, executing on our innovation road map, which I will touch on shortly. 
Since we're in the middle of tax season, let's start there. We're very confident in our strategy and momentum, extending our lead in the do-it-yourself category, and transforming the assisted segment. We're making great progress serving fast-growing underpenetrated Latinx, self-employed and investor segments. This season, we also expanded our free eligibility to better serve customers receiving unemployment benefits. We continue to aggressively transform the assisted segment by reshaping how 86 million filers can get their maximum refund with confidence virtually. We feel great about how the season is progressing. 
Let me now shift to our Big Bets. We're seeing strong momentum and accelerating innovation across the business with our AI-driven expert platform strategy and 5 Big Bets. These Big Bets are focused on the largest problems our customers face and represent durable growth opportunities for Intuit. I'll highlight our progress, covering Big Bet #1 last as it accelerates innovation across our platform and is foundational to the other Bet. 
Our second Big Bet is to connect people to experts. We're solving one of the largest problems our customers face, lack of confidence by connecting people to experts virtually with TurboTax Live and QuickBooks Live. With TurboTax Live, we're transforming the $20 billion assisted category by providing 86 million filers the opportunity to access tax experts on our platform. We continue to lead the way in shaping the category, helping customers understand how they get their taxes done in a new way with our marketing campaigns and for a limited time, offering free live expertise to filers with very simple returns to attract them into the category. We have significantly improved the TurboTax Live platform by making it easier for customers to access an expert throughout the filing experience. And now with our innovative full-service offering, our customers can hand off their return to an expert who will prepare and file it for them. 
We continue to make progress with QuickBooks Live, which is built on the same expert platform. Entering our second peak this season with QuickBooks Live, our customer base has doubled from a year ago and retention rates are improving. Although it's early days for QuickBooks Live, we're confident in the long-term opportunity to penetrate nonconsumption. 
Our third Big Bet is to unlock SMART Money decisions. We're making progress towards our goal of creating a personal financial assistance that helps consumers find the right financial products, puts more money in their pockets and access to financial experts and advice. Our strategic focus is to grow the core, including credit cards and personal loans, expand growth verticals, including home loans, auto loans and insurance, and develop emerging verticals focused on money innovation, including savings and checking accounts. As we make personalized financial offers to customers across our platform, Credit Karma provides an additional monetization engine, increasing our combined wallet share with both free and paying customers. 
We've made great initial progress combining our capabilities to fuel success of the Credit Karma platform. First, to create a complete financial profile for existing and prospective members. With customer consent, we've combined income data from 26 million TurboTax returns with Crédit Karma. The combination of verified income data with credit history will enable Credit Karma to better personalize offers, driving engagement and creating a win-win-win for our members, partners and us over time. This enables us to grow in our core verticals for credit cards and personal loans and growth verticals for insurance and mortgages. 
Second, we integrated Credit Karma Money into the TurboTax filing experience, providing approximately 36 million TurboTax customers ability to deposit up to 88 billion of tax refunds into a no-fee checking account. 
And third, we're migrating turbo users to Credit Karma. We're very excited about the journey ahead of us. 
Our fourth Big Bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get paid fast, manage capital, pay employees with confidence and grow in an omnichannel world. 60% of small businesses struggle with cash flow, and we're innovating with velocity to create solutions for customers to overcome this challenge. 
We're making it even easier for customers to get paid fast with tools like payment-enabled invoices by auto enabling new customers to accept payments immediately increasing our charge volume. We continue to innovate with QuickBooks Cash, a small business bank account that helps our customers manage working capital by providing visibility into their full financial picture, along with the ability to move money instantly and ensure their money is working for them, while taking advantage of the built-in accounting of QuickBooks. 
We integrated bill pay into the offering this quarter. We're seeing growing adoption and active users for QuickBooks Cash, including a meaningful increase in activation rates. 
We're making good progress with QuickBooks Commerce launched last September. QuickBooks Commerce is designed to better serve the 1 million product based businesses on our platform and 6.4 million product-based businesses in our core markets. The offering provides inventory and order management tools small businesses need to grow their businesses in an omnichannel world. 
We continue to add new partner integrations, enabling a streamlined experience. We're further bolstering the offering with the acquisition of OneSaas in early February. OneSaas is an infrastructure platform that integrates data streams from multiple sources of e-commerce platforms. This will help our customers see a complete view in QuickBooks. It's still early for both QuickBooks Cash and QuickBooks Commerce, but we're encouraged by what we're seeing. 
Our fifth Big Bet is to disrupt small business mid-market with QuickBooks Online Advanced. The features we're introducing individually tailor the offering for the needs of small businesses with 10 to 100 employees at a disruptive price point. We continue to build out the offering and innovate to better serve these mid-market, small business customers by adding more deeply integrated partners important to both acquisition and retention. 
And finally, our first Big Bet, revolutionize speed to benefit enables us to put more money in our customers' pockets to eliminate friction and deliver confidence at every touch point by using AI and customer insights. 
In TurboTax, we're leveraging advanced models to proactively offer customers the right resources at the right time to keep them engaged and give them confidence to file their taxes. And in QuickBooks Advanced, we're using AI to detect anomaly in price and quantity on customer invoices, saving our customers' time and frustration of having to resend an invoice. Our Live offerings are benefiting from a common AI platform that's creating efficiencies at scale, driving profitable growth. 
Across all of our Big Bets, we're building momentum and accelerating innovation, which we believe positions us well for durable growth into the future. I'm excited about the opportunity we have ahead of us, and I'm proud of the progress we're making as a team. Now let me hand it over to Michelle."
21171,702620425,2220036,"Intuit Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2021",2021-02-23,"Earnings Calls","Intuit Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Sasan. Good afternoon, everyone. For the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we delivered revenue of $1.6 billion, GAAP operating loss of $25 million versus operating income of $270 million last year. Non-GAAP operating income of $235 million versus $3",1023,"Thanks, Sasan. Good afternoon, everyone. For the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we delivered revenue of $1.6 billion, GAAP operating loss of $25 million versus operating income of $270 million last year. Non-GAAP operating income of $235 million versus $384 million last year. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.07 versus $0.91 a year ago. The GAAP earnings include a $30 million gain from the sale of a note receivable that was previously written off. And non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.68 versus $1.16 last year. 
Turning to the business segments. Consumer Group revenue declined 71% in Q2, driven by the later IRS opening this year. We continue to focus on our strategy to expand our lead in DIY and transform the assisted segment with TurboTax Live. We remain confident in our plans and guidance of 9% to 10% growth in fiscal 2021. 
Turning to the ProConnect Group. Revenue declined 8% in Q2, reflecting a delay in forms availability. In the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 11% during the quarter, while Online Ecosystem revenue was up 22%. Our strategic focus within Small Business and Self-Employed is to grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. Our longer-term expectation remains 30% or greater Online Ecosystem revenue growth, driven by 10% to 20% growth in both customers and ARPC. 
First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 22% in fiscal Q2, driven mainly by customer growth and mix shift. We lapped a full quarter of a price increase last year, driving slower year-over-year growth versus last quarter. 
Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online Services revenue, which includes payments, payroll, time tracking and capital, grew 20% in fiscal Q2. Within payments, revenue growth reflects continued customer growth, along with an increase in charge volume per customer. Within payroll, we continue to see revenue tailwinds during the quarter from a mix shift to our full-service offering and growth in payroll customers. 
Third, our progress expanding globally added to the growth of Online Ecosystem revenue during fiscal Q2. Total international online revenue grew 44%. The slower growth from last quarter was driven by lapping price increases a year ago and the lingering impact from lower retention and customer acquisition at the beginning of the pandemic. 
Desktop ecosystem revenue declined 2% in the second quarter, in line with our expectations for the business to decline longer term. Within this, QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew mid-single digits. Small businesses are resilient, and we continue to help them put more money in their pockets when they need it most. We're pleased to see most QuickBooks indicators are back to or better than pre-pandemic levels. This includes growth in customer acquisition, the number of companies running payroll and payments charge volume. This reinforces the digital tailwinds and positioning of our platform and Big Bets Sasan touched on earlier. 
We closed the acquisition of Credit Karma on December 3, resulting in revenue of $144 million for the partial quarter. Our strategic focus with Credit Karma is to grow the core of credit cards and personal loans; expand growth verticals such as home loans, auto loans and insurance; and developed emerging verticals, focused on money innovation, including savings and checking accounts. I'll share more detail on each of these strategic focus areas. 
First, our focus is growing the core. We're seeing new credit card and personal loan partners onboarding, while overall partner activity continues to recover. Adoption of the industry-first Lightbox continues to grow. Lightbox enables Credit Karma to more tightly integrate with its financial partners, which helps match members to the products that are right for them. This now represents approximately 40% of credit card transactions and approximately 30% of personal loan transactions, up substantially year-over-year. 
Second, our focus is expanding growth verticals. Although it's early days, we're seeing strong growth in auto insurance, followed by home loans and then auto loans. January revenue in the growth vertical is up over 1.5x year-over-year. It's a high-water mark. During the quarter, we introduced Karma Drive, providing members an easy opportunity to qualify for an auto insurance discount based on actual driving habits. 
Third, our focus is developing emerging verticals, particularly money innovation, and we're just getting started with Credit Karma Money. 
Turning to our financial principles. We remain committed to growing organic revenue double digits and growing operating income dollars faster than revenue. As I've shared before, as we lean into our platform strategy, we're starting to see the opportunity for faster margin expansion over time, and I'm proud of the progress the team is making. We take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investment greater than 15%. We continue to focus on reallocating resources to top priorities, with an emphasis of becoming an AI-driven expert platform. These principles remain our long-term commitment. 
Our first priority for the cash we generate is investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. We consider acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product road map. We return excess cash that we can't invest profitably in the business to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends. We finished the quarter with approximately $2.7 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet. We repurchased $175 million of stock during the second quarter. We have approximately $2.2 billion remaining on our authorization, and we expect to be in the market each quarter this year. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per share payable April 19, 2021. This represents an 11% increase versus last year. 
Moving on to guidance. While macro uncertainty continues, we remain confident in how our business is performing in the current environment. Our guidance for third quarter fiscal 2021 includes revenue growth of 53% to 55%, GAAP earnings per share of $5.85 to $5.95 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $6.75 to $6.85. You can find our full Q3 and reiterated fiscal 2021 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. With that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan."

And the other element, of course, is about transforming the assisted segment, which also helps us serve that community well if they need expertise or if they want us to do their taxes for them. And what I would tell you, we all see the same stats. There's been really a significant increase in retail investors using all the different tools that are out there and not just in the United States, but particularly in Brazil, India and the U.S. 
And so I feel good that we're very well positioned. And all of those segments that I mentioned, Latinx, Self-Employed and Premier, we are actually experiencing the kind of growth that we expected. And probably a tick up on our Premier offering, which really serves our investment community. So we are experiencing an accelerated growth, and it's really all sort of in context of what we had declared. And we'll have to see how the season plays out. And when we tally up our results, what it all looks like, but we're very, very pleased with the fact that we really positioned ourselves to serve this segment a few years ago.

And we expect to be able to grow our share of the total number of returns and particularly because of our focus on these underpenetrated segments that I mentioned and transforming the assisted segment with our live platform. So really, for us, it's about growing our share of the entire category. And as you know, we have such a massive opportunity with 86 million filers that today go to somebody else to do their taxes. And the fact that we have an opportunity to help them get their taxes done with the expert at their fingertips with any time that they needed. So really, our role is about growing the category and in context of a flattish IRS returns. 
All of our guidance just -- we made the assumption that it's April 15 finish. We contemplated the Texas announcement that was made yesterday. We're really just looking at past situations where there's been a disaster where IRS has extended the filing date. The behaviors are very different. Net-net, we feel very good about our progress. We feel very good about our momentum and really good about the potential that we have this season in the context of the guidance that we provided."

These 86 million filers need to know that they can ask a question from an expert at any time that they need to and have the ability to turn over their return if they so choose. And we are getting very good traction with Full-Service, but it really plays, I would say, a halo effect. What customers want to know is that they can come in and if they choose to ask for help that they can get it. And somewhere in the experience that they choose to just say here, let me give you all of my documents digitally that we can do it for them or even if they choose to make that choice upfront. 
So Full-Service beyond the actual number of customers that will end up using Full-Service really is playing a halo effect, which is what we learned in our test results last year, it really builds confidence for filers that come in from the assisted category that I can get my questions answered. There's always going to be an expert at my side. And as a reminder, last year, we experienced 70% plus growth in TurboTax Live. And a majority of those customers actually came from the assisted category. So it's playing the role exactly as we had assumed that it would.

So with the metrics that we have right now, we'll have to see how those trend over time. We're very excited about it.

And then you have places like Michigan, Washington and California and New York that are lagging. And then within that, you have industries that have come back all the way and the industries that have and it's the natural ones that you would assume, it's fitness, restaurants, travel. 
I bring that up in context of yet another data point, which is when we look across the data points that we see, about 25% of our customers, their net dollars in their bank account is down and nearly 50%. So I give you those data points just to say that small businesses are still working hard to come back to where they were, and they're not all the way back. That's really important context relative to how our trends are doing and what you heard from Michelle, which is we watch acquisition, we watch retention, of course. We watch our payments charge volume, the number of companies running payroll, the number of employees, core companies using payroll, time tracking, et cetera. And all of those indicators are at or above pre-COVID levels, except the number of employees at small businesses. 
And that really tells you a lot about just the innovation that's happening on our platform, the power of our platform, and the fact that in times where small businesses are actually doing worse than they were prior to COVID, our actually platform metrics are at or better than pre-COVID.

We sort of dropped that line for a while. So it was the combination of acquisition, retention, along with very intentional decisions we made around pricing and migration that has had an impact on the growth rates that we're seeing now.

Anything we should be aware of in terms of sort of expenses that might come on board that could upset -- or not upset, but could temporarily sort of reverse the margin expansion that we've been seeing?"

And so you may see some expenses here, there and obviously, you see margins move around a little bit quarter-to-quarter. But I would say, really focused on our guidance, which is, after last year, expanding margins a point. This year, we expect margins to expand approximately 110 basis points once you're excluding Credit Karma. And that is really us continuing to evolve to being more of a platform company and seeing those areas for us to drive margin expansion across the company, everything from technology to customer success to go-to-market. And so that is the biggest driver of margin expansion for us across the company."

So there are a number of big things that we're doing.

Let me start with live and the 86 million customers that today go to an assisted method. Based on research and work that we did several years ago, one of the learnings that we had is over 70 million of these 86 million c",843,"Sure, Kash. Good to hear from you. Let me start with live and the 86 million customers that today go to an assisted method. Based on research and work that we did several years ago, one of the learnings that we had is over 70 million of these 86 million customers are actually willing to use a digital platform as long as they can get help and expertise to be able to file their taxes with confidence. And in fact, they would like to get help beyond taxes, which is where Credit Karma comes in. 
And so to your question of what we have learned with our -- beginning our fourth year with the live platform, we're more bullish about the opportunity ahead of us than we were even 4 years ago when we launched TurboTax Live. Because in essence, what we've learned, and that's informing what we're executing this season is, one, we have 86 million folks that we need to get to consider the fact that there's a digital platform with an expert at their fingertips and the fact that they can actually hand everything off digitally for an expert, which is where you see what we're doing in our marketing campaigns. And you may only see what we're doing off-air on TV, but we've got an incredible campaign in educating our customers in multiple different digital channels to help them understand how this works because we're really shaping and reshaping the category. So one is about education, which is where a lot of our investment is going. 
The second is when they come in, really nailing the first-time use. Immediately when they come in to help them understand how to get access to an expert, engaging with an expert, exchanging a document visually and seeing how easy it is. And then with now the launch of Full-Service, if you choose to upgrade the Full-Service or if you come in and choose Full-Service, how do we deliver instant benefit to you? An instant benefit, by the way, is confidence that there's an expert there. 
Now which gets me to the other side of the equation, which I haven't mentioned, and that is our expert platform. That's really where we have advantage. A lot of our AI investments are actually improving our expert platform around scheduling, document exchange, making sure that we connect the right expert to the right customer, ensuring that we deliver insights to the expert because of our machine learning capabilities so that when the expert is talking to the customer, it actually -- they deliver confidence with their know-how and their knowledge. And then being able to, by the way, the culture we're creating with the experts that we have on our platform that love the Intuit culture, the income that they make and love the fact that they get to deliver for our customers in the comfort of their home. So those are the areas that we are focused on. And frankly, every day and season, we learn and we adjust and we love our momentum and the opportunities ahead. 
And what we'll learn over time is we're launching TurboTax Live as part of the Credit Karma platform. And what's unique in launching that as part of the Credit Karma platform is we'll actually be able to deliver a personalized experience because we'll know that you were a prior year assisted customer. And that, again, will pay off in the long-term but those are the things that we're testing now. 
In terms of your question around disrupting the mid-market with QuickBooks Advanced, I mean, there's a couple of things that we've learned. Frankly, we believe that we can even go higher in the market beyond 10 to 100 employees. Now our focus right now is 10 to 100 employees. But as we see the power of our platform and the ability for us to scale, we believe that we can actually serve even bigger mid-market customers at a disruptive price. And to your question, the things that we're continuing to add are things around like workflow management, automated invoice approval, batch increasing, getting very deep integration of critical apps that these customers need to be able to grow their business and run their business, some of which Michelle actually mentioned in the script around like DocuSign, HubSpot, Salesforce as just a few examples. And every day, we're learning what we need to add to the platform. 
But it's a lot of what we do today, just a much, much higher scale. And the confidence it's given us is not only being able to go upmarket, but we're actually -- we have now 70% of the customers that we're getting are upgraders and 30% that are new to the franchise. And we're actually seeing our new to the franchise growing even at a faster rate than what we thought without the focus yet in place to be able to go after new to the franchise. So those are the few elements that I think are worth sharing, Kash."

One of the things that we've been pretty consistent in communicating is that our growth rates would decline sequentially before they start bouncing and going back up. And that's really what we saw in Q2, is very consistent with what we expected. And it's consistent with what we expected on a couple of fronts. One, because this time last year or starting in March for several months, both acquisition slowed, but also our attrition popped. But in addition to that, there are things that, as I mentioned a few moments ago that we paused, like Full-Service migration, we paused our QuickBooks Advanced lineup for those upgraders that we didn't ask them to move up because we didn't want to have them experience that in the early COVID times. 
And so what your -- what we're experiencing now is just a reflection of some of those key indicators that we experienced earlier in the year. And we are, on top of that, lapping a price increase that we did last year that we didn't do this year. So you put all of that together. We're actually quite pleased with the growth rate that we experienced in the quarter, although we expected it to be lower than last quarter. And then as we look ahead, as I mentioned, in the coming quarters and year ahead, a lot of the indicators that Michelle and I shared will start turning into revenue growth. But everything is per our expectation. I think the only thing that's not per our expectation is the business is actually performing better than what we thought in the pandemic.

It's growing the core, which is credit cards and personal loans. It's expanding our growth verticals, which is auto and home loans and insurance. And then emerging verticals, which is really all around assets, which is money innovation. And none of this growth is really coming from that third bucket. And the second point I would make is we sort of have a 75-25. About 75% of the revenue is coming from credit cards and personal loans and 25% coming from the growth verticals, which is auto and home loans and insurance, which has actually really improved versus about a year ago where it was 95% credit cards and personal loans. 
And specifically, with that context to answer your question, we're seeing more partners come back on the platform. We're seeing new partners come on. We're starting to see higher spend and because of just the innovation with Lightbox and the better matching, we're getting more customers to actually get connected to the financial products that are right for them and partners benefiting from it. So the performance we experienced this quarter is just we're seeing stronger momentum when it comes to credit cards, personal loans, and then the growth vertical, specifically around auto insurance. 
And when we look ahead, our overall guidance was just based on the trajectory that we assumed for the year, and we'll just have to continue to see how these verticals play out, but we like the momentum that we see. But that could be the reason in the long term for overperformance, to your question. Specifically around margin, really important to note that, one, we manage margins at the company level. And so really pay attention to the guidance that we provide at the company level. 
Two, we are investing in Credit Karma. It is a -- we see it in the long term as a big growth engine for the company. The penetration, when you think about the 110 million members that Credit Karma has, the penetration with all these different financial products that I mentioned is actually still quite low. So it's actually quite exciting as we look ahead, the possibilities of increasing penetration. 
And so we are investing dollars in Credit Karma, all within the context of the guidance and margin expansion guidelines that we have provided. So I wouldn't get too anchored on the current quarter margin rate. It was more because it performed better than what we thought, and some of the investments and hiring shifted between quarters. I would more focus on company level operating income that we provided and margin rates that we provided."

What I would share with you that we've learned about the Credit Karma base is a big portion of their customers actually use an assisted method. And that is actually what is exciting to us. Now because they have 110 million members, you can imagine they have a strong cross-section of folks in the U.S., whether Latinx, self-employed, those that are retail investors. So that cross-section is generally consistent with the customers we serve in TurboTax today. What's different is we've got a good majority of those customers that, in the prior year used an assisted method."

First of all, we're very excited about QuickBooks Commerce, and it's also very, very early innings with QuickBooks Commerce. And the acquisition we just made with OneSaas actually allows us to bring data into the platform from marketplaces, from POS providers, from fulfillment apps. And so it really actually helps us help a customer understand how they're doing and their profitability, which is what's most important for the customers. 
We actually had to restrict at the top of the funnel to ensure that we can nail the customer experience. And so our focus first was ensuring that we can serve new customers that don't use our inventory today. Our next focus will be existing QBO customers that don't use any of our inventory capabilities. And then third will be existing QBO customers that actually do use our inventory capabilities. And the reason that's important is we want to ensure that if a customer already has inventory that we can easily think all the product catalogs and their product numbers and to keep their books clean. So net-net, we're just getting started. We had to restrict the top of the funnel because of the demand and the excitement that was out there because we want to be very intentional in terms of building out the capability. Very early indicators are positive with the number of customers that we have on our platform. But again, think about QuickBooks Commerce, think about QuickBooks Cash as these are long-term plays in terms of when and how they will deliver growth. But so far, we're bullish about the early indicators."

The biggest thing -- well, first of all, it's very early days. So we look at more cohort of customers versus the aggregate numbers. The biggest reason we're so focused on retention right now with QuickBooks Live is we're focused on understanding customer needs and really nailing the experience. Because with QuickBooks Live, there are customers that come in to get set up. There are customers that come in that want us to provide them advice, and they're just -- they're looking for bookkeeping advice. And there our customers actually want us to do their taxes for them and run their books for them. 
And what we're really being intentional about is understanding what are the needs, what are the experience that we need to deliver? And what does that look like on the platform, which is why you heard me mention retention. Retention right now is more focused on cohorts and it is lower than QBO only because we're looking at different cohorts of customers and their needs are very different. And before we really open up the top of the funnel, we want to make sure that every customer loves the experience that they're getting from us on QuickBooks Live. And the team is just innovating like crazy to close some of the gaps. And so we're excited about the possibilities."

And it's very much connected to -- when you look at -- there's 155 million or 160 million IRS returns, 86 million are in the assisted segment. Proportionality is the same thing within the Credit Karma base. So that's the point that I was making earlier. 
To your second question about RAL is really the biggest driver of getting a customer to use a digital platform is actually confidence are not early access to their money. They have to first have confidence that they can get their taxes done right with you, which is where our experts and expertise comes in. And that's really where a lot of our investments are going.

We had a very strong third quarter. Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue accelerated to 20% this quarter, and Credit Karma performed very well with revenue at an all-time high",1004,"Great. Thanks, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. 
We had a very strong third quarter. Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue accelerated to 20% this quarter, and Credit Karma performed very well with revenue at an all-time high for the quarter. Our tax results through the May 17 IRS tax filing deadline reflect another strong season. As a result, we are raising our revenue, operating income and earnings per share guidance for fiscal year 2021. 
Let me start with tax. We're proud of how we delivered for our customers and executed our strategy of expanding our lead in the do-it-yourself category and transforming the assisted category. Based on our performance through the May 17 IRS tax filing deadline, we expect our consumer group revenue to grow 11% to 12% during fiscal year 2021. We expect total IRS returns to be up approximately 1%, and our share of total returns expand an estimated 1 point for the tax filing season. This results in expected total customer growth of 6% and double-digit revenue growth for the fourth year in a row. 
The average revenue per return increased, reflecting a stronger contribution by TurboTax Live and mix shift to our premier offering used by investors. We made significant progress this season. 
Within the do-it-yourself category, we continue to double down on underpenetrated segments, including Latinx, Self-Employed and Investors. We saw a significant acceleration in Investor customer growth this season and expected to more than triple over last year. We expect the base of customers paying us nothing to grow 6% this season. 
Within transforming the assisted category, we continue to make progress connecting people to experts with TurboTax Live. We expect customers to grow more than 90% this season compared to 70% growth last year and TurboTax Live customers new to Intuit to be up more than 100%. 
More broadly, our AI-driven expert platform strategy and 5 Big Bets are driving strong momentum and accelerating innovation across the company. These Big Bets are focused on the largest problems our customers face and represent durable growth opportunities for Intuit. As a reminder, these Bets are: revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock SMART Money decisions, be the center of small business growth and disrupt the small business mid-market. Today, I'll highlight the notable progress we've made this quarter on 3 of these Big Bets. And we'll provide a detailed update on all 5 Big Bets at Investor Day in the fall. 
Our third Big Bet is to unlock SMART Money decisions. With Credit Karma's data platform and powerful network effects, we're making progress towards our goal of creating a personal financial assistant that helps consumers find the right financial products, put more money in their pockets and access financial expertise and advice. To deliver on this goal, our strategic focus is to grow the core, including credit cards and personal loans, expand growth verticals, including home loans, auto loans and insurance, and develop emerging verticals focused on digital money offerings, such as savings and checking accounts. 
Credit Karma also provides an additional monetization engine, increasing our combined wallet share with both free and paying customers. Credit Karma achieved its largest quarterly revenue ever in Q3, while the number of members, monthly active users and frequency of member visits reached all-time highs. Within the core, Credit Karma personal revenue was at a record high on a combined basis, reflecting an increase in both the number of partners and member engagement. The growth verticals also achieved all-time high revenue, reflecting strong momentum in auto insurance followed by home loans and auto loans. And we're developing the emerging verticals by focusing on innovation with Credit Karma Money, part of our digital money offering. 
We continue to make great progress combining our capabilities to fuel the success of Credit Karma. Since the acquisition closed, TurboTax customers and migrating Turbo users accounted for 40% of new Credit Karma members, significantly accelerating new member growth. We're pleased with the initial performance of Credit Karma Money, which we integrated into TurboTax filing experience, offering approximately 36 million TurboTax customers the opportunity deposit up to $88 billion of tax refunds into note fee checking accounts. Providing this product integration helps members achieve their financial goals, drives member engagement and creates a new revenue stream for the company in the future. The more we successfully innovate for Credit Karma members, the more times members visit the platform and the more opportunities we have to offer members products that are right for them, resulting in more monetization opportunities for Intuit. 
Our fourth Big Bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get customers that paid fast, manage capital, pay employees with confidence and grow in our omnichannel world. 60% of small businesses struggle with cash flow, and we're continuing to innovate to create solutions for customers to overcome this challenge. 
We are excited about our progress with QuickBooks Cash, a small business bank account that helps our customers manage working capital. QuickBooks Cash presents a full financial picture along with the ability to move money instantly and ensures that their money is working for them while taking advantage of the built-in accounting of QuickBooks. We achieved a milestone this quarter as QuickBooks Cash balances surpassed $100 million, and we're seeing strong active use among both new and existing customers. 
Our fifth Big Bet is to disrupt small business mid-market with QuickBooks Online Advanced. The usage of services such as payments, payroll and time tracking with QBO Advanced customers is more than 30% higher than the next QBO offering in our lineup, contributing to higher ARPC while overall engagement is up over 10 points year-to-date. We're very pleased with our results and remain confident in our game plan to win, accelerated by digital tailwinds. Across all of our Big Bets, we're building momentum and accelerating innovation, which we believe positions us well for durable growth in the future. 
Now let me hand it over to Michelle."

For the third quarter of fiscal 2021, we delivered revenue of $4.2 billion, GAAP operating income of $1.9 billion versus $1.4 billion last year, non-GAAP operating income of $2.2 billion versus $1.5 billion last",1106,"Thanks, Sasan. Good afternoon, everyone. 
For the third quarter of fiscal 2021, we delivered revenue of $4.2 billion, GAAP operating income of $1.9 billion versus $1.4 billion last year, non-GAAP operating income of $2.2 billion versus $1.5 billion last year, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $5.30 versus $4.11 a year ago, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $6.07 versus $4.49 last year. 
Turning to the business segments. Consumer Group revenue grew 34% in Q3, reflecting a shift in the timing of the IRS tax filing window year-over-year. The revenue we're reporting today is for our third quarter ending April 30. That said, based on our performance through the May 17 tax filing deadline, we are raising our consumer group revenue guidance to 11% to 12% growth for fiscal 2021, up from 9% to 10% previously. 
There are 4 primary drivers in our consumer business. Note that these levers exclude approximately 8 million stimulus filings last year. This data reflects our expectations for the season through July 31, 2021, versus the prior season through July 31, 2020. The first is the total number of returns filed with the IRS which we expect to be up approximately 1% by the end of the season. The second is the percentage of those returns filed using do-it-yourself software. We expect the DIY category share of total IRS returns to be approximately flat by the end of the season. The third driver is our share. We expect our share of total tax returns to expand 1 point this season and our share of the DIY category to be up approximately 1 point. The fourth is average revenue per return, which increased again this season. This growth reflects a stronger contribution by TurboTax Live and mix shift to our premier offering, which is used by investors. 
Turning to the ProConnect Group. Revenue grew 22% in Q3, reflecting a shift in the timing of the IRS tax filing window year-over-year. For the full year, we expect ProConnect Group revenue growth of 2%. In the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 20% during the quarter, including 1 point from approximately $10 million of nonrecurring Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP revenue. 
Online Ecosystem revenue was up 28%, including 2 points of growth from approximately $7 million of PPP revenue. Our longer-term expectation remains 30% or greater Online Ecosystem revenue growth, driven by 10% to 20% growth in both customers and ARPC. We expect to return to 30% Online Ecosystem revenue growth at some point during fiscal '22. 
our strategic focus within Small Business and Self-Employed is to grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 24% in fiscal Q3, driven mainly by customer growth and mix shift. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue, which includes payments, payroll, time tracking and capital, grew 34% in fiscal Q3 or 31% excluding PPP revenue. 
Within payments, revenue growth reflects continued customer growth, along with an increase in charge volume per customer. Within payroll, we continue to see revenue tailwinds during the quarter from a mix shift to our full-service offering and growth in payroll customers. 
During the quarter, we began migrating customers once again to our new Full-Service lineup. This did not have a significant impact on revenue during the quarter. Third, our progress expanding globally added to the growth of Online Ecosystem revenue during fiscal Q3. Total international online revenue grew 38% on a constant currency basis. 
Desktop ecosystem revenue grew 9% in the third quarter, including approximately $3 million of PPP revenue. As a reminder, in the third quarter last year, the Desktop business declined sharply, reflecting the impact of the pandemic. QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew mid-single digits in Q3. 
Note that we discontinued the TurboTax and QuickBooks Self-Employed bundle this year. We remain committed to serving the Self-Employed segment. However, after years of experimentation, we determined that serving Self-Employed customers through separate TurboTax and QuickBooks offerings is most effective. There was no material impact to revenue or operating income from this decision. 
Moving on to Credit Karma. Revenue was $316 million in Q3 as the business continues to gain momentum, reflecting growing members, member engagement and expansion of new and existing partners across verticals. Revenue reached a record high in the quarter. We are also seeing engagement reach a new high watermark with both monthly active users and frequency of member visits at all-time highs, giving us more opportunities to offer members products that are right for them. 
Turning to our financial principles. We remain committed to growing organic revenue double digits and growing operating income dollars faster than revenue. As I shared before, as we lean into our platform strategy, we see the opportunity for margin expansion over time. We take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investment greater than 15%. We continue to reallocate resources to top priorities with an emphasis on becoming an AI-driven expert platform. These principles remain our long-term commitment. 
Our first priority for the cash we generate is investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. We consider acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product road map. We return excess cash that we can't invest profitably in the business to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends. 
We finished the quarter with approximately $4.1 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet. We repurchased $380 million of stock during the third quarter. We have approximately $1.8 billion remaining on our authorization, and we expect to be in the market each quarter this year. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per share, payable July 19, 2021. This represents an 11% increase versus last year. 
Moving on to guidance. Our guidance for fourth quarter fiscal 2021 includes revenue growth of 26% to 28%, GAAP earnings per share of $0.78 to $0.83 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.55 to $1.60. We are also raising our fiscal 2021 guidance following strong performance in the first 3 quarters of the year. Our new guidance includes revenue growth of 22%, up from prior guidance of 15% to 17%; GAAP earnings per share of $6.96 to $7.01; and non-GAAP earnings per share of $9.32 to $9.37. We now expect a GAAP tax rate of 21% in fiscal 2021. You can find our full Q4 and updated fiscal 2021 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan."

Can you dive into that a little bit more in terms of -- versus your expectations, how well have those offers been working? I mean, I saw them while I was doing my taxes in TurboTax and saw the offers for Credit Karma. Have you been taking you guys up on that, has that been a material contributor as of yet? And are there like kind of linkages that we should be thinking about on the QuickBooks side of the equation of where you're starting to create those connections as well? And then maybe one for Michelle. Now we're looking for 100 basis points of margin expansion this year in the revised guidance, that's awesome. Does this take away from future years?

Got it. Very, very helpful. So I think the place I would start is, if you go back a year plus from the time we've been working with Credit Karma, really their focus, even during the pandemic, was to deliver benefits for customers from the perspective of how to manage their money, credit scores, how to get some of the COVID-19 Relief Act help. And one of the things that happened based on just the obsessive focus on customers is their engagement increased at a time where the pandemic was impacting the supply side of the equation. 
In addition to that, their investment in Lightbox and getting partners to really understand a Lightbox, the value of Lightbox, how it's good for consumers and how it's good for partners, whether it's financial institutions and insurance companies, is now really paying off. Because what you're seeing now is because the member engagement was up and to the right, you have more transactions that are happening on Lightbox, which really for the consumer means a much better match and eligibility for the partner, it means they are able to also make a perfect match. All of those things is really what's resulting in the momentum that we see right now, not only in the core, which is credit cards and personal loans and the areas where the company has been investing in 13-plus years, but also in the last year plus new areas, which is auto insurance, auto loans and home loans. 
So that's the acceleration that we're seeing. A lot of the synergy opportunities are going to pay off in the future. And particularly, there are several. One that we've talked about is ensuring that we, with customers permission, move all their data records from TurboTax to Credit Karma so that they can get much more personalized offers that are right for them on the first click. The launching of Credit Karma, both in the TurboTax experience, but also launching TurboTax as part of the Credit Karma platform. This was really all about a learning year. We ran 40-plus experiments, Keith, learned a ton, made a number of adjustments, and I think it positions us for the months and the years ahead. So a lot of the opportunities that we think about are -- that are synergies between the 2 companies are coming in the future. And that really is what's exciting. 
What I would say has been a near-term impact is the fact that 40% of the new Credit Karma members actually came from either TurboTax and/or the fact that we duplicated Turbo, and that has been an instant sort of a thrust for Credit Karma. But a lot of what I just described is yet to come, which is what's exciting about the platform. Specifically to your question around QuickBooks, that has been sequenced for some time down the road, Keith. We're very focused on what's most important, the biggest drivers of innovation and benefits for members. And QuickBooks is going to be something that we'll think about down the road, but it's been very intentionally sequenced so we don't distract the team."

So whether that's looking at technology or customer success or go-to-market, there are opportunities for us to continue to leverage the platform. 
However, I would remind you that this year is just very unique. We were deep in the pandemic at the beginning of the year, and we were conservative with our spending. Specifically, if you look at something like Credit Karma, it really took a while even though they really started to bounce back much more quickly than we anticipated. But it took us a while to be able to ramp up the spend when we saw that, and we do feel like we will continue to invest to drive accelerated growth in there. So I would just say this year is a little bit a unique year with the pandemic."

And then any color you can provide on this initial year of full service, what that adoption rate look like? And then for Michelle, just also a quick question on spend. It looks like R&D saw a really big step-up this quarter. It looked like roughly 30% year-over-year. How should we think about kind of where those investments are being funneled? And is that kind of the right pace of growth, at least for the near-term future on the product side?"

And/or you can, in essence, hand everything off to us and we'll do your taxes for you completely. And so the -- really the momentum of accelerating from 70% growth to 90% growth is the fact that we are continuing to build momentum. We're improving the platform. We are doing a far better job raising awareness. More folks are considering getting help in this world, in a virtual world. And we'll -- we're delivering really excellent experiences where our product recommendation scores are continuing to be one of the best that we've seen across the company. 
So I bring that up just to say that what you're just experiencing and what we are experiencing is momentum. And Full-Service just plays a halo effect role. The fundamental problem that we are solving for customers is one of confidence. And they want to know that if they need help that they can get access to an expert or even midstream, if they want to just hand everything off to somebody else to do their taxes, they can do it right off the bat. And so it provides a halo effect for the entire franchise that I can get my taxes done with TurboTax. And whether or not I delegate everything now and next year perhaps just ask for an expert or even the year after that, do it myself, that all helps the franchise. So that's the role that it's playing, which is why we're seeing the accelerated growth. And we'll share some of the specific metrics perhaps at Investor Day, but the majority of these customers are continuing to come from the assisted category."

What I would say is outside of the U.S. and Canada, recovery has been slower. So from a geographic perspective, the strength is really U.S. and Canada. And then particularly, answer your question on desktop. I think, as Michelle said, it's less about seasonality, but more from the perspective of Desktop also saw a very deep decline this time last year.

But also in some ways, the digital transformation for the mid-market is the same, if not a little bit behind the smaller businesses, which is why we're so excited about the possibilities with QuickBooks Advanced to truly give them a customer as a platform that becomes a source of truth for their entire business. 
Specifically, to your question around internal, I would say that from some of the decisions that we made years ago with a lot of the tools that we use internally, one, are shipped today AWS, the collaboration tools that we use internally, these are decisions and choices that we made 3 to 4 years ago, and we're fortunate that we're now using a lot of these digital tools internally, along with, of course, our shift to AWS.

Big picture, we're very pleased with what we experienced this season, and it's consistent with what we declared several years ago. Our biggest opportunity for continued growth is to be able to transform the assisted category. There's 86 million folks that, in essence, get assistance to get their taxes done. It's more than $20 billion in size. And beyond that, there's about an $8 billion business tax segment. And the second is underpenetrated segments, which is Investors, Self-Employed, Latinx. And when you look at our results this year, coming sort of out of the pandemic, our TurboTax Live platform accelerated to 90%. And we saw our Investors segment actually grow triple what it did last year. And we always want to continue to grow units, which will then result in ARPU. 
I think given that our biggest opportunity is not only under-penetrated segments and transforming assisted, we may just see more ARPU than units. It's more a result of our strategy and where we are focused and where the biggest opportunity is. So if I put this season in context of our strategy, I would say it is absolutely in line with our strategy and it's for us, it's more about just continuing to accelerate in the areas that we declared several years ago."

The -- if you just step back, what really drives Credit Karma's growth is the number of members, the number of transactions per member and then the revenue per transaction. So that's sort of big picture metrics. The second is, if you think about Credit Karma, it's got well over 110 million customers and it's a data platform that creates a powerful network effect. And really, it's technology-driven via Lightbox. And really, our opportunity is to continue to not only grow the products that we have today, which is credit cards and personal loans, but also the new products, which is auto and home insurance and home loans, but also the new areas that we're moving into, which is Credit Karma Money that we've talked about, which is savings, checking, early access to wages. And then ultimately, you can also get your taxes done on Credit Karma. And by the way, there's no boundary to what product verticals that we'll launch over time because we've got a relationship with over 100 million customers. We deliver personalized experiences, and they know that we're there for them. We're putting the power of their data in their hands. 
So I bring that up to say that during the pandemic, we were obsessively focused on benefits, even though the market was sort of in shambles. When I say the market because of the health crisis. And so what you're seeing now is, one, the benefit of a lot of the work that we did during the pandemic launching these new verticals, delivering benefits to customers that was about how to manage their money in their credit score. And our really member engagement went up into the right even during the pandemic. And so now with -- coming out of the pandemic and more financial institutions being in Lightbox, we're actually seeing more transactions in Lightbox which makes a more personalized match for not only the consumer, but it benefits significantly the financial institution. So this is not just a macro recovery, it's an end. 
And looking ahead, we believe that the combination of what I just described, being able to leverage our distribution of customers, combining the data that we have that we can continue to sustain the growth in Credit Karma. And of course, we'll talk more about that at Investor Day."

So it's not directly tied to new business formations. This goes back to what I've been talking about for the last, frankly, 2 years before the pandemic, which is we're seeing a shift to virtual solutions, a shift to online and omnichannel and a shift to digital money offerings. And I think what we're just seeing here is the pandemic accelerated that 5-plus years. And so both new acquisition and retention continues to be strong. 
And based on a lot of our innovation and just the economic recovery, we're seeing that same strength in payroll and payments, in time tracking and which is why, as Michelle mentioned earlier, we actually expect sometime in our fiscal year '22 to be at or above our 30% online ecosystem growth."

And our machine learning and knowledge engineering capabilities, not only continue to make the platform easier for the consumer, but also much, much easier and insightful for the expert. Which means that our experts are far more effective, far more efficient and focus on the value that they bring to customers. 
And really, a lot of our investments that we make in R&D go into our Live platform, which, by the way, also benefits QuickBooks Live. So it is a -- we believe we have a significant technology advantage and we've been adding over the last several years, process engineers that are also helping us improve our processes. And that, combined with technology, is really what's giving us the advantage that we have and the type of growth that we are experiencing because we also -- we measure not only recommendation scores by our consumers, but also for our experts and our recommendation scores for our experts are also up and to the right because of the ease of the platform."

What we're really focused on is what is our share of all the returns. And so we're actually quite pleased that our total share of all of IRS returns is up 1 point. And the reason that's the way we keep score now is because of our TurboTax Live platform. So that's the first thing. 
I think the second thing I would say is if you look at last year, IRS total returns were up about 3% to 4%, and then to do-it-yourself category actually grew about 2 points. And this year was flat. And so when we think about the category, we actually look at it over a 2-year period because it's really not comparing apples-to-apples. It was a very unusual last year with all of the folks that came in because of the stimulus track. So we're actually quite pleased that when you look at this year in context of last year, that our share of total IRS went up 1 point. The category stayed flat, and then our share within the category went up 1 point. So we're very, very pleased with the results, but I also wanted to just emphasize how we really keep score. 
I think the second thing I would say is our free grew 6% this year, the pay nothing customers. And that compares to 20% growth last year. So we actually feel like free moderated, and it's in the vicinity that we would have predicted and assumed and really are -- growth came from the areas that are very strategic, which is both transforming the assisted category with TurboTax Live and then the underpenetrated segment, which is what we expect for continued growth as we look in the years ahead."

So as we look ahead, we're not looking at headwinds because we've actually been dealing with a market that's really going after these type of experts in multiple different industries. There's a couple of things that not only helps us retain our experts but acquire more. And this is, of course, based on verbatims when talking to our experts. 
One, it's our culture. It is the way we treat employees, it's the benefits that we deliver. It's the overall employee experience that they have. And they're truly able to work virtually with the setup that they need and to do what they love, which is deliver for customers and not have to market their services. We are unique in that we don't ask our experts to sell. We ask our experts to do one thing, which is deliver an awesome experience for our customers. And we've had a quite high retention rate. And we have been able to recruit the best of the best. And by the way, we actually have very high standards. We have what we call an A for A process, which is assessing for awesome. They have to pass certain hurdles to be able to join us. We measure the recommendation scores. And so there's a service standard that they have to be able to deliver against. 
And now we also provide certifications. And so we help them with education to get certified and to actually be able to grow their careers.

We want as many free customers as we can get for exactly the reasons that you mentioned. One, we want to serve those customers. But then, two, over time as their life situation changes, they may have different tax needs. But now with Credit Karma, we have an opportunity to provide other benefits beyond taxes. So our strategy is unchanged. I would say, if I use this year, particularly as an example, we have end-to-end focus on free and particularly with TurboTax Live basic, where we got quite a bit of folks that came in that were from the assisted category that we love because ultimately, it's about transforming the assisted category. So our strategy is unchanged. And the growth that we saw was really in line with what we would have expected. 
There are no restrictions with Credit Karma. As I mentioned earlier, we have one launched Credit Karma as a test as part of the TurboTax filing experience, and we have launched TurboTax as part of the Credit Karma platform. And we ran 40 tests this year just to learn, to understand how we could really nail the experience, and we're going to be able to now, given our learnings, scale to a different level as we look ahead. But there are no restrictions in terms of what we can and can't do. It's really all focused on the customer experience."

Or is this really an opportunity, maybe even to go into the next tier, maybe the lower end of the mid-market at some point as you kind of move up market with QuickBooks Advanced?

With that said, to your question, we don't believe that there's a limit other than what we don't want to do is serve the Intuits of the world. We don't want to get into a place where we're serving a company the size of Intuit. And we don't want to get into a place where we get in the professional services, and we're having to customize the platform. We want it to be something that we can scale, and that is durable. 
So the limit will not stop at 100. We put that limit on ourselves to ensure that we could really nail the experience and be very intentional and focused around our scaling. And at the right time, of course, we'll communicate to you all when we choose to go beyond the 100, but we believe that there's an opportunity beyond the segments that we serve today."

First of all, I just want to clarify one thing to make sure it was not misinterpreted. We have the opportunity and made Credit Karma Money available to 36 million TurboTax customers. I don't want you all to interpret that as 3",487,"Yes. Great, Josh. Thank you. First of all, I just want to clarify one thing to make sure it was not misinterpreted. We have the opportunity and made Credit Karma Money available to 36 million TurboTax customers. I don't want you all to interpret that as 36 million customers actually took us up on Credit Karma money. I wish they did, and our goal is they will over time, but I want to just make sure that, that was clear. 
To the question that you asked, actually a great question gives me an opportunity to just very quickly paint a picture, and that is the -- I'll go back to what I shared earlier, which is the more we provide services and benefits to Credit Karma members, the more they will come back to the platform through our notifications. And the more they will engage with the services. And the more we have an opportunity to actually present more products to them. And then over time, be able to monetize that to drive our revenue growth. So the power of Credit Karma Money is if you have a checking account with us or a savings account or you choose to pick us up on direct payroll deposits, so we can give you early access to your paycheck. Not everything is necessarily about monetizing every single benefit. But the more we bring you back, the more that we can offer you, hey, Josh, we have a pre-approved credit card that's right for you. Hey, Josh, it looks like you're paying X for your auto insurance. We have an offer based on your driving habits to pay 20% less. 
So it becomes truly the vision that I described earlier, which is a financial assistant in your pocket where we are in your corner, to try to help you reduce your debt and put more money in your pocket. So we're not overly reliant on direct deposits by any means, but it just becomes another benefit and a reason to engage with the platform, which gives us opportunities to offer more products to you and then be able to monetize. 
And to your last question about M&A, our principles around M&A are steadfast. We, of course, have just based on some of the acquisitions we've made in the last several years and how well that they've done. We have a lot more confidence in our ability to execute because we truly studied our history in the last 10 years, what went well, what didn't go well, and that's informed, I mean a lot of our approaches today. And really, for us, everything is about speed-to-market. And so if there are -- if there's talent we need to acquire, technology we need to acquire or a capability like Credit Karma, those principles were informed decisions. And of course, our confidence has continued to grow, given the execution of the recent acquisitions."

We had a very strong third quarter. Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue accelerated to 20% this quarter, and Credit Karma performed very well with revenue at an all-time high",1004,"Great. Thanks, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. 
We had a very strong third quarter. Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue accelerated to 20% this quarter, and Credit Karma performed very well with revenue at an all-time high for the quarter. Our tax results through the May 17 IRS tax filing deadline reflect another strong season. As a result, we are raising our revenue, operating income and earnings per share guidance for fiscal year 2021. 
Let me start with tax. We're proud of how we delivered for our customers and executed our strategy of expanding our lead in the do-it-yourself category and transforming the assisted category. Based on our performance through the May 17 IRS tax filing deadline, we expect our consumer group revenue to grow 11% to 12% during fiscal year 2021. We expect total IRS returns to be up approximately 1%, and our share of total returns expand an estimated 1 point for the tax filing season. This results in expected total customer growth of 6% and double-digit revenue growth for the fourth year in a row. 
The average revenue per return increased, reflecting a stronger contribution by TurboTax Live and mix shift to our premier offering used by investors. We made significant progress this season. 
Within the do-it-yourself category, we continue to double down on underpenetrated segments, including Latinx, Self-Employed and Investors. We saw a significant acceleration in Investor customer growth this season and expected to more than triple over last year. We expect the base of customers paying us nothing to grow 6% this season. 
Within transforming the assisted category, we continue to make progress connecting people to experts with TurboTax Live. We expect customers to grow more than 90% this season compared to 70% growth last year and TurboTax Live customers new to Intuit to be up more than 100%. 
More broadly, our AI-driven expert platform strategy and 5 Big Bets are driving strong momentum and accelerating innovation across the company. These Big Bets are focused on the largest problems our customers face and represent durable growth opportunities for Intuit. As a reminder, these bets are: revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock SMART Money decisions, be the center of small business growth and disrupt the small business mid-market. Today, I'll highlight the notable progress we've made this quarter on 3 of these Big Bets. And we'll provide a detailed update on all 5 Big Bets at Investor Day in the fall. 
Our third Big Bet is to unlock SMART Money decisions. With Credit Karma's data platform and powerful network effects, we're making progress towards our goal of creating a personal financial assistant that helps consumers find the right financial products, put more money in their pockets and access financial expertise and advice. To deliver on this goal, our strategic focus is to grow the core, including credit cards and personal loans, expand growth verticals, including home loans, auto loans and insurance, and develop emerging verticals focused on digital money offerings, such as savings and checking accounts. 
Credit Karma also provides an additional monetization engine, increasing our combined wallet share with both free and paying customers. Credit Karma achieved its largest quarterly revenue ever in Q3, while the number of members, monthly active users and frequency of member visits reached all-time highs. Within the core, Credit Karma personal revenue was at a record high on a combined basis, reflecting an increase in both the number of partners and member engagement. The growth verticals also achieved all-time high revenue, reflecting strong momentum in auto insurance followed by home loans and auto loans. And we're developing the emerging verticals by focusing on innovation with Credit Karma Money, part of our digital money offering. 
We continue to make great progress combining our capabilities to fuel the success of Credit Karma. Since the acquisition closed, TurboTax customers and migrating Turbo users accounted for 40% of new Credit Karma members, significantly accelerating new member growth. We're pleased with the initial performance of Credit Karma Money, which we integrated into TurboTax filing experience, offering approximately 36 million TurboTax customers the opportunity deposit up to $88 billion of tax refunds into note fee checking accounts. 
Providing this product integration helps members achieve their financial goals, drives member engagement and creates a new revenue stream for the company in the future. The more we successfully innovate for Credit Karma members, the more times members visit the platform and the more opportunities we have to offer members products that are right for them, resulting in more monetization opportunities for Intuit. 
Our fourth Big Bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get customers that paid fast, manage capital, pay employees with confidence and grow in our omnichannel world. 60% of small businesses struggle with cash flow, and we're continuing to innovate to create solutions for customers to overcome this challenge. 
We are excited about our progress with QuickBooks Cash, a small business bank account that helps our customers manage working capital. QuickBooks Cash presents a full financial picture along with the ability to move money instantly and ensures that their money is working for them while taking advantage of the built-in accounting of QuickBooks. We achieved a milestone this quarter as QuickBooks Cash balances surpassed $100 million, and we're seeing strong active use among both new and existing customers. 
Our fifth Big Bet is to disrupt small business mid-market with QuickBooks Online Advanced. The usage of services such as payments, payroll and time tracking with QBO Advanced customers is more than 30% higher than the next QBO offering in our lineup, contributing to higher ARPC while overall engagement is up over 10 points year-to-date. We're very pleased with our results and remain confident in our game plan to win, accelerated by digital tailwinds. Across all of our Big Bets, we're building momentum and accelerating innovation, which we believe positions us well for durable growth in the future. 
Now let me hand it over to Michelle."

For the third quarter of fiscal 2021, we delivered revenue of $4.2 billion, GAAP operating income of $1.9 billion versus $1.4 billion last year, non-GAAP operating income of $2.2 billion versus $1.5 billion last",1106,"Thanks, Sasan. Good afternoon, everyone. 
For the third quarter of fiscal 2021, we delivered revenue of $4.2 billion, GAAP operating income of $1.9 billion versus $1.4 billion last year, non-GAAP operating income of $2.2 billion versus $1.5 billion last year, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $5.30 versus $4.11 a year ago, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $6.07 versus $4.49 last year. 
Turning to the business segments. Consumer Group revenue grew 34% in Q3, reflecting a shift in the timing of the IRS tax filing window year-over-year. The revenue we're reporting today is for our third quarter ending April 30. That said, based on our performance through the May 17 tax filing deadline, we are raising our Consumer Group revenue guidance to 11% to 12% growth for fiscal 2021, up from 9% to 10% previously. 
There are 4 primary drivers in our consumer business. Note that these levers exclude approximately 8 million stimulus filings last year. This data reflects our expectations for the season through July 31, 2021, versus the prior season through July 31, 2020. The first is the total number of returns filed with the IRS which we expect to be up approximately 1% by the end of the season. The second is the percentage of those returns filed using do-it-yourself software. We expect the DIY category share of total IRS returns to be approximately flat by the end of the season. 
The third driver is our share. We expect our share of total tax returns to expand 1 point this season and our share of the DIY category to be up approximately 1 point. The fourth is average revenue per return, which increased again this season. This growth reflects a stronger contribution by TurboTax Live and mix shift to our premier offering, which is used by investors. 
Turning to the ProConnect Group. Revenue grew 22% in Q3, reflecting a shift in the timing of the IRS tax filing window year-over-year. For the full year, we expect ProConnect Group revenue growth of 2%. In the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 20% during the quarter, including 1 point from approximately $10 million of nonrecurring Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP revenue. 
Online Ecosystem revenue was up 28%, including 2 points of growth from approximately $7 million of PPP revenue. Our longer-term expectation remains 30% or greater Online Ecosystem revenue growth, driven by 10% to 20% growth in both customers and ARPC. We expect to return to 30% Online Ecosystem revenue growth at some point during fiscal '22. 
our strategic focus within Small Business and Self-Employed is to grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 24% in fiscal Q3, driven mainly by customer growth and mix shift. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online Services revenue, which includes payments, payroll, time tracking and capital, grew 34% in fiscal Q3 or 31% excluding PPP revenue. 
Within payments, revenue growth reflects continued customer growth, along with an increase in charge volume per customer. Within payroll, we continue to see revenue tailwinds during the quarter from a mix shift to our full-service offering and growth in payroll customers. 
During the quarter, we began migrating customers once again to our new Full-Service lineup. This did not have a significant impact on revenue during the quarter. Third, our progress expanding globally added to the growth of Online Ecosystem revenue during fiscal Q3. Total international online revenue grew 38% on a constant currency basis. 
Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 9% in the third quarter, including approximately $3 million of PPP revenue. As a reminder, in the third quarter last year, the Desktop business declined sharply, reflecting the impact of the pandemic. QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew mid-single digits in Q3. 
Note that we discontinued the TurboTax and QuickBooks Self-Employed bundle this year. We remain committed to serving the Self-Employed segment. However, after years of experimentation, we determined that serving Self-Employed customers through separate TurboTax and QuickBooks offerings is most effective. There was no material impact to revenue or operating income from this decision. 
Moving on to Credit Karma. Revenue was $316 million in Q3 as the business continues to gain momentum, reflecting growing members, member engagement and expansion of new and existing partners across verticals. Revenue reached a record high in the quarter. We are also seeing engagement reach a new high-water mark with both monthly active users and frequency of member visits at all-time highs, giving us more opportunities to offer members products that are right for them. 
Turning to our financial principles. We remain committed to growing organic revenue double digits and growing operating income dollars faster than revenue. As I shared before, as we lean into our platform strategy, we see the opportunity for margin expansion over time. We take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investment greater than 15%. We continue to reallocate resources to top priorities with an emphasis on becoming an AI-driven expert platform. These principles remain our long-term commitment. 
Our first priority for the cash we generate is investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. We consider acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product road map. We return excess cash that we can't invest profitably in the business to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends. 
We finished the quarter with approximately $4.1 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet. We repurchased $380 million of stock during the third quarter. We have approximately $1.8 billion remaining on our authorization, and we expect to be in the market each quarter this year. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per share, payable July 19, 2021. This represents an 11% increase versus last year. 
Moving on to guidance. Our guidance for fourth quarter fiscal 2021 includes revenue growth of 26% to 28%, GAAP earnings per share of $0.78 to $0.83 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.55 to $1.60. We are also raising our fiscal 2021 guidance following strong performance in the first 3 quarters of the year. Our new guidance includes revenue growth of 22%, up from prior guidance of 15% to 17%; GAAP earnings per share of $6.96 to $7.01; and non-GAAP earnings per share of $9.32 to $9.37. We now expect a GAAP tax rate of 21% in fiscal 2021. You can find our full Q4 and updated fiscal 2021 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan."

Very nice quarter, good to see momentum really across all parts of the business heading into Q4. 2 questions, one for Sasan on Credit Karma.

Can you dive into that a little bit more in terms of -- versus your expectations, how well have those offers been working? I mean I saw them while I was doing my taxes in TurboTax and saw the offers for Credit Karma. Have you been taking you guys up on that, has that been a material contributor as of yet? And are there like kind of linkages that we should be thinking about on the QuickBooks side of the equation of where you're starting to create those connections as well? 
And then maybe one for Michelle. Now we're looking for 100 basis points of margin expansion this year in the revised guidance, that's awesome. Does this take away from future years? Are we getting sort of a pull-forward of operating margins? Or could we see consistency in this operating margin expansion on a go-forward basis?"

Got it. Very, very helpful. So I think the place I would start is, if you go back a year plus from the time we've been working with Credit Karma, really their focus, even during the pandemic, was to deliver benefits for customers from the perspective of how to manage their money, credit scores, how to get some of the COVID-19 Relief Act help. And one of the things that happened based on just the obsessive focus on customers is their engagement increased at a time where the pandemic was impacting the supply side of the equation. 
In addition to that, their investment in Lightbox and getting partners to really understand a Lightbox, the value of Lightbox, how it's good for consumers and how it's good for partners, whether it's financial institutions and insurance companies, is now really paying off. Because what you're seeing now is because the member engagement was up and to the right, you have more transactions that are happening on Lightbox, which really for the consumer means a much better match and eligibility for the partner. It means they are able to also make a perfect match. All of those things is really what's resulting in the momentum that we see right now, not only in the core, which is credit cards and personal loans and the areas where the company has been investing in 13-plus years, but also in the last year plus new areas, which is auto insurance, auto loans and home loans. 
So that's the acceleration that we're seeing. A lot of the synergy opportunities are going to pay off in the future. And particularly, there are several. One that we've talked about is ensuring that we, with customers' permission, move all their data records from TurboTax to Credit Karma so that they can get much more personalized offers that are right for them on the first click, the launching of Credit Karma, both in the TurboTax experience, but also launching TurboTax as part of the Credit Karma platform. This was really all about a learning year. We ran 40-plus experiments, Keith, learned a ton, made a number of adjustments, and I think it positions us for the months and the years ahead. So a lot of the opportunities that we think about are -- that are synergies between the 2 companies are coming in the future. And that really is what's exciting. 
What I would say has been a near-term impact is the fact that 40% of the new Credit Karma members actually came from either TurboTax and/or the fact that we deprecated Turbo, and that has been an instant sort of a thrust for Credit Karma. But a lot of what I just described is yet to come, which is what's exciting about the platform. 
Specifically to your question around QuickBooks, that has been sequenced for some time down the road, Keith. We're very focused on what's most important, the biggest drivers of innovation and benefits for members. And QuickBooks is going to be something that we'll think about down the road, but it's been very intentionally sequenced so we don't distract the team."

So whether that's looking at technology or customer success or go-to-market, there are opportunities for us to continue to leverage the platform. 
However, I would remind you that this year is just very unique. We were deep in the pandemic at the beginning of the year, and we were conservative with our spending. Specifically, if you look at something like Credit Karma, it really took a while even though they really started to bounce back much more quickly than we anticipated. But it took us a while to be able to ramp up the spend when we saw that, and we do feel like we will continue to invest to drive accelerated growth in there. So I would just say this year is a little bit a unique year with the pandemic."

And then any color you can provide on this initial year of full service, what that adoption rate look like? 
And then for Michelle, just also a quick question on spend. It looks like R&D saw a really big step-up this quarter. It looked like roughly 30% year-over-year. How should we think about kind of where those investments are being funneled? And is that kind of the right pace of growth, at least for the near-term future on the product side?"

The thing I would start with is I would want all of you to think about TurboTax now as a platform, and it is a platform that allows you to do your taxes yourself or we give you the opportunity to provide an expert to help you get your taxes done with you. And/or you can, in essence, hand everything off to us and we'll do your taxes for you completely. And so the -- really the momentum of accelerating from 70% growth to 90% growth is the fact that we are continuing to build momentum. 
We're improving the platform. We are doing a far better job raising awareness. More folks are considering getting help in this world, in a virtual world. And we'll -- we're delivering really excellent experiences where our product recommendation scores are continuing to be one of the best that we've seen across the company. 
So I bring that up just to say that what you're just experiencing and what we are experiencing is momentum. And Full Service just plays a halo effect role. The fundamental problem that we are solving for customers is one of confidence. And they want to know that if they need help that they can get access to an expert or even midstream, if they want to just hand everything off to somebody else to do their taxes, they can do it right off the bat. And so it provides a halo effect for the entire franchise that I can get my taxes done with TurboTax. 
And whether or not I delegate everything now and next year perhaps just ask for an expert or even the year after that, do it myself, that all helps the franchise. So that's the role that it's playing, which is why we're seeing the accelerated growth. And we'll share some of the specific metrics perhaps at Investor Day, but the majority of these customers are continuing to come from the assisted category."

What I would say is outside of the U.S. and Canada, recovery has been slower. So from a geographic perspective, the strength is really U.S. and Canada. And then particularly, answer your question on desktop. I think, as Michelle said, it's less about seasonality, but more from the perspective of desktop also saw a very deep decline this time last year.

And what that is an indication of is just the size of the businesses that we are serving. But also in some ways, the digital transformation for the mid-market is the same, if not a little bit behind the smaller businesses, which is why we're so excited about the possibilities with QuickBooks Advanced to truly give them, a customer as a platform that becomes a source of truth for their entire business. 
Specifically, to your question around internal, I would say that from some of the decisions that we made years ago with a lot of the tools that we use internally, one, are shipped today, WS, the collaboration tools that we use internally, these are decisions and choices that we made 3 to 4 years ago, and we're fortunate that we're now using a lot of these digital tools internally, along with, of course, our shift to AWS. So I would say that although the usage went up in the pandemic, it didn't inform a different set of decisions because I think as a team, these decisions were made proactively 4 to 5 years ago."

Big picture, we're very pleased with what we experienced this season, and it's consistent with what we declared several years ago. Our biggest opportunity for continued growth is to be able to transform the assisted category. There's 86 million folks that, in essence, get assistance to get their taxes done. It's more than $20 billion in size. And beyond that, there's about an $8 billion business tax segment. 
And the second is underpenetrated segments, which is Investors, Self-Employed, Latinx. And when you look at our results this year, coming sort of out of the pandemic, our TurboTax Live platform accelerated to 90%. And we saw our Investors segment actually grow triple what it did last year. And we always want to continue to grow units, which will then result in ARPU. 
I think given that our biggest opportunity is not only under-penetrated segments and transforming assisted, we may just see more ARPU than units. It's more a result of our strategy and where we are focused and where the biggest opportunity is. So if I put this season in context of our strategy, I would say it is absolutely in line with our strategy and it's for us, it's more about just continuing to accelerate in the areas that we declared several years ago."

The -- if you just step back, what really drives Credit Karma's growth is the number of members, the number of transactions per member and then the revenue per transaction. So that's sort of big picture metrics. The second is, if you think about Credit Karma, it's got well over 110 million customers and it's a data platform that creates a powerful network effect. And really, it's technology-driven via Lightbox. 
And really, our opportunity is to continue to not only grow the products that we have today, which is credit cards and personal loans, but also the new products, which is auto and home insurance and home loans, but also the new areas that we're moving into, which is Credit Karma Money that we've talked about, which is savings, checking, early access to wages. And then ultimately, you can also get your taxes done on Credit Karma. And by the way, there's no boundary to what product verticals that we'll launch over time because we've got a relationship with over 100 million customers. We deliver personalized experiences, and they know that we're there for them. We're putting the power of their data in their hands. 
So I bring that up to say that during the pandemic, we were obsessively focused on benefits, even though the market was sort of in shambles. When I say the market because of the health crisis. And so what you're seeing now is, one, the benefit of a lot of the work that we did during the pandemic launching these new verticals, delivering benefits to customers that was about how to manage their money and their credit score. And our really member engagement went up into the right even during the pandemic. 
And so now with -- coming out of the pandemic and more financial institutions being in Lightbox, we're actually seeing more transactions in Lightbox which makes a more personalized match for not only the consumer, but it benefits significantly the financial institution. So this is not just a macro recovery, it's an end. 
And looking ahead, we believe that the combination of what I just described, being able to leverage our distribution of customers, combining the data that we have that we can continue to sustain the growth in Credit Karma. And of course, we'll talk more about that at Investor Day."

And we're seeing -- continuing to see an acceleration in both areas. And the businesses that tend to typically come to QuickBooks, they're a little bit more mature. So it's not directly tied to new business formations. This goes back to what I've been talking about for the last, frankly, 2 years before the pandemic, which is we're seeing a shift to virtual solutions, a shift to online and omnichannel and a shift to digital money offerings. And I think what we're just seeing here is the pandemic accelerated that 5-plus years. And so both new acquisition and retention continues to be strong. 
And based on a lot of our innovation and just the economic recovery, we're seeing that same strength in payroll and payments, in time tracking and which is why, as Michelle mentioned earlier, we actually expect sometime in our fiscal year '22 to be at or above our 30% online ecosystem growth."

And our machine learning and knowledge engineering capabilities, not only continue to make the platform easier for the consumer, but also much, much easier and insightful for the expert, which means that our experts are far more effective, far more efficient and focused on the value that they bring to customers. 
And really, a lot of our investments that we make in R&D go into our Live platform, which, by the way, also benefits QuickBooks Live. So it is a -- we believe we have a significant technology advantage and we've been adding over the last several years, process engineers that are also helping us improve our processes. And that, combined with technology, is really what's giving us the advantage that we have and the type of growth that we are experiencing because we also -- we measure not only recommendation scores by our consumers, but also for our experts and our recommendation scores for our experts are also up and to the right because of the ease of the platform."

And last year, those were 10.5% of all of the federal filings. So it's a pretty significant amount of the federal filings. And so that was really why we wanted to provide the table when everything is conclusive.

And then the second part of the question is, with everything you've said about 90% up in TurboTax Live, customers and the premier category tripling, really implies a lot of revenue per return growth.

What we're really focused on is what is our share of all the returns. And so we're actually quite pleased that our total share of all of IRS returns is up 1 point. And the reason that's the way we keep score now is because of our TurboTax Live platform. So that's the first thing. 
I think the second thing I would say is if you look at last year, IRS total returns were up about 3% to 4%, and then the do-it-yourself category actually grew about 2 points. And this year was flat. And so when we think about the category, we actually look at it over a 2-year period because it's really not comparing apples-to-apples. It was a very unusual last year with all of the folks that came in because of the stimulus track. So we're actually quite pleased that when you look at this year in context of last year, that our share of total IRS went up 1 point. The category stayed flat, and then our share within the category went up 1 point. So we're very, very pleased with the results, but I also wanted to just emphasize how we really keep score. 
I think the second thing I would say is our free grew 6% this year, the pay nothing customers. And that compares to 20% growth last year. So we actually feel like free moderated, and it's in the vicinity that we would have predicted and assumed and really are -- growth came from the areas that are very strategic, which is both transforming the assisted category with TurboTax Live and then the underpenetrated segment, which is what we expect for continued growth as we look in the years ahead."

Thank you for your question, Daniel. In fact, I would share with you that the last couple of years, it's not been easy because everybody is -- and I don't mean in our space, but everybody is actually trying to find ways to shift to a virtual world and the pandemic just simply accelerated. So as we look ahead, we're not looking at headwinds because we've actually been dealing with a market that's really going after these type of experts in multiple different industries. There's a couple of things that not only helps us retain our experts but acquire more. And this is, of course, based on verbatims when talking to our experts. 
One, it's our culture. It is the way we treat employees, it's the benefits that we deliver. It's the overall employee experience that they have. And they're truly able to work virtually with the setup that they need and to do what they love, which is deliver for customers and not have to market their services. We are unique in that we don't ask our experts to sell. We ask our experts to do one thing, which is deliver an awesome experience for our customers. 
And we've had a quite high retention rate. And we have been able to recruit the best of the best. And by the way, we actually have very high standards. We have what we call an A for A process, which is assessing for awesome. They have to pass certain hurdles to be able to join us. We measure the recommendation scores. And so there's a service standard that they have to be able to deliver against. 
And now we also provide certifications. And so we help them with education to get certified and to actually be able to grow their careers.

So our strategy is unchanged. And the growth that we saw was really in line with what we would have expected. 
There are no restrictions with Credit Karma. As I mentioned earlier, we have one launched Credit Karma as a test as part of the TurboTax filing experience, and we have launched TurboTax as part of the Credit Karma platform. And we ran 40 tests this year just to learn, to understand how we could really nail the experience, and we're going to be able to now, given our learnings, scale to a different level as we look ahead.

You've obviously seen some real traction there, and it's an effort to kind of move upmarket. Is there a limit where perhaps you draw the line, north of which it's going to be difficult for QuickBooks to kind of go? Or is this really an opportunity, maybe even to go into the next tier, maybe the lower end of the mid-market at some point as you kind of move up market with QuickBooks Advanced? Obviously, there's that balance between optimizing for the Small Business and then features for larger organizations. So how are you thinking about that balance?

With that said, to your question, we don't believe that there's a limit other than what we don't want to do is serve the Intuits of the world. We don't want to get into a place where we're serving a company the size of Intuit. And we don't want to get into a place where we get in the professional services, and we're having to customize the platform. We want it to be something that we can scale, and that is durable. 
So the limit will not stop at 100. We put that limit on ourselves to ensure that we could really nail the experience and be very intentional and focused around our scaling. And at the right time, of course, we'll communicate to you all when we choose to go beyond the 100, but we believe that there's an opportunity beyond the segments that we serve today."

First of all, I just want to clarify one thing to make sure it was not misinterpreted. We have the opportunity and made Credit Karma Money available to 36 million TurboTax customers. I don't want you all to interpret that as 3",487,"Yes. Great, Josh. Thank you. First of all, I just want to clarify one thing to make sure it was not misinterpreted. We have the opportunity and made Credit Karma Money available to 36 million TurboTax customers. I don't want you all to interpret that as 36 million customers actually took us up on Credit Karma money. I wish they did, and our goal is they will over time, but I want to just make sure that, that was clear. 
To the question that you asked, actually a great question gives me an opportunity to just very quickly paint a picture, and that is the -- I'll go back to what I shared earlier, which is the more we provide services and benefits to Credit Karma members, the more they will come back to the platform through our notifications. And the more they will engage with the services. And the more we have an opportunity to actually present more products to them. And then over time, be able to monetize that to drive our revenue growth. 
So the power of Credit Karma Money is if you have a checking account with us or a savings account or you choose to pick us up on direct payroll deposits, so we can give you early access to your paycheck. Not everything is necessarily about monetizing every single benefit. But the more we bring you back, the more that we can offer you, hey, Josh, we have a pre-approved credit card that's right for you. Hey, Josh, it looks like you're paying X for your auto insurance. We have an offer based on your driving habits to pay 20% less. 
So it becomes truly the vision that I described earlier, which is a financial assistant in your pocket where we are in your corner, to try to help you reduce your debt and put more money in your pocket. So we're not overly reliant on direct deposits by any means, but it just becomes another benefit and a reason to engage with the platform, which gives us opportunities to offer more products to you and then be able to monetize. 
And to your last question about M&A, our principles around M&A are steadfast. We, of course, have just based on some of the acquisitions we've made in the last several years and how well that they've done. We have a lot more confidence in our ability to execute because we truly studied our history in the last 10 years, what went well, what didn't go well, and that's informed, I mean, a lot of our approaches today. 
And really, for us, everything is about speed-to-market. And so if there are -- if there's talent we need to acquire, technology we need to acquire or a capability like Credit Karma, those principles were informed decisions. And of course, our confidence has continued to grow, given the execution of the recent acquisitions."

We had a very strong fourth quarter, capping off an outstanding year. Full year revenue grew 25%, including the addition of Credit Karma. Total revenue growth was fueled by 16% growth for the Small Business and Self-Employed Group and 14% growth for the Consumer Group, while Credit Karma had a very strong year, delivering another record quarter in Q4. 
Combined platform revenue, which includes QuickBooks Online, TurboTax Online and Credit Karma grew 39% to $6.6 billion in fiscal year 2021. This includes 18 points from the addition of Credit Karma. I'm proud of what the team has accomplished this year, and our game plan to win remains durable. 
Let me now turn over to tax. This year marks our fourth consecutive year of double-digit revenue growth. We've built a durable strategy, and we've made outstanding progress this year, with customer growth of 6% and our share of total returns up approximately 1 point. We extended our lead in the do-it-yourself category by focusing on under-penetrated segments, including investor customers, where we tripled the growth rate from last year. 
We continued to transform the $20 billion assisted segment with TurboTax Live, accelerating total customer growth by nearly 100%. We have highly predictable model and a platform with significant runway for growth as we accelerate innovation. 
Recently, we announced plans not to renew our participation in the IRS Free File program. We expect no impact to revenue from this decision. I want to make sure that you understand how this decision fits within our overall strategy. Free offerings are a critical part of our strategy to serve and grow with customers over time, offering benefits to power their prosperity. Intuit has delivered nearly 100 million free tax filings over the past 8 years and with nearly 90% of those free tax filings coming outside of the IRS Free File program. Looking ahead, with no IRS Free File program constraints, customers can enjoy all of the innovation we have to offer on our TurboTax, Credit Karma and Mint's platform. 
Our AI-driven expert platform strategy and 5 Big Bets are driving strong momentum and accelerating innovation across the company. These Big Bets are focused on the largest problems our customers face and represent durable growth opportunities for Intuit. As a reminder, these Big Bets are: revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock SMART Money decisions, be the center of Small Business growth and disrupt the small business mid-market. Today, I'll highlight the notable progress we've made this quarter on 3 of these Big Bets, and we'll provide a detailed update on all 5 Big Bets at Investor Day next month. 
Our second Big Bet is to connect people to experts. We're solving one of the largest problems our customers face, lack of confidence, by connecting people to experts virtually with TurboTax Live and QuickBooks Live. With TurboTax Live, we're transforming the $20 billion assisted category by providing 86 million filers who have previously relied on in-person assistance, the opportunity to access tax experts to help them do their taxes or complete their return digitally. This expertise provides confidence for consumers and creates a halo effect for our entire TurboTax experience. 
The TurboTax Live funnel was strong this season. Customer awareness grew over 20% and TurboTax Live customers new to Intuit grew more than 100%. Our Full-Service do-it-for-me offering attracted new customers from the assisted segment at a rate nearly 25% higher than our TurboTax Live do-it-with-me offering. 
Our third Big Bet is to unlock SMART Money decisions. With Crédit Comer's data platform and powerful network effects, we're making progress towards our goal of creating a personal financial assistant that helps consumers find the right financial products, put more money in their pockets and access financial expertise and advice. To deliver on this goal, our strategic focus is to grow the core, including credit cards and personal loans; expand growth verticals, including home loans, auto loans and insurance; and develop emerging verticals focused on digital money offerings, such as savings and checking accounts. 
Credit Karma also provides an additional monetization engine, increasing our combined wallet share with both free and paying customers. Credit Karma achieved another record high revenue quarter in Q4, with the number of members reaching a new all-time high, fueled partly by the TurboTax integration and monthly active users and frequency of member visits remain strong. 
Within the core, credit card and personal revenue achieved another record high on a combined basis, reflecting an increase in transactions per member. The growth verticals also achieved an all-time revenue high again this quarter, reflecting strong momentum in auto insurance, followed by home loans and auto loans. And we're developing the emerging verticals by -- emerging verticals by focusing on innovation with Crédit Karma Money, part of our digital money offering. 
Just this past month -- or just this month, we announced the integration of QuickBooks Online payroll to deliver a better checking experience or a portion of our Small Business employees that help them manage all aspects of their finances all in one place. These results are evidence that successful innovation drives Credit Karma members to the platform, creating more opportunities to connect them with products that are right for them, resulting in more monetization opportunities for Intuit. 
The all-time highs we achieved are driven by focused innovation in both bolstering our proprietary AI-powered Lightbox technology and investing in growth verticals such as home and auto, as well as pent-up demand from our partners. Lightbox enables Credit Karma to present offers to members to have a higher likelihood of approval. Partners' usage of Lightbox in Q4 is now at an all-time high, with over 50% of credit card and over 40% of personal loan transactions flowing through versus less than 40% and 20% a year ago. 
This is the power of a network effect, solving a 2-sided problem. We expect pent-up demand across the core verticals to taper this coming year after a very strong year of investments by our partners, returning to pre-COVID investment levels. I'm very pleased with our progress and excited about the upcoming innovations. 
I'll end by circling back to our first Big Bet, which is our foundational bet to revolutionize speed to benefit for our customers. Our goal is to put more money in our customers' pockets, eliminate friction and deliver confidence at every touch point by using AI and customer insights. 
This year, we accelerated our use of AI, increasing the number of models deployed across our platform by nearly 50%, saving our customers millions of hours of work. Our application of AI has dramatically increased the number of experiments we ran by more than 35% this year, made it easier for our TurboTax customers to never enter data, saving them millions of hours of manual entry and modernize our payroll offering, tripling release velocity. We are very pleased with our results and remain confident in our game plan to win, accelerated by digital tailwinds. 
Across all of our Big Bets, we're building momentum and accelerating innovation, which we believe positions us well for durable growth in the future. We will continue to invest aggressively, including in key talent to drive even faster innovation going forward. 
Now let me hand it over to Michelle."
21171,1675608240,2385174,"Intuit Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 24, 2021",2021-08-24,"Earnings Calls","Intuit Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Sasan. Good afternoon, everyone. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we delivered revenue of $2.6 billion, GAAP operating income of $402 million versus $483 million last year. Non-GAAP operating income of $715 million versus $616 million last",1288,"Thanks, Sasan. Good afternoon, everyone. 
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we delivered revenue of $2.6 billion, GAAP operating income of $402 million versus $483 million last year. Non-GAAP operating income of $715 million versus $616 million last year. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.37 versus $1.68 a year ago. And non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.97 versus $1.81 last year. 
Turning to the business segments. In the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 19% during the quarter and 16% in fiscal 2021. Online Ecosystem revenue grew 30% in the fourth quarter and 26% for the year. With the aim of being the source of truth for Small Businesses, our strategic focus within Small Business and Self-Employed is threefold: grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. 
First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online Accounting revenue grew 28% in fiscal Q4, driven mainly by customer growth, mix shift and higher effective prices. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue, which includes payments, payroll, time tracking and capital, grew 35% in fiscal Q4. Within payments, revenue growth reflects ongoing customer growth, along with an increase in-charge volume per customer. Within payroll, we continue to see revenue tailwinds during the quarter from growth in payroll customers and a mix shift to our Full-Service offering. 
During the quarter, we continued migrating customers to our new Full-Service lineup, which added approximately 5 points to online services growth. We're also seeing the number of employees per customer back to pre-pandemic levels. 
Third, our progress expanding globally added to the growth of Online Ecosystem revenue during fiscal Q4. Total international Online revenue grew 47% on a constant currency basis. We believe the best measure of the health and success of our strategy is Online Ecosystem revenue growth, which we expect to grow better than 30% over time. This is driven by 10% to 20% expected growth in both customers and ARPC. 
Desktop ecosystem revenue grew 5% in the fourth quarter and 4% for the full year. QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew mid-single digits in fiscal 2021. Consumer Group revenue grew 14% in fiscal 2021, above the high end of our longer-term expectation of 8% to 12%. Fiscal 2021 was the fourth consecutive year of double-digit revenue growth for the Consumer Group. TurboTax units grew 6% this season. 
There are 4 primary drivers in our Consumer business. Note that these metrics exclude approximately 8 million stimulus filings last season. This data reflects the season through July 31, 2021 versus the prior season through July 31, 2020. 
The first is the total number of returns filed with the IRS, which we estimate will be up approximately 3% this season, higher than our prior estimate of up approximately 1%. The second is the percentage of those returns filed using do-it-yourself software. We estimate the DIY category share of total IRS returns was down slightly this season versus our prior estimate of approximately flat. 
The third driver is our share. Our share of total tax returns expanded approximately 1 point to 31% this season, and our share of the DIY category grew approximately 1 point. Our total share, excluding Free File customers this season, was approximately 29%. 
The fourth is average revenue per return, which increased again this season. This growth reflects a stronger contribution by TurboTax Live and mix shift to our premier offering, which is used by investors. We estimate our retention rate rose slightly year-over-year, excluding filers seeking stimulus payments last season that didn't return again this season, and we're pleased with these results. Including these filers, we estimate total retention was down approximately 2 points. 
Turning to the ProConnect Group. We reported $517 million of revenue in fiscal 2021, up 5%. Moving on to Credit Karma. Revenue was $405 million in Q4, another all-time high, reflecting record highs for both the core and growth verticals. Sequential growth predominantly reflects strength in credit cards and personal loans as transactions per member increased. As Sasan shared earlier, we expect pent-up demand across the core verticals to taper sometime in fiscal 2022 after a strong year of investment by our partners. We remain excited about the opportunities ahead for this platform. 
Turning to our financial principles. We remain committed to growing organic revenue double digits and growing operating income dollars faster than revenue. As I've shared before, as we lean into our platform strategy, we see the opportunity for margin expansion over time. We take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investment greater than 15%. We continue to reallocate resources to top priorities, with an emphasis on becoming an AI-driven expert platform. These principles remain our long-term commitment. 
Our first priority for the cash we generate is investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. We consider acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product road map. We return excess cash that we can't invest profitably in the business to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends. 
We finished the quarter with approximately $3.9 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet. We repurchased $467 million of stock during the fourth quarter and $1 billion during fiscal 2021. The Board approved a new $2 billion repurchase authorization, giving us a total authorization of approximately $3.3 billion to repurchase shares. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. 
The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.68 per share payable October 18, 2021. This represents a 15% increase versus last year. 
Moving on to guidance. Our full year fiscal 2022 guidance includes revenue of $11.05 billion to $11.2 billion, growth of 15% to 16% and including a full year of Credit Karma; GAAP earnings per share of $7.46 to $7.66 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $11.05 to $11.25. We expect a GAAP tax rate of 20% in fiscal 2022. Note that our revenue guidance for Credit Karma of $1.345 billion to $1.38 billion translates into 18% to 21% growth if we had a full year of Credit Karma revenue during fiscal 2021. 
I'd like to provide some additional context around our operating margin expectations. As I've shared before, we continue to see opportunities to leverage the platform and drive margin expansion over time. However, our guidance implies GAAP operating margin declined just over 2 points in fiscal 2022 versus fiscal 2021. This reflects the impact of the Credit Karma acquisition along with investments we're making in stock compensation to attract and retain talent. We are confident these are the right decisions to drive long-term growth. On a non-GAAP basis, our guidance implies operating margin in fiscal 2022 expands approximately 60 basis points. 
As I shared last quarter, fiscal 2021 was a very unique year, as we took a conservative approach to investments during the first half of the year when we were deep in the pandemic, and then the business started to bounce back more quickly than we anticipated in the second half. Our fiscal 2022 non-GAAP operating margin implies, on average, a point of expansion each year since fiscal 2019, even though our initial guidance after closing the Credit Karma acquisition included a negative 2-point non-GAAP operating margin impact. We continue to see margin expansion opportunities ahead. 
Our Q1 fiscal 2022 guidance includes revenue growth of 36% to 38%, GAAP earnings per share of $0.14 to $0.19 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.94 to $0.99. You can find our full Q1 and fiscal 2022 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan."

Thank you, Kirk. I'll just take us back to several years ago when we talked about the importance of having a platform that really allows our customers to not only grow their business but to be able to manage their money and ensure that they're compliant. And we've been heavily investing in payments, making it very easy for our customers to discover, making sure that we provide them with choice, accelerating our innovation in areas like instant deposit, getting paid upfront, those sorts of things. 
And with that, along with our investments in payroll, similar areas where we're really focused on making the experience far better, innovating in things like same-day payroll or next-day payroll, the shift to full service, where we have experts to help run your payroll and help you with your taxes, those are just, of course, 2 very big and important illustrative examples where those innovations are really continuing to accelerate and beginning to pay off, especially in a time where we have digital tailwinds where you have customers that are looking to move online, do more of their stuff online if they're already online. And that is starting to pan out when you look at our overall services revenue, whether it's payroll, payments, time tracking, all of those areas are contributing. 
And I think to your question, yes, this is sustainable. We are continuing to become the platform that customers look to be able to run their business. Our innovations are starting to pay off, and we're not standing still. Our innovations are, in fact, accelerating and we would continue to expect that we'll be there for our customers and grow with them. 
And I think last thing I would say, especially with our move into the mid-market where we're starting to serve larger customers, those are larger transactions. And as we continue to penetrate non-consumption in the mid-market, we would continue to see that pay off."

I would just tell you that I am delighted with our continued strategic progress. And that will really feed into our future growth, which I think is the element of your question. When you think about our performance, I know I'm repeating some of the stats, but I think they're worth repeating. One, we increased our total share of IRS returns by 1 point. 
The 2 areas that really matter most that we're focused on, under-penetrated segments and transforming the assisted segments, we saw really superb results. Our overall investor volume tripled year-over-year. TurboTax Live awareness increased 20%. Our total customers grew 100%. Our new customers to the franchise, the TurboTax Live, grew over 100%. And with our Full-Service offering, it actually attracted new customers from the prior year assisted segment at a 25% higher rate than TurboTax Live do it with me. And our retention rate stayed flat to a little bit up overall. 
So when you look at all the key sort of metrics, knock on wood, it's very, very healthy, and we expect that to inform next year's growth. And we do assume, by the way, that IRS returns is going to be about flattish next year. So that's probably one important assumption that's worthwhile sharing. But this is just a continuation, as you probably heard me say multiple times, we're on a 10-year-plus run in these opportunity areas that we're focused on. And next year is just going to be another sort of important pivotal year in our quest to transform assisted and penetrated the under-penetrated segment."

And that accele",569,"Sure, Alex. Thank you for your kind comments. On Credit Karma, let me just -- I'll briefly start at the top in terms of what we are seeing. First of all, the accelerated innovation that we are seeing with Credit Karma is really paying off. And that accelerated innovation is how we're using our combined data to be able to deliver personalized experiences, leveraging Lightbox for customers. It's then ensuring that we're providing relevant offers to customers in the areas that they need it most. And now we can provide multiple relevant offers, whether it's cards, personal loans, auto insurance, home loans and beyond. 
But I think then more importantly than when they -- the offers in front of them, we have the ability to actually help them with the the potential of their approval, make it very easy when they click to actually get the offer. So those are all critical areas of innovation that are really paying off. And I think it's a testament to the platform that when our partners decided to really go after customer acquisition that they invested a good chunk of their dollars on the platform, and it just demonstrates the network effect and the power of the data and the trust of the members that we have. So that's the first element that we just believe will continue given our accelerated innovation because our -- ultimately, our penetration rate maybe one of the highest in credit cards, but it's one of the lowest when you look at auto insurance. We have so much room for increased wallet share. 
In terms of synergies, Alex, we're actually quite bullish about the possibilities into the future, and I would want you to think about those synergies into the future. And there are really several areas of synergy. One is really making Credit Karma benefits part of the entire TurboTax experience. That's one big opportunity. The other big opportunity is making it seamless and contextual in terms of TurboTax as part of the Credit Karma experience to be able to do your taxes. And then third, what we just announced, which is Credit Karma being part of the payroll experience where our payroll customers can actually deposit their monies into a free checking and savings account and be able to access their money early over time if they wish. 
So those are significant opportunities because the -- you're talking about millions and millions of TurboTax customers, payroll customers and, of course, over our -- well over 100 million Credit Karma customers that we're going to launch TurboTax to. This past year, and as I'll remind us, it feels like a long time, but we just closed Credit Karma in December. These past 8 months, we have been experimenting with incredible purpose, incredible speed and incredible intention. And it's informed what we are rolling out and what we're doing in the year to come. I would just say, in terms of those things turning into sort of material customer revenue growth. There -- we're not counting on that in the near term, we're counting on that more on the midterm because we want to really continue to nail the experience in creating ecosystem benefit across all of our members. So that's the way I would want you to think about not only what you're seeing in Credit Karma, but the growth rates that are ahead of us."

So I want to unpack both what you're trying to tell us with the ability to deliver both growth and margin leverage at this scale, and unpack it, if you can, from a gross margin versus OpEx savings perspective, right? I know -- I remember a few years ago, there was fear with lives, particularly coming into the model, it would be gross margin dilutive. And yet the gross margins have actually improved this year. So I want to understand a little bit about when you think about that incremental margin leverage, where is it coming from? And how should we think about the durability of that opportunity?"

First of all, thank you for acknowledging the margin delivery we had this year. As you mentioned gross margin, and we have continued to say that we expect gross margin to remain fairly flat over time. You're right, we did have a lot of questions as we got into the TurboTax Live business as to whether that was going to deteriorate margins. But it has remained flattish over time. And that was the last expectation we gave that I gave last year at Investor Day. 
And our big focus is obviously then on op margin. And we see the opportunity there and continue to see opportunities to drive margin leverage really as we become more and more of a platform company. FY '21 was a little unique in that with the pandemic and full swing at the beginning. We weren't exactly sure how -- exactly how things were going to play out, and we were a little bit more conservative with investments. And then the business ended up bouncing back much more quickly than we thought. 
So as I mentioned earlier, when you look over all the way back from 2019, we've got about, on average, 1 point of margin expansion. And so we feel really good about that and especially with our guide looking forward of 60 basis points. So when I think about where we'll see the expansion, though, it is really all across the business is helping us drive it. Getting leverage, whether it's in technology and looking at how we can get rid of duplicate technology and use services more, whether it's in customer success and really leaning into a platform there to deliver for all our customers or opportunities we have in our go-to-market and enabling additional technology there. So we do think that we continue to have opportunities to drive that leverage."

So let me start with your question around international. First of all, as I mentioned in the last earnings call, and I think the same trend continues. One thing that's unchanged as small businesses across the globe are still recoverin",397,"Got it. Okay. Great. So let me start with your question around international. First of all, as I mentioned in the last earnings call, and I think the same trend continues. One thing that's unchanged as small businesses across the globe are still recovering. Some have recovered to -- back to pre-COVID levels. Some have actually accelerated their business because they changed the model. But at least what we see in our sort of data, 20%-ish of small businesses are still struggling. And struggling is defined by they have -- their net deposits are down over 25%. So I think it's important just as a general perspective to recognize that the small businesses are, in general, still in recovery mode. 
With that said, our platform has become more critical than ever. And the digital nature of our platform to be able to run your business, grow your business, manage your cash flow and be compliant is more important than ever, which is why based on our innovation, overall, we're seeing this acceleration. 
And then if I put that in context of geography, I would say U.S. has really bounced back in terms of the usage of our platform. And in fact, an acceleration probably above all has happened in the U.S. I would say Canada is sort of next in terms of the recovery. And I would just put countries like the U.K., France, Australia as really being much, much slower in the recovery. 
And really, the reason is, as you've seen, there's a lot of open, shutdown, open, shutdown and that's really impacted just the sentiment of both accountants and small businesses. But even in that context, it's actually quite exciting that we delivered 47% revenue growth in constant currency last quarter and 43% for the whole year. But with that said, we're assuming a much slower recovery international than we are in the U.S. because I think it's just really important that we get out of this health crisis. 
And then once we do, we believe the small businesses will bounce back much, much faster outside the U.S. International is still important for our future. But what I just shared is just how we've taken that into account strategically and both economically and our guidance as we look ahead. And maybe with that, I'll turn it over to Michelle to answer your QuickBooks Live question."

Brent, I would say we're continuing to make some progress with QuickBooks Live. It actually goes back to what I mentioned earlier on the opportunities for platform leverage because it's actually built on the same platform as TurboTax Live, and that's what enabled us to bring it to market so much more quickly. Right now, we're still focused on achieving product market fit. Seeing some early signs here as a way to bring in customers who are new to Intuit, so help us with customer acquisition. And we do think that there's a great opportunity for us to use the Live product to help penetrate non-consumption, which, as you know, is a huge opportunity. 
The pandemic over this last year has really been an opportunity as we've seen the acceleration to a virtual world. And so obviously, customers are much more anxious to -- or much more open to using these types of experiences. And so our platform really enables that. It does solve one of the biggest problems we have with Small Business customers, which is confidence. You also see that on the TurboTax side, too. Our expert interest has continued to remain really strong. And so that's been a good thing for us to see. 
A few customer pain points we're currently working on is on solving and streamlining and automating document collection. And then enabling messaging within the offering, so customers can more easily communicate with their bookkeeper. And then last thing I'd say is, last year, we launched the setup SKU so that we could really help small businesses come in, get set up on QuickBooks and have that confidence right from the get-go, and we've seen some good success with that."

So as you move slightly upmarket in Small Business and land bigger deals with QuickBooks QuickBooks Advanced, what are the things that you're learning about that part of the market that suits into it particularly well, given that you've got a wide range of assets, AI, Credit Karma, et cetera.

And I think particularly, there are 2 areas to answer your question as we move up market, but it's also relevant. One of them is very relevant to just the smaller businesses that we're continuing to focus on. And that is, one, how do we help you grow your business? That's both relevant to the businesses that we serve today, but also very relevant to the mid-market customers. And so to be able to manage your marketing, your sales, your services is one element. 
I think the other element, which is particularly important for mid-market customers, is just all their G&A. And we believe that the live platform that we've created, the engines that we've created will actually help us go beyond bookkeeping taxes and accounting to be able to focus on some of their -- kind of how they run their business and particularly the G&A.

We want to be the platform for your taxes. And of course, obviously, beyond that with the capabilities that we have with Crédit Karma. 
Second element, I would say, is what we learned this year going to full launch is that Full-Service offering has a halo effect and build confidence for customers, which is why we were able to attract new customers from prior assisted method at a 25% higher rate into Full-Service because they know that they can digitally provide us all of their data, and we have excellent experts to be able to take very good care of them. 
So that's the biggest learning that we had. It was a hypothesis that we had from prior year experimentation, and we're going to continue to scale that as we look ahead. It's just a very critical part of our platform. And as I've said before, we believe that we're in the very, very early innings of a 10-year-plus opportunity here.

First of all, just as a reminder, we were one of the founding members of the Free File Alliance program with the IRS. And it has been, frankly, an incredible partnership with the IRS and the private industry. And when we really founded this program with the IRS, there was really 2 goals, and I'll simplify it. Really the 2 goals were we wanted, at that time, to ensure that electronic filing was used by more than 80-plus percent of all consumers. And we wanted to make sure that free filing was available to 80% plus of consumers. 
And when you forward the clock, mission accomplished on both. In fact, we've exceeded both metrics as an industry on both fronts. And free has now become prevalent across the entire industry. And so we felt that the time was right now that the mission has been accomplished to really sort of change our approach to how we can deliver benefits for customers. Free will always be an important part of its strategy, but there are constraints when you come in through the Free File Alliance program. 
And those constraints are, for instance, we can't provide you benefits on other platforms like our free Credit Karma platform. And so as we look ahead, not only will we be able to provide free tax offerings to our customers, but as they grow and we grow with them, they can benefit from Credit Karma, they can benefit from Mint if they're a small business, they can benefit from QuickBooks, things that we ultimately couldn't talk to them about if they were part of the Free File Alliance program. So sort of mission accomplished, and that's the reason for why we chose to get out. I just want to state again, the partnership with the IRS has absolutely been phenomenal and with private industry to achieve the goals of FFA."

But I think secondly, and we haven't talked much about this and we'll spend a little bit of time on this at Investor Day, is how we are now leveraging data to never lose a customer. And I give a lot of credit to our TurboTax team where we've been working on this for several years. It's not a new body of work. But to shift from just a -- engaging you once a year when it's tax time to actually understanding and leveraging what we know about you if something is changing your life, if you bought a house, if you bought a car, if you got married, if you got divorced, if you move from one state to another, that actually engage you sort of year around relative to giving you confidence that those changes can be addressed by us. 
So it's the combination of leveraging data, apply AI to that data with our models to understand who could be at risk and then engaging those customers proactively. And by the way, depending on their needs, not just with TurboTax, it could also be engaging them with the benefits of Credit Karma.

It's really not driven by price, although we have increased price this year, it's the first time we've done it over the last couple of years. 
And I tell you that we run test, and it's exactly as you said, it's -- we look at a price value equation. We have very clear pricing principles and with experimentation and data, we choose when to move forward with a price increase. And I would tell you that our innovation just in the last couple of years, literally, last year, our innovation across the company, which includes Small Business, doubled year-over-year in terms of -- when we measure that by code deployment and impact, and it's doubled again this year. 
And that shows up in how we leverage data and AI across the platform to deliver insights to customers. It shows up in payments and payroll and time tracking. And then what we've announced, which is moving up market several years ago with QuickBooks Advance, it's being able to serve product based businesses with QuickBooks Commerce. It's being able to go after nonconsumption with QuickBooks Live, which is a higher sort of price tag for our customers. 
And then our disruptive offering with QuickBooks Cash, which is, in essence, you can start with a business bank account and be able to run your business through that. So just the innovation is, I would just say, staggering, focused on cohorts of customers and going after their needs. And with an open platform, we're able to really focus on what matters more customers and monetize. So we believe that capability is one that we'll have for years to come."

We had a very strong fourth quarter, capping off an outstanding year. Full year revenue grew 25%, including the addition of Credit Karma. Total revenue growth was fueled by 16% growth for the Small Business and Self-Employed Group and 14% growth for the Consumer Group, while Credit Karma had a very strong year, delivering another record quarter in Q4.  
Combined platform revenue, which includes QuickBooks Online, TurboTax Online and Credit Karma grew 39% to $6.6 billion in fiscal year 2021. This includes 18 points from the addition of Credit Karma. I'm proud of what the team has accomplished this year, and our game plan to win remains durable.  
Let me now turn over to tax. This year marks our fourth consecutive year of double-digit revenue growth. We've built a durable strategy, and we've made outstanding progress this year, with customer growth of 6% and our share of total returns up approximately 1 point. We extended our lead in the do-it-yourself category by focusing on under-penetrated segments, including investor customers, where we tripled the growth rate from last year.  
We continued to transform the $20 billion assisted segment with TurboTax Live, accelerating total customer growth by nearly 100%. We have highly predictable model and a platform with significant runway for growth as we accelerate innovation.  
Recently, we announced plans not to renew our participation in the IRS Free File program. We expect no impact to revenue from this decision. I want to make sure that you understand how this decision fits within our overall strategy. Free offerings are a critical part of our strategy to serve and grow with customers over time, offering benefits to power their prosperity. Intuit has delivered nearly 100 million free tax filings over the past 8 years and with nearly 90% of those free tax filings coming outside of the IRS Free File program. Looking ahead, with no IRS Free File program constraints, customers can enjoy all of the innovation we have to offer on our TurboTax, Credit Karma and Mint's platform.  
Our AI-driven expert platform strategy and 5 Big Bets are driving strong momentum and accelerating innovation across the company. These Big Bets are focused on the largest problems our customers face and represent durable growth opportunities for Intuit. As a reminder, these Big Bets are: revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock SMART Money decisions, be the center of small business growth and disrupt the small business mid-market. Today, I'll highlight the notable progress we've made this quarter on 3 of these Big Bets, and we'll provide a detailed update on all 5 Big Bets at Investor Day next month.  
Our second Big Bet is to connect people to experts. We're solving one of the largest problems our customers face, lack of confidence, by connecting people to experts virtually with TurboTax Live and QuickBooks Live. With TurboTax Live, we're transforming the $20 billion assisted category by providing 86 million filers who have previously relied on in-person assistance, the opportunity to access tax experts to help them do their taxes or complete their return digitally. This expertise provides confidence for consumers and creates a halo effect for our entire TurboTax experience.  
The TurboTax Live funnel was strong this season. Customer awareness grew over 20% and TurboTax Live customers new to Intuit grew more than 100%. Our Full Service do-it-for-me offering attracted new customers from the assisted segment at a rate nearly 25% higher than our TurboTax Live do-it-with-me offering.  
Our third Big Bet is to unlock SMART Money decisions. With Credit Karma's data platform and powerful network effects, we're making progress towards our goal of creating a personal financial assistant that helps consumers find the right financial products, put more money in their pockets and access financial expertise and advice. To deliver on this goal, our strategic focus is to grow the core, including credit cards and personal loans; expand growth verticals, including home loans, auto loans and insurance; and develop emerging verticals focused on digital money offerings, such as savings and checking accounts.  Credit Karma also provides an additional monetization engine, increasing our combined wallet share with both free and paying customers. 
Credit Karma achieved another record high revenue quarter in Q4, with the number of members reaching a new all-time high, fueled partly by the TurboTax integration, and monthly active users and frequency of member visits remain strong.  
Within the core, credit card and personal revenue achieved another record high on a combined basis, reflecting an increase in transactions per member. The growth verticals also achieved an all-time revenue high again this quarter, reflecting strong momentum in auto insurance, followed by home loans and auto loans. And we're developing the emerging verticals by -- emerging verticals by focusing on innovation with Credit Karma Money, part of our digital money offering.  
Just this past month -- or just this month, we announced the integration of QuickBooks Online payroll to deliver a better checking experience or a portion of our Small Business employees that help them manage all aspects of their finances all in one place. These results are evidence that successful innovation drives Credit Karma members to the platform, creating more opportunities to connect them with products that are right for them, resulting in more monetization opportunities for Intuit.  
The all-time highs we achieved are driven by focused innovation in both bolstering our proprietary AI-powered Lightbox technology and investing in growth verticals such as home and auto, as well as pent-up demand from our partners. Lightbox enables Credit Karma to present offers to members that have a higher likelihood of approval. Partners' usage of Lightbox in Q4 is now at an all-time high, with over 50% of credit card and over 40% of personal loan transactions flowing through versus less than 40% and 20% a year ago.  
This is the power of a network effect solving a 2-sided problem. We expect pent-up demand across the core verticals to taper this coming year after a very strong year of investments by our partners, returning to pre-COVID investment levels. I'm very pleased with our progress and excited about the upcoming innovations.  
I'll end by circling back to our first Big Bet, which is our foundational bet to revolutionize speed to benefit for our customers. Our goal is to put more money in our customers' pockets, eliminate friction and deliver confidence at every touch point by using AI and customer insights.  
This year, we accelerated our use of AI, increasing the number of models deployed across our platform by nearly 50%, saving our customers millions of hours of work. Our application of AI has dramatically increased the number of experiments we ran by more than 35% this year, made it easier for our TurboTax customers to never enter data, saving them millions of hours of manual entry, and modernize our payroll offering, tripling release velocity. We are very pleased with our results and remain confident in our game plan to win, accelerated by digital tailwinds.  
Across all of our Big Bets, we're building momentum and accelerating innovation, which we believe positions us well for durable growth in the future. We will continue to invest aggressively, including in key talent, to drive even faster innovation going forward.  
Now let me hand it over to Michelle."

For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we delivered revenue of $2.6 billion, GAAP operating income of $402 million versus $483 million last year. Non-GAAP operating income of $715 million versus $616 million las",1287,"Thanks, Sasan. Good afternoon, everyone.  
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we delivered revenue of $2.6 billion, GAAP operating income of $402 million versus $483 million last year. Non-GAAP operating income of $715 million versus $616 million last year. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.37 versus $1.68 a year ago. And non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.97 versus $1.81 last year.  
Turning to the business segments. In the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 19% during the quarter and 16% in fiscal 2021. Online Ecosystem revenue grew 30% in the fourth quarter and 26% for the year. With the aim of being the source of truth for Small Businesses, our strategic focus within Small Business and Self-Employed is threefold: grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally.  
First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online Accounting revenue grew 28% in fiscal Q4, driven mainly by customer growth, mix shift and higher effective prices. 
Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue, which includes payments, payroll, time tracking and capital, grew 35% in fiscal Q4. Within payments, revenue growth reflects ongoing customer growth, along with an increase in-charge volume per customer. Within payroll, we continued to see revenue tailwinds during the quarter from growth in payroll customers and a mix shift to our Full-Service offering.  
During the quarter, we continued migrating customers to our new Full-Service lineup, which added approximately 5 points to online services growth. We're also seeing the number of employees per customer back to pre-pandemic levels.  
Third, our progress expanding globally added to the growth of Online Ecosystem revenue during fiscal Q4. Total international online revenue grew 47% on a constant currency basis. We believe the best measure of the health and success of our strategy is Online Ecosystem revenue growth, which we expect to grow better than 30% over time. This is driven by 10% to 20% expected growth in both customers and ARPC.  
Desktop ecosystem revenue grew 5% in the fourth quarter and 4% for the; full year. QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew mid-single digits in fiscal 2021. 
Consumer Group revenue grew 14% in fiscal 2021, above the high end of our longer-term expectation of 8% to 12%. Fiscal 2021 was the fourth consecutive year of double-digit revenue growth for the Consumer Group. TurboTax units grew 6% this season.  
There are 4 primary drivers in our Consumer business. Note that these metrics exclude approximately 8 million stimulus filings last season. This data reflects the season through July 31, 2021 versus the prior season through July 31, 2020.  
The first is the total number of returns filed with the IRS, which we estimate will be up approximately 3% this season, higher than our prior estimate of up approximately 1%. The second is the percentage of those returns filed using do-it-yourself software. We estimate the DIY category share of total IRS returns was down slightly this season versus our prior estimate of approximately flat.  
The third driver is our share. Our share of total tax returns expanded approximately 1 point to 31% this season, and our share of the DIY category grew approximately 1 point. Our total share, excluding Free File customers this season, was approximately 29%.  
The fourth is average revenue per return, which increased again this season. This growth reflects a stronger contribution by TurboTax Live and mix shift to our premier offering, which is used by investors. We estimate our retention rate rose slightly year-over-year, excluding filers seeking stimulus payments last season that didn't return again this season, and we're pleased with these results. Including these filers, we estimate total retention was down approximately 2 points.  
Turning to the ProConnect Group. We reported $517 million of revenue in fiscal 2021, up 5%. 
Moving on to Credit Karma. Revenue was $405 million in Q4, another all-time high, reflecting record highs for both the core and growth verticals. Sequential growth predominantly reflects strength in credit cards and personal loans as transactions per member increased. As Sasan shared earlier, we expect pent-up demand across the core verticals to taper sometime in fiscal 2022 after a strong year of investment by our partners. We remain excited about the opportunities ahead for this platform.  
Turning to our financial principles. We remain committed to growing organic revenue double digits and growing operating income dollars faster than revenue. As I've shared before, as we lean into our platform strategy, we see the opportunity for margin expansion over time. We take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investment greater than 15%. We continue to reallocate resources to top priorities, with an emphasis on becoming an AI-driven expert platform. These principles remain our long-term commitment.  
Our first priority for the cash we generate is investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. We consider acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product road map. We return excess cash that we can't invest profitably in the business to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends.  
We finished the quarter with approximately $3.9 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet. We repurchased $467 million of stock during the fourth quarter and $1 billion during fiscal 2021. The Board approved a new $2 billion repurchase authorization, giving us a total authorization of approximately $3.3 billion to repurchase shares. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter.  
The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.68 per share payable October 18, 2021. This represents a 15% increase versus last year.  
Moving on to guidance. Our full year fiscal 2022 guidance includes revenue of $11.05 billion to $11.2 billion, growth of 15% to 16% including a full year of Credit Karma; GAAP earnings per share of $7.46 to $7.66; and non-GAAP earnings per share of $11.05 to $11.25. We expect a GAAP tax rate of 20% in fiscal 2022. Note that our revenue guidance for Credit Karma of $1.345 billion to $1.38 billion translates into 18% to 21% growth if we had a full year of Credit Karma revenue during fiscal 2021.  
I'd like to provide some additional context around our operating margin expectations. As I've shared before, we continue to see opportunities to leverage the platform and drive margin expansion over time. However, our guidance implies GAAP operating margin decline just over 2 points in fiscal 2022 versus fiscal 2021. This reflects the impact of the Credit Karma acquisition along with investments we're making in stock compensation to attract and retain talent. We are confident these are the right decisions to drive long-term growth. On a non-GAAP basis, our guidance implies operating margin in fiscal 2022 expands approximately 60 basis points.  
As I shared last quarter, fiscal 2021 was a very unique year, as we took a conservative approach to investments during the first half of the year when we were deep in the pandemic, and then the business started to bounce back more quickly than we anticipated in the second half. Our fiscal 2022 non-GAAP operating margin implies, on average, a point of expansion each year since fiscal 2019, even though our initial guidance after closing the Credit Karma acquisition included a negative 2-point non-GAAP operating margin impact. We continue to see margin expansion opportunities ahead.  
Our Q1 fiscal 2022 guidance includes revenue growth of 36% to 38%, GAAP earnings per share of $0.14 to $0.19, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.94 to $0.99. You can find our full Q1 and fiscal 2022 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet.  
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan."

Thank you, Kirk. I'll just take us back to several years ago when we talked about the importance of having a platform that really allows our customers to not only grow their business, but to be able to manage their money and ensure that they're compliant. And we've been heavily investing in payments, making it very easy for our customers to discover, making sure that we provide them with choice, accelerating our innovation in areas like instant deposit, getting paid upfront, those sorts of things. 
And with that, along with our investments in payroll, similar areas where we're really focused on making the experience far better, innovating in things like same-day payroll or next-day payroll, the shift to full service, where we have experts to help run your payroll and help you with your taxes, those are just, of course, 2 very big and important illustrative examples where those innovations are really continuing to accelerate and beginning to pay off, especially in a time where we have digital tailwinds, where you have customers that are looking to move online, do more of their stuff online if they're already online. And that is starting to pan out when you look at our overall services revenue, whether it's payroll, payments, time tracking, all of those areas are contributing. 
And I think to your question, yes, this is sustainable. We are continuing to become the platform that customers look to be able to run their business. Our innovations are starting to pay off, and we're not standing still. Our innovations are, in fact, accelerating, and we would continue to expect that we'll be there for our customers and grow with them. 
And I think last thing I would say, especially with our move into the mid-market where we're starting to serve larger customers, those are larger transactions. And as we continue to penetrate non-consumption in the mid-market, we would continue to see that pay off."

Obviously, it's a little bit lumpy given the -- we don't have full sort of year-over-year comps yet.

As you heard, Sasan said we did see some of the pent-up demand. We expect that will taper in fiscal 2022. We had a pretty strong year of investment by our partners. So we do expect that to return to more pre-COVID investment levels. 
As to how you might think about that across the year, there's not a whole lot of seasonality within CK. So -- but we -- obviously, we haven't guided the individual quarters yet except for Q1.

I would just tell you that I am delighted with our continued strategic progress. And that will really feed into our future growth, which I think is the element of your question. When you think about our performance, I know I'm repeating some of the stats, but I think they're worth repeating. One, we increased our total share of IRS returns by 1 point. 
The 2 areas that really matter most that we're focused on, under-penetrated segments and transforming the assisted segments, we saw really superb results. Our overall investor volume tripled year-over-year. TurboTax Live awareness increased 20%. Our total customers grew 100%. Our new customers to the franchise, the TurboTax Live, grew over 100%. And with our Full-Service offering, it actually attracted new customers from the prior year assisted segment at a 25% higher rate than TurboTax Live do-it-with-me. And our retention rate stayed flat to a little bit up overall. 
So when you look at all the key sort of metrics, knock on wood, it's very, very healthy, and we expect that to inform next year's growth. And we do assume, by the way, that IRS returns is going to be about flattish next year. So that's probably one important assumption that's worthwhile sharing. But this is just a continuation, as you probably heard me say multiple times. We're on a 10-year-plus run in these opportunity areas that we're focused on. And next year is just going to be another sort of important pivotal year in our quest to transform assisted and penetrated the under-penetrated segment."

And that accele",570,"Sure, Alex. Thank you for your kind comments. On Credit Karma, let me just -- I'll briefly start at the top in terms of what we are seeing. First of all, the accelerated innovation that we are seeing with Credit Karma is really paying off. And that accelerated innovation is how we're using our combined data to be able to deliver personalized experiences, leveraging Lightbox for customers. It's then ensuring that we're providing relevant offers to customers in the areas that they need it most. And now, we can provide multiple relevant offers, whether it's cards, personal loans, auto insurance, home loans and beyond. 
But I think then more importantly then when they -- the offers in front of them, we have the ability to actually help them with the the potential of their approval, make it very easy when they click to actually get the offer. And so those are all critical areas of innovation that are really paying off. And I think it's a testament to the platform that when our partners decided to really go after customer acquisition, that they invested a good chunk of their dollars on the platform. And it just demonstrates the network effect and the power of the data and the trust of the members that we have. So that's the first element that we just believe will continue given our accelerated innovation because our -- ultimately, our penetration rate maybe one of the highest in credit cards, but it's one of the lowest when you look at auto insurance. We have so much room for increased wallet share. 
In terms of synergies, Alex, we're actually quite bullish about the possibilities into the future, and I would want you to think about those synergies into the future. And there are really several areas of synergy. One is really making Credit Karma benefits part of the entire TurboTax experience. That's one big opportunity. The other big opportunity is making it seamless and contextual in terms of TurboTax as part of the Credit Karma experience to be able to do your taxes. And then third, what we just announced, which is Credit Karma being part of the payroll experience where our payroll customers can actually deposit their monies into a free checking and savings account and be able to access their money early over time if they wish. 
So those are significant opportunities because the -- you're talking about millions and millions of TurboTax customers, payroll customers and, of course, over our -- well over 100 million Credit Karma customers that we're going to launch TurboTax to. This past year, and as I'll remind us, it feels like a long time, but we just closed Credit Karma in December. These past 8 months, we have been experimenting with incredible purpose, incredible speed and incredible intention. And it's informed what we are rolling out and what we're doing in the year to come. I would just say, in terms of those things turning into sort of material customer revenue growth. There -- we're not counting on that in the near term, we're counting on that more on the midterm because we want to really continue to nail the experience in creating ecosystem benefit across all of our members. So that's the way I would want you to think about not only what you're seeing in Credit Karma, but the growth rates that are ahead of us."

So I want to unpack both what you're trying to tell us with the ability to deliver both growth and margin leverage at this scale, and unpack it, if you can, from a gross margin versus OpEx savings perspective, right? I know -- I remember a few years ago, there was fear with lives, particularly coming into the model, it would be gross margin dilutive. And yet the gross margins have actually improved this year. So I want to understand a little bit about when you think about that incremental margin leverage, where is it coming from? And how should we think about the durability of that opportunity?"

First of all, thank you for acknowledging the margin delivery we had this year. As you mentioned gross margin, and we have continued to say that we expect gross margin to remain fairly flat over time. You're right, we did have a lot of questions as we got into the TurboTax Live business as to whether that was going to deteriorate margins. But it has remained flattish over time. And that was the last expectation we gave -- that I gave last year at Investor Day. And our big focus is obviously then on op margin. And we see the opportunity there and continue to see opportunities to drive margin leverage really as we become more and more of a platform company. 
FY '21 was a little unique in that with the pandemic and full swing at the beginning. We weren't exactly sure how -- exactly how things were going to play out, and we were a little bit more conservative with investments. And then the business ended up bouncing back much more quickly than we thought. So as I mentioned earlier, when you look over all the way back from 2019, we've got about, on average, 1 point of margin expansion. And so we feel really good about that, and especially with our guide looking forward of 60 basis points. 
So when I think about where we'll see the expansion, though, it is really all across the business is helping us drive it. Getting leverage, whether it's in technology and looking at how we can get rid of duplicate technology and use services more, whether it's in customer success and really leaning into a platform there to deliver for all our customers or opportunities we have in our go-to-market and enabling additional technology there. So we do think that we continue to have opportunities to drive that leverage."

Great. So let me start with your question around international. First of all, as I mentioned in the last earnings call, and I think the same trend continues, one thing that's unchanged is small businesses across the globe are still recovering. Some have recovered to -- back to pre-COVID levels. Some have actually accelerated their business because they changed the model. But at least what we see in our sort of data, 20%-ish of small businesses are still struggling. And struggling is defined by they have -- their net deposits are down over 25%. So I think it's important just as a general perspective to recognize that the small businesses are, in general, still in recovery mode. 
With that said, our platform has become more critical than ever. And the digital nature of our platform to be able to run your business, grow your business, manage your cash flow and be compliant is more important than ever, which is why based on our innovation overall, we're seeing this acceleration. 
And then if I put that in context of geography, I would say U.S. has really bounced back in terms of the usage of our platform. And in fact, an acceleration probably above all has happened in the U.S. I would say Canada is sort of next in terms of the recovery. And I would just put countries like the U.K., France, Australia as really being much, much slower in the recovery. 
And really, the reason is, as you've seen, there's a lot of open, shutdown, open, shutdown, and that's really impacted just the sentiment of both accountants and small businesses. But even in that context, it's actually quite exciting that we delivered 47% revenue growth in constant currency last quarter and 43% for the whole year. But with that said, we're assuming a much slower recovery international than we are in the U.S. because I think it's just really important that we get out of this health crisis. And then once we do, we believe the small businesses will bounce back much, much faster outside the U.S. 
International is still important for our future. But what I just shared is just how we've taken that into account strategically and both economically in our guidance as we look ahead. 
And maybe with that, I'll turn it over to Michelle to answer your QuickBooks Live question."

Right now, we're still focused on achieving product market fit. Seeing some early signs here as a way to bring in customers who are new to Intuit, so help us with customer acquisition. And we do think that there's a great opportunity for us to use the Live product to help penetrate non-consumption, which, as you know, is a huge opportunity. 
The pandemic over this last year has really been an opportunity as we've seen the acceleration to a virtual world. And so obviously, customers are much more anxious to -- or much more open to using these types of experiences. And so our platform really enables that. It does solve one of the biggest problems we have with Small Business customers, which is confidence. You also see that on the TurboTax side, too. Expert interest has continued to remain really strong. And so that's been a good thing for us to see. 
A few customer pain points we're currently working on is on solving and streamlining and automating document collection. And then enabling messaging within the offering, so customers can more easily communicate with their bookkeeper. And then last thing I'd say is, last year, we launched the setup SKU so that we could really help small businesses come in, get set up on QuickBooks and have that confidence right from the get-go, and we've seen some good success with that."

That's both relevant to the businesses that we serve today, but also very relevant to the mid-market customers. And so to be able to manage your marketing, your sales, your services is one element. 
I think the other element, which is particularly important for mid-market customers, is just all their G&A. And we believe that the live platform that we've created, the engines that we've created will actually help us go beyond bookkeeping taxes and accounting to be able to focus on some of their -- kind of how they run their business and particularly on G&A. So those are the 2 areas."

We want to be the platform for your taxes. And of course, obviously, beyond that with the capabilities that we have with Credit Karma. 
Second element, I would say, is what we learned this year going to full launch is that Full Service offering has a halo effect and build confidence for customers, which is why we were able to attract new customers from prior assisted method at a 25% higher rate into Full Service because they know that they can digitally provide us all of their data, and we have excellent experts to be able to take very good care of them. 
So that's the biggest learning that we had. It was a hypothesis that we had from prior year experimentation. And we're going to continue to scale that as we look ahead. It's just a very critical part of our platform. And as I've said before, we believe that we're in the very, very early innings of a 10-year-plus opportunity here.

First of all, just as a reminder, we were one of the founding members of the Free File Alliance program with the IRS. And it has been, frankly, an incredible partnership with the IRS and the private industry. And when we really founded this program with the IRS, there was really 2 goals, and I'll simplify it. Really the 2 goals were we wanted, at that time, to ensure that electronic filing was used by more than 80-plus percent of all consumers. And we wanted to make sure that free filing was available to 8% -plus of consumers. 
And when you forward the clock, mission accomplished on both. In fact, we've exceeded both metrics as an industry on both fronts. And free has now become prevalent across the entire industry. And so we felt that the time was right now that the mission has been accomplished to really sort of change our approach to how we can deliver benefits for customers. Free will always be an important part of the strategy, but there are constraints when you come in through the Free File Alliance program. And those constraints are, for instance, we can't provide you benefits on other platforms like our free Credit Karma platform. 
And so as we look ahead, not only will we be able to provide free tax offerings to our customers, but as they grow and we grow with them, they can benefit from Credit Karma, they can benefit from Mint. If they're a small business, they can benefit from QuickBooks, things that we ultimately couldn't talk to them about if they were part of the Free File Alliance program. So sort of mission accomplished, and that's the reason for why we chose to get out. 
I just want to state again, the partnership with the IRS has absolutely been phenomenal and with private industry to achieve the goals of FFA."

First of all, with all of the sort of movement in the last couple of years with the pandemic and the growth that we've experienced, one, we're actually quite pleased with the retention rates. And I would tell you, the biggest lever around retention is what we are doing with TurboTax Live, which is ensuring that our customers know and understand that there's an expert to help them every step of the way. 
But I think secondly, and we haven't talked much about this, and we'll spend a little bit of time on this at Investor Day, is how we are now leveraging data to never lose a customer. And I give a lot of credit to our TurboTax team where we've been working on this for several years. It's not a new body of work. But to shift from just a -- engaging you once a year when it's tax time, to actually understanding and leveraging what we know about you, if something has changed in your life, if you bought a house, if you bought a car, if you got married, if you got divorced, if you moved from one state to another, to actually engage you sort of year around relative to giving you confidence that those changes can be addressed by us. 
So it's the combination of leveraging data, apply AI to that data with our models to understand who could be at risk, and then engaging those customers proactively. And by the way, depending on their needs, not just with TurboTax, it could also be engaging them with the benefits of Credit Karma. Those are the 2 big things, data and AI and the capabilities of TurboTax Live, engaging customers year round, where we are quite confident over the long term, we can continue to increase our retention rates."

One, the -- really, our -- the majority of our growth is coming from customer growth and mix. And when I say mix, for instance, QuickBooks Advanced which slows after the mid-market type mix. It's really not driven by price, although we have increased price this year, it's the first time we've done it over the last couple of years. 
And I tell you, we run tests, and it's exactly as you said it. We look at a price value equation. We have very clear pricing principles. And with experimentation and data, we choose when to move forward with a price increase. And I would tell you that our innovation, just in the last couple of years, literally, last year, our innovation across the company, which includes Small Business, doubled year-over-year in terms of -- when we measure that by code deployment and impact, and it's doubled again this year. 
And that shows up in how we leverage data and AI across the platform to deliver insights to customers. It shows up in payments and payroll and time tracking. And then what we've announced, which is moving upmarket several years ago with QuickBooks Advanced, it's being able to serve product based businesses with QuickBooks Commerce. It's being able to go after nonconsumption with QuickBooks Live, which is a higher sort of price tag for our customers. 
And then our disruptive offering with QuickBooks Cash, which is, in essence, you can start with a business bank account and be able to run your business through that. So just the innovation is, I would just say, staggering, focused on cohorts of customers and going after their needs. And with an open platform, we're able to really focus on what matters more customers and monetize. So we believe that capability is one that we'll have for years to come."

Thanks, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We're off to a strong start in fiscal year 2022 with continued momentum across the company, given our strategy of becoming a global AI-driven expert platform, powering the prosperity of consumers and small businesses. We have nearly a $300 billion addressable market, driven by digital tailwinds that include a shift to virtual solutions, acceleration to online and omnichannel capabilities and digital money offerings. 
First quarter revenue grew 52%, including 32 points from the addition of Credit Karma. Total revenue growth was fueled by Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue growth of 22% and Credit Karma revenue of $418 million, another record quarter. Consumer Group and ProConnect Group revenue was in line with our expectations in a seasonally small quarter. As a result, both of our strong start to the year and the close of Mailchimp transaction, we are raising our revenue and non-GAAP operating income and earnings per share guidance for fiscal year 2022. Michelle will cover this in detail later. 
Our AI-driven expert platform strategy is accelerating innovation and our 5 Big Bets are solving the largest problems our customers face. We continue to deliver strong proof points that demonstrate the success and are well positioned for durable growth in the future. As a reminder, these Big Bets are revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock SMART Money decisions, be the center of small business growth and disrupt the small business mid-market. 
Today, I'd like to highlight examples of our recent progress across 3 of these Big Bets. Our third Big Bet is to unlock SMART Money decisions. I'm extremely proud of the momentum we are seeing with Credit Karma. Credit Karma is a data platform with powerful network effects solving a 2-sided problem. We are focused on our goal of creating a personal financial assistant that helps consumers find the right financial products, put more money in their pockets and access financial experts and insights. Credit Karma achieved record high revenue again in Q1. 
We continue to deliver innovation across all verticals fueled by our proprietary Lightbox platform, enabling personalized experiences for our members, creating a network effect. Within the core, partners usage of Lightbox reached all-time highs across both credit cards and personal loans.  Lightbox more than doubles the average approval rate for members who apply for credit cards on Credit Karma versus outside of Credit Karma. 
Within the growth verticals, we're solving a larger set of financial challenges for consumers. Karma Drive is giving U.S. members the opportunity to see if they can save money on auto insurance with usage-based pricing. We're actively exploring expansion opportunities with Lightbox in other verticals, including auto loans, building off of the successes we've seen in credit cards and personal loans. 
Within the emerging verticals, we remain focused on innovation with Credit Karma Money. We integrated Credit Karma Money into TurboTax last season and experimented with how we can best meet our customers' needs and announced an integration with QuickBooks Online payroll. Given our learnings, we are excited about launching our improved experiences in the coming tax season. 
We believe Credit Karma Money is the key to driving growth and frequency of visits over time, one of the many key drivers of average revenue per monthly active user. Zooming out, we continue to grow members and are focused on building trust by delivering personalized financial products right for members, helping members save money, pay down debt and get faster access to their money while providing insight and advice. Over time, we're creating a virtual cycle, which we expect to increase the frequency of engagement, transactions and monetization across our ecosystem. 
Our fourth Big Bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get customers, get paid fast, manage capital, pay employees with confidence and grow in an omnichannel world. 60% of small businesses struggle with cash flow, and we are continuing to innovate to create solutions for customers to overcome this challenge. 
In fiscal year 2021, total payments volume on our platform grew 40% year-over-year to over $90 billion, and online payments volume grew more than 60%, driven by an increase in customers using our payments offering. 
As we continue to innovate for our customers and payments, those using QuickBooks Cash of nearly 3x higher engagement compared to customers who have just used QuickBooks Online. To accelerate engagement and usage of our platform, we recently introduced Get Paid Upfront, a game-changing innovation that will help qualify customers get paid soon after their invoice is set. 
Our fifth Big Bet is to disrupt the small business mid-market with QuickBooks Online Advanced. We're seeing strong traction with QBO Advanced with customers growing to 118,000 in fiscal year 2021, up 57% year-over-year. As we continue to move upmarket and serve these customers' most critical needs, we're seeing a services ecosystem ARPC that is 4x higher than the ARPC for QBO customers. We're pleased with our results and remain confident in our game plan to win. 
Across all of our Big Bets, we're building momentum and accelerating innovation, which we believe positions us well for durable growth in the future. This will be further fueled by Mailchimp. I'm delighted that we closed Mailchimp, that closed the acquisition earlier this month, which seeks to significantly accelerate 2 of our Big Bets: to be the center of small business growth and to disrupt the small business mid-market. 
Getting and engaging customers remains a significant pain point for small and mid-market businesses. We are well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers to help them grow and run their business. We have 3 acceleration priorities with Mailchimp. First priority is to deliver on our vision of an end-to-end customer growth platform to help customers get their business online, market their business, manage their customers' relationships, ,get paid, access capital, pay employees, manage cash flow and be compliant with virtual experts at their fingertips all in one place. 
Second, disrupting the mid-market by developing a full marketing automation, CRM and e-commerce suite for mid-market customers at an attractive price point, enabling mid-market customers to use the power of the platform to grow their business. And third, accelerating global growth with a holistic go-to-market approach. With Mailchimp now part of the Intuit family, we are uniquely positioned to enable small and mid-market businesses to combine their customer data from Mailchimp and purchase data from QuickBooks to deliver actionable insights they need to grow and run their businesses with confidence. 
This is where the real magic happens. Our combined platform technology enables us to move with speed, and we've already seen strong interest from our customers. The teams are hard at work, and we are excited about the opportunity ahead. 
Foundational to our company's success is building a high-performance culture. I want to take a moment to acknowledge our progress with our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. Last year, we declared our focus on increasing the percentages of women in technology roles and underrepresented minorities across our business. We achieved 30% and 13%, respectively, and we are inspired to accelerate our plan and push even harder as much work remains to be done. 
Additionally, we've made meaningful progress supporting our communities. First, we recently announced the Intuit Climate Action Marketplace, which will help 1 million U.S. small businesses find sustainable solutions to reduce carbon emissions. This is part of our decade-long climate positive goal to go beyond net carbon-neutral and reduce global carbon emissions by 2 million metric tons by 2030 or 50x greater than our 2018 operational footprint. 
We also recently announced a 23-year partnership with the Los Angeles Clippers that includes economic benefits for the local community with Intuit Dome, the team's future home. And finally, we launched Intuit Ventures to invest in the start-up community and accelerate FinTech innovation for consumers and small businesses. 
All the work we do starts with our mission of powering prosperity around the world. And I'm proud of the momentum across the company and delivering on that mission for our customers and communities. 
Now let me hand it over to Michelle."
21171,1686435131,2444709,"Intuit Inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 18, 2021",2021-11-18,"Earnings Calls","Intuit Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Sasan. Good afternoon, everyone, and I'd also like to welcome the Mailchimp team to Intuit. Now let me turn to the results. For the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we delivered revenue of $2 billion; GAAP operating income of $195 million versus $2",1221,"Thanks, Sasan. Good afternoon, everyone, and I'd also like to welcome the Mailchimp team to Intuit. 
Now let me turn to the results. For the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we delivered revenue of $2 billion; GAAP operating income of $195 million versus $209 million last year; non-GAAP operating income of $555 million versus $334 million last year; GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.82 versus $0.75 a year ago; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.53 versus $0.94 last year. Note that our GAAP results include a $39 million net gain on other long-term investments. 
Turning to the business segments. In the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 22% during the quarter, with Online Ecosystem revenue up 36%. With the aim of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within Small Business and Self-Employed is threefold: grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. 
First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 32% in fiscal Q1, driven mainly by customer growth, higher effective prices and mix shift. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online Services revenue, which includes payroll, payments, capital and time tracking, grew 42% in fiscal Q1. Within payroll, we continue to see revenue tailwinds during the quarter from growth in payroll customers and a mix shift to our full-service offering. Within payments, revenue growth reflects ongoing customer growth, along with an increase in charge volume per customer. 
Third, our progress expanding globally added to the growth of Online Ecosystem revenue during fiscal Q1. Total international online revenue grew 39% on a constant currency basis. We believe the best measure of the health and success of our strategy is Online Ecosystem revenue growth, which we expect to grow better than 30% organically over time. This is driven by 10% to 20% expected growth in both customers and ARPC. 
Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 7% in the first quarter. QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew high single digits, driven by strong customer growth and price increases we put in place late last year. As a reminder, this fall, we transitioned to a subscription model for this year's Desktop offering, which we expect to be a headwind to revenue growth in the second half of the year. We expect the Desktop business to decline longer term. 
Moving on to Credit Karma. Revenue was $418 million in Q1, another record revenue quarter, driven by high levels of monthly active users and revenue per monthly active user. Within the core, we saw another record quarter driven by the combined strength in personal loans and credit cards. The growth verticals also achieved another strong quarter, reflecting momentum in home loans and auto loans. And we're developing the emerging vertical by focusing on innovation with Credit Karma Money, part of our digital money offering, so this is not a large revenue driver today. 
We continue to expect pent-up demand across the core verticals to taper sometime in the second half of fiscal 2022 after a strong year of investment by our partners. We remain excited about the opportunities ahead. 
Consumer Group revenue of $120 million in Q1 was in line with our expectations. Looking ahead to the upcoming tax season, we continue to focus on our strategy to expand our lead in DIY and transform the assisted segment with TurboTax Live. As for the ProConnect Group, revenue of $26 million in the quarter was also in line with our expectations. 
Turning to our financial principles. We remain committed to growing organic revenue double digits and growing operating income dollars faster than revenue. As I've shared before, as we lean into our platform strategy, we see the opportunity for margin expansion over time. We take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investment greater than 15%. We continue to reallocate resources to top priorities with an emphasis on becoming an AI-driven expert platform. These principles guide our decisions and remain our long-term commitment. 
Our first priority for the cash we generate is investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. We consider acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product road map. We return excess cash that we can't invest profitably in the business to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends. 
We finished the quarter with approximately $3.3 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet. On November 1, we entered into a $4.7 billion term loan under a new credit arrangement -- credit agreement to partially fund the Mailchimp acquisition. We repurchased $339 million of stock during the first quarter. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.68 per share payable January 18, 2022. This represents a 15% increase versus last year. 
Moving on to guidance. We are raising our full year fiscal 2022 revenue and non-GAAP operating income and earnings per share guidance to reflect both the acquisition of Mailchimp and the stronger-than-expected start to the year in the Small Business and Self-Employed Group and Credit Karma. 
Our updated fiscal 2022 guidance includes revenue of $12.165 billion to $12.3 billion, growth of 26% to 28% including Mailchimp as of November 1 and a full year of Credit Karma. Excluding Mailchimp, revenue growth of 18% to 20%, up from our prior guidance of 15% to 16%. GAAP earnings per share of $7 to $7.16 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $11.48 to $11.64. 
This updated fiscal 2022 guidance includes organic growth for the Small Business and Self-Employed segment of 16% to 17%, up from 12% to 14%, expected Mailchimp revenue of $760 million to $770 million and Credit Karma revenue of $1.54 billion to $1.565 billion, up from $1.345 billion to $1.38 billion. 
As I shared before, we continue to see opportunities to leverage the platform and drive margin expansion over time. Excluding Mailchimp, our non-GAAP operating income guidance continues to imply approximately 60 basis points of margin expansion in fiscal 2022. Our guidance assumes the Mailchimp transaction is accretive to Intuit's non-GAAP earnings per share in full year fiscal 2022. However, we expect an approximately 80 basis point onetime step-down in non-GAAP operating margin, reflecting the impact of Mailchimp as we plan to invest aggressively in the business. We expect non-GAAP operating margin expansion to continue from this new level over time, in line with our financial principles. 
Our fiscal 2022 GAAP operating income guidance includes approximately $165 million for stock-based compensation associated with the acquisition of Mailchimp. In addition, our GAAP operating income guidance includes the impact of the Credit Karma acquisition, along with investments we are making in stock compensation to attract and retain talent. We're confident these are the right decisions to drive long-term growth. And we expect a GAAP tax rate of 18% in fiscal 2022. 
Our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 includes revenue growth of 73% to 74%, GAAP earnings per share of $0.55 to $0.59 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.84 to $1.88. You can find our full Q2 and updated fiscal 2022 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to you, Sasan."

I think what we talked about at Investor Day is we had 50% and 40% penetration in credit cards and personal loans compared to, I think, 40, 20 the year before. So one, we have significant penetration opportunity ahead of us. I think equally as important, if not more, is what financial institutions are seeing, which is really the pay off for their investments. And so more and more financial institutions are joining the platform, and this gives us really an opportunity to significantly increase penetration. I think that's the way I would probably give you the punchline. 
Our penetration in credit cards is, I think, less than 5%, just as an example, and personal loans and other verticals are even lower than that. So Lightbox, the trust we build with our members, the trust we're building with our partners gives us an opportunity for significant penetration. And I think our sort of best years are ahead of us when you think about Lightbox and particularly penetration. 
In terms of your question around expansion, auto loans is just one example of where we can expand Lightbox. And there are other areas that we've not talked about publicly. I won't do it today until we see further proof points where we can further expand Lightbox. So I think this is 13 years of investments that now positions us to really deliver for members, partners and really create this network effect."

I'll take you back to the 3 priorities that we've declared because I think it goes after the great question that you've asked. First and foremost, our #1 priority is really around creating 1 growth platform. And it's really a",392,"Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll take you back to the 3 priorities that we've declared because I think it goes after the great question that you've asked. First and foremost, our #1 priority is really around creating 1 growth platform. And it's really a lot of the work behind the scenes in terms of building data pipelines and connecting the services so that the magical power of the data, both Mailchimp and QuickBooks data can come together for the customer to put the power of the insights in their hands. So first and foremost, it's all about the product and creating 1 growth platform. 
The second is we see a huge opportunity to serve mid-market. As you know, we're already doing that from a financial management solutions perspective with QuickBooks Advanced. We're now we're going to, in essence, build out the capabilities on Mailchimp and really disrupt the mid-market because this is a huge need for mid-market. 
And I would say third is actually having a global playbook and investing -- accelerating our investments in go-to-market, which I think we'll get at the last question that you asked that I didn't answer yet. And that is we want customers to have choice. So if customers first want to engage with Mailchimp to be able to take their business online, to market their business and use CRM tools, they can use Mailchimp, but we'll make sure everything is payment-enabled. 
And then over time, if they want to use all of the invoicing capabilities, payroll capabilities, access to capital, ensure that they're compliant, all of that will be enabled within Mailchimp. And the vice versa is true. If you're using QuickBooks and you want to start using capabilities to market your business and manage your customers, all the capabilities of Mailchimp will be available to you and Mailchimp could end up being, for instance, a NAV item on the left-hand side. 
So we will let customers make choice, is I think the headline answer to your question. We will go to market separately. We will go to market together. We will raise awareness and ensure that customers know that there's one place where they can run their business and more importantly, the power of all their data will be in one place to fuel their success. So that's the approach that we're taking."

Last year, when you look at the full year of Credit Karma compared to the prior year, we grew 37%. And our new guidance for Credit Karma going forward is a range of 35% to 37%. And so I think what you see within that is there has been a macro bounce back, but really a lot of what we're really seeing is the innovation on the platform, the power of Lightbox, the fact that members are getting better matches to things that they are looking for, financial institutions and insurance companies are seeing the power of the platform. And it's really just creating that network effect. 
So I think what we're gaining confidence in is just the innovation, the technology investments in Lightbox and in context of the macro environment as we look ahead that gives us confidence around the performance of Credit Karma. And again, I would just remind us, and this is more of a longer-term comment, credit Karma is a platform and we're creating an ecosystem effect here. Credit Karma is part of the TurboTax experience, and we're excited for all of you to see what we're going to be launching in the coming tax season. 
TurboTax as part of the Credit Karma experience. Credit Karma is part of the payroll experience. So really think about Intuit as one platform with many platforms that solve different problems. And that's really what fuels our confidence as we look ahead."

Thank you for your kind comments and the question. I would say that it's very consistent with what we talked to you all about at Investor Day, and that is that we're continuing to see the acquisition trends that we would expect in the U.S. across the board, both in the low end of the market, but also the trends that we're seeing in the mid-market. So those trends continuing. 
And as we've shared before, we're not overly reliant by any means on new business formations. So from just a health perspective, I would say U.S. is consistent with what we talked about with all of you a few months ago. And I would say outside of the U.S., again, very consistent with before. The recovery has not been like the U.S. Now if I were to double-click on that, I would say, behind the U.S. has been Canada. And I think we're going to start seeing U.K. and Australia start to come back -- sorry, U.K. and France. And then Australia is, I would say, behind the U.K. and France. 
So we do believe that in the next year or less that international will start to slowly bounce back. And the reason for just the slowness in international bouncing back is there's just been so many starts and stops that small businesses have just lost confidence. Do I build up inventory? Do I go hire more employees? Do I increase my own marketing budget that they've just been slower and bouncing back. But we believe within the next year or so, we'll see that strength. But net-net, the headline news is U.S. continues to be strong and match what we've expected and international will bounce back within a year."

And we feel really confident relative to just the -- where we are with the virtual expert platform. 
And our focus intentionally has been really about serving customers when it comes to tax time, and helping small businesses with bookkeeping and eventually also with their taxes, but more importantly, just helping them run their business. And we have so much opportunity ahead of us just in that space. 
With that said, we do have a few what we call small mission-based teams that are exploring other spaces because we can leverage a lot of the capabilities of this virtual expert platform to serve spaces like marketing, potentially spaces like financial services. So we are doing experiments but very intentionally to ensure that we can learn.

And I would just tell you that we continue to even get more excited as we've closed the deal because the needs of our customers are in all the areas that you mentioned. They are -- and every customer is in a different place, but customers are really looking for ways to be able to engage getting new customers. It's their bread and butter.

They want to be able to manage their existing customers in an automated way, in an insightful way where everything is automated. They don't have to know when do I follow up with a customer, what additional products can I sell them, all that can get automated through Mailchimp. And one of the things people don't realize is one of the largest ways that you still engage customers, we see it through what we do in TurboTax, is actually e-mail.

Who's leading your shopping card and how do you pursue them? So it's consistent with what we've talked about before.

So from one account to another or from 1 store to an accountant. 
And then within the TurboTax base, the do-it-yourselfers, we have 4 million people that leave and they ultimately go to an assisted method. So I think the answer to your question is it's all of the above. We've seen conversion improvements, retention improvements. We've seen TurboTax customers that did it themselves a year before, where they had a life change or they just weren't sure if they did their home deductions the right way or if they had a kid and the kid went to college, how to ultimately account for those deductions where they're now using the live platform and vice versa. You may use the live platform and have enough confidence with the year after, you do it yourself. And then you may that after that, bounced back. And now we're seeing 3, 4 years of trend. So really, it's all of the above with the largest, I would say, driver being folks that use a different assisted method coming on to a platform and of course, those that have life changes within TurboTax growing with TurboTax and using the live platform.

And our financial institutions and all our partners see the power of that, how diligent and intentional we are about not creating our own products, but ensuring that we match members with a product that's right for them. And a lot of the capabilities that we have within Credit Karma ultimately has an institution that's participating in it. 
So that is not a concern that we have. Our stay due is very, very high with financial institutions, and we just believe that, that's the beginning of it, especially with the traction of Lightbox, which actually delivers more success for members and more success for financial institutions. So it is not a concern of ours."

So just curious to get your take on the issues that are facing -- that are being faced by the U.S. economy, you've got unprecedented labor shortage, you've got a supply chain issue, you've got an inflation issue. A lot of these problems do pertain to the small business ecosystem. When you think of Intuit and the dramatic transformation you've undertaken very successfully, but betting on AI, what can Intuit do to solve these problems for small business customers as it plays to these near-term headwinds that we're facing from your product perspective?"

One for your kind comments, and it's a wonderful question in all those areas, right? The labor shortage, some of the supply chain challenges if you're a product-based business and certainly inflation is absolutely impacting small businesses. I",452,"Yes, Kash. One for your kind comments, and it's a wonderful question in all those areas, right? The labor shortage, some of the supply chain challenges if you're a product-based business and certainly inflation is absolutely impacting small businesses. I would make a broad comment that I would say we are experiencing. When you couple what happened with the pandemic starting in March of 2020, where it really, I think, forced everyone around the globe, whether you're a small business or not, but let's just stay focused on small businesses to reinvent yourself. And it really accelerated the shift to virtual solutions, that accelerated the shift to going online, whether it's how you invoice and get paid, how you do your payroll, how you do your time tracking. 
And I think that movement, which is just simply continuing, I don't think we're ever going to go back to the old way. I think this pandemic really has accelerated the shift in those areas that I mentioned, in particular, of course, the digital money offering. I think that, coupled with this not only labor shortage, but also labor movement from job to job. Some of the supply chain challenges that generally, we believe, as I talk to my peers, will get -- start to get addressed by the second half of 2022, first half of 2023, and inflation is actually causing small businesses to leverage more platforms. 
And so if I then bring that back to our platform and the fact that if you use our platform, you can get paid upfront. You can get instant deposit, you can do same-day payroll. You can use an expert to ensure that you've got the best deductions as a small business and to ensure that you're running your business effectively. And the fact that you can do more with less people. If you use one platform, that's where the power of Mailchimp comes into play rather than having multiple tools where you're bouncing back and forth between tools, and you're not really sure what your customer profitability is, when you should follow up with the customer, how to acquire more customers, all of those things are trust for the use of our platform. 
And our platform is actually built to help you grow your business with less focus on labor and to be able to embrace as much as possible the inflation. Now ultimately, we have to address over time, and I believe it will get addressed some of these supply chain issues and inflationary issues, but that's where our platform comes into play and why we're so well positioned for small businesses and the role we need to play to continue to educate them."

Or in customer success is another great example, where we're scaling a common customer success platform so that we can more efficiently and effectively serve customers. And then also in the go-to-market area, really leveraging a common infrastructure to be able to more effectively target customers and manage our sales and marketing processes also.

I know, by the way, midstream, if you choose an expert and utilize, you know what, I don't know if I just want help. I just want Intuit to do it all that for me. We'll do it all for you. So really, our approach and now that we've had several years of experimenting and learning with full service is that now we have a true end-to-end platform where we can meet the needs of any customer.

I'll take you back to the reason, at Investor Day, we put the opportunity of Credit Karma as part of TurboTax experience and TurboTax as part of the Credit Karma platform as a Horizon 3 is we're really focused on the customer and member experience and nailing that because we know over time, we can monetize.

Sure, Scott. Thank you. First of all, on international, we saw some of the same trend given our -- not only our execution but the macro environment as we've seen in the last couple of quarters, there's certain countries like Canada that have bounced back a bit more strongly than there's places like Australia, that really have been very slow to bounce back based on the fact that the economy keeps opening and shutting down. 
And again, our view is within the next year, international should start to come back from a macro perspective. So net-net, our trends and our performance, although we're very pleased with it, we believe over time, could paint a different picture as the macro environment comes back. 
In terms of Mailchimp, our focus is the 3 priorities that I mentioned. We want to create an amazing product and platform that brings QuickBooks and Mailchimp together. We want to build the capabilities to go disrupt mid-market. And then as Michelle mentioned, we're going to be investing heavily in our global go-to-market. 
So I would say I wouldn't overly anticipate a significant change in our trajectory international because of Mailchimp. There's some fundamental things we want to get right to ensure that we can truly be the platform that -- where you can grow your business and run your business. And over time, it will certainly have an impact internationally, and we're excited about that because it gives us another foot in the door outside of the U.S."

So the way we think about Intuit Dome, it is not for us a naming rights deal. We've had many opportunities where we've actually been pursued to be part of deals like this, and we passed them up over the years. We did this because, one, it's very technology-forward Dome. We're going to be helping the community. And two, we're really going to be able to showcase our brands.

Thanks, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We're off to a strong start in fiscal year 2022 with continued momentum across the company, given our strategy of becoming a global AI-driven expert platform, powering the prosperity of consumers and small businesses. We have nearly a $300 billion addressable market, driven by digital tailwinds that include a shift to virtual solutions, acceleration to online and omnichannel capabilities and digital money offerings. 
First quarter revenue grew 52%, including 32 points from the addition of Credit Karma. Total revenue growth was fueled by Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue growth of 22% and Credit Karma revenue of $418 million, another record quarter. Consumer Group and ProConnect Group revenue was in line with our expectations in a seasonally smaller quarter. As a result, both of our strong start to the year and the close of the Mailchimp transaction, we are raising our revenue and non-GAAP operating income and earnings per share guidance for fiscal year 2022. Michelle will cover this in detail later. 
Our AI-driven expert platform strategy is accelerating innovation and our 5 Big Bets are solving the largest problems our customers face. We continue to deliver strong proof points that demonstrate the success and are well positioned for durable growth in the future. As a reminder, these Big Bets are revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth and disrupt the small business mid-market. 
Today, I'd like to highlight examples of our recent progress across 3 of these Big Bets. Our third Big Bet is to unlock SMART Money decisions. I'm extremely proud of the momentum we are seeing with Credit Karma. Credit Karma is a data platform with powerful network effects solving a 2-sided problem. We are focused on our goal of creating a personal financial assistant that helps consumers find the right financial products, put more money in their pockets and access financial expertise and insights. 
Credit Karma achieved record high revenue again in Q1. We continue to deliver innovation across all verticals fueled by our proprietary Lightbox platform, enabling personalized experiences for our members, creating a network effect. 
Within the core, partners' usage of Lightbox reached all-time highs across both credit cards and personal loans. Lightbox more than doubles the average approval rate for members who apply for credit cards on Credit Karma versus outside of Credit Karma. 
Within the growth verticals, we're solving a larger set of financial challenges for consumers. Karma Drive is giving U.S. members the opportunity to see if they can save money on auto insurance with usage-based pricing. We're actively exploring expansion opportunities with Lightbox in other verticals, including auto loans, building off of the successes we've seen in credit cards and personal loans. 
Within the emerging verticals, we remain focused on innovation with Credit Karma Money. We integrated Credit Karma Money into TurboTax last season and experimented with how we can best meet our customers' needs and announced an integration with QuickBooks Online Payroll. Given our learnings, we are excited about launching our improved experiences in the coming tax season. We believe Credit Karma Money is the key to driving growth in frequency of visits over time, one of the many key drivers of average revenue per monthly active user. 
Zooming out, we continue to grow members and are focused on building trust by delivering personalized financial products right for members, helping members save money, pay down debt and get faster access to their money while providing insights and advice. Over time, we're creating a virtuous cycle, which we expect to increase the frequency of engagement, transactions and monetization across our ecosystem. 
Our fourth Big Bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get customers, get paid fast, manage capital, pay employees with confidence and grow in an omnichannel world. 60% of small businesses struggle with cash flow, and we are continuing to innovate to create solutions for customers to overcome this challenge. 
In fiscal year 2021, total payments volume on our platform grew 40% year-over-year to over $90 billion, and online payments volume grew more than 60% driven by an increase in customers using our payments offering. 
As we continue to innovate for our customers in payments, those using QuickBooks Cash have nearly 3x higher engagement compared to customers who have just used QuickBooks Online. To accelerate engagement and usage of our platform, we recently introduced Get Paid Upfront, a game-changing innovation that will help qualified customers get paid soon after their invoice is sent. 
Our fifth Big Bet is to disrupt the small business mid-market with QuickBooks Online Advanced. We're seeing strong traction with QBO Advanced, with customers growing to 118,000 in fiscal year 2021, up 57% year-over-year. As we continue to move upmarket and serve these customers' most critical needs, we're seeing a services ecosystem ARPC that is 4x higher than the ARPC for QBO customers. 
We're pleased with our results and remain confident in our game plan to win. Across all of our Big Bets, we're building momentum and accelerating innovation, which we believe positions us well for durable growth in the future. This will be further fueled by Mailchimp. 
I'm delighted that we closed the acquisition earlier this month, which seeks to significantly accelerate 2 of our Big Bets: to be the center of small business growth and to disrupt the small business mid-market. Getting and engaging customers remains a significant pain point for small and mid-market businesses. We are well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers to help them grow and run their business. 
We have 3 acceleration priorities with Mailchimp. First priority is to deliver on our vision of an end-to-end customer growth platform to help customers get their business online, market their business, manage their customer relationships, get paid, access capital, pay employees, manage cash flow and be compliant, with virtual experts at their fingertips all in one place; second, disrupting the mid-market by developing a full marketing automation, CRM and e-commerce suite for mid-market customers at an attractive price point, enabling mid-market customers to use the power of the platform to grow their business; and third, accelerating global growth with a holistic go-to-market approach. 
With Mailchimp now part of the Intuit family, we are uniquely positioned to enable small and mid-market businesses to combine their customer data from Mailchimp and purchase data from QuickBooks to deliver actionable insights they need to grow and run their businesses with confidence. This is where the real magic happens. Our combined platform technology enables us to move with speed, and we've already seen strong interest from our customers. The teams are hard at work, and we are excited about the opportunity ahead. 
Foundational to our company's success is building a high-performance culture. I want to take a moment to acknowledge our progress with our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. Last year, we declared our focus on increasing the percentages of women in technology roles and underrepresented minorities across our business. We achieved 30% and 13%, respectively, and we are inspired to accelerate our plans and push even harder as much work remains to be done. 
Additionally, we've made meaningful progress supporting our communities. First, we recently announced the Intuit Climate Action Marketplace, which will help 1 million U.S. small businesses find sustainable solutions to reduce carbon emissions. This is part of our decade-long climate positive goal to go beyond net carbon-neutral and reduce global carbon emissions by 2 million metric tons by 2030 or 50x greater than our 2018 operational footprint. 
We also recently announced a 23-year partnership with the Los Angeles Clippers that includes economic benefits for the local community with Intuit Dome, the team's future home. And finally, we launched Intuit Ventures to invest in the start-up community and accelerate fintech innovation for consumers and small businesses. 
All the work we do starts with our mission of powering prosperity around the world. And I'm proud of the momentum across the company in delivering on that mission for our customers and communities.

Good afternoon, everyone, and I'd also like to welcome the Mailchimp team to Intuit. Now let me turn to the results. For the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we delivered revenue of $2 billion; GAAP operating income of $195 million versus $2",1218,"Thanks, Sasan. Good afternoon, everyone, and I'd also like to welcome the Mailchimp team to Intuit. Now let me turn to the results. 
For the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we delivered revenue of $2 billion; GAAP operating income of $195 million versus $209 million last year; non-GAAP operating income of $555 million versus $334 million last year; GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.82 versus $0.75 a year ago; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.53 versus $0.94 last year. Note that our GAAP results include a $39 million net gain on other long-term investments. 
Turning to the business segments. In the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 22% during the quarter, with Online Ecosystem revenue up 36%. With the aim of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within Small Business and Self-Employed is threefold: grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. 
First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 32% in fiscal Q1 driven mainly by customer growth, higher effective prices and mix shift. 
Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online Services revenue, which includes payroll, payments, capital and time tracking, grew 42% in fiscal Q1. Within payroll, we continue to see revenue tailwinds during the quarter from growth in payroll customers and a mix shift to our full-service offering. Within payments, revenue growth reflects ongoing customer growth, along with an increase in charge volume per customer. 
Third, our progress expanding globally added to the growth of Online Ecosystem revenue during fiscal Q1. Total international online revenue grew 39% on a constant currency basis. 
We believe the best measure of the health and success of our strategy is Online Ecosystem revenue growth, which we expect to grow better than 30% organically over time. This is driven by 10% to 20% expected growth in both customers and ARPC. 
Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 7% in the first quarter. QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew high single digits driven by strong customer growth and price increases we put in place late last year. As a reminder, this fall, we transitioned to a subscription model for this year's desktop offering, which we expect to be a headwind to revenue growth in the second half of the year. We expect the desktop business to decline longer term. 
Moving on to Credit Karma. Revenue was $418 million in Q1, another record revenue quarter driven by high levels of monthly active users and revenue per monthly active user. 
Within the core, we saw another record quarter driven by the combined strength in personal loans and credit cards. The growth verticals also achieved another strong quarter, reflecting momentum in home loans and auto loans. And we're developing the emerging vertical by focusing on innovation with Credit Karma Money, part of our digital money offering, so this is not a large revenue driver today. 
We continue to expect pent-up demand across the core verticals to taper sometime in the second half of fiscal 2022 after a strong year of investment by our partners. We remain excited about the opportunities ahead. 
Consumer Group revenue of $120 million in Q1 was in line with our expectations. Looking ahead to the upcoming tax season, we continue to focus on our strategy to expand our lead in DIY and transform the assisted segment with TurboTax Live. As for the ProConnect Group, revenue of $26 million in the quarter was also in line with our expectations. 
Turning to our financial principles. We remain committed to growing organic revenue double digits and growing operating income dollars faster than revenue. As I've shared before, as we lean into our platform strategy, we see the opportunity for margin expansion over time. We take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investment greater than 15%. We continue to reallocate resources to top priorities, with an emphasis on becoming an AI-driven expert platform. These principles guide our decisions and remain our long-term commitment. 
Our first priority for the cash we generate is investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. We consider acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product road map. We return excess cash that we can't invest profitably in the business to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends. 
We finished the quarter with approximately $3.3 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet. On November 1, we entered into a $4.7 billion term loan under a new credit agreement to partially fund the Mailchimp acquisition. We repurchased $339 million of stock during the first quarter. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.68 per share, payable January 18, 2022. This represents a 15% increase versus last year. 
Moving on to guidance. We are raising our full year fiscal 2022 revenue and non-GAAP operating income and earnings per share guidance to reflect both the acquisition of Mailchimp and the stronger-than-expected start to the year in the Small Business and Self-Employed Group and Credit Karma. 
Our updated fiscal 2022 guidance includes revenue of $12.165 billion to $12.3 billion, growth of 26% to 28%, including Mailchimp as of November 1 and a full year of Credit Karma; excluding Mailchimp, revenue growth of 18% to 20%, up from our prior guidance of 15% to 16%; GAAP earnings per share of $7 to $7.16; and non-GAAP earnings per share of $11.48 to $11.64. 
This updated fiscal 2022 guidance includes organic growth for the Small Business and Self-Employed segment of 16% to 17%, up from 12% to 14%; expected Mailchimp revenue of $760 million to $770 million and Credit Karma revenue of $1.54 billion to $1.565 billion, up from $1.345 billion to $1.38 billion. 
As I shared before, we continue to see opportunities to leverage the platform and drive margin expansion over time. Excluding Mailchimp, our non-GAAP operating income guidance continues to imply approximately 60 basis points of margin expansion in fiscal 2022. Our guidance assumes the Mailchimp transaction is accretive to Intuit's non-GAAP earnings per share in full year fiscal 2022. However, we expect an approximately 80 basis point onetime step-down in non-GAAP operating margin, reflecting the impact of Mailchimp as we plan to invest aggressively in the business. We expect non-GAAP operating margin expansion to continue from this new level over time, in line with our financial principles. 
Our fiscal 2022 GAAP operating income guidance includes approximately $165 million for stock-based compensation associated with the acquisition of Mailchimp. In addition, our GAAP operating income guidance includes the impact of the Credit Karma acquisition, along with investments we are making in stock compensation to attract and retain talent. We're confident these are the right decisions to drive long-term growth. And we expect a GAAP tax rate of 18% in fiscal 2022. 
Our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 includes revenue growth of 73% to 74%, GAAP earnings per share of $0.55 to $0.59 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.84 to $1.88. 
You can find our full Q2 and updated fiscal 2022 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to you, Sasan."

In terms of Lightbox, as we talked about at Investor Day, we've actually made significant progress year-over-year in terms of penetration. I think what we talked about at Investor Day is we had 50% and 40% penetration in credit cards and personal loans compared to, I think, 40%, 20% the year before. So one, we have significant penetration opportunity ahead of us. I think equally as important, if not more, is what financial institutions are seeing, which is really the payoff for their investments. And so more and more financial institutions are joining the platform, and this gives us really an opportunity to significantly increase penetration. I think that's the way I would probably give you the punchline. Our penetration in credit cards is, I think, less than 5%, just as an example; and personal loans and other verticals are even lower than that. 
So Lightbox, the trust we build with our members, the trust we're building with our partners, gives us an opportunity for significant penetration. And I think our sort of best years are ahead of us when you think about Lightbox and particularly penetration. In terms of your question around expansion, auto loans is just one example of where we can expand Lightbox. And there are other areas that we've not talked about publicly. I won't do it today until we see further proof points where we can further expand Lightbox. So I think this is 13 years of investments that now positions us to really deliver for members, partners and really create this network effect."

I'll take you back to the 3 priorities that we've declared because I think it goes after the great question that you've asked. First and foremost, our #1 priority is really around creating one growth platform. And it's really a lot of the work behind the scenes in terms of building data pipelines and connecting the services so that the magical power of the data, both Mailchimp data and QuickBooks data, can come together for the customer to put the power of the insights in their hands. So first and foremost, it's all about the product and creating one growth platform. 
The second is we see a huge opportunity to serve mid-market. As you know, we're already doing that from a financial management solutions perspective with QuickBooks Advanced. Well, now we're going to, in essence, build out the capabilities on Mailchimp and really disrupt the mid-market because this is a huge need for mid-market. And I would say third is actually having a global playbook and accelerating our investments in go-to-market, which I think will get at the last question that you asked that I didn't answer yet. And that is, we want customers to have choice. 
So if customers first want to engage with Mailchimp to be able to take their business online, to market their business and use CRM tools, they can use Mailchimp, but we'll make sure everything is payment-enabled. And then over time, if they want to use all of the invoicing capabilities, payroll capabilities, access to capital, ensure that they're compliant, all of that will be enabled within Mailchimp. And the vice versa is true. If you're using QuickBooks and you want to start using capabilities to market your business and manage your customers, all the capabilities of Mailchimp will be available to you. And Mailchimp could end up being, for instance, a NAV item on the left-hand side. 
So we will let customers make choice is I think the headline answer to your question. We will go to market separately. We will go to market together. We will raise awareness and ensure that customers know that there's one place where they can run their business and, more importantly, the power of all their data will be in one place to fuel their success. So that's the approach that we're taking."

Thank you for your kind comments and the question.

So those trends are continuing. And as we've shared before, we're not overly reliant, by any means, on new business formations. So from just a health perspective, I would say U.S. is consistent with what we talked about with all of you a few months ago. And I would say outside of the U.S., again, very consistent with before. The recovery has not been like the U.S. 
Now if I were to double-click on that, I would say, behind the U.S. has been Canada. And I think we're going to start seeing U.K. and Australia start to come back -- sorry, U.K. and France. And then Australia is, I would say, behind the U.K. and France. So we do believe that in the next year or less, that international will start to slowly bounce back. And then the reason for just the slowness in international bouncing back is there's just been so many starts and stops that small businesses have just lost confidence, do I build up inventory, do I go hire more employees, do I increase my own marketing budget, that they've just been slower in bouncing back. But we believe, within the next year or so, we'll see that strength. But net-net, the headline news is U.S. continues to be strong and match what we've expected, and international will bounce back within a year."

Listen, our goal is we want every TurboTax customer to be using Credit Karma and all the benefits of Credit Karma. And we want every Credit Karma member to be using TurboTax, whether they want to do it themselves or they need assistance. And so I think we're going to be 1 year better than we were last year in terms of all of our experiences, in terms of just the investments that we've made in the experiences. And we're excited about it. 
Just to put it in context, at Investor Day, we shared with you our Horizon framework, Horizon 1 being sort of revenue impact within 0 to 18 months; Horizon 2 being 18 to 36 months; and Horizon 3 being 36 months plus. We actually put the impact of Credit Karma integrated as part of TurboTax and vice versa as almost 3 years out because we really want to nail the experience. But nevertheless, we're leaning in, and we're excited about the things we're going to be launching in the weeks to come."

When we declared our bet around connecting people to experts and creating a virtual expert platform, we have been -- I think we're on to now, I don't know, 5-plus years, really investing in this virtual expert platform. There are so many underlying technology services where AI is being used to ensure that the platform, matches the right customer to the right expert, to make the platform simple and easy to use for experts. And we feel really confident relative to just where we are with the virtual expert platform. And our focus intentionally has been really about serving customers when it comes to tax time and helping small businesses with bookkeeping and eventually also with their taxes but, more importantly, just helping them run their business. And we have so much opportunity ahead of us just in that space. 
With that said, we do have a few, what we call, small mission-based teams that are exploring other spaces because we can leverage a lot of the capabilities of this virtual expert platform to serve spaces like marketing, potentially spaces like financial services. So we are doing experiments but very intentionally to ensure that we can learn. I think I will just end with, the opportunities of where we can take this virtual expert platform is endless. However, the biggest growth opportunity ahead of us right now is helping customers with taxes and helping small businesses run their business. And then as these other verticals become reality, we'll, of course, share our plans with all of you. But it is something that will extend over time horizontally into new verticals."

I think a lot of what we are learning and a lot of what we're excited about as we move forward depends on the customer and the cohort of customers. There are certain customers that, depending on their situation and how much they depend on living weekly -- connected to their weekly paycheck, if you live paycheck to paycheck, you are much more focused on can I get early access to that versus if you don't live week-to-week. So we're learning about those cohorts within our payroll, to your question, and where we can get traction and where it's just not a need for customers. 
I would just say more broadly, we are excited about early access to wages, both providing it across payroll stand-alone, providing it through Credit Karma. And frankly, I think over time, this is just something that's going to be commodity. I think everybody is going to have a product feature that gives you early access to wages.

And I would just tell you that we continue to even get more excited as we've closed the deal because the needs of our customers are in all the areas that you mentioned. And every customer is in a different place. But customers are really looking for ways to be able to engage getting new customers. It's their bread and butter. Almost 70% of our customers are looking for ways to get new customers. 
We now have those capabilities, and we'll integrate it in the QuickBooks and vice versa, QuickBooks into Mailchimp. They want to be able to manage their existing customers in an automated way, in an insightful way where everything is automated. They don't have to know when do I follow up with a customer, what additional products can I sell them, all of that can get automated through Mailchimp. And one of the things people don't realize is one of the largest ways that you still engage customers, we see it through what we do in TurboTax, is actually e-mail. So now we have all those capabilities. 
We have abilities to put you on mega platforms with all of our digital assets, manage all of your existing relationships, all the e-mail capabilities. But more importantly, it's leveraging the power of the data, the customer data and the purchase data to help you understand who's the customer, who bought what, what did they not buy, who's leading your shopping card and how do you pursue them. So it's consistent with what we've talked about before. That's the opportunity ahead, and it's about the work that we do now on the product to put the power of those capabilities in the hands of our customers.

One, there's 88 million folks that use an assisted method today. Within the assisted method, you have 10 million folks every year where there's churn. They go jump from one assisted method to another. So from one account to another or from 1 store to an accountant. And then within the TurboTax base, the do-it-yourselfers, we have 4 million people that leave, and they ultimately go to an assisted method. So I think the answer to your question is it's all of the above. 
We've seen conversion improvements, retention improvements. We've seen TurboTax customers that did it themselves a year before where they had a life change or they just weren't sure if they did their home deductions the right way or if they had a kid and the kid went to college, how to ultimately account for those deductions where they're now using the Live platform. And vice versa, you may use the Live platform and have enough confidence, for the year after, you do it yourself. And then you may -- a day after that, bounce back. And now we're seeing 3, 4 years of trend. So really, it's all of the above, with the largest, I would say, driver being folks that use a different assisted method coming on to a platform and, of course, those that have life changes within TurboTax growing with TurboTax and using the Live platform.

I w",451,"Yes, Kash. One for your kind comments and it's a wonderful question on all those areas, right, the labor shortage, some of the supply chain challenges if you're a product-based business and certainly inflation is absolutely impacting small businesses. I would make a broad comment that I would say we are experiencing. When you couple what happened with the pandemic, starting in March of 2020, where it really, I think, forced everyone around the globe, whether you're a small business or not, but let's just stay focused on small businesses, to reinvent yourself. And it really accelerated the shift to virtual solutions. It accelerated the shift to going online, whether it's how you invoice and get paid, how you do your payroll, how you do your time tracking. And I think that movement, which is just simply continuing, I don't think we're ever going to go back to the old way, I think this pandemic really has accelerated the shift in those areas that I mentioned, in particular, of course, the digital money offering. 
I think that, coupled with this not only labor shortage but also labor movement from job to job, some of the supply chain challenges that generally, we believe, as I talk to my peers, will start to get addressed by the second half of 2022, first half of 2023, and inflation, is actually causing small businesses to leverage more platforms. And so if I then bring that back to our platform and the fact that if you use our platform, you can get paid upfront. You can get instant deposit. You can do same-day payroll. You can use an expert to ensure that you've got the best deductions as a small business and to ensure that you're running your business effectively. 
And the fact that you can do more with less people if you use one platform, that's where the power of Mailchimp comes into play. Rather than having multiple tools where you're bouncing back and forth between tools, and you're not really sure what your customer profitability is, when you should follow up with the customer, how to acquire more customers, all of those things are a thrust for the use of our platform. And our platform is actually built to help you grow your business with less focus on labor and to be able to embrace as much as possible the inflation. Now ultimately, we have to address over time, and I believe it will get addressed, some of these supply chain issues and inflationary issues. But that's where our platform comes into play and why we're so well positioned for small businesses and the role we need to play to continue to educate them."

Last year, you saw a nice upside in the tax quarters, converting TurboTax filers to Credit Karma. Could you remind us kind of where you are there? Was that some low-hanging fruit initially? What drove that success that you saw in that business? And kind of what is your outlook for that this year and going forward?"

I would really put last year entirely in the bucket of just learning. And it doesn't mean that's going to change this year. We are a company that's all about moving fast, experimenting, pivoting and learning, all in context of being stubborn around the vision that we have. And so really, last year was a learning year, although there were some nice member growth impacts to Credit Karma from TurboTax. We're really excited and eager to see how our new innovations and experiences on the platform plays out this year and to see what we learn. 
I'll take you back to the reason, at Investor Day, we put the opportunity of Credit Karma as part of TurboTax experience and TurboTax as part of the Credit Karma platform as a Horizon 3, is we're really focused on the customer and member experience and nailing that because we know, over time, we can monetize. So we're excited about the year ahead. We have 11 months under our belt learning and adjusting and preparing for this tax season. And we're excited about these experiences being launched and seeing how they play out in the next couple of months."

Sure, Scott. Thank you. First of all, on international, we saw some of the same trend given not only our execution but the macro environment, as we've seen in the last couple of quarters, there's certain countries like Canada that have bounced back a bit more strongly. Then there's places like Australia that really have been very slow to bounce back based on the fact that the economy keeps opening and shutting down. And again, our view is, within the next year, international should start to come back from a macro perspective. So net-net, our trends and our performance, although we're very pleased with it, we believe over time could paint a different picture as the macro environment comes back. 
In terms of Mailchimp, our focus is the 3 priorities that I mentioned. We want to create an amazing product and platform that brings QuickBooks and Mailchimp together. We want to build the capabilities to go disrupt mid-market. And then as Michelle mentioned, we're going to be investing heavily in our global go-to-market. So I would say I wouldn't overly anticipate a significant change in our trajectory international because of Mailchimp. There's some fundamental things we want to get right to ensure that we can truly be the platform where you can grow your business and run your business. And over time, it will certainly have an impact internationally, and we're excited about that because it gives us another foot in the door outside of the U.S."

I would say, and I've said this for years, and I think you used to hear Brad talk about this. I think we're the world's biggest hidden secret. And we don't want that secret to hold true anymore.

I think we're the world's biggest hidden secret. And we don't want that secret to hold true anymore. We want to make sure the world knows who it is and what our brands are. And we have data that shows that the more customers learn that TurboTax, Credit Karma, Mailchimp now and QuickBooks, when they learn that they're part of the Intuit brand and the platforms are all connected, it actually has a positive impact on our potential for growth. 
So the way we think about Intuit Dome, it is not for us a naming rights deal. We've had many opportunities where we've actually been pursued to be part of deals like this, and we passed them up over the years. We did this because, one, it's very technology-forward dome. We're going to be helping the community. And two, we're really going to be able to showcase our brands. And it will be yet another way to demonstrate the benefits that we bring to the market as one Intuit platform and the impact that we can have in the lives of consumers and small businesses. 
So that's really how we think about it and why we're excited about it. And by the way, over time, we expect the same return on investment as we do with our marketing investments, and that's really what this is. It just goes beyond marketing to impacting the local communities in L.A., which we're excited about."
