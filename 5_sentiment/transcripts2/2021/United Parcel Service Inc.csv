Joining me today are Carol Tomé, our CEO; and Brian Newman, our CFO. 
Before we begin, I want to remind you that some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements within the federal security laws and address our expectation for the future performance or operating results of our company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2019 Form 10-K, subsequently filed Form 10-Qs and other reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports, when filed, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the SEC. 
For the fourth quarter of 2020, GAAP results included a noncash after-tax mark-to-market pension charge of $4.9 billion, an after-tax transformation charge of $114 million and an after-tax impairment charge of $545 million related to the company's decision to sell UPS Freight. The after-tax total for these items is $5.6 billion, an impact to the fourth quarter of 2020 EPS of $6.38 per diluted share. The mark-to-market pension charge of $4.9 billion included a benefit from higher-than-anticipated asset returns, which did not fully offset the negative impact of lower discount rates. It also included the remainder of our current best estimate of potential central states coordinating benefits as of December 31, 2020. Additional details regarding the year-end pension charges will be available in a presentation posted to our Investor Relations website later today. 
Unless stated otherwise, our comments will refer to adjusted results, which exclude the year-end pension charges, transformation costs and noncash impairment charge. The webcast of today's call, along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions from those joining us via the teleconference. [Operator Instructions] 
And now I'll turn the call over to Carol."

I will review our peak season and then provide an update on our strategic progress. Brian will cover the financial details for the quarter and then finish with an outlook for 2021. 
Let me begin with a huge thank you to our more than 540,000 UPSers who are not only delivering one of the best peaks in our company history, but also for their extraordinary efforts throughout 2020. UPSers are essential workers, and I could not be more proud of the team. In a year unlike any other, they delivered what matters. 
Looking at the fourth quarter, our results were strong and considerably better than we expected. Consolidated revenue in the quarter rose 21% from last year to $24.9 billion, and operating profit grew 26% from last year to $2.9 billion. This is the highest quarterly operating profit in the company's history, with record profit produced in each segment. 
For the year, UPS generated record revenue of $84.6 billion, with growth in all 3 segments. We increased operating profit by 7% to $8.7 billion, and we generated diluted earnings per share of $8.23, an increase of 9.3%. 
Turning back to the fourth quarter, let me address our holiday peak performance. The environment was very dynamic largely due to market demand exceeding market supply, but we were ready. Our early collaboration with customers and a disciplined approach to executing our peak plans proved to be very successful. We delivered industry-leading service levels, which, in turn, accelerated new customer requests for our services. 
As peak holiday approached, we saw SMBs, or small and medium-sized businesses, increasingly turned to UPS. In the U.S., in the fourth quarter, SMB volume grew 28.5%, outpacing our larger customers, which grew by 4%. By running the network with more discipline and through the deployment of new tools, we reduced what we refer to as chaos costs or costs associated with bottlenecks and overtime pay. 
Additionally, SurePost Redirect reached a new record in December. Nearly 50% of SurePost volume was delivered by UPS drivers, optimizing our network. 
And just a comment about peak outside of the U.S., it was a very peaky peak with the highest volume in our history, delivered with excellent service levels. And while this peak was one of our best, we know that we can do even better. We have identified additional areas for improvement and are including them in our peak 2021 planning. 
During the height of the peak season, the FDA and other health authorities approved the use of COVID-19 vaccines. We were ready for this as we had reserved capacity in our network. We've been in the healthcare logistics business for more than 15 years. Our expertise in cold chain logistics positions us well. And thus far, we have provided above 99% service for vaccine delivery. 
Looking back to 2020, we laid a strong foundation for future success. On my first earnings call in July, I mentioned that we were operationalizing our strategy, customer first, people-led, innovation-driven through a better, not bigger framework. We are making solid progress. 
From a customer-first perspective, speed and enabling capabilities are very important. Our goal is to provide the best digital experience powered by our Smart Global Logistics Network. And we're targeting our solutions to high-yielding sectors like SMBs, among others. 
We've moved the needle on speed. For the year, weekend ground volume was up 93.9% over last year. And SMB volume on our fastest ground ever lanes grew by 40% in the fourth quarter since we improved these lanes. We now have more than 700,000 accounts in DAP, which is our digital access program, and revenue from that program grew more than 360% in 2020. We expect our DAP revenues to reach $1 billion in 2021. 
People-led focuses on building a better workplace for our people. Over the past several months, we've addressed some of the pain points here, and early feedback has been very positive. In fact, we've seen a 13 percentage point improvement in likelihood to recommend, the primary metric we use to measure progress on our people-led initiatives. 
As Brian will detail, during the quarter, we accelerated certain annual bonus awards that we're paying out over 5 years. Going forward, our annual management incentive plan will pay out in 1 year and will include targets for return on invested capital. Further, we are simplifying our sales incentive programs and incorporating profitability targets into those programs. These changes better align employee performance to the interest of all share owners. 
People-led also means creating fewer but more impactful jobs and lowering our nonoperating costs. Brian will provide you with an update on our transformation activities. 
Innovation-driven means driving higher returns on the capital we deploy using new tools, processes and technologies. Driving higher returns starts by improving our revenue quality. And here, our efforts are working. 
In the fourth quarter, U.S. Domestic revenue per piece was up 7.8%, the highest growth we've seen in more than 10 years. While this year-over-year growth rate reflects peak surcharges, it also reflects a change in mix as SMBs accounted for 64% of U.S. average daily volume growth in the quarter. We also saw solid SMB volume growth outside of the U.S. Lastly, we have tightened the linkage between our investments and returns. 
As I mentioned back in July, with the exception of our 5 core principles, everything else is under review. Last week, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to sell UPS Freight, our LTL business unit. UPS Freight is a capital-intensive, low-returning business. We do not need to own this business to provide an LTL solution for our customers. With the disposition of UPS Freight, we will be smaller, but we will be better as without it, we will see an improvement in our operating margin and return on invested capital. 
Being better, not bigger also means derisking our balance sheet. We will use the proceeds from the sale of UPS Freight to pay down long-term debt. 
Looking ahead, uncertainty remains. While we are optimistic about the future, we don't know the pace of the vaccine rollout or the impact that a continuing pandemic will have on the global economy. 
On the other hand, we don't think e-commerce sales as a percentage of retail sales will decline, which means continued supply and demand imbalances. This scenario supports our efforts to improve revenue quality while optimizing our existing network. These efforts, coupled with a relentless focus on productivity and effective capital allocation, should result in both operating margin expansion and higher return on invested capital in 2021. But until we have more certainty with the economic environment, we are not providing revenue or earnings per share guidance. 
Let me close with a note of reflection. I've been in the CEO chair since June 1. It has been an honor and a privilege to serve, especially this year, a year the world won't forget. UPS is a purpose-driven company with a proud past and an even brighter future. I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

In my comments today, I will cover 4 areas, starting with high-level macroeconomic trends, then the results for each of our business segments.

In my comments today, I will cover 4 areas, starting with high-level macroeconomic trends, then the results for each of our business segments. Next, I'll review full year cash and shareowner returns, and lastly, I'll wrap up with some color on our 2021 outlook, including full year guidance for capital allocation. 
Let's start with the macro, which can be best described as dynamic and has created both opportunities and obstacles, pushing business activity in multiple directions. Global GDP for the fourth quarter is expected to finish down 1.7%, a slight improvement versus the third quarter. 
In the U.S., reported consumer sentiment in December was 80.7, up 3.8 points from November. And consumers continue to shop online with year-over-year growth for nonstore retail sales up 24.3% to finish at 20.9% of all U.S. retail sales in the fourth quarter. 
On the commercial side of the U.S. economy, growth in industrial production during the fourth quarter remained negative at minus 4.7% year-over-year but improved 180 basis points from the third quarter. Overall, macro conditions are weak. However, the shift in buying patterns generated elevated residential demand. 
Moving to performance. For the quarter, consolidated revenue, profit and EPS were all up more than 20%. UPS consolidated revenue increased 21% to $24.9 billion, and operating profit totaled $2.9 billion, 26% higher than last year. The operating margin for the company expanded to 11.5%, which was 40 basis points above last year. And diluted earnings per share was $2.66, up 26.1% from the same period last year. Our strong fourth quarter financial results provide a glimpse into our strategic progress and what is possible. 
Moving into the segments. In U.S. Domestic, our success was driven by our revenue quality efforts and a disciplined approach to executing our peak plans. As expected, average daily volume increased 8.9% year-over-year to a total of 25.2 million packages per day. 
More importantly, customer mix improved. SMB volume growth accelerated 980 basis points sequentially, going from 18.7% growth in the third quarter to 28.5% in the fourth. Both SMBs and our larger customers grew residential shipments across air and ground products. Overall, B2C shipments increased 19.9% year-over-year and represented 67% of total volume. 
Conversely, both SMBs and large customers shipped fewer B2B packages on a year-over-year basis. B2B average daily volume finished down 8.3%. Healthcare and automotive were bright spots and delivered single-digit B2C growth. However, they were unable to offset weakness in retail and high tech. 
For the quarter, U.S. Domestic generated its highest ever quarterly revenue, up 17.4% to $15.7 billion driven by growth in ground products. We are extremely pleased with our revenue quality efforts, which were well above our expectations. 
More specifically, SMB growth accelerated, and we had higher-than-anticipated peak season surcharge revenue. As a result, reported revenue per piece grew 7.8% year-over-year, with ground revenue per piece up 11.2%. 
Turning to costs. Expenses were up 17.7% over the fourth quarter of last year, and cost per piece was up 8.2%. 
Our expenses grew faster than revenue due to several factors. First, in 2019, we had $150 million in expense reductions from alternative fuel tax credits and lower management incentives that did not repeat; second, total delivery stops increased by 15.7% due to high-growth in single piece shipments, and lower delivery density increased cost by $185 million; third, in the quarter, we had higher benefit expenses of $100 million related to the employees hired early in 2020; and finally, as Carol mentioned, in the fourth quarter, we elected to accelerate the vesting of certain previous compensation awards, a onetime expense impact of $129 million. If you ignore the impact of the accelerated vesting of awards, we would have leveraged expense in the quarter. 
When we look specifically at our peak period, despite the complexities, our operators and engineers executed extremely well. Together with the sales teams, we controlled volume that entered the network, avoiding chaos costs while delivering best-in-class service. As one example, overtime hours in our operations in December went down 7.7% compared to last year. Pulling it all together, in the fourth quarter, the U.S. generated $1.4 billion in operating profit, an increase of 14.3% compared to last year. 
Moving to International. The segment delivered another quarter of record operating profit. We exceeded our volume expectation with total average daily volume up 21.9% driven by export and domestic volume growth in all regions. We added 365 flights above our normal schedules to support high market demand for our export services. In fact, total exports grew 27.8% on a year-over-year basis led by Asia exports, up 45%; and Europe exports, up 30.7%. 
B2C average daily volume grew 104.1%, while B2B was up 2%, the first quarterly B2B growth in 2020. For the quarter, International revenue was up 26.8% to $4.8 billion. Revenue per piece was up 3.8%, and cost per piece was up 0.3% year-over-year, which generated positive operating leverage in the quarter. 
For the fourth quarter, International delivered operating profit of $1.2 billion, an increase of 43.4%, and operating margin expanded 280 basis points to 24.3%. Operating profit and margin are both record highs for the segment. 
Looking at Supply Chain and Freight. The segment results were excellent, with revenue up 29% to $4.4 billion. Strong market demand drove revenue and profit growth in almost all business units. 
Forwarding had another great quarter led by elevated demand out of Asia. Our LTL business grew operating profit by focusing on revenue quality efforts, and healthcare had its best quarterly top line and bottom line growth ever driven by outbound direct-to-patient shipments, all while providing near-perfect service in late December for COVID-19 vaccine deliveries. Overall, in Supply Chain and Freight, operating profit was $331 million an increase of 26.3% year-over-year. 
Walking down our income statement, we had $175 million of interest expense. Other pension income was $327 million, and lastly, our effective tax rate came in at 23.2%. 
Now let's turn to cash and share owner returns. Our cash flow was strong throughout the year. We generated $10.5 billion in cash from operations, which included a benefit of $1.1 billion related to the CARES Act federal payroll tax deferral, offset by pension contributions totaling $3.1 billion. Capital investments totaled $5.6 billion, which includes 16 new aircraft, 16,000 new vehicles and 18 facilities added to our Smart Global Logistics Network, all of which resulted in free cash flow for 2020 of $5.1 billion. In 2020, UPS distributed $3.6 billion in dividends, which represents a 5.2% increase on a per-share basis over 2019. 
Moving to our outlook for 2021. As Carol mentioned, due to the continuing economic uncertainty, we are not providing revenue or diluted earnings per share guidance at this time, but I do want to give you some color as you think about 2021. 
First, let me update you on what we have been calling Transformation 2.0. Through a combination of various programs, we plan to reduce our nonoperating expenses by more than $500 million in 2021. As Carol mentioned, we are focused on creating fewer but more impactful jobs. 
Second, we expect the sale of UPS Freight will close during the second quarter of 2021. So you will want to adjust your models accordingly. 
Third, we are gaining traction on our revenue quality initiatives. As a result, we would expect our small package revenue in 2021 to grow faster than our average daily volume. As we further evaluate the year, one of our wildly important initiatives is to review our network design and look at alternatives for how we expand capacity. 
And finally, because of our revenue quality initiatives, along with our actions to drive higher levels of productivity and take costs out, we expect operating margin and return on invested capital to expand. And just to comment on the first half of the year, we will face more difficult comps in the second quarter of 2021 than in the first quarter. As a result, we anticipate much stronger year-over-year financial results in the first quarter relative to the second quarter. While it is early in the quarter now, we are pleased with how the year has begun. 
Looking at full year capital allocation in 2021, we expect capital expenditures to be about $4 billion, with 40% allocated to maintenance CapEx, 50% for both technology initiatives and network capabilities in 2021 with over half of this investment being deployed to international and health care and the remaining 10% for growth projects that will come online after 2021. Dividends are expected to grow subject to Board approval. 
And to further strengthen the balance sheet, we will pay off $2.5 billion of funded debt. We have no plans to repurchase shares or access the debt capital markets. And lastly, our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23.5%. 
Before I wrap up, I would like to confirm that we will host an investor meeting on June 9, where we will share multiyear financial targets and our specific plans for how we will achieve those targets. 
In closing, we are laser-focused on executing our strategy and leaning into the best market opportunities to improve the financial performance of the company, provide the best customer experience and benefit our share owners. Thank you, and operator, please open the lines."

So I think you've heard us talk about the revenue quality actions we've been implementing. It's a combination of mix. It's a combination of surcharges and customer actions. So I think the progress speaks for itself. 
In terms of op margins for 2021, as I mentioned, we're committed to expanding our domestic op margin in the year. I won't get into Q1 versus Q2. We'll certainly give you some more guidance and clarity when we get together in June to talk about the second half of the year.

I guess what I would call your attention to if you're looking for margin progression and progress, we made an intentional decision, as Carol mentioned, to accelerate divesting of some awards. And if you back that out, that was worth about 80 basis points. So we would have actually generated positive leverage in Q4. So as you think about that relationship, we would have seen positive leverage if we chose not to pull that forward. Hopefully, that answers."

We look at Q4 as a turning point in our company, where our revenue grew faster than our ADV. And that was driven really by 3 factors in the U.S. We were -- beat our U.S. expectations on the top line by nearly $850 million, and it was driven by higher peak surcharges. It was driven by a change in mix as we called out with that increase in SMB, almost 29%. And it was driven by the actions that we started last year to optimize our network, all along the better, not bigger framework. And we think this is proof positive that better, not bigger will work. 
And in the face of the demand capacity constraints, we believe that will continue. So as we look forward to 2021, we expect our revenue to grow faster than our ADV, which provides leveraging opportunities. But it doesn't stop at the top line. It also means continued productivity on the bottom line. So Brian called out our actions to take out $500 million of cost, that's cost that's being eliminated from our company. And then we are driving productivity in our operations expense lines as well. 
So it's a combination of better revenue quality and productivity that will lead to margin expansion, not just in 2021, but beyond. Now we're going to lay this out for you in great detail at our investor conference in June.

Amazon is our largest customer. We enjoyed growth with that customer in 2020. If you look at total revenues for our company in '20, Amazon now makes up about 13.3% of our total revenues, up from 11.6% last year. But we had growth in other customers as well. 
As we look at our large enterprise customers in the fourth quarter alone, we had enterprise customers who are growing at 80% year-on-year. Full year, we had enterprise customers who are growing 100% year-on-year. So we see growth across the board. 
To your question, Allison, about the stickiness of the SMB customer, we are laser-focused here because this is such an important customer to us and one we think values our end-to-end network. So we have 16 customer journeys that we are investing into to improve the customer experience. 
Now it started with our fastest ground ever initiative, and we made good progress in that regard, but we are not done. We know there's more we can do to invest in that -- at that experience because speed really matters for this customer. But it's also about a frictionless digital experience. 
And I'll just give you one example of our 16 customer journeys. That's our billing system. If you look at our billing system for our SMB customers compared to our competitors, and if you did a Harvey ball comparison, you would see that many of our Harvey balls are empty, which means our capabilities are well at a competitive disadvantage. This is a system that was built by UPS years ago, gosh, I don't know how long ago but years ago. We are replacing that system with a new SaaS-provided software application. And when you do the capability comparison against what we will have against our competitors, we were best-in-class. That matters to this customer because the billing system can be personalized for their experience, and every SMB customer is different. 
Now we can't have this in every country around the world because some countries require paper still today. But in many countries, we can install this billing system, and we believe that will result in stickiness. 
It's also about the solutions that we provide. When we provide solutions to our customers, we see they stick with us, and the numbers are quite impressive in terms of the stickiness if they have a solution and don't have a solution. So we continue to invest in that. And at our June 9 investor conference, we're going to unpack this in pretty good detail for you, so you can get a sense of what we're talking about. 
The one other data point that I will share with you is churn. And I think we talked about churn on my first earnings call, didn't we? And we've got a laser focus on SMB churn. What we saw in December is our churn improved for the company year-over-year or the first month this year. And we think that's really in large part because of the customer journeys we're investing in and our fastest ground ever. And as a reminder, every point of churn improvement in the United States is about $170 million of revenue."

A few things were different than this peak than last peak. One was the use of PVDs or personal vehicle drivers. We've used them in the past. But this year, we really leaned into it. So in the United States, this year, we had 39,000 PVD drivers, and they delivered 69 million packages. That we believe drove $92 million of benefit in the quarter. So this is something that really worked very well, and we're going to lean into this as we think about peaks of the future. 
We were also able to use our dream tool, which is a dispatch tool to give our team store drivers who worked so hard give them some time with their families, which hasn't been the case in prior seasons. So we were happy to be able to deliver that. 
We were also pleased with our ability to redirect our SurePost volume back into our network. We saw in December alone, 50% of the SurePost volume was directed back into the network delivered by our UPS drivers. That resulted in productivity savings as well of about $44 million. 
Now was there money left on the table? Sure. We had disruption with pilots in part of the world like Shanghai. For sure, we had some money left on the table. But I would say we had more good news than bad news coming out of the challenges in the fourth quarter."

So as I mentioned back in July, my first earnings call, other than our 5 core principles, everything in the business was under review and immediately looked at UPS Freight. 
I was on the UPS Board for a long time. I went on the UPS Board in 2003. So I was on the Board when we acquired overnight back in 2005. And I have been laser-focused on this asset because we had to impair it shortly after we bought it, and it's never turned out to be what we thought it would be. It's a capital intensive, low-margin business that we don't need to own to offer this solution. So we're like if we can get a price where this asset is worth more to someone else than it is to us, shouldn't we move on that asset, but keep the commercial agreement so that we can serve our customers. And that's where we landed. 
We couldn't be happier with this announced acquisition. That should close, I think, the beginning of the second quarter."

The mark-to-market pension charge of $4.9 billion included a benefit from higher-than-anticipated asset returns which did not fully offset the negative impact of lower discount rates. It also included the remainder of our current best estimate of potential central states coordinating benefits as of December 31, 2020. Additional details regarding the year-end pension charges will be available in a presentation posted to our Investor Relations website later today.  
Unless stated otherwise, our comments will refer to adjusted results, which exclude the year-end pension charges, transformation cost and noncash impairment charge. The webcast of today's call, along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website. 
Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions from those joining us via the teleconference. [Operator Instructions]  
And now I'll turn the call over to Carol."

I will review our peak season and then provide an update on our strategic progress. Brian will cover the financial details for the quarter and then finish with an outlook for 2021.  
Let me begin with a huge thank you to our more than 540,000 UPSers who are not only delivering one of the best peaks in our company history, but also for their extraordinary efforts throughout 2020. UPSers are essential workers, and I could not be more proud of the team. In a year unlike any other, they delivered what matters.  
Looking at the fourth quarter, our results were strong and considerably better than we expected. Consolidated revenue in the quarter rose 21% from last year to $24.9 billion, and operating profit grew 26% from last year to $2.9 billion. This is the highest quarterly operating profit in the company's history, with record profit produced in each segment. 
For the year, UPS generated record revenue of $84.6 billion, with growth in all 3 segments. We increased operating profit by 7% to $8.7 billion. And we generated diluted earnings per share of $8.23, an increase of 9.3%.  
Turning back to the fourth quarter, let me address our holiday peak performance. The environment was very dynamic largely due to market demand exceeding market supply, but we were ready. Our early collaboration with customers and a disciplined approach to executing our peak plans proved to be very successful. We delivered industry-leading service levels which in turn accelerated new customer requests for our services.  
As peak holiday approached, we saw SMBs, or small and medium-sized businesses, increasingly turn to UPS. In the U.S., in the fourth quarter, SMB volume grew 28.5%, outpacing our larger customers, which grew by 4%. By running the network with more discipline and through the deployment of new tools, we reduced what we refer to as chaos costs, or costs associated with bottlenecks and overtime pay. Additionally, SurePost Redirect reached a new record in December. Nearly 50% of SurePost volume was delivered by UPS drivers, optimizing our network.  
And just a comment about peak outside of the U.S., it was a very peaky peak with the highest volume in our history, delivered with excellent service levels. And while this peak was one of our best, we know that we can do even better. We have identified additional areas for improvement and are including them in our peak 2021 planning.  
During the height of the peak season, the FDA and other health authorities approved the use of COVID-19 vaccines. We were ready for this as we had reserved capacity in our network. We've been in the health care logistics business for more than 15 years. Our expertise in cold chain logistics positions us well. And thus far, we have provided above 99% service for vaccine delivery.  
Looking back to 2020, we laid a strong foundation for future success. On my first earnings call in July, I mentioned that we were operationalizing our strategy: Customer-first; people-led; innovation-driven; through a better, not bigger, framework. We are making solid progress.  
From a customer-first perspective, speed and enabling capabilities are very important. Our goal is to provide the best digital experience powered by our Smart Global Logistics Network. And we're targeting our solutions to high-yielding sectors, like SMBs, among others. We've moved the needle on speed. For the year, weekend ground volume was up 93.9% over last year. And SMB volume on our Fastest Ground Ever lanes grew by 40% in the fourth quarter since we improved these lanes. We now have more than 700,000 accounts in DAP, which is our Digital Access Program. And revenue from that program grew more than 360% in 2020. We expect our DAP revenues to reach $1 billion in 2021. 
People-led focuses on building a better workplace for our people. Over the past several months, we've addressed some of the pain points here, and early feedback has been very positive. In fact, we've seen a 13 percentage point improvement in likelihood to recommend, the primary metric we use to measure progress on our people-led initiative. 
As Brian will detail, during the quarter, we accelerated certain annual bonus awards that we're paying out over 5 years. Going forward, our annual management incentive plan will pay out in 1 year and will include targets for return on invested capital. Further, we are simplifying our sales incentive programs and incorporating profitability targets into those programs. These changes better align employee performance to the interest of all shareowners. 
People-led also means creating fewer but more impactful jobs and lowering our nonoperating costs. Brian will provide you with an update on our transformation activities. 
Innovation-driven means driving higher returns on the capital we deploy using new tools, processes and technologies. Driving higher returns starts by improving our revenue quality. And here, our efforts are working. In the fourth quarter, U.S. Domestic revenue per piece was up 7.8%, the highest growth we've seen in more than 10 years. While this year-over-year growth rate reflects peak surcharges, it also reflects a change in mix as SMBs accounted for 64% of U.S. average daily volume growth in the quarter. We also saw solid SMB volume growth outside of the U.S. Lastly, we have tightened the linkage between our investments and returns. 
As I mentioned back in July, with the exception of our 5 core principles, everything else is under review. Last week, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to sell UPS Freight, our LTL business unit. UPS Freight is a capital-intensive, low-returning business. We do not need to own this business to provide an LTL solution for our customers. With the disposition of UPS Freight, we will be smaller, but we will be better, as without it, we will see an improvement in our operating margin and return on invested capital. Being better, not bigger also means derisking our balance sheet. We will use the proceeds from the sale of UPS Freight to pay down long-term debt. 
Looking ahead, uncertainty remains. While we are optimistic about the future, we don't know the pace of the vaccine rollout or the impact that a continuing pandemic will have on the global economy. On the other hand, we don't think e-commerce sales as a percentage of retail sales will decline, which means continued supply and demand imbalances. This scenario supports our efforts to improve revenue quality while optimizing our existing network. These efforts, coupled with a relentless focus on productivity and effective capital allocation, should result in both operating margin expansion and higher return on invested capital in 2021. But until we have more certainty with the economic environment, we are not providing revenue or earnings per share guidance. 
Let me close with a note of reflection. I've been in the CEO chair since June 1. It has been an honor and a privilege to serve, especially this year, a year the world won't forget. UPS is a purpose-driven company with a proud past and an even brighter future. I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

In my comments today, I will cover 4 areas, starting with high-level macroeconomic trends, then the results for each of our business segments. Next, I'll review full year cash and shareowner returns. And lastly, I'll wrap up with some color on our 2021 outlook, including full year guidance for capital allocation. 
Let's start with the macro, which can be best described as dynamic and has created both opportunities and obstacles, pushing business activity in multiple directions. Global GDP for the fourth quarter is expected to finish down 1.7%, a slight improvement versus the third quarter. In the U.S., reported consumer sentiment in December was 80.7, up 3.8 points from November. And consumers continued to shop online with year-over-year growth for nonstore retail sales up 24.3% to finish at 20.9% of all U.S. retail sales in the fourth quarter. On the commercial side of the U.S. economy, growth in industrial production during the fourth quarter remained negative at minus 4.7% year-over-year but improved 180 basis points from the third quarter. Overall, macro conditions are weak. However, the shift in buying patterns generated elevated residential demand. 
Moving to performance. For the quarter, consolidated revenue, profit and EPS were all up more than 20%. UPS consolidated revenue increased 21% to $24.9 billion, and operating profit totaled $2.9 billion, 26% higher than last year. The operating margin for the company expanded to 11.5%, which was 40 basis points above last year. And diluted earnings per share was $2.66, up 26.1% from the same period last year. Our strong fourth quarter financial results provide a glimpse into our strategic progress and what is possible. 
Moving into the segments. In U.S. Domestic, our success was driven by our revenue quality efforts and a disciplined approach to executing our peak plans. As expected, average daily volume increased 8.9% year-over-year to a total of 25.2 million packages per day. More importantly, customer mix improved. SMB volume growth accelerated 980 basis points sequentially, going from 18.7% growth in the third quarter to 28.5% in the fourth. Both SMBs and our larger customers grew residential shipments across air and ground products. 
Overall, B2C shipments increased 19.9% year-over-year and represented 67% of total volume. Conversely, both SMBs and large customers shipped fewer B2B packages on a year-over-year basis. B2B average daily volume finished down 8.3%. Health care and automotive were bright spots and delivered single-digit B2B growth. However, they were unable to offset weakness in retail and high tech. 
For the quarter, U.S. Domestic generated its highest-ever quarterly revenue, up 17.4% to $15.7 billion, driven by growth in ground products. We are extremely pleased with our revenue quality efforts which were well above our expectations. More specifically, SMB growth accelerated, and we had higher-than-anticipated peak season surcharge revenue. As a result, reported revenue per piece grew 7.8% year-over-year, with ground revenue per piece up 11.2%. 
Turning to costs. Expenses were up 17.7% over the fourth quarter of last year, and cost per piece was up 8.2%. Our expenses grew faster than revenue due to several factors. First, in 2019, we had $150 million in expense reductions from alternative fuel tax credits and lower management incentives that did not repeat. Second, total delivery stops increased by 15.7% due to high-growth in single piece shipments, and lower delivery density increased cost by $185 million. Third, in the quarter, we had higher benefit expenses of $100 million related to the employees hired early in 2020. And finally, as Carol mentioned, in the fourth quarter, we elected to accelerate the vesting of certain previous compensation awards, a onetime expense impact of $129 million. If you ignore the impact of the accelerated vesting of awards, we would have leveraged expense in the quarter. 
When we look specifically at our peak period, despite the complexities, our operators and engineers executed extremely well. Together with the sales teams, we controlled volume that entered the network, avoiding chaos costs while delivering best-in-class service. As one example, overtime hours in our operations in December went down 7.7% compared to last year. Pulling it all together, in the fourth quarter, the U.S. generated $1.4 billion in operating profit, an increase of 14.3% compared to last year. 
Moving to International. The segment delivered another quarter of record operating profit. We exceeded our volume expectation with total average daily volume up 21.9% driven by export and domestic volume growth in all regions. We added 365 flights above our normal schedules to support high market demand for our export services. In fact, total exports grew 27.8% on a year-over-year basis led by Asia exports, up 45%; and Europe exports, up 30.7%. B2C average daily volume grew 104.1%, while B2B was up 2%, the first quarterly B2B growth in 2020. 
For the quarter, International revenue was up 26.8% to $4.8 billion. Revenue per piece was up 3.8%, and cost per piece was up 0.3% year-over-year, which generated positive operating leverage in the quarter. For the fourth quarter, International delivered operating profit of $1.2 billion, an increase of 43.4%, and operating margin expanded 280 basis points to 24.3%. Operating profit and margin are both record highs for the segment. 
Looking at Supply Chain and Freight. The segment results were excellent, with revenue up 29% to $4.4 billion. Strong market demand drove revenue and profit growth in almost all business units. Forwarding had another great quarter led by elevated demand out of Asia. Our LTL business grew operating profit by focusing on revenue quality efforts, and health care had its best quarterly top line and bottom line growth ever driven by outbound direct-to-patient shipments, all while providing near-perfect service in late December for COVID-19 vaccine deliveries. Overall, in Supply Chain and Freight, operating profit was $331 million an increase of 26.3% year-over-year. 
Walking down our income statement. We had $175 million of interest expense. Other pension income was $327 million. And lastly, our effective tax rate came in at 23.2%. 
Now let's turn to cash and shareowner returns. Our cash flow was strong throughout the year. We generated $10.5 billion in cash from operations, which included a benefit of $1.1 billion related to the CARES Act federal payroll tax deferral, offset by pension contributions totaling $3.1 billion. Capital investments totaled $5.6 billion, which includes 16 new aircraft, 16,000 new vehicles and 18 facilities added to our Smart Global Logistics Network, all of which resulted in free cash flow for 2020 of $5.1 billion. In 2020, UPS distributed $3.6 billion in dividends, which represents a 5.2% increase on a per-share basis over 2019. 
Moving to our outlook for 2021. As Carol mentioned, due to the continuing economic uncertainty, we are not providing revenue or diluted earnings per share guidance at this time, but I do want to give you some color as you think about 2021.  
First, let me update you on what we have been calling Transformation 2.0. Through a combination of various programs, we plan to reduce our nonoperating expenses by more than $500 million in 2021. As Carol mentioned, we are focused on creating fewer but more impactful jobs. 
Second, we expect the sale of UPS Freight will close during the second quarter of 2021. So you will want to adjust your models accordingly. 
Third, we are gaining traction on our revenue quality initiatives. As a result, we would expect our small package revenue in 2021 to grow faster than our average daily volume. As we further evaluate the year, one of our wildly important initiatives is to review our network design and look at alternatives for how we expand capacity. 
And finally, because of our revenue quality initiatives, along with our actions to drive higher levels of productivity and take cost out, we expect operating margin and return on invested capital to expand. 
And just to comment on the first half of the year. We will face more difficult comps in the second quarter of 2021 than in the first quarter. As a result, we anticipate much stronger year-over-year financial results in the first quarter relative to the second quarter. While it is early in the quarter now, we are pleased with how the year has begun.  
Looking at full year capital allocation in 2021, we expect capital expenditures to be about $4 billion, with 40% allocated to maintenance CapEx, 50% for both technology initiatives and network capabilities in 2021 with over half of this investment being deployed to International and health care, and the remaining 10% for growth projects that will come online after 2021. Dividends are expected to grow subject to Board approval. And to further strengthen the balance sheet, we will pay off $2.5 billion of funded debt. We have no plans to repurchase shares or access the debt capital markets. And lastly, our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23.5%. 
Before I wrap up, I would like to confirm that we will host an investor meeting on June 9, where we will share multiyear financial targets and our specific plans for how we will achieve those targets. 
In closing, we are laser-focused on executing our strategy and leaning into the best market opportunities to improve the financial performance of the company, provide the best customer experience and benefit our shareowners. 
Thank you. And operator, please open the lines."

I guess what I would call your attention to if you're looking for margin progression and progress, we made an intentional decision, as Carol mentioned, to accelerate the vesting of some awards. And if you back that out, that was worth about 80 basis points. So we would have actually generated positive leverage in Q4. So as you think about that relationship, we would have seen positive leverage if we chose not to pull that forward. Hopefully, that answers."

And that was driven really by 3 factors in the U.S. We were -- beat our U.S. expectations on the top line by nearly $850 million, and it was driven by higher peak surcharges. It was driven by a change in mix as we called out with that increase in SMB, almost 29%. And it was driven by the actions that we started last year to optimize our network, all along the better, not bigger framework. And we think this is proof positive that better, not bigger will work. And in the face of the demand capacity constraints, we believe that will continue. 
So as we look forward to 2021, we expect our revenue to grow faster than our ADV, which provides leveraging opportunities. But it doesn't stop at the top line, it also means continued productivity on the bottom line. So Brian called out our actions to take out $500 million of cost, that's cost that's being eliminated from our company. And then we are driving productivity in our operations expense lines as well. 
So it's a combination of better revenue quality and productivity that will lead to margin expansion, not just in 2021, but beyond.

And we'll be happy to share with you more information in that regard, too. It's pretty exciting when I think about what we can do from that perspective, longer term. 
In terms of how we're spending our capital this year, Brian, you might want to talk about that."

Amazon is our largest customer. We enjoyed growth with that customer in 2020. If you look at total revenues for our company in '20, Amazon now makes up about 13.3% of our total revenues, up from 11.6% last year. 
But we had growth in other customers as well. As we look at our large enterprise customers in the fourth quarter alone, we had enterprise customers who are growing at 80% year-on-year. Full year, we had enterprise customers who are growing 100% year-on-year. So we see growth across the board. 
To your question, Allison, about the stickiness of the SMB customer, we are laser-focused here because this is such an important customer to us and one we think values our end-to-end network. So we have 16 customer journeys that we are investing into to improve the customer experience. Now it started with our Fastest Ground Ever initiative, and we made good progress in that regard, but we are not done. We know there's more we can do to invest in that -- at that experience because speed really matters for this customer. But it's also about a frictionless digital experience. 
And I'll just give you one example of our 16 customer journeys. That's our billing system. If you look at our billing system for our SMB customers compared to our competitors, and if you did a Harvey ball comparison, you would see that many of our Harvey balls are empty, which means our capabilities are, well, at a competitive disadvantage. This is a system that was built by UPS years ago. Gosh, I don't know how long ago, but years ago. 
We are replacing that system with a new SaaS-provided software application. And when you do the capability comparison against what we will have against our competitors, well, we're best-in-class. That matters to this customer because the billing system can be personalized for their experience, and every SMB customer is different. Now we can't have this in every country around the world because some countries require paper still today. But in many countries, we can install this billing system, and we believe that will result in stickiness. 
It's also about the solutions that we provide. When we provide solutions to our customers, we see they stick with us, and the numbers are quite impressive in terms of the stickiness if they have a solution and don't have a solution. So we continue to invest in that. And at our June 9 investor conference, we're going to unpack this in pretty good detail for you, so you can get a sense of what we're talking about. 
The one other data point that I will share with you is churn. And I think we talked about churn on my first earnings call, didn't we? And we've got a laser focus on SMB churn. What we saw in December is our churn improved for the company year-over-year the first month this year. And we think that's really in large part because of the customer journeys we're investing in and our Fastest Ground Ever. And as a reminder, every point of churn improvement in the United States is about $170 million of revenue."

But the team did a masterful job of managing through it. 
A few things were different than this peak than last peak. One was the use of PVDs, or personal vehicle drivers. We've used them in the past. But this year, we really leaned into it. So in the United States, this year, we had 39,000 PVD drivers, and they delivered 69 million packages. That, we believe, drove $92 million of benefit in the quarter. So this is something that really worked very well, and we're going to lean into this as we think about peaks of the future. 
We were also able to use our dream tool, which is a dispatch tool to give our Teamster drivers who worked so hard, give them some time with their families, which hasn't been the case in prior seasons. So we were happy to be able to deliver that. 
We were also pleased with our ability to redirect our SurePost volume back into our network. We saw in December alone, 50% of the SurePost volume was directed back into the network, delivered by our UPS drivers. That resulted in productivity savings as well of about $44 million.

We want to keep those jobs, we want to grow jobs. So we're going to be speaking with the union representation about how we do that going forward. 
We're also, candidly, excited about what new administration could mean for pension reform. And pension reform would be good for us and it would be good for our Teamsters. So we will continue to work that agenda because we think it's in the best interest of all parties."

So as I mentioned back in July, my first earnings call, other than our 5 core principles, everything in the business was under review and immediately looked at UPS Freight. 
I was on the UPS Board for a long time. I went on the UPS Board in 2003. So I was on the Board when we acquired Overnite back in 2005. And I have been laser-focused on this asset because we had to impair it shortly after we bought it, and it's never turned out to be what we thought it would be. It's a capital-intensive, low-margin business that we don't need to own to offer this solution. 
So we're like if we can get a price where this asset is worth more to someone else than it is to us, shouldn't we move on that asset?

Before we begin, I want to remind you that some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements within the federal securities laws and address our expectation for the future performance or operating results of our company. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainty, which are described in detail in our 2020 Form 10-K and other reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports, when filed, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the SEC. 
For the first quarter of 2021, GAAP results include a net benefit of $2.4 billion or $2.70 per diluted share, comprised of an after-tax mark-to-market pension benefit of $2.5 billion and an after-tax transformation and other charges of $140 million. The mark-to-market pension benefit was primarily driven by the enactment of the American Rescue Plan Act, the resulting elimination of our balance sheet liability related to the Central States Pension Fund as well as the remeasurement of the UPS IBT Pension plan at the current discount rate. Together, these reduced our pension liability by $6.4 billion. 
Unless stated otherwise, our comments will refer to adjusted results, which exclude the mark-to-market pension benefit and transformation and other charges. The webcast of today's call, along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions from those joining via the teleconference.

As shown in our results, our team is advancing our customer-first, people-led, innovation-driven strategy under the better, not bigger framework. As we've discussed, customer first is about building capabilities that matter the most to our customers and using those capabilities to capture the best opportunities in the market, like small and medium-sized businesses and health care. 
In the U.S., the improvements we made last year and continue to make this year to speed up our ground network, enhance our digital access program known as DAP and expand weekend operations. Well, these are taking hold. In fact, during the first quarter, we added nearly 150,000 new DAP accounts, and we are well on our way to hitting our $1 billion DAP revenue target by the end of this year. Further, in the U.S., total average daily volume growth for SMBs, including our platform businesses, reached an all-time high of 35.6%, outpacing the growth rate of our larger customers for the third consecutive quarter. This mix improvement and certain other revenue quality actions are delivering results with U.S. domestic revenue per piece up 10.2% in the first quarter. 
Looking at our International segment, we were able to meet elevated customer demand by leveraging the agility of our network. Export volume grew double digits in all regions. Commercial volume increased 10.1% and SMB average daily volume was up 23% in the first quarter, and we see even more opportunity moving ahead as we expand DAP and other solutions to key international markets. 
During the quarter, our Supply Chain & Freight segment responded well to market demands. We are on track to complete the divestiture of our UPS Freight business by the end of this month and we look forward to our new commercial relationship with TFI. Our focus on the customer includes improving the end-to-end experience. In other words, improving the experience from the shipper to the receiver as both our customers. We've identified a number of customer journeys and candidly pain points that we are addressing. 
Let me give you an example. Until recently, paying a UPS bill online was a poor customer experience. So we replaced our old homegrown system with a new SaaS application, which we began deploying globally in the first quarter. Once fully implemented, our industry-leading billing solution will make it easy for nearly 2 million global customers to pay and manage their UPS bills. This will be particularly helpful for our SMB customers. Our customer first aspiration is to provide the best digital experience powered by our smart global logistics network. A simplified billing experience is one aspect of this aspiration. 
Another is the digitization that's occurring within our Supply Chain and Freight segment. We are moving from telephone-based quotes to online quoting. This new digital experience is driving simplification across the entire value chain. We'll talk more about our efforts to improve our customers' experiences during our June Investor and Analyst Day. 
We know that our customers place high value on the reliability of the UPS network. That's why we led the market by reinstating our service guarantees for U.S. Next-day Air Services and Worldwide Express Services for all origins and destinations. We intend to be the carrier that shippers and receivers can count on for reliable delivery. 
And as it relates to COVID-19 vaccine, our global expertise, technology and network are enabling us to move vaccines, kits and dry ice over great distances around the world. As of last week, we have delivered more than 1.1 million shipments, about 196 million vaccine doses to about 50 countries and territories and utilized our UPS Premier Service to achieve 99.9% on-time delivery. 
The combination of our efforts to remove friction in the customer experience provide the digital capabilities that matter most and deliver industry-leading service levels are positioning us for future growth. Further, as we've discussed, market demand is outpacing industry supply and we expect this dynamic to continue for the foreseeable future. 
GDP forecasts are being revised higher, economies are reopening and U.S. consumer spending is being boosted by government stimulus programs. This demand/supply imbalance creates an environment where pricing in the industry should remain firm. Brian will cover more of our economic outlook in his remarks. 
People Led is an important part of our strategy. Our success in the first quarter was due to the commitment of our people and the strength of our culture. Every UPSer has a role to play in supporting our customers. We've hired a lot of new UPSers, so we know we need to focus on employee safety and training. In the U.S., we have reimagined our driver safety program by truly taking it on the road. We've created mobile units that can be rapidly deployed across the country. These units provide classroom training and a learning lab within movable trailers. 
Our mobile training, along with other vehicle safety technologies, are making a difference. So far this year, we've improved auto accident frequency by 2.1% globally. And we will continue to advance our employee safety programs around the world. 
Moving to Innovation Driven. Over the past several years, we have invested in automation, introduced new technology and open new facilities. We are now starting to reap productivity benefits from these investments. The additional flexibility we've gained in the network enables us to be more responsive to changes in demand and be more efficient. In fact, in the first quarter compared to last year, productivity improved in nearly all major operating categories. But we have more to do. We aim to make productivity a virtuous cycle, not just a transformation project. We are laser-focused on operational excellence. And we'll share more details about our efforts here during our conference. 
Let me take a moment to touch on 1 of our 5 core principles, which is maintaining a strong balance sheet and credit rating. We have made great strides in this area by reducing financial leverage and improving shareowners' equity. Brian will share the details on this in a moment. Our strategy is gaining traction and we see even more opportunities ahead. We look forward to sharing the details with you at our upcoming Investor and Analyst Day. And now I'll turn the call over to Brian."
238570,711123569,2258862,"United Parcel Service, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,"Earnings Calls","United Parcel Service, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Carol, and good morning. In my comments today, I will cover 4 areas, starting with macroeconomic trends, then our first quarter results. Next, I'll review cash and shareowner returns.

In my comments today, I will cover 4 areas, starting with macroeconomic trends, then our first quarter results. Next, I'll review cash and shareowner returns. And lastly, I'll wrap up with some comments on our outlook and the new Pension Reform law. 
Okay. Let's start with the macro and how it is projected to unfold. Global GDP in the first quarter is expected to finish up 3.5% and U.S. GDP is expected to be up 0.2%. Both have shown significant improvement over the fourth quarter of 2020. Key economic indicators continue to support a strong recovery in 2021. Forecasts are moving higher based on 3 factors: First is the progress with the global vaccine rollout. Second is a low U.S. inventory to sales ratio, which ran between 1.4 and 1.5 for the 3 years prior to COVID and is currently down about 18% from historic averages at a time when a number of economies are starting to reopen. And third is the passage of the most recent U.S. government stimulus. According to IHS, for the full year, global GDP is now expected to grow 5.3% and U.S. GDP is expected to grow 6.2%. 
In the U.S., full year nominal retail sales are anticipated to grow 11.7% and electronic sales and mail orders, the proxy we use for online sales, are expected to be up 12.7%, following growth of 24.7% in 2020. The outlook for the commercial side of the U.S. economy is also encouraging. Full year industrial production is forecasted to grow 6.5% on a year-over-year basis. We view these projections as favorable for our company and expect the imbalance between market demand and industry capacity to continue, as Carol mentioned. 
Moving to our first quarter performance. Consolidated revenue increased 27% to $22.9 billion. Operating profit totaled $2.9 billion, 164% higher than last year. Consolidated operating margin expanded to 12.9%, which is our best consolidated margin in 18 quarters, and diluted earnings per share was up $2.77, up 141% from the same period last year. 
Now let's take a look at the segments. In U.S. Domestic, our success was due to a combination of our revenue quality initiatives and the impact of our productivity efforts running the network. Average daily volume increased 12.8% year-over-year to a total of 20.4 million packages per day. Additionally, mix continued to be positive. SMB volume growth, including platforms, accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter, reaching 35.6% and accounted for 63% of our total average daily volume increase. 
Both SMBs and our larger customers grew residential shipments across air and ground products. Overall, B2C shipments increased 23.8% year-over-year. Conversely, B2B average daily volume declined 0.6% year-over-year. Health care and automotive remain bright spots and delivered mid-single-digit B2B growth, yet they were unable to offset weakness in other commercial segments. 
Total B2B volume strengthened late in the quarter with March turning positive. For the quarter, U.S. Domestic generated revenue of $14 billion, up 22.3%, driven by average daily volume growth and improvements in revenue per piece. We were extremely pleased with our revenue quality efforts, which were driven by strong SMB average daily volume growth and demand-related surcharges. 
As a result of our actions, reported revenue per piece grew 10.2% year-over-year with ground revenue per piece up 12.5%. 
Turning to costs. Expenses were up 13.5%. Cost per piece rose 2.2%, driven primarily by 2 factors: our fastest ground ever and weekend initiatives and planned benefit expense increases. Nando and his team did an outstanding job transitioning the network from fourth quarter peak back into nonpeak operations. This enabled us to control unnecessary costs and make productivity improvements across the network. And building on Carol's comments about reducing accident frequency, our efforts to prevent incidents through additional safety training, technology and analytics enabled lower-than-expected casualty self-insurance costs in the first quarter. 
Most notably in the quarter, revenue growth was significantly above expense growth, which generated positive operating leverage. So in summary, the U.S. Domestic segment delivered $1.5 billion in operating profit, an increase of $1.1 billion or 265% compared to last year, and operating margin expanded to 10.4%. 
Moving over to International. The results were excellent, and our performance demonstrates the flexibility of our network to match global air capacity with demand. Volume growth was very strong, with total average daily volume up 23.1%. We saw growth across customer segments with both larger customers and SMBs growing over 20%. To support outbound Asia demand, we added 25% more flights and even more in terms of capacity because of our 747-8 capabilities. 
Asia export volume was up 43% and Europe exports were up 27.7%. And overall, total exports grew 26.2% on a year-over-year basis. B2C average daily volume grew 77.6%, while B2B was up 10.1% driven by the retail, high-tech and automotive sectors. For the quarter, International revenue was up 36.2% to $4.6 billion, with all regions growing revenue over 20%. We generated strong operating leverage in the quarter with revenue per piece of 12.3% and cost per piece up 2.7% year-over-year. For the first quarter, International delivered operating profit of $1.1 billion, an increase of 95.5% and operating margin expanded to 23.7%. 
Looking at Supply Chain & Freight. Revenue increased 34.3% to $4.3 billion, and the segment generated record profit and operating margin. Market demand was elevated and nearly all business units had revenue and profit growth. Forwarding led the way, driven by strong growth on the outbound Asia lane for both air and ocean. And health care activities delivered the highest top and bottom line growth ever. Growth was broad-based from biopharma and biologics as well as implantable medical device and lab customers, all while providing near perfect service during the quarter for COVID-19 vaccine deliveries. In the first quarter, Supply Chain & Freight generated operating profit of $395 million and operating margin was 9.2%. 
Walking through the rest of the income statement, we had $177 million of interest expense. Other pension income was $313 million. And lastly, our effective tax rate came in at 21.6% due to discrete items. 
Now let's turn to cash and shareowner returns. Our focus on bottom line results drove strong cash flow in the quarter. We generated $4.5 billion in cash from operations, Free cash flow for the period was $3.7 billion, a 130% increase year-over-year. And lastly, so far this year, UPS has distributed $938 million in dividends. 
Moving to our outlook for 2021. We recognize there is still uncertainty ahead related to the pandemic and other factors that could interrupt the recovery, so we are not providing revenue or diluted earnings per share guidance at this time. As Carol mentioned, we expect the sale of UPS Freight to close during the second quarter, and today, we are reaffirming our capital allocation plans. To that end, we still expect capital expenditures to be about $4 billion. We have no plans to repurchase shares at this time, and our effective tax rate for the remainder of the year is expected to be around 23.5%. 
We repaid $1.5 billion of long-term debt maturities in the first quarter. And in early April, we repaid another $1 billion in debt, achieving our 2021 target of $2.5 billion in debt repayment. And lastly, on March 11, the American Rescue Plan Act was signed into law. This law protects certain multiemployer pension plans from becoming insolvent through 2051. And, in turn, eliminates our balance sheet liability for potential coordinating benefits related to the Central States Pension Fund. The passage of the law triggered us to remeasure the UPS IBT Pension plan at current discount rates, which have significantly increased since year-end. The result was a $6.4 billion reduction in our pension liability. Additional information is available in the Appendix section of today's earnings presentation. 
As Carol mentioned, a strong balance sheet is a core UPS principle, and we are absolutely moving in a positive direction. The reduction in pension liability and debt repayments have reduced our long-term obligations by $7.9 billion. Combined with our improving business performance, our leverage ratios have significantly improved. 
In closing, we are laser-focused on executing our strategy and look forward to sharing more with you at our June 9 Investor and Analyst Day. Thank you, and operator, please open the lines."

We're looking forward to the June Investor and Analyst Day, where we will give you much more color on our forward-looking outlook, including what we're doing from a productivity perspective. As we think about productivity, we really want to move away from an event, in other words, a transformation event, to actually a virtuous cycle. And we're starting that, as you see in our results in the first quarter. If you look at our operating performance, we drove productivity in nearly every operating category. 
And when I think about productivity in the business, It's really about packages per hour. We had improvement in packages per hour in our sort, in our feeder, in our hub operations. We saw productivity in our delivery, our route density improved year-on-year driven in large part by our Orion technology. So we're going to give you a lot more color as to what we're doing to drive productivity in the business at our Investor Day. 
One more comment on productivity, and that relates to non-operations. Well, you refer to that, Brian, as Transformation 2.0. And at the beginning of the year, we told you we were teaching now $500 million of expense in our nonoperations area. We're well down the path in that regard. We are on plan, and we will deliver that result by the end of the year."

That was a large contributor to the growth in RPP in the quarter. And when you have a 10% growth in RPP, well, you're going to leverage the bottom line, and we did just that. 
So optimizing the network and leaning in to those opportunities of growth that candidly the revenue quality is better for us, our customers like the offering, the end-to-end network that we present to them. That's really laying the future for our growth going forward. Coupled with health care, those 2 growth opportunities are a winning combination. We saw the same opportunity outside the United States, too, with great SMB growth, 23% in our International business.

But let you know what we're doing because we're increasing our weekend delivery because our customers are demanding that. 
We love our SurePost product. SurePost was about 36% of the growth in the first quarter. But the cool thing about SurePost is that 41% of that product was redirected back into the UPS network, which allows us to get delivery density. So that's a great way to think about how we can grow Sunday. So we'll be expanding our Sunday deliveries as well. And we really look forward -- we don't have enough time this morning, but we really look forward to the June investor conference because we're in talk to you about how by expanding our network across 7 days we can actually eliminate some of the lumpiness in the network in the middle of the week. And the lumpiness in the network in the middle of the week is causing some of the productivity deleverage that we see in our business. And if we can flatten out the demand, we can really get some great productivity. So we'll walk you through that algorithm at our June Investor Day."

Joining me today are Carol Tomé, our CEO; and Brian Newman, our CFO.  
Before we begin, I want to remind you that some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements within the federal securities laws and address our expectation for the future performance or operating results of our company. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainty, which are described in detail in our 2020 Form 10-K and other reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports, when filed, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the SEC.  
For the first quarter of 2021, GAAP results include a net benefit of $2.4 billion or $2.70 per diluted share, comprised of an after-tax mark-to-market pension benefit of $2.5 billion and an after-tax transformation and other charges of $140 million. The mark-to-market pension benefit was primarily driven by the enactment of the American Rescue Plan Act, the resulting elimination of our balance sheet liability related to the Central States Pension Fund as well as the remeasurement of the UPS IBT Pension Plan at the current discount rate. Together, these reduced our pension liability by $6.4 billion.  
Unless stated otherwise, our comments will refer to adjusted results, which exclude the mark-to-market pension benefit and transformation and other charges. The webcast of today's call, along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website.

We are now more than a year into the COVID-19 pandemic, which drove enormous change to how we all live and conduct business. I want to thank our more than 540,000 UPSers for continuing to deliver what matters and for serving our customers, communities and each other.  
Looking at the first quarter. Our results exceeded our expectations, driven by an improving macro environment and great execution by our team. Consolidated revenue in the quarter rose 27% from last year to $22.9 billion, and operating profit grew 164% to $2.9 billion. All of our business segments delivered strong performance in the first quarter.  
We reported record profits and a double-digit operating margin in our U.S. Domestic segment, record first quarter profit in our International segment and record operating profit and operating margin in Supply Chain and Freight. As shown in our results, our team is advancing our customer-first, people-led, innovation-driven strategy under the better, not bigger framework. As we've discussed, customer first is about building capabilities that matter the most to our customers and using those capabilities to capture the best opportunities in the market, like small and medium-sized businesses and health care.  
In the U.S., the improvements we made last year and continue to make this year to speed up our ground network, enhance our digital access program known as DAP and expand weekend operations. Well, these are taking hold. In fact, during the first quarter, we added nearly 150,000 new DAP accounts, and we are well on our way to hitting our $1 billion DAP revenue target by the end of this year. 
Further, in the U.S., total average daily volume growth for SMBs, including our platform businesses, reached an all-time high of 35.6%, outpacing the growth rate of our larger customers for the third consecutive quarter. This mix improvement and certain other revenue quality actions are delivering results with U.S. domestic revenue per piece, up 10.2% in the first quarter.  
Looking at our International segment. We were able to meet elevated customer demand by leveraging the agility of our network. Export volume grew double digits in all regions. Commercial volume increased 10.1% and SMB average daily volume was up 23% in the first quarter, and we see even more opportunity moving ahead as we expand DAP and other solutions to key international markets.  
During the quarter, our Supply Chain and Freight segment responded well to market demands. We are on track to complete the divestiture of our UPS Freight business by the end of this month and we look forward to our new commercial relationship with TFI. Our focus on the customer includes improving the end-to-end experience. In other words, improving the experience from the shipper to the receiver as both our customers. We've identified a number of customer journeys and candidly pain points that we are addressing.  
Let me give you an example. 
Until recently, paying a UPS bill online was a poor customer experience. So we replaced our old homegrown system with a new SaaS application, which we began deploying globally in the first quarter. Once fully implemented, our industry-leading billing solution will make it easy for nearly 2 million global customers to pay and manage their UPS bills. This will be particularly helpful for our SMB customers. Our customer first aspiration is to provide the best digital experience powered by our smart global logistics network. A simplified billing experience is one aspect of this aspiration.  
Another is the digitization that's occurring within our Supply Chain and Freight segment. We are moving from telephone-based quotes to online quoting. This new digital experience is driving simplification across the entire value chain. We'll talk more about our efforts to improve our customers' experiences during our June Investor and Analyst Day.  
We know that our customers place high value on the reliability of the UPS network. That's why we led the market by reinstating our service guarantees for U.S. Next-day Air Services and Worldwide Express Services for all origins and destinations. We intend to be the carrier that shippers and receivers can count on for reliable delivery.  
And as it relates to COVID-19 vaccine, our global expertise, technology and network are enabling us to move vaccines, kits and dry ice over great distances around the world. As of last week, we have delivered more than 1.1 million shipments, about 196 million vaccine doses to about 50 countries and territories and utilized our UPS Premier Service to achieve 99.9% on-time delivery.  
The combination of our efforts to remove friction in the customer experience provide the digital capabilities that matter most and deliver industry-leading service levels are positioning us for future growth. Further, as we've discussed, market demand is outpacing industry supply and we expect this dynamic to continue for the foreseeable future.  
GDP forecasts are being revised higher, economies are reopening and U.S. consumer spending is being boosted by government stimulus programs. This demand/supply imbalance creates an environment where pricing in the industry should remain firm. Brian will cover more of our economic outlook in his remarks.  
People Led is an important part of our strategy. Our success in the first quarter was due to the commitment of our people and the strength of our culture. Every UPSer has a role to play in supporting our customers. We've hired a lot of new UPSers, so we know we need to focus on employee safety and training. In the U.S., we have reimagined our driver safety program by truly taking it on the road. We've created mobile units that can be rapidly deployed across the country. These units provide classroom training and a learning lab within movable trailers. Our mobile training, along with other vehicle safety technologies, are making a difference. So far this year, we've improved auto accident frequency by 2.1% globally. And we will continue to advance our employee safety programs around the world.  
Moving to Innovation Driven. Over the past several years, we have invested in automation, introduced new technology and open new facilities. We are now starting to reap productivity benefits from these investments. The additional flexibility we've gained in the network enables us to be more responsive to changes in demand and be more efficient. In fact, in the first quarter compared to last year, productivity improved in nearly all major operating categories. But we have more to do. We aim to make productivity a virtuous cycle, not just a transformation project.  
We are laser-focused on operational excellence. And we'll share more details about our efforts here during our conference. Let me take a moment to touch on 1 of our 5 core principles, which is maintaining a strong balance sheet and credit rating. We have made great strides in this area by reducing financial leverage and improving shareowners' equity. Brian will share the details on this in a moment. Our strategy is gaining traction and we see even more opportunities ahead. We look forward to sharing the details with you at our upcoming Investor and Analyst Day. And now I'll turn the call over to Brian."
238570,711123569,2259238,"United Parcel Service, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,"Earnings Calls","United Parcel Service, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Carol, and good morning.

In my comments today, I will cover 4 areas, starting with macroeconomic trends, then our first quarter results. Next, I'll review cash and shareowner returns. And lastly, I'll wrap up with some comments on our outlook and the new Pension Reform Law.  
Okay. Let's start with the macro and how it is projected to unfold. Global GDP in the first quarter is expected to finish up 3.5% and U.S. GDP is expected to be up 0.2%. Both have shown significant improvement over the fourth quarter of 2020. Key economic indicators continue to support a strong recovery in 2021. Forecasts are moving higher based on 3 factors: first is the progress with the global vaccine rollout; second is a low U.S. inventory to sales ratio, which ran between 1.4 and 1.5 for the 3 years prior to COVID.  It is currently down about 18% from historic averages, at a time when a number of economies are starting to reopen. And third is the passage of the most recent U.S. government stimulus. According to IHS, for the full year, global GDP is now expected to grow 5.3% and U.S. GDP is expected to grow 6.2%.  
In the U.S., full year nominal retail sales are anticipated to grow 11.7% and electronic sales and mail orders, the proxy we use for online sales, are expected to be up 12.7%, following growth of 24.7% in 2020. The outlook for the commercial side of the U.S. economy is also encouraging. Full year industrial production is forecasted to grow 6.5% on a year-over-year basis. We view these projections as favorable for our company and expect the imbalance between market demand and industry capacity to continue, as Carol mentioned.  
Moving to our first quarter performance. Consolidated revenue increased 27% to $22.9 billion. Operating profit totaled $2.9 billion, 164% higher than last year. Consolidated operating margin expanded to 12.9%, which is our best consolidated margin in 18 quarters, and diluted earnings per share was up $2.77, up 141% from the same period last year.  
Now let's take a look at the segments. In U.S. Domestic, our success was due to a combination of our revenue quality initiatives and the impact of our productivity efforts running the network. Average daily volume increased 12.8% year-over-year to a total of 20.4 million packages per day. Additionally, mix continued to be positive. SMB volume growth, including platforms, accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter, reaching 35.6% and accounted for 63% of our total average daily volume increase.  
Both SMBs and our larger customers grew residential shipments across air and ground products. Overall, B2C shipments increased 23.8% year-over-year. Conversely, B2B average daily volume declined 0.6% year-over-year. Health care and automotive remain bright spots and delivered mid-single-digit B2B growth, yet they were unable to offset weakness in other commercial segments.  
Total B2B volume strengthened late in the quarter with March turning positive. For the quarter, U.S. Domestic generated revenue of $14 billion, up 22.3%, driven by average daily volume growth and improvements in revenue per piece. We were extremely pleased with our revenue quality efforts, which were driven by strong SMB average daily volume growth and demand-related surcharges.  
As a result of our actions, reported revenue per piece grew 10.2% year-over-year with ground revenue per piece up 12.5%. Turning to costs. Expenses were up 13.5%. Cost per piece rose 2.2%, driven primarily by 2 factors: our fastest ground ever; and weekend initiatives and planned benefit expense increases. Nando and his team did an outstanding job transitioning the network from fourth quarter peak back into nonpeak operations. This enabled us to control unnecessary cost and make productivity improvements across the network. And building on Carol's comments about reducing accident frequency, our efforts to prevent incidents through additional safety training, technology and analytics enabled lower-than-expected casualty self-insurance costs in the first quarter.  
Most notably in the quarter, revenue growth was significantly above expense growth, which generated positive operating leverage. So in summary, the U.S. Domestic segment delivered $1.5 billion in operating profit, an increase of $1.1 billion or 265% compared to last year, and operating margin expanded to 10.4%.  
Moving over to International. The results were excellent, and our performance demonstrates the flexibility of our network to match global air capacity with demand. Volume growth was very strong, with total average daily volume up 23.1%. We saw growth across customer segments with both larger customers and SMBs growing over 20%. To support outbound Asia demand, we added 25% more flights and even more in terms of capacity because of our 747-8 capabilities.  
Asia export volume was up 43%, Europe exports were up 27.7%, and overall, total exports grew 26.2% on a year-over-year basis. B2C average daily volume grew 77.6%, while B2B was up 10.1% driven by the retail, high-tech and automotive sectors. For the quarter, International revenue was up 36.2% to $4.6 billion, with all regions growing revenue over 20%. We generated strong operating leverage in the quarter with revenue per piece up 12.3% and cost per piece up 2.7% year-over-year.  
For the first quarter, International delivered operating profit of $1.1 billion, an increase of 95.5% and operating margin expanded to 23.7%. Looking at Supply Chain and Freight. Revenue increased 34.3% to $4.3 billion, and the segment generated record profit and operating margin. Market demand was elevated and nearly all business units had revenue and profit growth. Forwarding led the way, driven by strong growth on the outbound Asia lane for both air and ocean. And health care activities delivered the highest top and bottom line growth ever. Growth was broad-based from biopharma and biologics as well as implantable medical device and lab customers, all while providing near perfect service during the quarter for COVID-19 vaccine deliveries.  
In the first quarter, Supply Chain and Freight generated operating profit of $395 million and operating margin was 9.2%. Walking through the rest of the income statement. We had $177 million of interest expense. Other pension income was $313 million. And lastly, our effective tax rate came in at 21.6% due to discrete items. Now let's turn to cash and shareowner returns. Our focus on bottom line results drove strong cash flow in the quarter. We generated $4.5 billion in cash from operations, Free cash flow for the period was $3.7 billion, a 130% increase year-over-year. And lastly, so far this year, UPS has distributed $938 million in dividends.  
Moving to our outlook for 2021. We recognize there is still uncertainty ahead related to the pandemic and other factors that could interrupt the recovery, so we are not providing revenue or diluted earnings per share guidance at this time. As Carol mentioned, we expect the sale of UPS Freight to close during the second quarter, and today, we are reaffirming our capital allocation plans. To that end, we still expect capital expenditures to be about $4 billion. We have no plans to repurchase shares at this time, and our effective tax rate for the remainder of the year is expected to be around 23.5%.  
We repaid $1.5 billion of long-term debt maturities in the first quarter. And in early April, we repaid another $1 billion in debt, achieving our 2021 target of $2.5 billion in debt repayment. And lastly, on March 11, the American Rescue Plan Act was signed into law. This law protects certain multiemployer pension plans from becoming insolvent through 2051. And, in turn, eliminates our balance sheet liability for potential coordinating benefits related to the Central States Pension Fund. The passage of the law triggered us to remeasure the UPS IBT Pension plan at current discount rates, which have significantly increased since year-end. The result was a $6.4 billion reduction in our pension liability. Additional information is available in the Appendix section of today's earnings presentation.  
As Carol mentioned, a strong balance sheet is a core UPS principle, and we are absolutely moving in a positive direction. The reduction in pension liability and debt repayments have reduced our long-term obligations by $7.9 billion. Combined with our improving business performance, our leverage ratios have significantly improved.  
In closing, we are laser-focused on executing our strategy and look forward to sharing more with you at our June 9 Investor and Analyst Day. Thank you, and operator, please open the lines."

We're looking forward to the June Investor and Analyst Day, where we will give you much more color on our forward-looking outlook, including what we're doing from a productivity perspective. As we think about productivity, we really want to move away from an event, in other words, a transformation event, to actually a virtuous cycle. And we're starting that, as you see in our results in the first quarter. If you look at our operating performance, we drove productivity in nearly every operating category. 
And when I think about productivity in the business, it's really about packages per hour. We had improvement in packages per hour in our sort, in our feeder, in our hub operations. We saw productivity in our delivery, our route density improved year-on-year, driven in large part by our ORION technology. So we're going to give you a lot more color as to what we're doing to drive productivity in the business at our Investor Day. 
One more comment on productivity, and that relates to nonoperations. Well, you refer to that, Brian, as Transformation 2.0.

You've heard us talk about our better, not bigger framework. And that's really about optimizing the network, and you saw that take hold in the first quarter with over 63% of our average daily volume growth in the United States driven by small- and medium-sized businesses. That was a large contributor to the growth in RPP in the quarter. And when you have a 10% growth in RPP, well, you're going to leverage the bottom line, and we did just that. 
So optimizing the network and leaning in to those opportunities of growth that candidly the revenue quality is better for us, our customers like the offering, the end-to-end network that we present to them. That's really laying the future for our growth going forward. Coupled with health care, those 2 growth opportunities are a winning combination. We saw the same opportunity outside the United States, too, with great SMB growth, 23% in our International business. So optimizing the network, leaning in to those areas of growth that are most attracted to us and winning in those areas certainly was a big part of the value equation, and it will be a big part of the value equation going forward.

And we'll go through the details of this at our June Investor Day but might as well let you know what we're doing because we're increasing our weekend delivery because our customers are demanding that. 
We love our SurePost product. SurePost was about 36% of the ADB growth in the first quarter. But the cool thing about SurePost is that 41% of that product was redirected back into the UPS network, which allows us to get delivery density. So that's a great way to think about how we can grow with Sunday. So we'll be expanding our Sunday deliveries as well. And we really look forward -- we don't have enough time this morning. 
But we really look forward to the June investor conference because we're going to talk to you about how by expanding our network across 7 days, we can actually eliminate some of the lumpiness in the network in the middle of the week. And the lumpiness in the network in the middle of the week is causing some of the productivity deleverage that we see in our business. And if we can flatten out the demand, we can really get some great productivity. So we'll walk you through that algorithm at our June Investor Day."

And our health care business is very nutritive to the overall business. As Brian commented, we had the best top line and bottom line performance ever. We do make money on vaccines, as you can appreciate, principally because of the value-added attributes to the vaccines. UPS Premier is a special label that goes on top of the package. The label has a battery inside. So we can track that package wherever it is throughout our network. We stood up a command center to watch that package wherever it is throughout the network. And these are precious vaccines, and we want to make sure they get to their dosing sites on time and we're able to do that with 99.9% on-time delivery.

And going forward, from a P&L perspective, the P&L benefit, aside from the asset base, we'll see about a $50 million reduced service cost on a quarterly basis going forward.

Joining me today are Carol TomÃ©, our CEO; and Brian Newman, our CFO.  
Before we begin, I want to remind you that some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements within the federal securities laws and address our expectation for the future performance or operating results of our company. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainty, which are described in detail in our 2020 Form 10-K and other reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports, when filed, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the SEC.  
For the first quarter of 2021, GAAP results include a net benefit of $2.4 billion or $2.70 per diluted share, comprised of an after-tax mark-to-market pension benefit of $2.5 billion and an after-tax transformation and other charges of $140 million. The mark-to-market pension benefit was primarily driven by the enactment of the American Rescue Plan Act, the resulting elimination of our balance sheet liability related to the Central States Pension Fund as well as the remeasurement of the UPS IBT Pension Plan at the current discount rate. Together, these reduced our pension liability by $6.4 billion.  
Unless stated otherwise, our comments will refer to adjusted results, which exclude the mark-to-market pension benefit and transformation and other charges. The webcast of today's call, along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website.

We are now more than a year into the COVID-19 pandemic, which drove enormous change to how we all live and conduct business. I want to thank our more than 540,000 UPSers for continuing to deliver what matters",1178,"Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. We are now more than a year into the COVID-19 pandemic, which drove enormous change to how we all live and conduct business. I want to thank our more than 540,000 UPSers for continuing to deliver what matters and for serving our customers, communities and each other.  
Looking at the first quarter. Our results exceeded our expectations, driven by an improving macro environment and great execution by our team. Consolidated revenue in the quarter rose 27% from last year to $22.9 billion, and operating profit grew 164% to $2.9 billion. All of our business segments delivered strong performance in the first quarter.  
We reported record profits and a double-digit operating margin in our U.S. Domestic segment, record first quarter profit in our International segment and record operating profit and operating margin in Supply Chain and Freight. As shown in our results, our team is advancing our customer-first, people-led, innovation-driven strategy under the better, not bigger framework. As we've discussed, customer first is about building capabilities that matter the most to our customers and using those capabilities to capture the best opportunities in the market, like small and medium-sized businesses and health care.  
In the U.S., the improvements we made last year and continue to make this year to speed up our ground network, enhance our digital access program known as DAP and expand weekend operations. Well, these are taking hold. In fact, during the first quarter, we added nearly 150,000 new DAP accounts, and we are well on our way to hitting our $1 billion DAP revenue target by the end of this year. 
Further, in the U.S., total average daily volume growth for SMBs, including our platform businesses, reached an all-time high of 35.6%, outpacing the growth rate of our larger customers for the third consecutive quarter. This mix improvement and certain other revenue quality actions are delivering results with U.S. domestic revenue per piece, up 10.2% in the first quarter.  
Looking at our International segment. We were able to meet elevated customer demand by leveraging the agility of our network. Export volume grew double digits in all regions. Commercial volume increased 10.1% and SMB average daily volume was up 23% in the first quarter, and we see even more opportunity moving ahead as we expand DAP and other solutions to key international markets.  
During the quarter, our Supply Chain and Freight segment responded well to market demands. We are on track to complete the divestiture of our UPS Freight business by the end of this month and we look forward to our new commercial relationship with TFI. Our focus on the customer includes improving the end-to-end experience. In other words, improving the experience from the shipper to the receiver as both our customers. We've identified a number of customer journeys and candidly pain points that we are addressing.  
Let me give you an example. 
Until recently, paying a UPS bill online was a poor customer experience. So we replaced our old homegrown system with a new SaaS application, which we began deploying globally in the first quarter. Once fully implemented, our industry-leading billing solution will make it easy for nearly 2 million global customers to pay and manage their UPS bills. This will be particularly helpful for our SMB customers. Our customer first aspiration is to provide the best digital experience powered by our smart global logistics network. A simplified billing experience is one aspect of this aspiration.  
Another is the digitization that's occurring within our Supply Chain and Freight segment. We are moving from telephone-based quotes to online quoting. This new digital experience is driving simplification across the entire value chain. We'll talk more about our efforts to improve our customers' experiences during our June Investor and Analyst Day.  
We know that our customers place high value on the reliability of the UPS network. That's why we led the market by reinstating our service guarantees for U.S. Next-day Air Services and Worldwide Express Services for all origins and destinations. We intend to be the carrier that shippers and receivers can count on for reliable delivery.  
And as it relates to COVID-19 vaccine, our global expertise, technology and network are enabling us to move vaccines, kits and dry ice over great distances around the world. As of last week, we have delivered more than 1.1 million shipments, about 196 million vaccine doses to about 50 countries and territories and utilized our UPS Premier Service to achieve 99.9% on-time delivery.  
The combination of our efforts to remove friction in the customer experience provide the digital capabilities that matter most and deliver industry-leading service levels are positioning us for future growth. Further, as we've discussed, market demand is outpacing industry supply and we expect this dynamic to continue for the foreseeable future.  
GDP forecasts are being revised higher, economies are reopening and U.S. consumer spending is being boosted by government stimulus programs. This demand/supply imbalance creates an environment where pricing in the industry should remain firm. Brian will cover more of our economic outlook in his remarks.  
People Led is an important part of our strategy. Our success in the first quarter was due to the commitment of our people and the strength of our culture. Every UPSer has a role to play in supporting our customers. We've hired a lot of new UPSers, so we know we need to focus on employee safety and training. In the U.S., we have reimagined our driver safety program by truly taking it on the road. We've created mobile units that can be rapidly deployed across the country. These units provide classroom training and a learning lab within movable trailers. Our mobile training, along with other vehicle safety technologies, are making a difference. So far this year, we've improved auto accident frequency by 2.1% globally. And we will continue to advance our employee safety programs around the world.  
Moving to Innovation Driven. Over the past several years, we have invested in automation, introduced new technology and open new facilities. We are now starting to reap productivity benefits from these investments. The additional flexibility we've gained in the network enables us to be more responsive to changes in demand and be more efficient. In fact, in the first quarter compared to last year, productivity improved in nearly all major operating categories. But we have more to do. We aim to make productivity a virtuous cycle, not just a transformation project.  
We are laser-focused on operational excellence. And we'll share more details about our efforts here during our conference. Let me take a moment to touch on 1 of our 5 core principles, which is maintaining a strong balance sheet and credit rating. We have made great strides in this area by reducing financial leverage and improving shareowners' equity. Brian will share the details on this in a moment. Our strategy is gaining traction and we see even more opportunities ahead. We look forward to sharing the details with you at our upcoming Investor and Analyst Day. And now I'll turn the call over to Brian."
238570,711123569,2259324,"United Parcel Service, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,"Earnings Calls","United Parcel Service, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Carol, and good morning. In my comments today, I will cover 4 areas, starting with macroeconomic trends, then our first quarter results. Next, I'll review cash and shareowner returns. And lastly, I'll wrap up with some comments on our outlook and",1375,"Thanks, Carol, and good morning. In my comments today, I will cover 4 areas, starting with macroeconomic trends, then our first quarter results. Next, I'll review cash and shareowner returns. And lastly, I'll wrap up with some comments on our outlook and the new Pension Reform Law.  
Okay. Let's start with the macro and how it is projected to unfold. Global GDP in the first quarter is expected to finish up 3.5% and U.S. GDP is expected to be up 0.2%. Both have shown significant improvement over the fourth quarter of 2020. Key economic indicators continue to support a strong recovery in 2021. Forecasts are moving higher based on 3 factors: first is the progress with the global vaccine rollout; second is a low U.S. inventory to sales ratio, which ran between 1.4 and 1.5 for the 3 years prior to COVID.  It is currently down about 18% from historic averages, at a time when a number of economies are starting to reopen. And third is the passage of the most recent U.S. government stimulus. According to IHS, for the full year, global GDP is now expected to grow 5.3% and U.S. GDP is expected to grow 6.2%.  
In the U.S., full year nominal retail sales are anticipated to grow 11.7% and electronic sales and mail orders, the proxy we use for online sales, are expected to be up 12.7%, following growth of 24.7% in 2020. The outlook for the commercial side of the U.S. economy is also encouraging. Full year industrial production is forecasted to grow 6.5% on a year-over-year basis. We view these projections as favorable for our company and expect the imbalance between market demand and industry capacity to continue, as Carol mentioned.  
Moving to our first quarter performance. Consolidated revenue increased 27% to $22.9 billion. Operating profit totaled $2.9 billion, 164% higher than last year. Consolidated operating margin expanded to 12.9%, which is our best consolidated margin in 18 quarters, and diluted earnings per share was up $2.77, up 141% from the same period last year.  
Now let's take a look at the segments. In U.S. Domestic, our success was due to a combination of our revenue quality initiatives and the impact of our productivity efforts running the network. Average daily volume increased 12.8% year-over-year to a total of 20.4 million packages per day. Additionally, mix continued to be positive. SMB volume growth, including platforms, accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter, reaching 35.6% and accounted for 63% of our total average daily volume increase.  
Both SMBs and our larger customers grew residential shipments across air and ground products. Overall, B2C shipments increased 23.8% year-over-year. Conversely, B2B average daily volume declined 0.6% year-over-year. Health care and automotive remain bright spots and delivered mid-single-digit B2B growth, yet they were unable to offset weakness in other commercial segments.  
Total B2B volume strengthened late in the quarter with March turning positive. For the quarter, U.S. Domestic generated revenue of $14 billion, up 22.3%, driven by average daily volume growth and improvements in revenue per piece. We were extremely pleased with our revenue quality efforts, which were driven by strong SMB average daily volume growth and demand-related surcharges.  
As a result of our actions, reported revenue per piece grew 10.2% year-over-year with ground revenue per piece up 12.5%. Turning to costs. Expenses were up 13.5%. Cost per piece rose 2.2%, driven primarily by 2 factors: our fastest ground ever; and weekend initiatives and planned benefit expense increases. Nando and his team did an outstanding job transitioning the network from fourth quarter peak back into nonpeak operations. This enabled us to control unnecessary cost and make productivity improvements across the network. And building on Carol's comments about reducing accident frequency, our efforts to prevent incidents through additional safety training, technology and analytics enabled lower-than-expected casualty self-insurance costs in the first quarter.  
Most notably in the quarter, revenue growth was significantly above expense growth, which generated positive operating leverage. So in summary, the U.S. Domestic segment delivered $1.5 billion in operating profit, an increase of $1.1 billion or 265% compared to last year, and operating margin expanded to 10.4%.  
Moving over to International. The results were excellent, and our performance demonstrates the flexibility of our network to match global air capacity with demand. Volume growth was very strong, with total average daily volume up 23.1%. We saw growth across customer segments with both larger customers and SMBs growing over 20%. To support outbound Asia demand, we added 25% more flights and even more in terms of capacity because of our 747-8 capabilities.  
Asia export volume was up 43%, Europe exports were up 27.7%, and overall, total exports grew 26.2% on a year-over-year basis. B2C average daily volume grew 77.6%, while B2B was up 10.1% driven by the retail, high-tech and automotive sectors. For the quarter, International revenue was up 36.2% to $4.6 billion, with all regions growing revenue over 20%. We generated strong operating leverage in the quarter with revenue per piece up 12.3% and cost per piece up 2.7% year-over-year.  
For the first quarter, International delivered operating profit of $1.1 billion, an increase of 95.5% and operating margin expanded to 23.7%. Looking at Supply Chain and Freight. Revenue increased 34.3% to $4.3 billion, and the segment generated record profit and operating margin. Market demand was elevated and nearly all business units had revenue and profit growth. Forwarding led the way, driven by strong growth on the outbound Asia lane for both air and ocean. And health care activities delivered the highest top and bottom line growth ever. Growth was broad-based from biopharma and biologics as well as implantable medical device and lab customers, all while providing near perfect service during the quarter for COVID-19 vaccine deliveries.  
In the first quarter, Supply Chain and Freight generated operating profit of $395 million and operating margin was 9.2%. Walking through the rest of the income statement. We had $177 million of interest expense. Other pension income was $313 million. And lastly, our effective tax rate came in at 21.6% due to discrete items. Now let's turn to cash and shareowner returns. Our focus on bottom line results drove strong cash flow in the quarter. We generated $4.5 billion in cash from operations, Free cash flow for the period was $3.7 billion, a 130% increase year-over-year. And lastly, so far this year, UPS has distributed $938 million in dividends.  
Moving to our outlook for 2021. We recognize there is still uncertainty ahead related to the pandemic and other factors that could interrupt the recovery, so we are not providing revenue or diluted earnings per share guidance at this time. As Carol mentioned, we expect the sale of UPS Freight to close during the second quarter, and today, we are reaffirming our capital allocation plans. To that end, we still expect capital expenditures to be about $4 billion. We have no plans to repurchase shares at this time, and our effective tax rate for the remainder of the year is expected to be around 23.5%.  
We repaid $1.5 billion of long-term debt maturities in the first quarter. And in early April, we repaid another $1 billion in debt, achieving our 2021 target of $2.5 billion in debt repayment. And lastly, on March 11, the American Rescue Plan Act was signed into law. This law protects certain multiemployer pension plans from becoming insolvent through 2051. And, in turn, eliminates our balance sheet liability for potential coordinating benefits related to the Central States Pension Fund. The passage of the law triggered us to remeasure the UPS IBT Pension plan at current discount rates, which have significantly increased since year-end. The result was a $6.4 billion reduction in our pension liability. Additional information is available in the Appendix section of today's earnings presentation.  
As Carol mentioned, a strong balance sheet is a core UPS principle, and we are absolutely moving in a positive direction. The reduction in pension liability and debt repayments have reduced our long-term obligations by $7.9 billion. Combined with our improving business performance, our leverage ratios have significantly improved.  
In closing, we are laser-focused on executing our strategy and look forward to sharing more with you at our June 9 Investor and Analyst Day. Thank you, and operator, please open the lines."

We're looking forward to the June Investor and Analyst Day, where we will give you much more color on our forward-looking outlook, including what we're doing from a productivity perspective. As we think about productivity, we really want to move away from an event, in other words, a transformation event, to actually a virtuous cycle. And we're starting that, as you see in our results in the first quarter. If you look at our operating performance, we drove productivity in nearly every operating category. 
And when I think about productivity in the business, it's really about packages per hour. We had improvement in packages per hour in our sort, in our feeder, in our hub operations. We saw productivity in our delivery, our route density improved year-on-year, driven in large part by our ORION technology. So we're going to give you a lot more color as to what we're doing to drive productivity in the business at our Investor Day. 
One more comment on productivity, and that relates to nonoperations. Well, you refer to that, Brian, as Transformation 2.0. And at the beginning of the year, we told you we were taking out $500 million of expense in our non-operations area. We're well-down the path in that regard. We are on plan, and we will deliver that result by the end of the year."

You've heard us talk about our better, not bigger framework. And that's really about optimizing the network, and you saw that take hold in the first quarter with over 63% of our average daily volume growth in the United States driven by small- and medium-sized businesses. That was a large contributor to the growth in RPP in the quarter. And when you have a 10% growth in RPP, well, you're going to leverage the bottom line, and we did just that. 
So optimizing the network and leaning in to those opportunities of growth that candidly the revenue quality is better for us, our customers like the offering, the end-to-end network that we present to them. That's really laying the future for our growth going forward. Coupled with health care, those 2 growth opportunities are a winning combination. We saw the same opportunity outside the United States, too, with great SMB growth, 23% in our International business. So optimizing the network, leaning in to those areas of growth that are most attracted to us and winning in those areas certainly was a big part of the value equation, and it will be a big part of the value equation going forward.

And we'll go through the details of this at our June Investor Day but might as well let you know what we're doing because we're increasing our weekend delivery because our customers are demanding that. 
We love our SurePost product. SurePost was about 36% of the ADB growth in the first quarter. But the cool thing about SurePost is that 41% of that product was redirected back into the UPS network, which allows us to get delivery density. So that's a great way to think about how we can grow with Sunday. So we'll be expanding our Sunday deliveries as well. And we really look forward -- we don't have enough time this morning. 
But we really look forward to the June investor conference because we're going to talk to you about how by expanding our network across 7 days, we can actually eliminate some of the lumpiness in the network in the middle of the week. And the lumpiness in the network in the middle of the week is causing some of the productivity deleverage that we see in our business. And if we can flatten out the demand, we can really get some great productivity. So we'll walk you through that algorithm at our June Investor Day."

Internationally, we actually posted plus 10% on the B2B side in the first quarter.

And if I look at those large enterprise accounts, which we very much appreciate the relationship we have with those customers, they were very growthy. In the first quarter, they grew mid-teens. So that's very growthy compared to what we were up against. So we will continue to invest in that experience as well. But we're really looking at an end-to-end experience and have discovered 16 customer journeys where we can, based on customer feedback, where we can make improvements and based on those improvements, get stickiness with those customers. And those customer journeys are as true for our SMB customers as they are for our enterprise customers. And we'll talk more about that at our June Investor Day."

Joining me today are Carol Tome, our CEO; and Brian Newman, our CFO.
Before we begin, I want to remind you that some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements within the federal securities laws and address our expectation for the future performance or operating results of our company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in our 2020 Form 10-K, subsequently filed Form 10-Qs and other reports that we file with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports, when filed, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from SEC.
For the second quarter 2021, GAAP results include after-tax transformation and other charges of $11 million or $0.01 per diluted share. Also in the second quarter, on April 30, we closed on the sale of UPS Freight, which triggered remeasurement of certain of our pension and postretirement benefit plans. The remeasurement resulted in a $2.1 billion reduction in pension and postretirement benefit obligations on our balance sheet, primarily due to higher discount rates. The vast majority of the remeasurement impact fell within the corridor. So the impact to GAAP net income was negligible at approximately $3 million.
Unless stated otherwise, our comments will refer to adjusted results, which exclude transformation and other charges. The webcast of today's call, along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures, is available on the UPS Investor Relations website.
Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions from those joining us via the teleconference. [Operator Instructions]

Our better, not bigger framework, is enabling consistently high service levels and producing improved financial results. Our team is truly moving our role forward by delivering what matters.
More specifically, we are winning in the most attractive parts of the markets with new capabilities like our fastest ground ever weekend initiatives and improvements in our customer experience journeys. We are continuing to deliver life-saving COVID-19 vaccines, and our health care growth initiative is gaining momentum. We are also driving sustainable revenue per piece growth through targeted revenue quality strategies. And lastly, we are driving productivity improvements in the network and implementing targeted transformational expense reductions. Our second quarter financial results across all segments were much better than we anticipated.
Consolidated revenue in the quarter rose 14.5% from last year to $23.4 billion, and operating profit grew 40.8% to $3.3 billion. As we expected, U.S. average daily volume for the quarter was down slightly from 1 year ago, driven primarily by tough comparisons due to the jump in e-commerce-related volume last year, but our revenue quality in the U.S. was much improved due to a change in customer mix as well as our revenue quality strategies. All of our business segments delivered record quarterly operating profit and expanded operating margins on a year-over-year basis.
In the U.S., operating margin was 11.6%, our highest second quarter operating margin since 2017. In the International segment, operating profit increased 41.3% and operating margin reached a record 24.7%. And in Supply Chain Solutions, continued strength in freight forwarding and health care drove operating margin of 9.7%, a record for the segment. While we closely monitor external factors, like the tight labor market and low inventory levels, the execution of our initiatives has put us well on our way to achieving the high end of our 2023 financial targets. Brian will share more details with you during his remarks.
Moving to our customer-first, people-led, innovation-driven strategy, we strive to provide our customers with the best digital experience, powered by our global Smart Logistics Network. Customer-first is about creating a frictionless customer experience and building the capabilities that matter the most to our customers.
During the second quarter, Saturday ground delivery volume grew 13% as we continued expanding our weekend coverage. This is an example of better, not bigger, as we are expanding service with very little capital spending. We are currently halfway through our efforts to expand our existing centers and turn on Saturday operations in more than 200 additional centers. By the end of October of this year, we will cover about 90% of the U.S. population on Saturdays, which will further extend our market-leading Saturday commercial delivery and pickup services and support our ongoing Sunday delivery services. These improvements benefit all of our customers, large and small, by enabling faster time in transit and expanding capacity.
As we execute our strategy, our focus is on growing value share. We are changing the growth targets of the company and are no longer focused solely on volume growth. Instead, we are creating new capabilities and leveraging our competitive advantages to grow revenue and profits from the most attractive parts of the market like SMB, B2B, health care and international, while at the same time, providing value and service to targeted large enterprise customers.
It's early days, but we believe our strategy is working. For example, in the U.S., we grew SMB average daily volume, including platforms, by 21.6% and we saw a total U.S. revenue per piece increased by 13.4%. As you know, health care is one of our wildly important customer-first initiatives. In the second quarter, health care accounted revenue on a global basis grew 19.8% and contributed to margin expansion in all 3 segments. To grow in the health care sector, we are creating new capabilities like our recent launch of UPS Cold Chain Solutions, and we're deploying sophisticated solutions that customers want into new geographies like the expansion of UPS Premier to Canada and Europe. These actions are advancing our leadership position in the global health care logistics market.
To support growth in our International segment, we continue to invest broadly, including the launch of our first-ever daily flight from Osaka to Shenzhen, thus significantly speeding up our time and transit across multiple trade lines. We are also improving the customer experience across 16 journeys to make them simpler and more helpful. One of the customer pain points we are addressing is claims. We recently completed a successful pilot that shortened the average claim processing time from 20 days to 5. The improvements we made resulted in a 1.9% reduction in churn among pilot participants. We are rolling out our new claims process to all U.S. SMB customers over the next 12 months.
To put this into perspective, every 1 percentage point reduction in U.S. SMB churn is worth about $170 million in annual revenue. Moving to the people-like component of our strategy, our focus here is to make UPS a great place to work so that our people feel confident recommending UPS to others. During the second quarter, our executive leadership team spent many days in our operations around the world, delivering packages, walking our facilities and talking with our people. When we visit, we don't take a list, we bring back a list of the action we can take to simplify our processes, drive productivity and improve the quality of the work environment for our people. I cannot say enough about the commitment of UPSers who, over the last year, rose to meet the challenges of elevated volume, while ensuring great service to our customers day in and day out.
I'd like to recognize our 38,000 part-time management employees in the U.S. that work primarily in our preload, hub, sort and air operations. In appreciation of their extraordinary efforts, we provided them with a onetime financial award in the second quarter. People-led builds on a strong foundation, and we will continue living our values, modernizing our policies and rewarding our people to make UPS an even better place to work and employer of choice.
Turning to Innovation Driven. Our disciplined approach to capital allocation is generating significant levels of free cash flow. In fact, in the first 6 months of this year, we generated $6.8 billion in free cash flow. This is a record. We've generated more free cash flow in the first 6 months of this year than we previously generated in any full year at any time in our company's history.
Also in the second quarter, we completed the divestiture of UPS Freight, a capital-intensive, low returning part of our business. This and other actions have greatly improved our financial condition from 1 year ago, as Brian will detail. And looking ahead, we expect to see a significant increase in our return on invested capital this year. Innovation-driven will also help us reach carbon neutrality by 2050. In August, we will publish our annual sustainability reports, which include our 19th GRI content index, along with our second Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, or SASB report, and our first Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, or TCFD report. Social and environmental stewardship goes right to our core values, and we remain committed to providing investors transparency through our expanded ESG disclosures.
Next month, UPS will celebrate our 114th anniversary. It is such an honor for me to guide this company through our next chapter. We are a purpose-driven company, and we are investing in the capabilities that matter most to our customers to create value for our shareowners. Thank you.
And now I'll turn the call over to Brian."
238570,711280527,2351444,"United Parcel Service, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2021",2021-07-27,"Earnings Calls","United Parcel Service, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Carol, and good morning. In my comments today, I will cover 4 areas, starting with macroeconomic trends, then our second quarter results. Next, I'll review cash and shareowner returns. And lastly, I'll wrap up with some comments on our outlook.O",1862,"Thanks, Carol, and good morning. In my comments today, I will cover 4 areas, starting with macroeconomic trends, then our second quarter results. Next, I'll review cash and shareowner returns. And lastly, I'll wrap up with some comments on our outlook.
Okay. Let's start with the macro. All major economic indicators remain strong, with the economic recovery progressing faster than expected. In the second quarter, looking at IHS forecast, global GDP is expected to finish up 10.6% and U.S. GDP is expected to be up 12.5%. However, robust economic growth and high consumer demand is putting pressure on global supply chains and inventory replenishment. In fact, the U.S. inventory to sales ratio declined further from the figure I shared last quarter and was 1.09 in June.
As a point of reference, for the 3 years prior to COVID, this ratio ran between 1.4 and 1.5.  For the full year, global GDP is now expected to grow 5.8% and U.S. GDP is expected to grow 6.6%. Accordingly, as we look at the back half of the year, while economic growth is forecast to remain positive, the rate of growth slows.
Moving to our second quarter consolidated performance. We delivered double-digit top and bottom line growth. Consolidated revenue increased 14.5% to $23.4 billion. Consolidated operating profit totaled $3.3 billion, 40.8% higher than last year. And I'll note that this is the first time UPS has generated quarterly operating profit over $3 billion. Consolidated operating margin expanded to 14%, which was 260 basis points above last year. And diluted earnings per share was $3.06, up 43.7% from the same period last year.
Now let's take a look at the segments. In U.S. domestic, our mix improvement and other revenue quality initiatives as well as productivity efforts continue to drive strong results. As expected, last year's surge in essential goods delivered to homes created tough comparisons on a year-over-year basis. As a result, total average daily volume in the U.S. in the second quarter of this year was down 619,000 pieces per day or 2.9% due to a decline in SurePost volume of 1.3 million packages per day. The decline in SurePost volume was partially offset by double-digit percentage growth in ground, commercial and next-day air volume.
The unique year-over-year comparisons were also visible in our volume mix. B2C average daily volume was down 15.8% year-over-year. Conversely, B2B volume increased 25.7%. All industry sectors grew B2B volume, led by retail as more foot traffic returned to the brick-and-mortar locations. In fact, B2B retail posted its first year-over-year increase in volumes since 2019, and health care remained a bright spot with B2B volume up 28.6%. 
Customer mix continued to be positive as our network enhancements drove SMB volume growth, including platforms of 21.6%. And in the second quarter, SMB made up 27.2% of U.S. domestic volume. For the quarter, U.S. domestic generated revenue of $14.4 billion, up 10.2%, driven by a record 13.4% increase in revenue per piece with fuel driving 220 basis points of the revenue per piece growth rate. We are pleased with the progress of our revenue quality efforts. The combination of base rate increases, surcharges and mix improvements generated double-digit revenue per piece percentage increases in our next-day air and ground products.
Turning to costs. Total expense grew 7.3%, driven by 3 main areas. First, fuel represented 220 basis points of the increase. Second, were the enhancements to speed up our network and expand weekend operations, which accounted for around 200 basis points of the total expense increase. And finally, another 210 basis points came from an increase in employee benefit expenses as more employees became eligible for health, welfare and retirement benefits and from the reinstatement of the federal excise tax.
Looking at efficiencies. We continue to see productivity improvements within package and inside operations. In fact, direct labor hours were down 1.4%, which includes a double-digit percentage reduction in overtime hours. Most notably in the quarter, revenue growth was significantly above expense growth, which generated positive operating leverage.
In summary, the U.S. Domestic segment delivered $1.7 billion in operating profit, an increase of $460 million or 37.9% compared to last year, and operating margin expanded 230 basis points.
Moving to international. The segment delivered another quarter of record operating profit. Total average daily volume was up 12.7%. B2B volume grew 25% on a year-over-year basis, with growth across all industries and customer segments. Conversely, B2C volume was down 4.1%. These year-over-year comparisons reflect the unique pandemic effects from last year as B2C volume doubled in the second quarter of 2020.
Total export average daily volume was up 14% on a year-over-year basis with all regions, except Asia posting double-digit growth. Asia export volume faced difficult comps and was down 5.8% compared to the remarkable growth rate of 46.8% in the second quarter of last year, driven by the surge of PPE.
For the quarter, international revenue was up 30% to $4.8 billion, with all major regions growing revenue by double-digit percentages. We generated positive operating leverage in the quarter. Revenue per piece was up 15.5%, including a 530 basis point benefit from the fuel surcharge. And cost per piece was up 12.4%, including a 570 basis point impact from higher fuel costs.
In the second quarter, International delivered operating profit of $1.2 billion, an increase of 41.3% and operating margin expanded to 24.7%. Our strategy in the International segment is absolutely driving value share and growth from the best parts of the market. As Scott Price shared in June, we are underpenetrated in almost all geographies around the world. So we see tremendous potential as we continue executing our wildly important initiatives internationally.
Now looking at Supply Chain Solutions. Revenue increased 14.3% to $4.2 billion, and the segment generated record profit and operating margin. Market demand was elevated and revenue growth in our major business categories more than offset the revenue impact from the sale of UPS Freight, which closed on April 30.
Looking at operating profit. In forwarding, our Ocean Freight product more than doubled its operating profit on a year-over-year basis, driven by strong inventory replenishment demand. And in health care, our clinical trials, along with cell and gene solutions, again delivered record top and bottom line results.
In the second quarter, Supply Chain Solutions generated operating profit of $408 million, and the operating margin was 9.7%. We are extremely pleased with our performance in this segment. We have moved the needle on operating margin, where over the past 5 years, operating margin has averaged 6.6%. 
Walking through the rest of the income statement, we had $167 million of interest expense. Other pension income was $302 million. And lastly, our effective tax rate came in at 22.1%, which was lower than last year due to discrete items. 
Now let's turn to cash on the balance sheet. We are generating strong cash flow from our disciplined focus on capital allocation and bottom line results. For the first 6 months of the year, we generated $8.5 billion in cash from operations and $6.8 billion in free cash flow. Also in the second quarter, the sale of UPS Freight triggered remeasurement of certain U.S. pension and postretirement plans, which resulted in a reduction in our net pension liability of $2.1 billion on our balance sheet, primarily due to higher discount rates. GAAP income only benefited by about $3 million because the vast majority of the gains fell within the corridor.
As Carol mentioned, our financial condition has greatly improved. A strong balance sheet is a core UPS principle. And since the end of 2020, we have reduced our pension liability and outstanding debt by $10.2 billion, bringing our debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 2.1. And lastly, so far this year, UPS has distributed $1.7 billion in dividends.
Moving to our outlook. I'll cover both the second half of 2021 and the full year. First, we expect market conditions to remain favorable and our initiatives to continue delivering positive results in our business. We are also paying close attention to several external factors, including the Delta variant of COVID-19, inflationary pressures, the U.S. inventory to sales ratio and consumer spending preferences. Nonetheless, we expect our revenue quality efforts to cover known expense pressures and we are on track to meet our 2021 nonoperating savings target of $500 million.
On a consolidated basis, we expect second half 2021 revenue growth of around 5.4% year-over-year, which takes into account the divestiture of UPS Freight, tough comparisons from last year and our revenue quality initiatives. We expect the second half 2021 consolidated operating margin of around 12%. 
In U.S. Domestic, we anticipate back half 2021 revenue growth of about 8.2%, with revenue growing faster than volume. Operating margin should be around 9.2%. Operating margin in the back half of the year is expected to be lower than what we reported in the first half due to 3 factors: First is higher compensation expense from our contractual labor increase, which goes into effect each year in August. Second, we have made targeted hourly rate adjustments in certain geographies to remain competitive in the market. And as usual, lower-margin enterprise and B2C volume will represent a larger percentage of our total volume due to peak. Pulling it all together, we now expect full year 2021 U.S. operating margin to be approximately 10.1%. 
In the International segment, for the second half of 2021, we anticipate year-over-year average daily volume growth from Europe to be in the mid-single digits. In addition, we expect Asia outbound volume to remain elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels. As a result, we expect revenue growth around 10.7%, with an operating margin of about 22.9%. 
In the Supply Chain Solutions segment, in the second half of this year, we expect freight forwarding and health care to continue to lead the segment. We anticipate total revenue in the segment will decline around 9.6%, due to the sale of UPS Freight. However, we expect operating profit growth of around 8.1% and an operating margin of about 9.1%. 
Moving to the full year. In 2021, we expect consolidated operating margin of approximately 12.7% and return on invested capital of approximately 28%. We expect capital expenditures to be about $4 billion. And in April, we repaid $1 billion in debt and have achieved our 2021 target of $2.55 billion in debt repayment.
We have no plans to repurchase shares in 2021 at this time. But given the strong free cash flow and further reductions to our pension liabilities, we continue to evaluate the option to repurchase shares later this year. And lastly, our effective tax rate for the remainder of the year is now expected to be around 23%. Looking out to 2023, the current economic outlook, coupled with the early results from our revenue quality and productivity initiatives, is putting us well on our way to achieving the high end of our 2023 targets.
In closing, we are laser-focused on executing our strategy under the better, not bigger framework, and leaning into the best market opportunities to improve the financial performance of the company, provide the best customer experience and benefit our shareowners.

And we're leaning into those packages and those customers that value our end-to-end network.

We've been talking to our large customers about what they're seeing in their business. And interestingly, 1 large brick-and-mortar customer told us they have 50 containers second to port. And until those containers can get into their warehouses and into their stores, it's hard to sell. So there's a bit of an uncertainty out there, but we kind of control what we are going to control. And we shared this back half view with you because we thought you should know what we're seeing and what we're thinking about our business.
On the balance sheet question, I mean, gosh, from where we were a year ago, the financial condition of our company has greatly improved. Even from the end of the year, it's greatly improved, with our debt and pension liabilities down $10 billion from the end of the year. And having a strong financial condition lets us all sleep well at night so that we can lean into our customer experience and do the right thing for our people, for our communities and for our customers.
As we think about our strategic opportunities ahead, we are opportunity-rich. And so we're going to continue to lean into those 16 customer journeys that we've talked to you about because we really think by improving the end-to-end experience, we get stickiness with our customers and can grow that value share that we are seeking to grow.
Could there be a capability that we might want to acquire to enable or speed up those journeys? Perhaps. But we're not seeing here building a large M&A war chest, if you will. In fact, we're just going to try to run the best business that we can.
Now we do believe that cash belongs to the shareowners and not to us. We told you that at the beginning or at the end of this year, if you will, we have a new dividend payout target, which is 50% of earnings. So based on the guidance that Brian has shared with you today, that could imply a fairly nice use of cash when we announced that new dividend. We are also looking at reentering the share repurchase market. This is something that we discussed with our Board every quarter. We have a Board meeting next week.

We need to hire a lot of people for peak. And I'm happy to say that even in the face of this tight labor market, we are ahead of where we were a year ago. And Nando and his team are just managing this on a day-to-day basis. And just as it relates to peak, our peak planning is well underway. The good news is, from an operating perspective, we have 1 additional operating day this year, which helps us. We are lining up aircraft that we need to lease to manage the volume.

And I think the margin -- the spreads get a bit tighter. I laid out the -- what our assumptions were in the back half of the year. So there's still positive leverage.

We still got plenty of room to go, as I mentioned, on the rate renegotiation. On the cost piece, we're looking at bigger ticket items to change the game. So Nando and his team are thinking about. They're doing the blocking and tackling every day, but how do we take on a few initiatives in that much bigger cost bucket? Non-ops we're making good progress.

Now the cost runway, it takes a little longer to get after. So we're still catching up with some of the initiatives taking hold from an operations and a cost perspective, that will have a longer tail to it. And then we're well on the journey in terms of getting a playbook. I would say the piece on RPP that still needs sort of revenue that still needs to catch up would be the dynamic pricing that relies on technology. So that's the next chapter on the revenue side.

So all of our consuming applications go into 1 clean data pool that will make it so much easier our revenue leaders and our sales leaders to manage the business.
The same is true for costs, right? So this is a pretty exciting initiative that we have underway and then you layer technology on top of that. The technology piece is not the heavy lift the data, is the head of lift. But that initiative is well underway. And in terms of the demand supply capacity challenge, it has gotten a little it better because people have added capacity. As you would expect, we're adding capacity, so our competitors.
So it's still an interesting environment for sure. And as we work with our customers, we want to ensure that we meet their needs. So we're sitting down with -- there are about 300 customers who make up that peak volume surge, and we're sitting down with each of them, understanding what their projections, what their promotions are, how are they thinking about the holiday season and really trying to work with them so that we provide to them the same outstanding and excellent service that we gave to them last year.

And the reaction was, ""No, it won't, can't possibly do it."" And in fact, Brian, we are increasing the operating margin in the U.S. by 240 basis points.

Joining me today are Carol Tome, our CEO; and Brian Newman, our CFO.
Before we begin, I want to remind you that some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements within the federal securities laws and address our expectation for the future performance or operating results of our company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in our 2020 Form 10-K, subsequently filed Form 10-Qs and other reports that we file with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports, when filed, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the SEC.
For the second quarter of 2021, GAAP results include after-tax transformation and other charges of $11 million or $0.01 per diluted share. Also in the second quarter, on April 30, we closed on the sale of UPS Freight, which triggered remeasurement of certain of our pension and postretirement benefit plans. The remeasurement resulted in a $2.1 billion reduction in pension and postretirement benefit obligations on our balance sheet, primarily due to higher discount rates. The vast majority of the remeasurement impact fell within the corridor. So the impact to GAAP net income was negligible at approximately $3 million.
Unless stated otherwise, our comments will refer to adjusted results, which exclude transformation and other charges. The webcast of today's call, along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures, is available on the UPS Investor Relations website.
Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions from those joining us via the teleconference.

Our better, not bigger framework, is enabling consistently high service levels and producing improved financial results. Our team is truly moving our role forward by delivering what matters.
More specifically, we are winning in the most attractive parts of the markets with new capabilities, like our fastest ground ever weekend initiatives and improvements in our customer experience journeys. We are continuing to deliver life-saving COVID-19 vaccines, and our healthcare growth initiative is gaining momentum. We are also driving sustainable revenue per piece growth through targeted revenue quality strategies. And lastly, we are driving productivity improvements in the network and implementing targeted transformational expense reductions. Our second quarter financial results across all segments were much better than we anticipated.
Consolidated revenue in the quarter rose 14.5% from last year to $23.4 billion, and operating profit grew 40.8% to $3.3 billion. As we expected, U.S. average daily volume for the quarter was down slightly from 1 year ago, driven primarily by tough comparisons due to the jump in e-commerce-related volume last year, but our revenue quality in the U.S. was much improved due to a change in customer mix as well as our revenue quality strategies. All of our business segments delivered record quarterly operating profit and expanded operating margins on a year-over-year basis.
In the U.S., operating margin was 11.6%, our highest second quarter operating margin since 2017. In the International segment, operating profit increased 41.3% and operating margin reached a record 24.7%. And in Supply Chain Solutions, continued strength in freight forwarding and healthcare drove operating margin of 9.7%, a record for the segment. While we closely monitor external factors, like the tight labor market and low inventory levels, the execution of our initiatives has put us well on our way to achieving the high end of our 2023 financial targets. Brian will share more details with you during his remarks.
Moving to our Customer First, People Led, Innovation Driven strategy, we strive to provide our customers with the best digital experience, powered by our global Smart Logistics Network. Customer First is about creating a frictionless customer experience and building the capabilities that matter the most to our customers.
During the second quarter, Saturday Ground delivery volume grew 13%, as we continued expanding our weekend coverage. This is an example of better, not bigger, as we are expanding service with very little capital spending. We are currently halfway through our efforts to expand our existing centers and turn on Saturday operations in more than 200 additional centers. 
By the end of October of this year, we will cover about 90% of the U.S. population on Saturdays, which will further extend our market-leading Saturday commercial delivery and pickup services and support our ongoing Sunday delivery services. These improvements benefit all of our customers, large and small, by enabling faster time in transit and expanding capacity.
As we execute our strategy, our focus is on growing value share. We are changing the growth targets of the company and are no longer focused solely on volume growth. Instead, we are creating new capabilities and leveraging our competitive advantages to grow revenue and profits from the most attractive parts of the market like SMB, B2B, healthcare and international, while at the same time providing value and service to targeted large enterprise customers.
It's early days, but we believe our strategy is working. For example, in the U.S., we grew SMB average daily volume, including platforms, by 21.6%, and we saw a total U.S. revenue per piece increased by 13.4%. As you know, healthcare is one of our wildly important Customer First initiatives. In the second quarter, healthcare customer revenue on a global basis grew 19.8% and contributed to margin expansion in all 3 segments. 
To grow in the healthcare sector, we are creating new capabilities like our recent launch of UPS Cold Chain Solutions. And we're deploying sophisticated solutions that customers want into new geographies like the expansion of UPS Premier to Canada and Europe. These actions are advancing our leadership position in the global healthcare logistics market.
To support growth in our International segment, we continue to invest broadly, including the launch of our first-ever daily flight from Osaka to Shenzhen, thus significantly speeding up our time and transit across multiple trade lines. We are also improving the customer experience across 16 journeys to make them simpler and more helpful. One of the customer pain points we are addressing is claims.
We recently completed a successful pilot that shortened the average claim processing time from 20 days to 5. The improvements we made resulted in a 1.9% reduction in churn among pilot participants. We are rolling out our new claims process to all U.S. SMB customers over the next 12 months.
To put this into perspective, every 1 percentage point reduction in U.S. SMB churn is worth about $170 million in annual revenue. Moving to the People Led component of our strategy, our focus here is to make UPS a great place to work so that our people feel confident recommending UPS to others. During the second quarter, our executive leadership team spent many days in our operations around the world, delivering packages, walking our facilities and talking with our people. 
When we visit, we don't take a list, we bring back a list of the actions we can take to simplify our processes, drive productivity and improve the quality of the work environment for our people. I cannot say enough about the commitment of UPSers who, over the last year, rose to meet the challenges of elevated volume, while ensuring great service to our customers day in and day out.
I'd like to recognize our 38,000 part-time management employees in the U.S. that work primarily in our preload, hub, sort and air operations. In appreciation of their extraordinary efforts, we provided them with a onetime financial award in the second quarter. People Led builds on a strong foundation, and we will continue living our values, modernizing our policies and rewarding our people to make UPS an even better place to work and employer of choice.
Turning to Innovation Driven. Our disciplined approach to capital allocation is generating significant levels of free cash flow. In fact, in the first 6 months of this year, we generated $6.8 billion in free cash flow. This is a record. We've generated more free cash flow in the first 6 months of this year than we previously generated in any full year at any time in our company's history.
Also in the second quarter, we completed the divestiture of UPS Freight, a capital-intensive, low returning part of our business. This and other actions have greatly improved our financial condition from 1 year ago, as Brian will detail. And looking ahead, we expect to see a significant increase in our return on invested capital this year. 
Innovation Driven will also help us reach carbon neutrality by 2050. In August, we will publish our annual sustainability reports, which include our 19th GRI content index, along with our second Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, or SASB report, and our first Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, or TCFD report. Social and environmental stewardship goes right to our core values, and we remain committed to providing investors transparency through our expanded ESG disclosures.
Next month, UPS will celebrate our 114th anniversary. It is such an honor for me to guide this company through our next chapter. We are a purpose-driven company, and we are investing in the capabilities that matter most to our customers to create value for our shareowners. Thank you.
And now I'll turn the call over to Brian."
238570,711280527,2351792,"United Parcel Service, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2021",2021-07-27,"Earnings Calls","United Parcel Service, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Carol, and good morning. In my comments today, I will cover four areas, starting with macroeconomic trends, then our second quarter results. Next, I'll review cash and shareowner returns. And lastly, I'll wrap up with some comments on our outlook.",1861,"Thanks, Carol, and good morning. In my comments today, I will cover four areas, starting with macroeconomic trends, then our second quarter results. Next, I'll review cash and shareowner returns. And lastly, I'll wrap up with some comments on our outlook.
Okay. Let's start with the macro. All major economic indicators remain strong, with the economic recovery progressing faster than expected. In the second quarter, looking at IHS forecast, global GDP is expected to finish up 10.6% and U.S. GDP is expected to be up 12.5%. However, robust economic growth and high consumer demand is putting pressure on global supply chains and inventory replenishment. In fact, the U.S. inventory to sales ratio declined further from the figure I shared last quarter and was 1.09 in June.
As a point of reference, for the 3 years prior to COVID, this ratio ran between 1.4 and 1.5.  For the full year, global GDP is now expected to grow 5.8% and U.S. GDP is expected to grow 6.6%. Accordingly, as we look at the back half of the year, while economic growth is forecast to remain positive, the rate of growth slows.
Moving to our second quarter consolidated performance. We delivered double-digit top and bottom line growth. Consolidated revenue increased 14.5% to $23.4 billion. Consolidated operating profit totaled $3.3 billion, 40.8% higher than last year. And I'll note that this is the first time UPS has generated quarterly operating profit over $3 billion. Consolidated operating margin expanded to 14%, which was 260 basis points above last year. And diluted earnings per share was $3.06, up 43.7% from the same period last year.
Now let's take a look at the segments. In U.S. domestic, our mix improvement and other revenue quality initiatives as well as productivity efforts continue to drive strong results. As expected, last year's surge in essential goods delivered to homes created tough comparisons on a year-over-year basis. 
As a result, total average daily volume in the U.S. in the second quarter of this year was down 619,000 pieces per day or 2.9% due to a decline in SurePost volume of 1.3 million packages per day. The decline in SurePost volume was partially offset by double-digit percentage growth in Ground commercial and Next Day Air volume.
The unique year-over-year comparisons were also visible in our volume mix. B2C average daily volume was down 15.8% year-over-year. Conversely, B2B volume increased 25.7%. All industry sectors grew B2B volume, led by retail as more foot traffic returned to the brick-and-mortar locations. In fact, B2B retail posted its first year-over-year increase in volumes since 2019. And healthcare remained a bright spot with B2B volume up 28.6%. 
Customer mix continued to be positive as our network enhancements drove SMB volume growth, including platforms of 21.6%. And in the second quarter, SMB made up 27.2% of U.S. domestic volume. For the quarter, U.S. domestic generated revenue of $14.4 billion, up 10.2%, driven by a record 13.4% increase in revenue per piece with fuel driving 220 basis points of the revenue per piece growth rate. We are pleased with the progress of our revenue quality efforts. The combination of base rate increases, surcharges and mix improvements generated double-digit revenue per piece percentage increases in our Next Day Air and Ground products.
Turning to costs. Total expense grew 7.3%, driven by three main areas. First, fuel represented 220 basis points of the increase. Second, were the enhancements to speed up our network and expand weekend operations, which accounted for around 200 basis points of the total expense increase. And finally, another 210 basis points came from an increase in employee benefit expenses, as more employees became eligible for health, welfare and retirement benefits and from the reinstatement of the federal excise tax.
Looking at efficiencies. We continue to see productivity improvements within package and inside operations. In fact, direct labor hours were down 1.4%, which includes a double-digit percentage reduction in overtime hours. Most notably in the quarter, revenue growth was significantly above expense growth, which generated positive operating leverage.
In summary, the U.S. Domestic segment delivered $1.7 billion in operating profit, an increase of $460 million or 37.9% compared to last year, and operating margin expanded 230 basis points.
Moving to international. The segment delivered another quarter of record operating profit. Total average daily volume was up 12.7%. B2B volume grew 25% on a year-over-year basis, with growth across all industries and customer segments. Conversely, B2C volume was down 4.1%. These year-over-year comparisons reflect the unique pandemic effects from last year, as B2C volume doubled in the second quarter of 2020.
Total export average daily volume was up 14% on a year-over-year basis with all regions, except Asia posting double-digit growth. Asia export volume faced difficult comps and was down 5.8% compared to the remarkable growth rate of 46.8% in the second quarter of last year, driven by the surge of PPE.
For the quarter, International revenue was up 30% to $4.8 billion, with all major regions growing revenue by double-digit percentages. We generated positive operating leverage in the quarter. Revenue per piece was up 15.5%, including a 530 basis point benefit from the fuel surcharge. And cost per piece was up 12.4%, including a 570 basis point impact from higher fuel costs.
In the second quarter, International delivered operating profit of $1.2 billion, an increase of 41.3% and operating margin expanded to 24.7%. Our strategy in the International segment is absolutely driving value share and growth from the best parts of the market. As Scott Price shared in June, we are underpenetrated in almost all geographies around the world. So we see tremendous potential, as we continue executing our wildly important initiatives internationally.
Now looking at Supply Chain Solutions. Revenue increased 14.3% to $4.2 billion, and the segment generated record profit and operating margin. Market demand was elevated and revenue growth in our major business categories more than offset the revenue impact from the sale of UPS Freight, which closed on April 30.
Looking at operating profit. In forwarding, our Ocean Freight product more than doubled its operating profit on a year-over-year basis, driven by strong inventory replenishment demand. And in healthcare, our clinical trials, along with cell and gene solutions again delivered record top and bottom line results.
In the second quarter, Supply Chain Solutions generated operating profit of $408 million, and the operating margin was 9.7%. We are extremely pleased with our performance in this segment. We have moved the needle on operating margin, where over the past 5 years, operating margin has averaged 6.6%. 
Walking through the rest of the income statement, we had $167 million of interest expense. Other pension income was $302 million. And lastly, our effective tax rate came in at 22.1%, which was lower than last year due to discrete items. 
Now let's turn to cash on the balance sheet. We are generating strong cash flow from our disciplined focus on capital allocation and bottom line results. For the first 6 months of the year, we generated $8.5 billion in cash from operations and $6.8 billion in free cash flow. Also in the second quarter, the sale of UPS Freight triggered remeasurement of certain U.S. pension and postretirement plans, which resulted in a reduction in our net pension liability of $2.1 billion on our balance sheet, primarily due to higher discount rates. GAAP income only benefited by about $3 million because the vast majority of the gains fell within the corridor.
As Carol mentioned, our financial condition has greatly improved. A strong balance sheet is a core UPS principle. And since the end of 2020, we have reduced our pension liability and outstanding debt by $10.2 billion, bringing our debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 2.1. And lastly, so far this year, UPS has distributed $1.7 billion in dividends.
Moving to our outlook. I'll cover both the second half of 2021 and the full year. First, we expect market conditions to remain favorable and our initiatives to continue delivering positive results in our business. We are also paying close attention to several external factors, including the Delta variant of COVID-19, inflationary pressures, the U.S. inventory to sales ratio and consumer spending preferences. Nonetheless, we expect our revenue quality efforts to cover known expense pressures, and we are on track to meet our 2021 nonoperating savings target of $500 million.
On a consolidated basis, we expect second half 2021 revenue growth of around 5.4% year-over-year, which takes into account the divestiture of UPS Freight, tough comparisons from last year and our revenue quality initiatives. We expect the second half 2021 consolidated operating margin of around 12%. 
In U.S. Domestic, we anticipate back half 2021 revenue growth of about 8.2%, with revenue growing faster than volume. Operating margin should be around 9.2%. Operating margin in the back half of the year is expected to be lower than what we reported in the first half due to three factors: First is higher compensation expense from our contractual labor increase, which goes into effect each year in August. Second, we have made targeted hourly rate adjustments in certain geographies to remain competitive in the market. And as usual, lower-margin enterprise and B2C volume will represent a larger percentage of our total volume due to peak. Pulling it all together, we now expect full year 2021 U.S. operating margin to be approximately 10.1%. 
In the International segment, for the second half of 2021, we anticipate year-over-year average daily volume growth from Europe to be in the mid-single digits. In addition, we expect Asia outbound volume to remain elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels. As a result, we expect revenue growth around 10.7%, with an operating margin of about 22.9%. 
In the Supply Chain Solutions segment, in the second half of this year, we expect freight forwarding and healthcare to continue to lead the segment. We anticipate total revenue in the segment will decline around 9.6%, due to the sale of UPS Freight. However, we expect operating profit growth of around 8.1% and an operating margin of about 9.1%. 
Moving to the full year. In 2021, we expect consolidated operating margin of approximately 12.7% and return on invested capital of approximately 28%. We expect capital expenditures to be about $4 billion. And in April, we repaid $1 billion in debt and have achieved our 2021 target of $2.55 billion in debt repayment.
We have no plans to repurchase shares in 2021 at this time. But given the strong free cash flow and further reductions to our pension liabilities, we continue to evaluate the option to repurchase shares later this year. And lastly, our effective tax rate for the remainder of the year is now expected to be around 23%. Looking out to 2023, the current economic outlook, coupled with the early results from our revenue quality and productivity initiatives, is putting us well on our way to achieving the high end of our 2023 targets.
In closing, we are laser-focused on executing our strategy under the better, not bigger framework, and leaning into the best market opportunities to improve the financial performance of the company, provide the best customer experience and benefit our shareowners.
Thank you, and operator, please open the lines."

Is there an appetite for maybe significant M&A? And if there is, what are some of the areas and adjacencies that kind of make sense for how you see the company evolving over the next many years?

We've been talking to our large customers about what they're seeing in their business. And interestingly, one large brick-and-mortar customer told us they have 50 containers that were stuck in the port. And until those containers can get into their warehouses and into their stores, it's hard to sell. So there's a bit of an uncertainty out there, but we kind of control what we are going to control. And we shared this back half view with you because we thought you should know what we're seeing and what we're thinking about our business.
On the balance sheet question, I mean, gosh, from where we were a year ago, the financial condition of our company has greatly improved. Even from the end of the year, it's greatly improved, with our debt and pension liabilities down $10 billion from the end of the year. And having a strong financial condition, lets us all sleep well at night so that we can lean into our customer experience and do the right thing for our people, for our communities and for our customers.
As we think about our strategic opportunities ahead, we are opportunity-rich. And so we're going to continue to lean into those 16 customer journeys that we've talked to you about because we really think by improving the end-to-end experience, we get stickiness with our customers and can grow that value share that we are seeking to grow.
Could there be a capability that we might want to acquire to enable or speed up those journeys? Perhaps. But we're not seeing here building a large M&A war chest, if you will. In fact, we're just going to try to run the best business that we can.
Now we do believe that cash belongs to the shareowners and not to us. We told you that at the beginning or at the end of this year, if you will, we have a new dividend payout target, which is 50% of earnings. So based on the guidance that Brian has shared with you today, that could imply a fairly nice use of cash when we announced that new dividend. We are also looking at reentering the share repurchase market. This is something that we discussed with our Board every quarter. We have a Board meeting next week. So Brian shared with you in his prepared remarks that we're looking at as well."

There are a lot of moving pieces here from a CPP. I mentioned the cost increases from the wage and union contract. We've also got some market rate adjustments that are going in, in the second half of the year to remain competitive on a geographic standpoint.

And to your observation, we are pretty much locked in because of the way that most of our people are employed. But in certain parts of the country, we've had to make some market rate adjustments. That's a smaller piece of the cost pressure that we have in the back half that Brian detailed for you in his remarks.
We need to hire a lot of people for peak. And I'm happy to say that even in the face of this tight labor market, we are ahead of where we were a year ago. And Nando and his team are just managing this on a day-to-day basis. And just as it relates to peak, our peak planning is well underway. The good news is, from an operating perspective, we have one additional operating day this year, which helps us. We are lining up the aircraft that we need to lease to manage the volume. We're lining up on the rental equipment that we need to have in place to handle the volume and of course, on the people side. So we're -- every day, we're working on peak. I know it's just July, but we're working on peak every day."

Obviously, we're always talking more sequentially, what was in the first half versus the second half, and that's the big impact, which is about -- in or about $400 million in total, so about 150 bps on margin.
And I think the margin, the spreads get a bit tighter. I laid out the -- what our assumptions were in the back half of the year. So there's still positive leverage. They just get a little bit constrained by two things, one is the mix that we talked about during peak and the higher enterprise and B2C, and then the additional headwind pressure in terms of the labor piece that I mentioned."

We still got plenty of room to go, as I mentioned, on the rate renegotiation. On the cost piece, we're looking at bigger ticket items to change the game. So Nando and his team are thinking about. They're doing the blocking and tackling every day, but how do we take on a few initiatives in that much bigger cost bucket? Non-ops, we're making good progress.

And then, Carol, you mentioned the 5 million pieces per day shortfall, I think that's down from 7 million.

Now the cost runway, it takes a little longer to get after. So we're still catching up with some of the initiatives taking hold from an operations and a cost perspective, that will have a longer tail to it. And then we're well on the journey in terms of getting a playbook. I would say the piece on RPP that still needs sort of revenue that still needs to catch up, would be the dynamic pricing that relies on technology. So that's the next chapter on the revenue side.

So all of our consuming applications go into one clean data pool that will make it so much easier for our revenue leaders and our sales leaders to manage the business.
The same is true for costs, right? So this is a pretty exciting initiative that we have underway and then you layer technology on top of that. The technology piece is not the heavy lift the data is that haven't lift. But that initiative is well underway. And in terms of the demand supply capacity challenge, it has gotten a little it better because people have added capacity. As you would expect, we're adding capacity, so our competitors.
So it's still an interesting environment for sure. And as we work with our customers, we want to ensure that we meet their needs. So we're sitting down with -- there are about 300 customers, who make up that peak volume surge, and we're sitting down with each of them, understanding what their projections, what their promotions are, how are they thinking about the holiday season and really trying to work with them so that we provide to them the same outstanding and excellent service that we gave to them last year.

And the reaction was, ""No, it won't, you can't possibly do it."" And in fact, Brian, we are increasing the operating margin in the U.S. by 240 basis points.

Kevin and the team and Kate, they're doing a wonderful job of working with platform customers and SMBs to drive that. So as that mix goes up, margin improves. So there are several levers.

I'd like to begin by thanking all UPSers for continuing to deliver great service to our customers. In the 17 months that I've been CEO, I've learned that no matter what comes our way, UPSers deliver. The third",1275,"Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by thanking all UPSers for continuing to deliver great service to our customers. In the 17 months that I've been CEO, I've learned that no matter what comes our way, UPSers deliver. The third quarter brought several extreme weather events, including the widespread effects of Hurricane Ida in the U.S. But through it all, UPSers leverage the flexibility of our integrated network and the technology that powers it to deliver what matters. 
A little over 1 year ago, we laid out our better, not bigger framework under a customer-first people-led innovation-driven strategy. Inside that strategic framework is a focus on 3 main areas. First is to improve revenue quality, including growing SMB volume. Second is to reduce our cost to serve through productivity and cost takeout initiatives. And third is to effectively allocate capital to create a better customer experience, happier UPSers and higher returns on the capital we deploy. While it is early in the execution of our strategy, the progress we are making is clearly visible in our results. 
Looking at the third quarter, our performance was better than we anticipated. Consolidated revenue rose 9.2% from last year to $23.2 billion driven by another quarter of improved revenue quality across all 3 of our operating segments. Consolidated operating profit grew 23.4% to $3 billion driven by solid revenue growth and strong expense control. Each of our segments delivered year-over-year operating profit improvement and double-digit operating margins. And for the first 9 months of 2021, UPS has generated more operating profit than any full year in our history. Brian will share the details of our performance shortly. 
As we've discussed, we are laser-focused on adding capabilities that enable UPS to grow with SMBs. These improvements also benefit large customers that value our end-to-end network. Expanded weekend delivery services is one of our new capabilities. This initiative will be completed in the U.S. as planned by the end of this week. We will now cover about 90% of the U.S. population on Saturday for both residential and commercial pickups and deliveries. In addition, expanded Saturday services provides more capacity for Sunday SurePost delivery. The best part of our weekend delivery program is that we've unlocked additional network capacity that benefits all customers without deploying additional capital. And we've done this while expanding our U.S. operating margin on a year-over-year basis. 
As we look at our third quarter results, we see that SMBs value the new capabilities we are providing. In the U.S., SMB average daily volume, including platforms, was up 10.9% year-over-year. In fact, we've seen strong growth here for the past 6 quarters. In the third quarter, SMBs made up 27.4% of our total U.S. volume up 380 basis points from 1 year ago. And outside the U.S., SMB average daily volume growth was 3.9%. We see many opportunities to grow our international SMB volume as we continue to improve our digital experiences and roll out DAP, our Digital Access Program, to customers outside of the U.S. 
Let me also touch on SMBs and health care. When COVID-19 vaccines were rolled out late last year, the world turned to UPS, and we were ready with connected capabilities, technology and expertise. Our brand relevance here is attracting new SMB health care customers and significantly driving profit growth in this sector. And just on COVID-19 vaccines, we are on track to deliver more than 1 billion vaccine doses by the end of this year with 99.9% on-time delivery. 
Moving to productivity. We are relentlessly focused on reducing our cost to serve, and we're making good progress. While Brian will go through the details, I'll call out a few highlights. In the U.S. we drove a measurable improvement in productivity as PPH, or pieces per hour, increased by 2.5%. Additionally, as Nando described at our June Investor Day, through our ongoing efforts to optimize loads in our trailers, cube utilization in the third quarter was up 520 basis points versus last year. This helped us eliminate more than 10% of daily trailer loads year-over-year. And as we've discussed previously, we are creating fewer but more impactful jobs. So to reduce turnover and improve productivity, we are converting around 1,000 part-time supervisor positions in our operations into nearly 400 full-time positions at no additional cost to our company. 
Turning to what we refer to as Transformation 2.0 or plans to optimize our nonoperating expense. We are on track to eliminate $500 million in nonoperating costs this year with about $500 million of additional opportunity in 2022. 
Finally, our third area of focus is disciplined capital allocation. Since we began executing our strategy, we've seen marked improvement in our employee satisfaction and competitive Net Promoter Scores, due in part to how we've allocated capital to enhance the employee and customer experience. In October, we completed the acquisition of Roadie, a technology platform that also provides delivery services for packages that don't lend themselves to our small package network. We are delighted to welcome the Roadie team to UPS. 
We continue to be disciplined in our capital spending practices. This discipline, plus record earnings, yield a significant amount of cash. So far this year, we've generated a record $9.3 billion in free cash flow. And we expect full year 2021 return on invested capital to be around 29%, which is a 730 basis point improvement from what we reported at the end of last year. 
Turning to the fourth quarter. The global supply chain market is challenging. There are capacity, congestion and cost concerns. But for UPS, our outlook is positive as, once we get a package, we get it delivered. Outside of the U.S., where we peak, we are ready, and tight capacity benefits our freight forwarding business. In the U.S., we project a robust peak season, and through our planning efforts, we believe we are well on our way to deliver a peak that will be a win for UPS shippers, recipients and share owners. 
Let me share a few details. To begin with, the calendar is helpful as we have one more peak operating day than last year. Further, we've expanded weekend delivery and added additional sorting capacity. Nonetheless, we expect consumer demand will outpace capacity in the market. We began collaborating with our largest customer several months ago, and we'll stay in close contact with them during the holiday shipping season. Our technology allows us to match daily capacity with customer demand. And where we need to, we will again control the amount of volume that enters our network. These actions will minimize chaos costs and enable high service levels. 
On the labor front, we've digitized and simplified our job application process. enabling qualified applicants to receive a job offer within 30 minutes of applying. In parts of the country, labor costs are higher than they were last year but we are effectively managing through that cost pressure. When you add it up, in the fourth quarter, we expect to generate record consolidated operating profit and expand operating margin year-over-year. 
While we are laser-focused on peak, our business doesn't end on December 31. Later this week, we will release our U.S. general rate increase. The 2022 increase will be 5.9%, reflecting the value of the services we offer and cost inflation pressures. The details will be posted to ups.com. 
As we move ahead, we will continue to execute by leveraging our global Smart Logistics Network, our amazing UPSers and a strategy that's driving strong financial results today. and positions us well for the future. Thank you, and now I'll turn the call over to Brian."

And lastly, I'll wrap up with some comments on our outlook for the",1582,"Thanks, Carol, and good morning. In my comments today, I will cover 4 areas, starting with a macro overview, then our third quarter results. Next, I'll review cash and shareowner returns. And lastly, I'll wrap up with some comments on our outlook for the full year. 
Okay. Let's start with the macro. In the third quarter, the global economy continued its strong growth despite the dampening effects of COVID-19 and inflation, along with shortages in inventory and labor. Within this backdrop, demand for our services remained high and the pricing environment in the industry was firm. We expect similar dynamics in the fourth quarter, and as we demonstrated in the third, we will continue to execute our strategy and capture profitable growth opportunities in the market. IHS is forecasting fourth quarter global GDP will grow 3.8% and U.S. GDP is expected to grow 4.9%, which remain above historic GDP growth rates. 
Moving to our third quarter consolidated performance. The progress we've made to improve revenue quality enhance productivity and allocate capital is driving strong top and bottom line results. Consolidated revenue increased 9.2% to $23.2 billion. Consolidated operating profit totaled $3 billion, 23.4% higher than last year. All 3 segments generated record third quarter operating profit and achieved double-digit operating margins in the quarter. Consolidated operating margin expanded to 12.8%, which was 150 basis points above last year, and diluted earnings per share was $2.71 and up 18.9% from the same period last year. 
Now let's take a look at the segments. Our results in U.S. domestic were better than we anticipated principally due to higher than planned for improvements in revenue per piece and productivity gains. As we expected, average daily volume in the U.S. was down 540,000 pieces or 2.7% due to a decline in SurePost of 576,000 packages per day. This decline was partially offset by growth in ground commercial volume. 
Our results reflect the continued execution of our strategy to win in the most attractive parts of the market. In fact, customer mix continued to be positive as higher-yielding SMB average daily volume, including platforms, was up 10.9%. And in the third quarter, SMBs made up 27.4% of U.S. domestic volume compared to 23.6% last year. 
Regarding our delivery mix, our commercial business continued to recover and grew 6.8%, representing 42% of our volume in the third quarter compared to 39% in the third quarter of last year. Nearly all industry sectors grew B2B average daily volume, including retail and high tech. For the quarter, U.S. domestic generated revenue of $14.2 billion, up 7.4%, driven by a 12% increase in revenue per piece with fuel driving 270 basis points of the revenue per piece growth rate. 
Turning to costs. Total expense grew 5.8% and with fuel driving 180 basis points of the year-over-year expense growth rate. Through our focus on productivity, overall improvements, led by our inside sort operations and on-road activities, helped offset the market rate adjustments we implemented in certain geographies as well as the cost of expanding Saturday delivery. 
And as Carol mentioned, a key measure of UPS productivity is pieces per hour. And in the third quarter, we made improvements in nearly every area of our operations, led by preload, which improved by 6.5%. Combined, these improvements contributed to a decrease in direct labor hours per day of 5.1%. 
In summary, revenue growth was above expense growth, which generated positive operating leverage. The U.S. Domestic segment delivered $1.4 billion in operating profit, an increase of $281 million or 24.8% compared to last year, and operating margin expanded 140 basis points. 
Moving to International. The segment continues to generate strong profit growth driven by the execution of our strategy. Due to tough year-over-year comparisons and some supply chain disruptions growth in average daily volume moderated in the third quarter and was up 1.9%. B2B average daily volume grew 3.8% on a year-over-year basis and offset a decline in B2C volume, which was down 2.3%. On a 2-year stack, total average daily volume was up 14%. Total export average daily volume was up 1.3% on a year-over-year basis. Export growth in Europe and the Americas offset a 4.8% decrease in export average daily volume out of Asia. The decline in Asia was due to difficult comps from a year ago and the implementation of network contingency plans in response to COVID-19 protocols at select airports. Relative to our plan, we had 137 fewer flights out of Asia than we anticipated. 
For the quarter, International revenue was up 15.5% to $4.7 billion with strong growth across all regions. Revenue per piece was up 14%, including a 500 basis point benefit from fuel. Revenue quality improved on a year-over-year basis as we continue to utilize surcharges to match demand with available capacity. In the third quarter, International delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of profits over $1 billion. Operating profit was $1.1 billion, an increase of 14% and operating margin was 23.5%. 
Now looking at Supply Chain Solutions. The segment delivered record third quarter top and bottom line results as the team executed exceptionally well in a dynamic environment. Revenue increased 8.4% to $4.3 billion with all major business categories contributing to profit growth. Market demand remained elevated with a couple of key profit drivers. In forwarding, capacity constraints and consumer demand in the market drove volume growth in air freight forwarding and strong yields in our ocean freight product, which drove top and bottom line results. And in logistics, revenue and operating profit grew by double digits led by our health care portfolio. In the third quarter, Supply Chain Solutions generated record operating profit of $448 million and the operating margin was an impressive 10.5%. As a reminder, this is our first full quarter without UPS Freight results given that we closed the sale on that business on April 30 of this year. 
Walking through the rest of the income statement, we had $177 million of interest expense. Other pension income was $285 million. And lastly, our effective tax rate came in at 22.3%, which was lower than last year due to favorable changes in jurisdictional tax rates and discrete items. 
Now let's turn to cash on the balance sheet. We are generating strong cash flow from our disciplined focus on capital allocation and growth in net income. So far, in 2021, we have generated a record $11.8 billion in cash from operations and $9.3 billion in free cash flow. And in the first 9 months of this year, UPS has distributed $2.6 billion in dividends. 
In August, we announced a $5 billion share repurchase plan. with the intent to repurchase $500 million of shares in 2021, which we completed in the third quarter. We expect to execute the remainder of the program over the next few years. 
Now I'll make a few comments regarding the full year outlook. We are continuing to pay close attention to and manage through several external factors, including COVID-19, inflationary pressures and inventory and labor shortages. Despite these challenges, consumer demand is expected to be strong during peak season and in the fourth quarter. Due to our third quarter outperformance, combined with the progress we are making with our strategic initiatives and our increased fourth quarter plan, we are raising our full year guidance. On a consolidated basis, we expect full year 2021 revenue growth of around 13.8% year-over-year, which takes into account the divestiture of UPS Freight. Additionally, consolidated operating margin should be around 13%. In U.S. domestic, we anticipate full year 2021 revenue growth of about 12.7% with revenue growing faster than volume. We anticipate the full year 2021 U.S. operating margin will be around 10.5%. 
As you update your models for the U.S. domestic segment, there are a couple of things to keep in mind as we get into the fourth quarter. First, as usual, enterprise and B2C volume will represent a larger percentage of our total volume due to peak when compared to the rest of the year. And second, we are lapping more than $550 million in peak season surcharges in addition to the early customer pricing actions we implemented last year as a part of our revenue quality initiatives. As a result, we expect the sequential revenue per piece growth rate to moderate in the fourth quarter. 
Moving to the International segment. We expect full year revenue growth of around 20.7% with an operating margin of about 23.9%. And in the Supply Chain Solutions segment, we anticipate full year revenue growth of around 10.3% and operating margin of about 10%. Additionally, for the full year in 2021, we expect free cash flow to be around $10.5 billion and return on invested capital will be around 29%. Capital expenditures are now expected to be approximately $4.2 billion. And lastly, our effective tax rate for the full year is expected to be about 22.5%. 
As I wrap up, the economic outlook and the effects of our revenue quality and productivity initiatives are putting us well on our way to achieving the high end of our 2023 targets that I shared with you in June. We are executing our strategy under the better, not bigger framework and delivering on our commitments despite a very dynamic environment. We are laser-focused on improving revenue quality, reducing our cost to serve and remaining disciplined on capital allocation to improve the experience for our customers and our people and the financial performance of our company. Thank you. And operator, please open the lines."

So when we think about the growth of enterprise customers versus the rest of the business, we declared and called out the growth that we saw in our SMB customers. With an increasing penetration in SMB customers, that means the enterprise customers declined a bit, as we expected, for a couple of reasons. One, we were up against tough year-over-year comparisons. Secondly, we're controlling the volume that comes into our network because we're laser-focused on revenue quality. We used to think that every package was the same. We don't think that anymore. So for some shippers, we're no longer delivering their packages, and that's okay with us. 
Now as we think about our largest customer, we've got a great relationship with our largest customer and really -- and pleased where that relationship stands. Last year, volume with that customer surged, as you would expect, because of the impact of COVID-19 and the shift in e-commerce demand. This year, if I look at the volume with our largest customer as a percent of total volume for the first 9 months of this year, it's trending at where it was back in 2019. And we continue to support that customer as they continue to grow, but we're not -- they're a supply chain. We're just part of their supply chain."

It's such an interesting conundrum, isn't it? We are hearing from some surveys that consumers are quite panicked about this because supply chain jams are all over the news and, in fact, something that holiday shopping will be completed by Cyber Monday or 50% of holiday shopping be completed by Cyber Monday. As a result, some of our customers are actually pulling forward promotions. And we saw that last week, as an example, our volume was quite good because of promotions that our retail customers were offering. So I think everyone is trying to work through the supply chain demands to ensure a good holiday season. There's also a belief that there will be more gift cards sold this year than in prior years. which should suggest that packages will continue to be delivered post the holiday, as that's kind of elongates the holiday shipping season in a way. 
As we think about what it means for us right now, I'll just make it real for you, for the ports in California, a lot of discussion about the ports in Los Angeles and at Long Beach. We have hubs very close to those ports. We receive containers from those ports through a dropped-ship arrangement with a third party. So when people say there's a supply shortage of truck drivers, it's true because this third party is delivering those containers to our hubs. We have capacity, as an example, in one of our hubs for 70 containers today. We're only getting about 50 of those containers. So it is slowing down the flow of packages. 
Now as soon as we get it, we get it delivered. So our business is doing well. But in terms of the end-to-end supply chain, is jammed upstream. So when the administration -- the Biden administration recently announced we're going to have efforts to operate these ports at 24/7, we've said that's great news because if you can pull the containers off the ships, and then get them drop shipped to us, we've got the capacity to take on those containers. So we're here, ready and able to support anything that we can do to unlock some of that jam."

The productivity side is the thing that took a little longer to kick in, but the optimization right now, as we think about cube utilization, I think our trailers were down about 10% in terms of utilization, which is a great stat. And I talked about direct labor hours being down 5% relative to volume.

So there's not excess demand -- The problem is, is that everybody is rushing to fill the jobs. And so that's why you see so much pressure out there because, as the economy has opened up, everyone is rushing to fill the jobs. Now in some ways, we got ahead of it. Because if you think about last year, when our volumes surged, we hired 40,000 people in the second quarter. So we got ahead of some of the challenges by hiring last year. Now we are heading into peak where we do hire 100,000 seasonal workers. We are pretty good at this. We've done this for the past several years. The environment is different than it's ever been for sure, but we're all hands on deck. We have hundreds of recruiters that are working for us. These are UPSers as well as partners that we work with outside of the company. We have simplified the hiring process. So now within 30 minutes, you can get an offer. Before, you had to go through a gaming exercise before you can get an offer, and trust me, I play those games. I didn't do well. So I was like let's -- out of the game.

I'd like to begin by thanking all UPS-ers for continuing to deliver great service to our customers. In the 17 months that I've been CEO, I've learned that no matter what comes our way, UPS-ers deliver. The third quarter brought several extreme weather events, including the widespread effects of Hurricane Ida in the U.S. But through it all, UPS-ers leverage the flexibility of our integrated network and the technology that powers it to deliver what matters. 
A little over 1 year ago, we laid out our better, not bigger framework under a customer-first people-led innovation-driven strategy. Inside that strategic framework is a focus on 3 main areas. First is to improve revenue quality, including growing SMB volume. Second is to reduce our cost to serve through productivity and cost takeout initiatives. And third is to effectively allocate capital to create a better customer experience, happier UPS-ers and higher returns on the capital we deploy. While it is early in the execution of our strategy, the progress we are making is clearly visible in our results. 
Looking at the third quarter, our performance was better than we anticipated. Consolidated revenue rose 9.2% from last year to $23.2 billion driven by another quarter of improved revenue quality across all 3 of our operating segments. Consolidated operating profit grew 23.4% to $3 billion driven by solid revenue growth and strong expense control. Each of our segments delivered year-over-year operating profit improvement and double-digit operating margins. And for the first 9 months of 2021, UPS has generated more operating profit than any full year in our history. Brian will share the details of our performance shortly. 
As we've discussed, we are laser-focused on adding capabilities that enable UPS to grow with SMBs. These improvements also benefit large customers that value our end-to-end network. Expanded weekend delivery services is one of our new capabilities. This initiative will be completed in the U.S. as planned by the end of this week. We will now cover about 90% of the U.S. population on Saturday for both residential and commercial pickups and deliveries. In addition, expanded Saturday services provides more capacity for Sunday SurePost delivery. The best part of our weekend delivery program is that we've unlocked additional network capacity that benefits all customers without deploying additional capital. And we've done this while expanding our U.S. operating margin on a year-over-year basis. 
As we look at our third quarter results, we see that SMBs value the new capabilities we are providing. In the U.S., SMB average daily volume, including platforms, was up 10.9% year-over-year. In fact, we've seen strong growth here for the past 6 quarters. In the third quarter, SMBs made up 27.4% of our total U.S. volume up 380 basis points from 1 year ago. And outside the U.S., SMB average daily volume growth was 3.9%. We see many opportunities to grow our international SMB volume as we continue to improve our digital experiences and roll out DAP, our Digital Access Program, to customers outside of the U.S. 
Let me also touch on SMBs and health care. When COVID-19 vaccines were rolled out late last year, the world turned to UPS, and we were ready with connected capabilities, technology and expertise. Our brand relevance here is attracting new SMB health care customers and significantly driving profit growth in this sector. And just on COVID-19 vaccines, we are on track to deliver more than 1 billion vaccine doses by the end of this year with 99.9% on-time delivery. 
Moving to productivity. We are relentlessly focused on reducing our cost to serve, and we're making good progress. While Brian will go through the details, I'll call out a few highlights. In the U.S. we drove a measurable improvement in productivity as PPH, or pieces per hour, increased by 2.5%. Additionally, as Nando described at our June Investor Day, through our ongoing efforts to optimize loads in our trailers, cube utilization in the third quarter was up 520 basis points versus last year. This helped us eliminate more than 10% of daily trailer loads year-over-year. And as we've discussed previously, we are creating fewer but more impactful jobs. So to reduce turnover and improve productivity, we are converting around 1,000 part-time supervisor positions in our operations into nearly 400 full-time positions at no additional cost to our company. 
Turning to what we refer to as Transformation 2.0 or plans to optimize our nonoperating expense. We are on track to eliminate $500 million in nonoperating costs this year with about $500 million of additional opportunity in 2022. 
Finally, our third area of focus is disciplined capital allocation. Since we began executing our strategy, we've seen marked improvement in our employee satisfaction and competitive Net Promoter Scores, due in part to how we've allocated capital to enhance the employee and customer experience. In October, we completed the acquisition of Roadie, a technology platform that also provides delivery services for packages that don't lend themselves to our small package network. We are delighted to welcome the Roadie team to UPS. 
We continue to be disciplined in our capital spending practices. This discipline, plus record earnings, yield a significant amount of cash. So far this year, we've generated a record $9.3 billion in free cash flow. And we expect full year 2021 return on invested capital to be around 29%, which is a 730 basis point improvement from what we reported at the end of last year. 
Turning to the fourth quarter. The global supply chain market is challenging. There are capacity, congestion and cost concerns. But for UPS, our outlook is positive as, once we get a package, we get it delivered. Outside of the U.S., where we peak, we are ready, and tight capacity benefits our freight forwarding business. In the U.S., we project a robust peak season, and through our planning efforts, we believe we are well on our way to deliver a peak that will be a win for UPS shippers, recipients and share owners. 
Let me share a few details. To begin with, the calendar is helpful as we have one more peak operating day than last year. Further, we've expanded weekend delivery and added additional sorting capacity. Nonetheless, we expect consumer demand will outpace capacity in the market. We began collaborating with our largest customer several months ago, and we'll stay in close contact with them during the holiday shipping season. Our technology allows us to match daily capacity with customer demand. And where we need to, we will again control the amount of volume that enters our network. These actions will minimize chaos costs and enable high service levels. 
On the labor front, we've digitized and simplified our job application process. enabling qualified applicants to receive a job offer within 30 minutes of applying. In parts of the country, labor costs are higher than they were last year but we are effectively managing through that cost pressure. When you add it up, in the fourth quarter, we expect to generate record consolidated operating profit and expand operating margin year-over-year. 
While we are laser-focused on peak, our business doesn't end on December 31. Later this week, we will release our U.S. general rate increase. The 2022 increase will be 5.9%, reflecting the value of the services we offer and cost inflation pressures. The details will be posted to ups.com. 
As we move ahead, we will continue to execute by leveraging our global Smart Logistics Network, our amazing UPS-ers and a strategy that's driving strong financial results today. and positions us well for the future. Thank you, and now I'll turn the call over to Brian."

In my comments today, I will cover 4 areas, starting with a macro overview, then our third quarter results. Next, I'll review cash and shareowner returns. And lastly, I'll wrap up with some comments on our outlook for the full year. 
Okay. Let's start with the macro. In the third quarter, the global economy continued its strong growth despite the dampening effects of COVID-19 and inflation, along with shortages in inventory and labor. Within this backdrop, demand for our services remained high and the pricing environment in the industry was firm. We expect similar dynamics in the fourth quarter, and as we demonstrated in the third, we will continue to execute our strategy and capture profitable growth opportunities in the market. IHS is forecasting fourth quarter global GDP will grow 3.8% and U.S. GDP is expected to grow 4.9%, which remain above historic GDP growth rates. 
Moving to our third quarter consolidated performance. The progress we've made to improve revenue quality enhance productivity and allocate capital is driving strong top and bottom line results. Consolidated revenue increased 9.2% to $23.2 billion. Consolidated operating profit totaled $3 billion, 23.4% higher than last year. All 3 segments generated record third quarter operating profit and achieved double-digit operating margins in the quarter. Consolidated operating margin expanded to 12.8%, which was 150 basis points above last year, and diluted earnings per share was $2.71 and up 18.9% from the same period last year. 
Now let's take a look at the segments. Our results in U.S. domestic were better than we anticipated principally due to higher than planned for improvements in revenue per piece and productivity gains. As we expected, average daily volume in the U.S. was down 540,000 pieces or 2.7% due to a decline in SurePost of 576,000 packages per day. This decline was partially offset by growth in ground commercial volume. 
Our results reflect the continued execution of our strategy to win in the most attractive parts of the market. In fact, customer mix continued to be positive as higher-yielding SMB average daily volume, including platforms, was up 10.9%. And in the third quarter, SMBs made up 27.4% of U.S. domestic volume compared to 23.6% last year. 
Regarding our delivery mix, our commercial business continued to recover and grew 6.8%, representing 42% of our volume in the third quarter compared to 39% in the third quarter of last year. Nearly all industry sectors grew B2B average daily volume, including retail and high tech. For the quarter, U.S. domestic generated revenue of $14.2 billion, up 7.4%, driven by a 12% increase in revenue per piece with fuel driving 270 basis points of the revenue per piece growth rate. 
Turning to costs. Total expense grew 5.8% and with fuel driving 180 basis points of the year-over-year expense growth rate. Through our focus on productivity, overall improvements, led by our inside sort operations and on-road activities, helped offset the market rate adjustments we implemented in certain geographies as well as the cost of expanding Saturday delivery. 
And as Carol mentioned, a key measure of UPS productivity is pieces per hour. And in the third quarter, we made improvements in nearly every area of our operations, led by preload, which improved by 6.5%. Combined, these improvements contributed to a decrease in direct labor hours per day of 5.1%. 
In summary, revenue growth was above expense growth, which generated positive operating leverage. The U.S. Domestic segment delivered $1.4 billion in operating profit, an increase of $281 million or 24.8% compared to last year, and operating margin expanded 140 basis points. 
Moving to International. The segment continues to generate strong profit growth driven by the execution of our strategy. Due to tough year-over-year comparisons and some supply chain disruptions, growth in average daily volume moderated in the third quarter and was up 1.9%. B2B average daily volume grew 3.8% on a year-over-year basis and offset a decline in B2C volume, which was down 2.3%. On a 2-year stack, total average daily volume was up 14%. Total export average daily volume was up 1.3% on a year-over-year basis. Export growth in Europe and the Americas offset a 4.8% decrease in export average daily volume out of Asia. The decline in Asia was due to difficult comps from a year ago and the implementation of network contingency plans in response to COVID-19 protocols at select airports. Relative to our plan, we had 137 fewer flights out of Asia than we anticipated. 
For the quarter, International revenue was up 15.5% to $4.7 billion with strong growth across all regions. Revenue per piece was up 14%, including a 500 basis point benefit from fuel. Revenue quality improved on a year-over-year basis as we continue to utilize surcharges to match demand with available capacity. In the third quarter, International delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of profits over $1 billion. Operating profit was $1.1 billion, an increase of 14% and operating margin was 23.5%. 
Now looking at Supply Chain Solutions. The segment delivered record third quarter top and bottom line results as the team executed exceptionally well in a dynamic environment. Revenue increased 8.4% to $4.3 billion with all the major business categories contributing to profit growth. Market demand remained elevated with a couple of key profit drivers. In forwarding, capacity constraints and consumer demand in the market drove volume growth in air freight forwarding and strong yields in our ocean freight product, which drove top and bottom line results. And in logistics, revenue and operating profit grew by double digits led by our health care portfolio. In the third quarter, Supply Chain Solutions generated record operating profit of $448 million and the operating margin was an impressive 10.5%. As a reminder, this is our first full quarter without UPS Freight results given that we closed the sale on that business on April 30 of this year. 
Walking through the rest of the income statement, we had $177 million of interest expense. Other pension income was $285 million. And lastly, our effective tax rate came in at 22.3%, which was lower than last year due to favorable changes in jurisdictional tax rates and discrete items. Now let's turn to cash on the balance sheet. We are generating strong cash flow from our disciplined focus on capital allocation and growth in net income. So far in 2021, we have generated a record $11.8 billion in cash from operations and $9.3 billion in free cash flow. And in the first 9 months of this year, UPS has distributed $2.6 billion in dividends. In August, we announced a $5 billion share repurchase plan. with the intent to repurchase $500 million of shares in 2021, which we completed in the third quarter. We expect to execute the remainder of the program over the next few years. 
Now I'll make a few comments regarding the full year outlook. We are continuing to pay close attention to and manage through several external factors, including COVID-19, inflationary pressures and inventory and labor shortages. Despite these challenges, consumer demand is expected to be strong during peak season and in the fourth quarter. Due to our third quarter outperformance, combined with the progress we are making with our strategic initiatives and our increased fourth quarter plan, we are raising our full year guidance. On a consolidated basis, we expect full year 2021 revenue growth of around 13.8% year-over-year, which takes into account the divestiture of UPS Freight. Additionally, consolidated operating margin should be around 13%. In U.S. domestic, we anticipate full year 2021 revenue growth of about 12.7% with revenue growing faster than volume. We anticipate the full year 2021 U.S. operating margin will be around 10.5%. 
As you update your models for the U.S. domestic segment, there are a couple of things to keep in mind as we get into the fourth quarter. First, as usual, enterprise and B2C volume will represent a larger percentage of our total volume due to peak when compared to the rest of the year. And second, we are lapping more than $550 million in peak season surcharges, in addition to the early customer pricing actions we implemented last year as a part of our revenue quality initiatives. As a result, we expect the sequential revenue per piece growth rate to moderate in the fourth quarter. 
Moving to the International segment. We expect full year revenue growth of around 20.7% with an operating margin of about 23.9%. And in the Supply Chain Solutions segment, we anticipate full year revenue growth of around 10.3% and operating margin of about 10%. Additionally, for the full year in 2021, we expect free cash flow to be around $10.5 billion and return on invested capital will be around 29%. Capital expenditures are now expected to be approximately $4.2 billion. And lastly, our effective tax rate for the full year is expected to be about 22.5%. 
As I wrap up, the economic outlook and the effects of our revenue quality and productivity initiatives are putting us well on our way to achieving the high end of our 2023 targets that I shared with you in June. We are executing our strategy under the better, not bigger framework and delivering on our commitments despite a very dynamic environment. We are laser-focused on improving revenue quality, reducing our cost to serve and remaining disciplined on capital allocation to improve the experience for our customers, and our people and the financial performance of our company.

But can you talk a little bit about your ability to get out in front or ahead of that and start to see cost per piece start to slow as we move into 2022, and kind of how you view that as a normalized or what a normalized rate for that should be going forward?"

So when we think about the growth of enterprise customers versus the rest of the business, we declared and called out the growth that we saw in our SMB customers. With an increasing penetration in SMB customers, that means the enterprise customers declined a bit, as we expected, for a couple of reasons. One, we were up against tough year-over-year comparisons. Secondly, we're controlling the volume that comes into our network because we're laser-focused on revenue quality. We used to think that every package was the same. We don't think that anymore. So for some shippers, we're no longer delivering their packages, and that's okay with us. 
Now as we think about our largest customer, we've got a great relationship with our largest customer and really -- and pleased where that relationship stands. Last year, volume with that customer surged, as you would expect, because of the impact of COVID-19 and the shift in e-commerce demand. This year, if I look at the volume with our largest customer as a percent of total volume for the first 9 months of this year, it's trending at where it was back in 2019. And we continue to support that customer as they continue to grow, but we're not -- they're a supply chain. We're just part of their supply chain."

It's such an interesting conundrum, isn't it? We are hearing from some surveys that consumers are quite panicked about this because supply chain jams are all over the news. And in fact, something that holiday shopping will be completed by Cyber Monda",365,"Yes. It's such an interesting conundrum, isn't it? We are hearing from some surveys that consumers are quite panicked about this because supply chain jams are all over the news. And in fact, something that holiday shopping will be completed by Cyber Monday or 50% of holiday shopping be completed by Cyber Monday. As a result, some of our customers are actually pulling forward promotions. And we saw that last week, as an example, our volume was quite good because of promotions that our retail customers were offering. So I think everyone is trying to work through the supply chain demands to ensure a good holiday season. There's also a belief that there will be more gift cards sold this year than in prior years, which should suggest that packages will continue to be delivered post the holiday, as that's kind of elongates the holiday shipping season in a way. 
As we think about what it means for us right now, I'll just make it real for you, for the ports in California. A lot of discussion about the ports in Los Angeles and at Long Beach. We have hubs very close to those ports. We receive containers from those ports through a drop-ship arrangement with a third party. So when people say there's a supply shortage of truck drivers, it's true because this third party is delivering those containers to our hubs. We have capacity, as an example, in one of our hubs for 70 containers today. We're only getting about 50 of those containers. So it is slowing down the flow of packages. 
Now as soon as we get it, we get it delivered. So our business is doing well. But in terms of the end-to-end supply chain, it's jammed upstream. So when the administration -- the Biden administration recently announced we're going to have efforts to operate these ports at 24/7, we've said that's great news because if you can pull the containers off the ships, and then get them drop shipped to us, we've got the capacity to take on those containers. So we're here, ready and able to support anything that we can do to unlock some of that jam."

So we'll get to $1 billion over the 2-year period, and we feel confident in that. 
The productivity side is the thing that took a little longer to kick in, but the optimization right now, as we think about cube utilization, I think our trailers were down about 10% in terms of utilization, which is a great stat. And I talked about direct labor hours being down 5% relative to volume. So we're going to track those metrics very closely on the pieces per hour, the cube utilization and watch those as we go into next year. But we feel good about maintaining the margin spread from Q3 to Q4 in terms of the delta between RPP and CPP. And as Carol mentioned, we'll come back in the fourth quarter and talk about the trajectory of margin expansion for '22."

Before, you had to go through a gaming exercise before you can get an offer, and trust me, I play those games. I didn't do well. So I was like let's -- out of the game. So we've simplified the processing on board. And look, we're not -- it's not over until it's over but we're making progress here. I'll just give you one data point.
