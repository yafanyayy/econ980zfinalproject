The last 2 weeks have been the most difficult in our company's history as we mourn the loss of our founder, Sheldon Adelson. Sheldon, as you know, was a visionary. We led the transformation of not 1 but 3 integrated resort markets, that being in Las Vegas, Macau and Singapore. He offered the [indiscernible] integrated resort model in Las Vegas, we pioneered the development of the [indiscernible] chip in Macau and reimagine the skyline of Singapore to the iconic metabasis. His audacity to challenge the status quo transformed entire markets. 
In Las Vegas, Sheldon originated the convention based integrated sort model for non, and I mean no one we believe is viability or sustainability. Today, Las Vegas conventions are [indiscernible]. In Macau, either [indiscernible] our Sheldon on for [indiscernible] define the consensus thinking at that time. Every element of each Macau is questioned by the skeptics, and I mean every omen. A 3,000 room all-suite hotel, then the overnight tours market almost didn't exist, existing hotel inventory was very limited. The Grand Canal shops or the 300 retail stores in a market that had virtually no retail. A 13,000-seat arena and 1.2 million square foot convention center. He dreamt big but also delivered, who developed a critical mass of world-class integrated resorts at record speed. Before others are even dare to dream, he completed the niche and a [indiscernible] 2007 and was the fifth year of our company's 20-year concession. His determination pushing forward diversification and investment in non gaming in Macau, was unwavering and breathtaking to be part of. Our total investment account today exceeds USD 15 billion. [indiscernible] Sheldon is a big believer of strong, healthy and cordial U.S.-China relationship. We believe it was to the benefit of both countries to maintain a bilateral relationship based on mutual respect. 
The company, the Board and the family are absolutely committed to continuing Sheldon's efforts in this regard. Sheldon are replaceable as the visionary founder of our company of the unmatched portfolio of integrated resort assets and the management team he assembled to operate and expand the business in the future remain here in place, ready to work. The DNA of the company of Sheldon foundered remain ever present. The company with the full and wholehearted support to the Board, and the family will continue to honor Sheldon's vision to protect enhances legacy. We look forward to the future, induce a lot of confidence and optimism. 
While the pandemic continues to impact our business adversely, we have achieved positive EBITDA in both Macao and Singapore in the fourth quarter, and there's no doubt, in my mind, our business will be down to pre-COVID levels in the future. In Macau, the Grand Suite Four Seasons is now open, and the first phase of London, Macau will officially open in February. We are very excited about the progressive unveiling of a London Macau throughout the course of '21. 
Sands China is well positioned to capture rebound in tourism when the pandemic finally does subside. We believe -- we've always believed there's no better market or our company invest in an Macao. We will continue to invest in our resort product, nurture our local talent and, of course, support the local community, which we are grateful to. 
In Singapore, we remained very committed to long-term investment in [indiscernible], including both the upgrade of our existing facilities and the expansion of that property. On a principal note, I spent more than 2 decades with Sheldon. And had both the fun and the pleasure of working for with Shell. We use great inventory is a great friend. And I guess what speaks about is by the generosity reflecting the decision to continue to pay our team members, [indiscernible] dramatically impact our business. He was adamant that team members continue to receive pay and health benefits, even while we're closing our buildings and as abundantly clear of our business will be hampered for quite some time. 
In the days since this past, we received condolences around the world to global leaders, elected officials, business partners, investors, customers, and many of you joining us on the call today. We are touched by the outgoing of support, and we really appreciate that. I am honored to have been invited by the Boards of Las Vegas Sands and Sands China has become the Chairman and CEO of both companies. 
With the full support of the Board and the family, I will work hard on updating team members, the management team to fulfill Sheldon's extraordinary vision. I am confident as Sheldon in 1995, this company will go from strength to strength of the future. For one final thought before we turn to questions, I look forward to the day, we can say, yay, [indiscernible]."

I mean, Joe, I think following the resumption of the visa issuance from late September, the business volumes clearly did rebound during the fourth quarter.

I mean, Joe, I think following the resumption of the visa issuance from late September, the business volumes clearly did rebound during the fourth quarter. And the recovery was led primarily by premium mass and luxury retail. I think both segments actually did show good momentum throughout the quarter. So in December, we had a very encouraging month, especially the holiday season. We reached over 50% hotel occupancy during the month. And there were -- the peak days, we were achieving 8,500, 9,000 room nights, which obviously we haven't done anywhere close to that since January. And if you look at the pace of recovery in retail, the luxury retail sales really took off during the quarter. And by December, Four Seasons' retail mall was up 16% over the prior year. Actually, we had the best ever month that we ever had in Four Seasons more tenant sales. So that's pre and post pandemic, a record month. 
So at issue here is what you referenced. There is just not sufficient visitation to power or segments of the business and to replace the volumes that we lost. So the base mass remains very subdued. Macau only had 20% of the prior year's visitations during the fourth quarter. So really, there's not a lot you can do about that. It's not a policy issue in the sense of they can do something now that they would not otherwise be doing in light of having to prioritize the control of the pandemic. And obviously, the authorities have done an excellent job in that regard. So what you have to remember is that during the fourth quarter, the number of many outbreaks, local cases in different provinces and cities in China. 
And in October, November, they were relatively muted, and even for the first half of this [Audio Gap] So the number of zones or districts that were classified as medium to high-risk from a cover perspective were relatively few. But from about, let's say, third week of December, the domestic case started to rise in Northern China. And what we saw was that a lot more districts, a lot more zones and sometimes whole cities were classified as medium to high risk, which immediately, obviously, puts a break on visitation from those affected zones or cities, but also the overall narrative and travel advisories related to COVID becomes, obviously, a lot more cautious, and that impacts forward bookings. 
So from about middle of December, where up to that point, we were getting very positive momentum in terms of forward bookings in January and obviously, into Chinese New Year. Obviously, things will start to moderate from a forward booking and a pace of new bookings and obviously, the increase in cancellations. So that is directly related to the trending of the pandemic and some of these isolated outbreaks that we've seen, particularly in the northern provinces. So with that in mind, it's not easy to see relaxation of the current guidelines in terms of travel. Hope that's..."

We have not picked up any nor have we been consulted on whether there should be participation of Chinese companies. Now -- but we have to bear in mind that Chinese companies are likely -- I mean real Chinese companies are likely to take part in gambling, which in China is considered not legal. So there were, in the past, some suggestions of people saying, state-owned enterprises might come in. I don't think this really in line. For their policy consideration, whether private Chinese companies would be allowed to participate in Macau, and under what circumstances. These are things that have not been approached to us at all. So the only thing I can say at this stage is that we will continue to do our best in Macau and show that we are a locally rooted company because we are listed on [Audio Gap] as the same as any Hong Kong company [Audio Gap] and that we do this."

I'd never ever had a conversation with one person who mattered who ever said that to me. We even made a comment.

In fact, I think what we do here is complete affirmation of what Shell has always done, which is invest heavily invests heavily in nongaming activities. Believe in Macao, supports your employees and think they can grow. That's been the exact direction period for at least the last 5 years. And before that, we heard more from [indiscernible]. We've never heard them say, hey, you got to sell stake the Chinese people or we've heard please support your employees, Sheldon do that [indiscernible]. We paid everybody through the pandemic. It costs a lot of money. We did it. Invest in the cap. I think Sheldon, we've covered that in really $15 billion, invest in nongaming. That's always been a direction. But not onetime, from no one I've ever heard, oh, you have a cycle. I only hear that these people write these columns or have a belief that they understand the thinking over there. I did want to do a very, very good person, very important guy in the Chinese world, a business man. And I suggest that when he started laughing, he said no one is going to buy into a Chinese gambling company where it's Macao or Las Vegas because that's not we're going to do.

I think long term, it's irreplaceable in terms of a tourist destination. A huge amount of investment going into Las Vegas. We think there's a huge amount of potential pent-up demand just looking at other markets, when there's been a return. And really, the restriction in Las Vegas now are based on the capacity constraints set by the government. On weekends, we're actually doing quite well. There are days where we're actually almost at 2019 slot levels. It's really -- it's an interesting thing to see, and I think we're very positive on Vegas outlook just generally. That being said, if there is a completion of the sale process, it's independent of the dividend. I think the key thing for us is that we need to see a return to operations. We've had this discussion before on prior calls. We need to understand what the cash flow trajectory of the business is, the growth in that cash flow trajectory. You've heard Grant mentioned the completion of some of the [indiscernible] milestones. That's a phenomenal product, and we believe it will be very cash flow generative in the quarters and years to come as it addresses our most profitable and powerful segment in Macao. So the way we'll look at the dividend is evaluate our cash flow trajectory and the profile of business and then make an assessment about how to restart it and sort of what the trajectory of that dividend would look like. But we're very focused on the return of capital. We think it's been fundamental to our shareholder return story. 
We think we have a growth component in our key markets. We have a growth component in new growth opportunities and new developments. And I think as part of that, we look very heavily towards the dividend as our cornerstone and, of course, the share repurchases as well. So we're very focused, getting on the other side of the pandemic. Hopefully, we'll see some positive in the upcoming quarters. We have some green shoots in Macao. We have some positive results in Singapore, and some positive results in Las Vegas here. And so I think over time, we'll have better visibility into the trajectory of the business.

In the near term, it's also helpful to have additional liquidity, right?

That's a very -- in my opinion, when the Macanese government makes its decision, I think it will be contingent upon a rather substantial capital investment, which we know exactly shall we get with both hands. And that may be something else you think about. There's just no place like Macao. I think Grant and he'll give you a sense of London and 4 season. We hope we can all be there this year to see what that team has achieved. But we're not done in Macao. We tend to be there for many more years. And when all this gets to where it goes away, probably later this year, next winter, I don't know. I'm not going to predict because I've been wrong before. It won't be wrong again because they won't make a bet. But I bet the one thing will happen is the Macao government is going to necessitate that licensees make investments in Macao, and we want to be there, be ready.

You're right. And the slot business there is actually not quite at pre-pandemic levels, but it's getting close so we've learned that there's a local market, but more important than the local market, frankly, are the outsized contributions of foreigners were residing either do independent or full-time in Singapore. We have a lot of strong play inside the country from wealthy people that want to gamble. And that's a very positive sign. You saw the numbers. If we can run -- even though it's not the $1.7 billion, we used to be at, not going to 2, 3 or 4 like to be at. It's still a run rate of $0.5 billion plus in the most dramatic times. All it does for me is reinforce just how damn powerful Singapore and deploy the asset. And frankly, I wonderful the government is to work with there in terms of their they're still willing to talk and work with us, and we're hoping to get actually OTA there in March to continue our discussions how get phase 2 going. But it reinforces the enormous size and scale of that market and to think about having no foreign visitation yet make that kind of money and perhaps even more, it's very encouraging. On the flip side, it also makes you is important the airlift is an island. It's hampered by the fact, unlike Macao, which could open the doors up if the government is so chosen to lack the visitation requirements. In Singapore, the government is easier to open the doors, but necessitates airlift, which means counterparty trading with other governments and other airlines. So we don't see it coming back in the short term, I think it stays in this $150 million a quarter or so level. And so there's no real growth opportunity, I think, to see it until this the issues resolved. But it certainly makes us very much want to invest in Singapore. It's a great place to do business. It's a great market. Obviously, we need to a turn of all consumers, faring consumers to enhance it. But we want to invest money in [indiscernible], we sure do. We should get our product better.

And the idea we did, we can do $5-plus billion post pandemic is pretty encouraging. It can be more. We think it can be a lot more. Yes."

I think, Shaun, firstly, we have to stand back and look at the domestic Chinese economy during the course of -- especially the second half of 2020. So it is different from the western economies, largely the domestic economy was recovering very strongly. So this is without, obviously, vaccination being applied to the whole population. And that's obviously attributable to the fantastic control of the pandemic so as you look into the fourth quarter, you're getting the 6.5% GDP growth in domestic China without the vaccination. So that's a very, very strong outcome. And obviously, the consumer is getting stronger across the board. So I think we have to look at China in a slightly different way. The strategy is to continue to control to basically 0 local cases. And whether that is achieved through vaccination, whether that is achieved through what they've already been doing. Clearly, there is a path either way to clearing the locations and localities from the virus. And that will enable travel to resume more normally between Mainland China and Macao. So I think that's the first and most important point. In terms of the vaccine strategy, locally, you've seen comments from the local governments of both SARS, both Hong Kong and Macao, both have a strategy to procure a number of different vaccines, actually 3 from 3 different providers. And both cities are looking to procure the first batch during the first quarter as we understand. So the local populations in the will also be looking at a vaccination program in the months ahead. But really, the most important thing is still controlling the pandemic in terms of the local cases inside China itself. And if Macao then can be part of the domestic travel bubble, in a bigger way, in an easier way in a more fluid way than has been the case up to now. Then obviously, the tourism and the consumption spend will come back very strongly. And there has been progress. I think it's -- obviously, it's from a low base, but there has been progress. There has been a gradual easing up of the logistics and the getting used to some of the guidelines throughout the course of the fourth quarter. But again, the central point is as the worldwide pandemic got worse in the winter months, there are more imported cases that leads to more isolated outbreaks in some of the provinces in China. 
Then obviously, that puts pressure on restrictions again and the travel advisories that are issued by various different local governments and entities, especially prior to Chinese New Year, which is, as you know, a huge a period of huge migration of the population and travel. So that obviously rightly gives some consideration from the perspective of authorities that we need to be very careful at this stage, which is very delicate. So again, another important point is as the pandemic, obviously, if it subsides in the rest of the world as well, than that imported risk reduces, and that obviously relieves the pressure inside China as well, which hopefully is another factor that would lead to a normalization of the travel between Macao and Mainland China."

Actually, the amendment to Article 303 of the criminal law has been enacted. It was enacted about 2 weeks ago. And as you appreciate, this law, this amendment deals with people organizing, gambling, running casinos and particularly organizing citizens of China to go outside of the country to participate in gambling. Now there were the inactive version made 2 changes of the previous draft. First, the definition of the criminal actor, which they try to come up with a definition was removed. So they just use a catch-all phrase of whoever organizes. So this is to avoid people arguing who falls into the net. The second change appears to be a bit positive, but it's still ambiguous for Macao is that in the legislation, they specifically say outside of the country, which, as you all appreciate, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan is generally considered within the country. But then they leave -- and then equity there by putting the word offshore inside the bracket after outside the country. Now this introduces the ambiguity, and I was discussing this with both our lawyers in Beijing and the local MPC, National People's Congress, people attending the session. And they said that while the central people's government recognizes the special status of Macao, they do not want Macao to be exploited as a base for organizing such activities to take people outside of the country, such as the Southeast Asian countries. And as we all know, the Ministry of Tourism has compiled and is compiling a black list of countries to which they are known to be accommodating gambling from Chinese citizen. So to us, there is certain ambiguity, which will ultimately be decided by the authorities and the courts going forward. But at this stage, it is for sure that any person or a junket try to use Macao as a base to organize gambling to other countries would be condemned."

I think structurally, and this is not to do with the pandemic. Structurally, we've seen, obviously, the power and the growth of the premium mass over the last several years, and that trend is going to continue, whether it's pre pandemic, during and after. And the reality of that is because the players, the customers they want to deal directly with the owners of operators of these great assets. And obviously, the great lifestyle destination that would provide the multitude of amenities and the services that we're able to offer is very, very appealing. So I think that will continue. Your reference to is there a transfer from 1 segment to another? I think structurally, there has been over the last several years anyway. And that's one of the brilliant things about Sheldon's integrated resort model is that we can offer everything from the entertainment, the retail, to the food and beverage, the spars, all of these nongaming lifestyle amenities. So that trend is structural, and that's why we strategically invested in products that serve this segment. 
In terms of specifically what's happening now, the situation is -- you referenced is more related to issues specific to the system in the junket segment, and that has stabilized at low levels of volumes. And obviously, as a result of some of those issues, you may see that as new demand resurfaces resumes in the coming years that, that new demand is captured directly by the operators rather than through intermediaries. That also is true. But I think the overarching trend was there before anyway and would have continued in that manner. It's just that what's happened in the last 12 months may somewhat accelerate that trend. But it was going to be a big structural trend and driver for years to come anyway."

The last 2 weeks have been the most difficult in our company's history as we mourn the loss of our founder, Sheldon Adelson. Sheldon, as you know, was a visionary. He led the transformation of not one but 3 integrated resort markets, that being Las Vegas, Macao and Singapore. He offered the MICE-based Integrated Resort model in Las Vegas. He pioneered the development of the Cotai Strip in Macao and reimagined the skyline of Singapore to the iconic [ Marina Bay Sands ]. His audacity to challenge the status quo transformed the entire market.
In Las Vegas, Sheldon originated the convention-based Integrated Resort model when no one, and I mean no one, who believe in its viability or sustainability. Today, Las Vegas conventions are synonymous. In Macao, [indiscernible] defied the consensus thinking at that time. Every element of [indiscernible] Macao is questioned by the skeptics, and I mean every omen. A 3,000 room all-suite hotel, when the overnight tours market almost didn't exist, existing hotel inventory was very limited. The Grand Canal Shoppes with over 300 retail stores in a market that had virtually no retail. A 13,000-seat arena and 1.2 million square foot convention center. He dreamt big but he also delivered, who developed a critical mass of world-class integrated resorts at a record speed.
Before others could even dare to dream, he completed the [indiscernible] Macao in 2007 and was the fifth year of our company's 20-year concession. His determination pushing forward diversification and investment in non-gaming in Macao, was unwavering and breathtaking to be part of. Our total investment account today exceeds USD 15 billion. We know that Sheldon was a big believer of strong, healthy and cordial U.S.-China relationship. He believed it was to the benefit of both countries to maintain a bilateral relationship based on mutual respect.
The company, the Board and the family are absolutely committed to continuing Sheldon's efforts in this regard. Sheldon is irreplaceable as the visionary founder of our company, of the unmatched portfolio of integrated resort assets and the management team he assembled to operate and expand the business in the future remain here in place, ready to work.
The DNA of the company that Sheldon founded will remain ever present. The company with the full and wholehearted support of the Board, and the family will continue to honor Sheldon's vision to protect and enhance his legacy. We look forward to the future, and do so with a lot of confidence and optimism. While the pandemic continues to impact our business adversely, we have achieved positive EBITDA in both Macao and Singapore in the fourth quarter, and there's no doubt, in my mind, our business [ will be down ] to pre-COVID levels in the future. In Macao, the Grand Suite Four Seasons is now open, and the first phase of Londoner Macao will officially open in February. We are very excited about the progressive unveiling of the Londoner Macao throughout the course of '21.
Sands China is well positioned to capture rebound in tourism when the pandemic finally does subside. We believe -- we've always believed there's no better market for our company to invest in than Macao. We will continue to invest in our resort product, nurture our local talent and, of course, support the local community, which we are grateful to.
In Singapore, we remained very committed to long-term investment in Marina Bay Sands, including both the upgrading of our existing facilities and the expansion of that property. On a principal note, I spent more than 2 decades with Sheldon. And had both fun and the pleasure of working for and with Sheldon. He was a great mentor, he was a great friend. And I guess what speaks volumes about his generosity and decency is reflected in the decision to continue to pay our team members, even after the dramatically impacted our business. He was adamant that team members continue to receive pay and health benefits, even while we're closing our buildings and it was abundantly clear that our business will be hampered for quite some time.
In the days since he has passed, we received condolences from around the world from global leaders, elected officials, business partners, investors, customers, and many of you joining us on the call today. We are touched by the [indiscernible] of support, and we really appreciate that. I am honored to have been invited by the Board of Las Vegas Sands and Sands China to become the Chairman and CEO of both companies.
With the full support of the Board and the family, I will work hard on upskilling team members, the management team to fulfill Sheldon's extraordinary vision. I am confident, as Sheldon in 1995, that this company will go from strength to strength in the future. For one final thought before we turn to questions, I look forward to the day, we can say, [indiscernible].
Thanks, we are ready for questions."

I mean, Joe, I think following the resumption of the visa issuance from late September, the business volumes clearly did rebound during the fourth quarter. And the recovery was led primarily by premium mass and luxury retail. I think both segments actually did show good momentum throughout the quarter. So in December, we had a very encouraging month, especially the holiday season. We reached over 50% hotel occupancy during the month. And there were -- the peak days, we were achieving 8,500, 9,000 room nights, which obviously we haven't done anywhere close to that since January.
And if you look at the pace of recovery in retail, the luxury retail sales really took off during the quarter. And by December, Four Seasons' retail mall was up 16% over the prior year. Actually, we had the best ever month that we ever had in Four Seasons mall tenant sales. So that's pre- and post-pandemic, a record month.
So at issue here is what you referenced. There is just not sufficient visitation to power all segments of the business and to replace the volumes that we lost. So the base mass remains very subdued. Macao only had 20% of the prior year's visitations during the fourth quarter. So really, there's not a lot you can do about that. It's not a policy issue in the sense of they can do something now that they would not otherwise be doing in light of having to prioritize the control of the pandemic. And obviously, the authorities have done an excellent job in that regard. So what you have to remember is that during the fourth quarter, they had number of many outbreaks, local cases in different provinces and cities in China.
And in October, November, they were relatively muted, and even for the first half of
[Audio Gap] 
So the number of zones or districts that were classified as medium to high-risk from a COVID perspective were relatively few. But from about, let's say, third week of December, the domestic cases started to rise in Northern China. And what we saw was that a lot more districts, a lot more zones and sometimes the whole cities were classified as medium to high risk, which immediately, obviously, puts a break on visitation from those affected zones or cities, but also the overall narrative and travel advisories related to COVID becomes, obviously, a lot more cautious, and that impacts forward bookings.
So from about mid of December, where up to that point, we were getting very positive momentum in terms of forward bookings in January and obviously, into Chinese New Year. Obviously, things have started to moderate from a forward booking and the pace of new bookings and obviously, the increase in cancellations. So that is directly related to the trending of the pandemic and some of these isolated outbreaks that we've seen, particularly in the northern provinces. So with that in mind, it's not easy to see relaxation of the current guidelines in terms of travel. Hope that's..."

Now -- but we have to bear in mind that Chinese companies are likely -- I mean real Chinese companies are likely to take part in gambling, which in China is considered not legal. So there were, in the past, some suggestions of people saying, state-owned enterprises might come in. I don't think this really in line for their policy consideration. Whether private Chinese companies would be allowed to participate in Macao, and under what circumstances, these are things that have not been brought to us at all. So the only thing I can say at this stage is that we will continue to do our best in Macao and show that we are a locally rooted company because we are listed on the stock exchange in Hong Kong so we are just the same as any Hong Kong company and that we do everything, even better than other competitors."

It all sounded very good, but one thing no one's ever said that, the government to us. Never heard that from anybody actually understands how Macao and Beijing operate.

There are days where we're actually almost at 2019 slot levels. It's really -- it's an interesting thing to see, and I think we're very positive on Vegas outlook just generally.
That being said, if there is a completion of the sale process, it's independent of the dividend. I think the key thing for us is that we need to see a return to operations. We've had this discussion before on prior calls. We need to understand what the cash flow trajectory of the business is, the growth in that cash flow trajectory. You've heard Grant mention the completion of some of the Londoner milestones. That's a phenomenal product, and we believe it will be very cash flow generative in the quarters and years to come as it addresses our most profitable and powerful segment in Macao.
So the way we'll look at the dividend is evaluate our cash flow trajectory and the profile of business and then make an assessment about how to restart it and sort of what the trajectory of that dividend would look like. But we're very focused on the return of capital. We think it's been fundamental to our shareholder return story.
We think we have a growth component in our key markets. We have a growth component and new growth opportunities and new developments. And I think as part of that, we look very heavily towards the dividend as our cornerstone and, of course, the share repurchases as well. 
So we're very focused, getting on the other side of the pandemic. Hopefully, we'll see some positive in the upcoming quarters. We have some green shoots in Macao. We have some positive results in Singapore, and some positive results in Las Vegas here. And so I think over time, we'll have better visibility into the trajectory of the business. And then we'll make an assessment over the timing and the size of the dividend."

Again, I want to re-ensure that we believe Las Vegas has plenty of gas in the tank. Our demand for '22 through '27 convention is unbelievable. Our customers want to come, and we remain very bullish on the return of Las Vegas. It may take longer than we want it to. It may take till the end of this year, as we see visitation spike. But please don't be among those people who have these ideas that this pandemic would put a hole in Las Vegas. And just the opposite, the demand will be there. This is a unique town. We're going have all the digital products out there you want. People want the visitation, and this town has a lot to offer. So we remain very bullish on the return post-pandemic."

We love Singapore and think the future for Singapore is very strong, both as a leisure and business tourism market, and we're happy to have helped the government there, support its goals and continue to invest there. So we have capital that we can deploy there in the near term.
I think in terms of other opportunities, you hear some of the things that Rob is talking about. We also have return of capital consideration. So for us, capital allocation is front and center. We have these discussions with the management team and the Board all the time. So it's something where we'll look at our opportunities, look for a way to maximize shareholder returns. If we have assets where we think our returns are increased by transacting, we'll transact. And otherwise, we'll look to the sort of historical actions that we've taken in order to enhance returns. 
In the near term, it's also helpful to have additional liquidity, right? So I think from our standpoint, as the pandemic recovers, it's nice to have additional liquidity on the balance sheet, which is the reason why we're running the amount of liquidity that we have today, right?

But I bet the one thing will happen is the Macao government is going to necessitate that licensees make investments in Macao, and we want to be there and be ready. Patrick referenced Singapore and these are not small investors, they're in the billions of dollars.

You're right. And the slot business there is actually not quite at pre-pandemic levels, but it's getting close so we've learned that there's a local market, but more important than the local market, frankly, are the outsized contributions of foreigners who are residing either during the pandemic or full-time in Singapore. We have a lot of strong play inside the country from wealthy people that want to gamble. And that's a very positive sign. You saw the numbers. If we can run -- even though it's not the $1.7 billion, it used to be at, not [indiscernible] 2, 3 or 4 like to be at. It's still a run rate of $0.5 billion plus in the most dramatic times.

On the flip side, it also makes you [indiscernible] important the airlift is as an island. It's hampered by the fact, unlike Macao, which could open the doors up if the government -- so chosen to relax the visitation requirements. In Singapore, the government is eager to open the doors, but it necessitates airlift, which means counterparty trading with other governments and other airlines. So we don't see it coming back in the short term, I think it stays in this $150 million a quarter or so level. And so there's no real growth opportunity, I think, to see until this  airlift issue is resolved. But it certainly makes us very much want to invest in Singapore. It's a great place to do business. It's a great market. Obviously, we need a return of all consumers, foreign consumers to enhance it. But do we want to invest money in Singapore, we sure do. We should get our product better.

I think, Shaun, firstly, we have to stand back and look at the domestic Chinese economy during the course of -- especially the second half of 2020. So it is different from the western economies, largely the domestic economy was recovering very strongly. So this is without, obviously, vaccination being applied to the whole population. And that's obviously attributable to the fantastic control of the pandemic. So as you look into the fourth quarter, you're getting the 6.5% GDP growth in domestic China without the vaccination. So that's a very, very strong outcome. And obviously, the consumer is getting stronger across the board. So I think we have to look at China in a slightly different way. The strategy is to continue to control to basically 0 local cases. And whether that is achieved through vaccination, whether that is achieved through what they've already been doing. Clearly, there is a path either way to clearing the locations and localities from the virus. And that will enable travel to resume more normally between Mainland China and Macao. So I think that's the first and most important point. 
In terms of the vaccine strategy, locally, you've seen comments from the local governments of both [indiscernible], both Hong Kong and Macao, both have a strategy to procure a number of different vaccines, actually 3 from 3 different providers. And both cities are looking to procure the first batch during the first quarter as we understand. So the local populations in the [indiscernible] will also be looking at a vaccination program in the months ahead. But really, the most important thing is still controlling the pandemic in terms of the local cases inside China itself. And if Macao then can be part of the domestic travel bubble, in a bigger way, in an easier way in a more fluid way than has been the case up to now, then obviously, the tourism and the consumption spend will come back very strongly. And there has been progress. I think it's -- obviously, it's from a low base, but there has been progress. There has been a gradual easing up of the logistics and the getting used to some of the guidelines throughout the course of the fourth quarter. But again, the central point is as the worldwide pandemic got worse in the winter months, there are more imported cases that leads to more isolated outbreaks in some of the provinces in China. Then obviously, that puts pressure on restrictions again and the travel advisories that are issued by various different local governments and entities, especially prior to Chinese New Year, which is, as you know, a huge -- a period of huge migration of the population and travel. 
So that obviously rightly gives some consideration from the perspective of authorities that we need to be very careful at this stage, which is very delicate. So again, another important point is as the pandemic -- obviously, if it subsides in the rest of the world as well, than that imported risk reduces, and that obviously relieves the pressure inside China as well, which hopefully is another factor that would lead to a normalization of the travel between Macao and Mainland China."

Actually, the amendment to Article 303 of the criminal law has been enacted. It was enacted about 2 weeks ago. And as you appreciate, this law, this amendment deals with people organizing, gambling, running casinos and particularly organizing citizens of China to go outside of the country to participate in gambling. Now there were -- the inactive version made 2 changes of the previous draft. First, the definition of the criminal actor, which they tried to come up with a definition, was removed. So they just use a catch-all phrase of whoever organizes. So this is to avoid people arguing who falls into the net. 
The second change appears to be a bit positive, but it's still ambiguous for Macao is that in the legislation, they specifically say outside of the country, which, as you all appreciate, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan is generally considered within the country. But then they leave an ambiguity equity there by putting the word offshore inside the bracket after outside the country. Now this introduces the ambiguity, and I was discussing this with both our lawyers in Beijing and the local NPC, National People's Congress, people attending the session. And they said that while the central people's government recognizes the special status of Macao, they do not want Macao to be exploited as a base for organizing such activities to take people outside of the country, such as the Southeast Asian countries. And as we all know, the Ministry of Tourism has compiled and is compiling a black list of countries to which they are known to be accommodating gambling from Chinese citizen. So to us, there is certain ambiguity, which will ultimately be decided by the authorities and the courts going forward. But at this stage, it is for sure that any person or a junket trying to use Macao as a base to organize gambling to other countries would be condemned."

I think structurally -- and this is not to do with the pandemic. Structurally, we've seen, obviously, the power and the growth of the premium mass over the last several years, and that trend is going to continue, whether it's pre-pandemic, during and after. And the reality of that is because the players, the customers, they want to deal directly with the owners of operators of these great assets. And obviously, the great lifestyle destination that would provide the multitude of amenities and the services that we're able to offer is very, very appealing. 
So I think that will continue. So your reference to is there a transfer from one segment to another? I think structurally, there has been over the last several years anyway. And that's one of the brilliant things about Sheldon's Integrated Resort model is that we can offer everything from the entertainment, to the retail, to the food and beverage, the spas, all of these non-gaming lifestyle amenities. So that trend is structural, and that's why we strategically invested in products that serve this segment.
In terms of specifically what's happening now, the situation is -- you referenced, it's more related to issues specific to the system in the junket segment, and that has stabilized at low levels of volumes. And obviously, as a result of some of those issues, you may see that as new demand resurfaces resumes in the coming years that, that new demand is captured directly by the operators rather than through intermediaries. That also is true. But I think the overarching trend was there before anyway and would have continued in that manner. It's just that what's happened in the last 12 months may somewhat accelerate that trend. But it was going to be a big structural trend and driver for years to come anyway."

The last 2 weeks have been the most difficult in our company's history as we mourn the loss of our founder, Sheldon Adelson. Sheldon, as you know, was a visionary. He led the transformation of not one but 3 integrated resort markets, that being Las Vegas, Macao and Singapore. He offered the MICE-based Integrated Resort model in Las Vegas. He pioneered the development of the Cotai Strip in Macao and reimagined the skyline of Singapore to the iconic [ Marina Bay Sands ]. His audacity to challenge the status quo transformed entire markets.
In Las Vegas, Sheldon originated the convention-based Integrated Resort model when no one, and I mean no one, who believe in its viability or sustainability. Today, Las Vegas conventions are synonymous. In Macao, it's easy to forget how Sheldon's vision for Cotai defied the consensus thinking at that time. Every element of The Venetian Macao was questioned by the skeptics, and I mean every element. A 3,000 room all-suite hotel, when the overnight tours market almost didn't exist, existing hotel inventory was very limited. The Grand Canal Shoppes with over 300 retail stores in a market that had virtually no retail. A 13,000-seat arena and 1.2 million square foot convention center. He dreamt big but he also delivered, who developed a critical mass of world-class integrated resorts at a record speed.
Before others could even dare to dream, he completed the The Venetian Macao in 2007 and was the fifth year of our company's 20-year concession. His determination pushing forward diversification and investment in non-gaming in Macao was unwavering and breathtaking to be part of. Our total investment account today exceeds USD 15 billion. We know that Sheldon was a big believer of strong, healthy and cordial U.S.-China relationship. He believed it was to the benefit of both countries to maintain a bilateral relationship based on mutual respect.
The company, the Board and the family are absolutely committed to continuing Sheldon's efforts in this regard. Sheldon is irreplaceable as the visionary founder of our company, of the unmatched portfolio of integrated resort assets and the management team he assembled to operate and expand the business in the future remain here in place, ready to work.
The DNA of the company that Sheldon founded will remain ever present. The company with the full and wholehearted support of the Board, and the family will continue to honor Sheldon's vision to protect and enhance his legacy. We look forward to the future, and do so with a lot of confidence and optimism. While the pandemic continues to impact our business adversely, we have achieved positive EBITDA in both Macao and Singapore in the fourth quarter, and there's no doubt, in my mind, our business [ will be down ] to pre-COVID levels in the future. In Macao, the Grand Suite Four Seasons is now open, and the first phase of Londoner Macao will officially open in February. We are very excited about the progressive unveiling of the Londoner Macao throughout the course of '21.
Sands China is well positioned to capture rebound in tourism when the pandemic finally does subside. We believe -- we've always believed there's no better market for our company to invest in than Macao. We will continue to invest in our resort product, nurture our local talent and, of course, support the local community, which we are grateful to.
In Singapore, we remained very committed to long-term investment in Marina Bay Sands, including both the upgrading of our existing facilities and the expansion of that property. On a principal note, I spent more than 2 decades with Sheldon. And had both fun and the pleasure of working for and with Sheldon. He was a great mentor, he was a great friend. And I guess what speaks volumes about his generosity and decency is reflected in the decision to continue to pay our team members, even after the dramatically impacted our business. He was adamant that team members continue to receive pay and health benefits, even while we're closing our buildings and it was abundantly clear that our business will be hampered for quite some time.
In the days since he has passed, we received condolences from around the world from global leaders, elected officials, business partners, investors, customers, and many of you joining us on the call today. We are touched by the outpouring of support, and we really appreciate that. I am honored to have been invited by the Board of Las Vegas Sands and Sands China to become the Chairman and CEO of both companies.
With the full support of the Board and the family, I will work hard on upskilling team members, the management team to fulfill Sheldon's extraordinary vision. I am confident, as Sheldon in 1995, that this company will go from strength to strength in the future. For one final thought before we turn to questions, I look forward to the day, we can say, yay, dividends.
Operator, we are ready for questions."

I mean, Joe, I think following the resumption of the visa issuance from late September, the business volumes clearly did rebound during the fourth quarter. And the recovery was led primarily by premium mass and luxury retail. I think both segments actually did show good momentum throughout the quarter. So in December, we had a very encouraging month, especially the holiday season. We reached over 50% hotel occupancy during the month. And there were -- the peak days, we were achieving 8,500, 9,000 room nights, which obviously we haven't done anywhere close to that since January.
And if you look at the pace of recovery in retail, the luxury retail sales really took off during the quarter. And by December, Four Seasons' retail mall was up 16% over the prior year. Actually, we had the best ever month that we ever had in Four Seasons mall tenant sales. So that's pre- and post-pandemic, a record month.
So at issue here is what you referenced. There is just not sufficient visitation to power all segments of the business and to replace the volumes that we lost. So the base mass remains very subdued. Macao only had 20% of the prior year's visitations during the fourth quarter. So really, there's not a lot you can do about that. It's not a policy issue in the sense of they can do something now that they would not otherwise be doing in light of having to prioritize the control of the pandemic. And obviously, the authorities have done an excellent job in that regard. So what you have to remember is that during the fourth quarter, they had number of many outbreaks, local cases in different provinces and cities in China.
And in October, November, they were relatively muted, and even for the first half of
[Audio Gap] 
So the number of zones or districts that were classified as medium to high risk from a COVID perspective were relatively few. But from about, let's say, third week of December, the domestic cases started to rise in Northern China. And what we saw was that a lot more districts, a lot more zones and sometimes the whole cities were classified as medium to high risk, which immediately, obviously, puts a break on visitation from those affected zones or cities, but also the overall narrative and travel advisories related to COVID becomes, obviously, a lot more cautious, and that impacts forward bookings.
So from about mid of December, where up to that point, we were getting very positive momentum in terms of forward bookings in January and obviously, into Chinese New Year. Obviously, things have started to moderate from a forward booking and the pace of new bookings and obviously, the increase in cancellations. So that is directly related to the trending of the pandemic and some of these isolated outbreaks that we've seen, particularly in the northern provinces. So with that in mind, it's not easy to see relaxation of the current guidelines in terms of travel. Hope that's..."

Now -- but we have to bear in mind that Chinese companies are likely -- I mean real Chinese companies are likely to take part in gambling, which in China is considered not legal. So there were, in the past, some suggestions of people saying, state-owned enterprises might come in. I don't think this really in line for their policy consideration. Whether private Chinese companies would be allowed to participate in Macao, and under what circumstances, these are things that have not been brought to us at all. So the only thing I can say at this stage is that we will continue to do our best in Macao and show that we are a locally rooted company because we are listed on the stock exchange in Hong Kong so we are just the same as any Hong Kong company and that we do everything, even better than other competitors."

I know there's an outsized belief by some people who write these things, and they constantly opine their thoughts on how equity should be sold to Chinese companies, and they're jumping up and down. I've never ever had a conversation with one person who mattered who ever said that to me or even made that comment, in fact, if anything, they kind of chuckle because to Wilfred's comment, there's not a big appetite to invest in gambling. 
So I think those -- I know it's very prevalent in the market. I hear quite a bit. I know that somebody wrote something recently about how we could guarantee our licensure, if we sell x percent. It all sounded very good, but one thing no one's ever said that, the government to us. Never heard that from anybody actually understands how Macao and Beijing operate. In fact, I think what we do hear, it is complete affirmation of what Sheldon has always done, which is invest heavily, invest heavily in non-gaming activities, believe in Macao, support your employees and think they can grow. That's been the exact direction for at least the last 5 years. And before that, we heard more from the Macanese officials. We've never heard them say, hey, you got to sell stake the Chinese people or we've heard please support your employees. Sheldon did that to a T. We paid everybody through the pandemic. It costs a lot of money. We did it. 
Invest in the cap. I think Sheldon, we've covered that already, $15 billion. Invest in non-gaming. That's always been a direction. But not onetime, from no one I've ever heard, oh, you got to sell equity. I want to hear that from these people who write these columns or have a belief that they understand the thinking over there. I did once knew a very, very good person, very important guy in the Chinese world, a business man. And I suggested, so he started laughing, he said no one is going to buy into a Chinese gambling company whether it's Macao or Las Vegas because that's not what we're going to do. We found it kind of humorous actually. So I know that's a common prevailing thought, but we don't hear it."

We also know that there is a legislative council election scheduled for September this year. So all these are coming into play, and we are coming up against a very tight time table. We don't know whether this will begin very soon because right now, the government is all involved in the fight against the pandemic. As we all know, Macao cannot afford a single case because it was a public announcement by the government that if there is even one case, Macao would be locked down again. So the government is putting all their energy into the fight against the pandemic to ensure that visitors can continue to come. So we don't know. The short answer is we don't know.
And when asked about this publicly, the Chief Executive said that anything is possible. I think he was asked whether there could be an extension or how soon can this be done. And his response was, anything is possible."

I think long term, it's irreplaceable in terms of a tourist destination. A huge amount of investment going into Las Vegas. We think there's a huge amount of potential pent-up demand just looking at other markets, when there's been a return. And really, the restriction in Las Vegas now are based on the capacity constraints set by the government. On weekends, we're actually doing quite well. There are days where we're actually almost at 2019 slot levels. It's really -- it's an interesting thing to see, and I think we're very positive on Vegas outlook just generally.
That being said, if there is a completion of the sale process, it's independent of the dividend. I think the key thing for us is that we need to see a return to operations. We've had this discussion before on prior calls. We need to understand what the cash flow trajectory of the business is, the growth in that cash flow trajectory. You've heard Grant mention the completion of some of the Londoner milestones. That's a phenomenal product, and we believe it will be very cash flow generative in the quarters and years to come as it addresses our most profitable and powerful segment in Macao.
So the way we'll look at the dividend is evaluate our cash flow trajectory and the profile of business and then make an assessment about how to restart it and sort of what the trajectory of that dividend would look like. But we're very focused on the return of capital. We think it's been fundamental to our shareholder return story.
We think we have a growth component in our key markets. We have a growth component and new growth opportunities and new developments. And I think as part of that, we look very heavily towards the dividend as our cornerstone and, of course, the share repurchases as well. 
So we're very focused, getting on the other side of the pandemic. Hopefully, we'll see some positive in the upcoming quarters. We have some green shoots in Macao. We have some positive results in Singapore, and some positive results in Las Vegas here. And so I think over time, we'll have better visibility into the trajectory of the business. And then we'll make an assessment over the timing and the size of the dividend."

Again, I want to re-ensure that we believe Las Vegas has plenty of gas in the tank. Our demand for '22 through '27 convention is unbelievable. Our customers want to come, and we remain very bullish on the return of Las Vegas. It may take longer than we want it to. It may take till the end of this year, as we see visitation spike.

He just simply had this outsized ethical concern about people couldn't afford it or people that were too young to use it. And he wasn't a believer in the technology could stop that. He never questioned the viability of it. He questioned the ability to police it properly.
And so the same way he paid people, hundreds of millions of dollars last year, because he wanted to. It's an ethical consideration to Sheldon. So we've had this discussion prior to his passing, and we are going to explore it. And again, the cab is we are in the making-money business.

We love Singapore and think the future for Singapore is very strong, both as a leisure and business tourism market, and we're happy to have helped the government there, support its goals and continue to invest there. So we have capital that we can deploy there in the near term.
I think in terms of other opportunities, you hear some of the things that Rob is talking about. We also have return of capital consideration. So for us, capital allocation is front and center. We have these discussions with the management team and the Board all the time. So it's something where we'll look at our opportunities, look for a way to maximize shareholder returns. If we have assets where we think our returns are increased by transacting, we'll transact. And otherwise, we'll look to the sort of historical actions that we've taken in order to enhance returns. 
In the near term, it's also helpful to have additional liquidity, right? So I think from our standpoint, as the pandemic recovers, it's nice to have additional liquidity on the balance sheet, which is the reason why we're running the amount of liquidity that we have today, right? We want to make sure that we have the opportunity to do whatever we need to do during this sort of unprecedented time. So I think from that standpoint, that's kind of how we think about things.

I know these miserable years of '20 and perhaps even '21 make that seem like a distant memory, but we think it comes back and it comes back strong.

That's a very -- in my opinion, when the Macanese government makes its decision, I think it will be contingent upon a rather substantial capital investment, which we know exactly what Sheldon will do and he bet with both hands. 
And that may be something else to be thinking about. There's just no place like Macao. I think Grant -- and he also gave you a sense of Londoner and Four Seasons. I hope we can all be there this year to see what that team has achieved. But we're not done in Macao. We intend to be there for many more years. And when all this gets away, it goes away, probably later this year, next, I don't know. I'm not going to predict because I've been wrong before. I won't be wrong again because I won't make a bet.
But I bet the one thing will happen is the Macao government is going to necessitate that licensees make investments in Macao, and we want to be there and be ready. Patrick referenced Singapore and these are not small investors, they're in the billions of dollars. So I think we have to be prepared for outsized investments in our markets, which are Macao and Singapore for crazy growth. And then there's the other possibilities in the U.S. we referenced.

And the slot business there is actually not quite at pre-pandemic levels, but it's getting close. So we've learned that there's a local market, but more important than the local market, frankly, are the outsized contributions of foreigners who are residing either during the pandemic or full-time in Singapore. We have a lot of strong play inside the country from wealthy people that want to gamble. And that's a very positive sign. You saw the numbers. 
If we can run -- even though it's not the $1.7 billion it used to be at, not north of the 2, 3 or 4 we'd like to be at. It's still a run rate of $0.5 billion plus in the most dramatic times.

It's hampered by the fact, unlike Macao, which could open the doors up if the government so chose to relax the visitation requirements. In Singapore, the government is eager to open the doors, but it necessitates airlift, which means counterparty trading with other governments and other airlines. So we don't see it coming back in the short term, I think it stays in this $150 million a quarter or so level. 
And so there's no real growth opportunity, I think, to see until this  airlift issue is resolved. But it certainly makes us very much want to invest in Singapore. It's a great place to do business. It's a great market. Obviously, we need a return of all consumers, foreign consumers to enhance it. But do we want to invest money in Singapore, we sure do. We should get our product better. We have a lot of work to do in the building right now. We're actually embarking on an ambitious reinvestment program in the current asset to bring up to a better standard. And then we want to build our second phase as soon  as we resolve everything. So we're -- just like Macao, we're lucky to be there. And the idea we did -- we can do $5-plus billion post-pandemic is pretty encouraging. It can be more. We think it can be a lot more. Yes."

I think Grant's comments to start off as a little sobering about sort of expectations of when we can start thinking about a recovery relative to kind of what's going on with the pandemic in China. And if we step back for a second, maybe it's a little harder for us over here, sometimes to monitor exactly the nuances of some of the vaccine developments. But one thing that's increasingly separating the U.S. recovery narrative from overseas is probably that to some degree. So I'm wondering if we could get a little bit of thought around maybe some of the vaccination programs and what the expectations are around that for maybe within Macao, broader thoughts on the local area there, possibly Hong Kong and then how that could branch out to China in terms of -- is that what we may need to really see a more concrete reopening for this entire market at this stage?"

I think, Shaun, firstly, we have to stand back and look at the domestic Chinese economy during the course of -- especially the second half of 2020. So it is different from the western economies, largely the domestic economy was recovering very strongly. So this is without, obviously, vaccination being applied to the whole population. And that's obviously attributable to the fantastic control of the pandemic. So as you look into the fourth quarter, you're getting the 6.5% GDP growth in domestic China without the vaccination. So that's a very, very strong outcome. And obviously, the consumer is getting stronger across the board. So I think we have to look at China in a slightly different way. The strategy is to continue to control to basically 0 local cases. And whether that is achieved through vaccination, whether that is achieved through what they've already been doing. Clearly, there is a path either way to clearing the locations and localities from the virus. And that will enable travel to resume more normally between Mainland China and Macao. So I think that's the first and most important point. 
In terms of the vaccine strategy, locally, you've seen comments from the local governments of both SARs, both Hong Kong and Macao, both have a strategy to procure a number of different vaccines, actually 3 from 3 different providers. And both cities are looking to procure the first batch during the first quarter as we understand. So the local populations in the SARs will also be looking at a vaccination program in the months ahead. But really, the most important thing is still controlling the pandemic in terms of the local cases inside China itself. 
And if Macao then can be part of the domestic travel bubble, in a bigger way, in an easier way in a more fluid way than has been the case up to now, then obviously, the tourism and the consumption spend will come back very strongly. And there has been progress. I think it's -- obviously, it's from a low base, but there has been progress. There has been a gradual easing up of the logistics and the getting used to some of the guidelines throughout the course of the fourth quarter. But again, the central point is as the worldwide pandemic got worse in the winter months, there are more imported cases that leads to more isolated outbreaks in some of the provinces in China. Then obviously, that puts pressure on restrictions again and the travel advisories that are issued by various different local governments and entities, especially prior to Chinese New Year, which is, as you know, a huge -- a period of huge migration of the population and travel. 
So that obviously rightly gives some consideration from the perspective of authorities that we need to be very careful at this stage, which is very delicate. So again, another important point is as the pandemic -- obviously, if it subsides in the rest of the world as well, than that imported risk reduces, and that obviously relieves the pressure inside China as well, which hopefully is another factor that would lead to a normalization of the travel between Macao and Mainland China."

Actually, the amendment to Article 303 of the criminal law has been enacted. It was enacted about 2 weeks ago. And as you appreciate, this law, this amendment deals with people organizing, gambling, running casinos and particularly organizing citizens of China to go outside of the country to participate in gambling. Now there were -- the inactive version made 2 changes of the previous draft. First, the definition of the criminal actor, which they tried to come up with a definition, was removed. So they just use a catch-all phrase of whoever organizes. So this is to avoid people arguing who falls into the net. 
The second change appears to be a bit positive, but it's still ambiguous for Macao is that in the legislation, they specifically say outside of the country, which, as you all appreciate, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan is generally considered within the country. But then they leave an ambiguity equity there by putting the word offshore inside the bracket after outside the country. Now this introduces the ambiguity, and I was discussing this with both our lawyers in Beijing and the local NPC, National People's Congress, people attending the session. 
And they said that while the central people's government recognizes the special status of Macao, they do not want Macao to be exploited as a base for organizing such activities to take people outside of the country, such as the Southeast Asian countries. And as we all know, the Ministry of Tourism has compiled and is compiling a black list of countries to which they are known to be accommodating gambling from Chinese citizen. So to us, there is certain ambiguity, which will ultimately be decided by the authorities and the courts going forward. But at this stage, it is for sure that any person or a junket trying to use Macao as a base to organize gambling to other countries would be condemned."

Structurally, we've seen, obviously, the power and the growth of the premium mass over the last several years, and that trend is going to continue, whether it's pre-pandemic, during and after. And the reality of that is because the players, the customers, they want to deal directly with the owners of operators of these great assets. And obviously, the great lifestyle destination that would provide the multitude of amenities and the services that we're able to offer is very, very appealing. 
So I think that will continue. So your reference to is there a transfer from one segment to another? I think structurally, there has been over the last several years anyway. And that's one of the brilliant things about Sheldon's Integrated Resort model is that we can offer everything from the entertainment, to the retail, to the food and beverage, the spas, all of these non-gaming lifestyle amenities. So that trend is structural, and that's why we strategically invested in products that serve this segment.
In terms of specifically what's happening now, the situation is -- you referenced, it's more related to issues specific to the system in the junket segment, and that has stabilized at low levels of volumes. And obviously, as a result of some of those issues, you may see that as new demand resurfaces resumes in the coming years that, that new demand is captured directly by the operators rather than through intermediaries. That also is true. But I think the overarching trend was there before anyway and would have continued in that manner. It's just that what's happened in the last 12 months may somewhat accelerate that trend. But it was going to be a big structural trend and driver for years to come anyway."

The last 2 weeks have been the most difficult in our company's history as we mourn the loss of our founder, Sheldon Adelson. Sheldon, as you know, was a visionary. He led the transformation of not one but 3 integrated resort markets, that being Las Vegas, Macao and Singapore. He offered the MICE-based Integrated Resort model in Las Vegas. He pioneered the development of the Cotai Strip in Macao and reimagined the skyline of Singapore to the iconic [ Marina Bay Sands ]. His audacity to challenge the status quo transformed entire markets.
In Las Vegas, Sheldon originated the convention-based Integrated Resort model when no one, and I mean no one, who believe in its viability or sustainability. Today, Las Vegas conventions are synonymous. In Macao, it's easy to forget how Sheldon's vision for Cotai defied the consensus thinking at that time. Every element of The Venetian Macao was questioned by the skeptics, and I mean every element. A 3,000 room all-suite hotel, when the overnight tours market almost didn't exist, existing hotel inventory was very limited. The Grand Canal Shoppes with over 300 retail stores in a market that had virtually no retail. A 13,000-seat arena and 1.2 million square foot convention center. He dreamt big but he also delivered, who developed a critical mass of world-class integrated resorts at a record speed.
Before others could even dare to dream, he completed the The Venetian Macao in 2007 and was the fifth year of our company's 20-year concession. His determination pushing forward diversification and investment in non-gaming in Macao was unwavering and breathtaking to be part of. Our total investment account today exceeds USD 15 billion. We know that Sheldon was a big believer of strong, healthy and cordial U.S.-China relationship. He believed it was to the benefit of both countries to maintain a bilateral relationship based on mutual respect.
The company, the Board and the family are absolutely committed to continuing Sheldon's efforts in this regard. Sheldon is irreplaceable as the visionary founder of our company, of the unmatched portfolio of integrated resort assets and the management team he assembled to operate and expand the business in the future remain here in place, ready to work.
The DNA of the company that Sheldon founded will remain ever present. The company with the full and wholehearted support of the Board, and the family will continue to honor Sheldon's vision to protect and enhance his legacy. We look forward to the future, and do so with a lot of confidence and optimism. While the pandemic continues to impact our business adversely, we have achieved positive EBITDA in both Macao and Singapore in the fourth quarter, and there's no doubt, in my mind, our business [ will be down ] to pre-COVID levels in the future. In Macao, the Grand Suite Four Seasons is now open, and the first phase of Londoner Macao will officially open in February. We are very excited about the progressive unveiling of the Londoner Macao throughout the course of '21.
Sands China is well positioned to capture rebound in tourism when the pandemic finally does subside. We believe -- we've always believed there's no better market for our company to invest in than Macao. We will continue to invest in our resort product, nurture our local talent and, of course, support the local community, which we are grateful to.
In Singapore, we remained very committed to long-term investment in Marina Bay Sands, including both the upgrading of our existing facilities and the expansion of that property. On a principal note, I spent more than 2 decades with Sheldon. And had both fun and the pleasure of working for and with Sheldon. He was a great mentor, he was a great friend. And I guess what speaks volumes about his generosity and decency is reflected in the decision to continue to pay our team members, even after the dramatically impacted our business. He was adamant that team members continue to receive pay and health benefits, even while we're closing our buildings and it was abundantly clear that our business will be hampered for quite some time.
In the days since he has passed, we received condolences from around the world from global leaders, elected officials, business partners, investors, customers, and many of you joining us on the call today. We are touched by the outpouring of support, and we really appreciate that. I am honored to have been invited by the Board of Las Vegas Sands and Sands China to become the Chairman and CEO of both companies.
With the full support of the Board and the family, I will work hard on upskilling team members, the management team to fulfill Sheldon's extraordinary vision. I am confident, as Sheldon in 1995, that this company will go from strength to strength in the future. For one final thought before we turn to questions, I look forward to the day, we can say, yay, dividends.
Operator, we are ready for questions."

Actually, we had the best ever month that we ever had in Four Seasons mall tenant sales. So that's pre- and post-pandemic, a record month.
So at issue here is what you referenced. There is just not sufficient visitation to power all segments of the business and to replace the volumes that we lost. So the base mass remains very subdued. Macao only had 20% of the prior year's visitations during the fourth quarter. So really, there's not a lot you can do about that. It's not a policy issue in the sense of they can do something now that they would not otherwise be doing in light of having to prioritize the control of the pandemic. And obviously, the authorities have done an excellent job in that regard. So what you have to remember is that during the fourth quarter, they had number of many outbreaks, local cases in different provinces and cities in China.
And in October, November, they were relatively muted, and even for the first half of
[Audio Gap] 
So the number of zones or districts that were classified as medium to high risk from a COVID perspective were relatively few. But from about, let's say, third week of December, the domestic cases started to rise in Northern China. And what we saw was that a lot more districts, a lot more zones and sometimes the whole cities were classified as medium to high risk, which immediately, obviously, puts a break on visitation from those affected zones or cities, but also the overall narrative and travel advisories related to COVID becomes, obviously, a lot more cautious, and that impacts forward bookings.
So from about mid of December, where up to that point, we were getting very positive momentum in terms of forward bookings in January and obviously, into Chinese New Year. Obviously, things have started to moderate from a forward booking and the pace of new bookings and obviously, the increase in cancellations. So that is directly related to the trending of the pandemic and some of these isolated outbreaks that we've seen, particularly in the northern provinces. So with that in mind, it's not easy to see relaxation of the current guidelines in terms of travel. Hope that's..."

With Macao casinos, either existing -- by an existing states or having board representation, is this something that's a priority for the government? So important? Have there been discussions? I kind of remember hearing something along these lines maybe a couple of years ago as this potentially happening on the ground in Macao a couple of years ago, but we're getting more questions and commentary on that of late. So anything you can shed on that would be interesting."

Now -- but we have to bear in mind that Chinese companies are likely -- I mean real Chinese companies are likely to take part in gambling, which in China is considered not legal. So there were, in the past, some suggestions of people saying, state-owned enterprises might come in. I don't think this really in line for their policy consideration. Whether private Chinese companies would be allowed to participate in Macao, and under what circumstances, these are things that have not been brought to us at all. So the only thing I can say at this stage is that we will continue to do our best in Macao and show that we are a locally rooted company because we are listed on the stock exchange in Hong Kong so we are just the same as any Hong Kong company and that we do everything, even better than other competitors."

We've been going to Beijing for around 20 years in Macao, and having endless meetings. I know there's an outsized belief by some people who write these things, and they constantly opine their thoughts on how equity should be sold to Chinese companies, and they're jumping up and down. I've never ever had a conversation with one person who mattered who ever said that to me or even made that comment, in fact, if anything, they kind of chuckle because to Wilfred's comment, there's not a big appetite to invest in gambling. 
So I think those -- I know it's very prevalent in the market. I hear quite a bit. I know that somebody wrote something recently about how we could guarantee our licensure, if we sell x percent. It all sounded very good, but one thing no one's ever said that, the government to us. Never heard that from anybody actually understands how Macao and Beijing operate. In fact, I think what we do hear, it is complete affirmation of what Sheldon has always done, which is invest heavily, invest heavily in non-gaming activities, believe in Macao, support your employees and think they can grow. That's been the exact direction for at least the last 5 years. And before that, we heard more from the Macanese officials. We've never heard them say, hey, you got to sell stake the Chinese people or we've heard please support your employees. Sheldon did that to a T. We paid everybody through the pandemic. It costs a lot of money. We did it. 
Invest in the cap. I think Sheldon, we've covered that already, $15 billion. Invest in non-gaming. That's always been a direction. But not onetime, from no one I've ever heard, oh, you got to sell equity. I want to hear that from these people who write these columns or have a belief that they understand the thinking over there. I did once knew a very, very good person, very important guy in the Chinese world, a business man. And I suggested, so he started laughing, he said no one is going to buy into a Chinese gambling company whether it's Macao or Las Vegas because that's not what we're going to do. We found it kind of humorous actually. So I know that's a common prevailing thought, but we don't hear it."

We also know that there is a legislative council election scheduled for September this year. So all these are coming into play, and we are coming up against a very tight time table. We don't know whether this will begin very soon because right now, the government is all involved in the fight against the pandemic. As we all know, Macao cannot afford a single case because it was a public announcement by the government that if there is even one case, Macao would be locked down again. So the government is putting all their energy into the fight against the pandemic to ensure that visitors can continue to come. So we don't know. The short answer is we don't know.
And when asked about this publicly, the Chief Executive said that anything is possible. I think he was asked whether there could be an extension or how soon can this be done. And his response was, anything is possible."

I think long term, it's irreplaceable in terms of a tourist destination. A huge amount of investment going into Las Vegas. We think there's a huge amount of potential pent-up demand just looking at other markets, when there's been a return. And really, the restriction in Las Vegas now are based on the capacity constraints set by the government. On weekends, we're actually doing quite well. There are days where we're actually almost at 2019 slot levels. It's really -- it's an interesting thing to see, and I think we're very positive on Vegas outlook just generally.
That being said, if there is a completion of the sale process, it's independent of the dividend. I think the key thing for us is that we need to see a return to operations. We've had this discussion before on prior calls. We need to understand what the cash flow trajectory of the business is, the growth in that cash flow trajectory. You've heard Grant mention the completion of some of the Londoner milestones. That's a phenomenal product, and we believe it will be very cash flow generative in the quarters and years to come as it addresses our most profitable and powerful segment in Macao.
So the way we'll look at the dividend is evaluate our cash flow trajectory and the profile of business and then make an assessment about how to restart it and sort of what the trajectory of that dividend would look like. But we're very focused on the return of capital. We think it's been fundamental to our shareholder return story.
We think we have a growth component in our key markets. We have a growth component and new growth opportunities and new developments. And I think as part of that, we look very heavily towards the dividend as our cornerstone and, of course, the share repurchases as well. 
So we're very focused, getting on the other side of the pandemic. Hopefully, we'll see some positive in the upcoming quarters. We have some green shoots in Macao. We have some positive results in Singapore, and some positive results in Las Vegas here. And so I think over time, we'll have better visibility into the trajectory of the business. And then we'll make an assessment over the timing and the size of the dividend."

I think in terms of other opportunities, you hear some of the things that Rob is talking about. We also have return of capital consideration. So for us, capital allocation is front and center. We have these discussions with the management team and the Board all the time. So it's something where we'll look at our opportunities, look for a way to maximize shareholder returns. If we have assets where we think our returns are increased by transacting, we'll transact. And otherwise, we'll look to the sort of historical actions that we've taken in order to enhance returns. 
In the near term, it's also helpful to have additional liquidity, right? So I think from our standpoint, as the pandemic recovers, it's nice to have additional liquidity on the balance sheet, which is the reason why we're running the amount of liquidity that we have today, right? We want to make sure that we have the opportunity to do whatever we need to do during this sort of unprecedented time. So I think from that standpoint, that's kind of how we think about things. I hope this answers your question."

One thought and that is, obviously, we have a very strong balance sheet, whether we sell in Las Vegas or not. But we also have, I believe, in the next couple of years -- as you know, 2019, we did about $5.5 billion of EBITDA. I know these miserable years of '20 and perhaps even '21 make that seem like a distant memory, but we think it comes back and it comes back strong. But also, I believe, when Macao makes its decision, there's going to be a requirement to invest more in Macao. It's, as you know, Sheldon felt, well, I can't wait to invest $5 billion, $10 billion. That's a very -- in my opinion, when the Macanese government makes its decision, I think it will be contingent upon a rather substantial capital investment, which we know exactly what Sheldon will do and he bet with both hands. 
And that may be something else to be thinking about. There's just no place like Macao. I think Grant -- and he also gave you a sense of Londoner and Four Seasons. I hope we can all be there this year to see what that team has achieved. But we're not done in Macao. We intend to be there for many more years. And when all this gets away, it goes away, probably later this year, next, I don't know. I'm not going to predict because I've been wrong before. I won't be wrong again because I won't make a bet.
But I bet the one thing will happen is the Macao government is going to necessitate that licensees make investments in Macao, and we want to be there and be ready. Patrick referenced Singapore and these are not small investors, they're in the billions of dollars. So I think we have to be prepared for outsized investments in our markets, which are Macao and Singapore for crazy growth. And then there's the other possibilities in the U.S. we referenced. So as strong as we are, if we can get stronger, we will."

And the slot business there is actually not quite at pre-pandemic levels, but it's getting close. So we've learned that there's a local market, but more important than the local market, frankly, are the outsized contributions of foreigners who are residing either during the pandemic or full-time in Singapore. We have a lot of strong play inside the country from wealthy people that want to gamble. And that's a very positive sign. You saw the numbers. 
If we can run -- even though it's not the $1.7 billion it used to be at, not north of the 2, 3 or 4 we'd like to be at. It's still a run rate of $0.5 billion plus in the most dramatic times. All it does for me is reinforce just how damn powerful Singapore, how wonderful the asset, and frankly, how wonderful the government is to work with there in terms of their -- they're still willing to talk and work with us, and we're hoping to get actually over there in March to continue our discussions on how to get phase 2 going. But it reinforces the enormous size and scale of that market and to think about having no foreign visitation yet make that kind of money and perhaps even more, it's very encouraging. 
On the flip side, it also makes you realize how important the airlift is as an island. It's hampered by the fact, unlike Macao, which could open the doors up if the government so chose to relax the visitation requirements. In Singapore, the government is eager to open the doors, but it necessitates airlift, which means counterparty trading with other governments and other airlines. So we don't see it coming back in the short term, I think it stays in this $150 million a quarter or so level. 
And so there's no real growth opportunity, I think, to see until this  airlift issue is resolved. But it certainly makes us very much want to invest in Singapore. It's a great place to do business. It's a great market. Obviously, we need a return of all consumers, foreign consumers to enhance it. But do we want to invest money in Singapore, we sure do. We should get our product better. We have a lot of work to do in the building right now. We're actually embarking on an ambitious reinvestment program in the current asset to bring up to a better standard. And then we want to build our second phase as soon  as we resolve everything. So we're -- just like Macao, we're lucky to be there. And the idea we did -- we can do $5-plus billion post-pandemic is pretty encouraging. It can be more. We think it can be a lot more. Yes."

I think Grant's comments to start off as a little sobering about sort of expectations of when we can start thinking about a recovery relative to kind of what's going on with the pandemic in China. And if we step back for a second, maybe it's a little harder for us over here, sometimes to monitor exactly the nuances of some of the vaccine developments. But one thing that's increasingly separating the U.S. recovery narrative from overseas is probably that to some degree. So I'm wondering if we could get a little bit of thought around maybe some of the vaccination programs and what the expectations are around that for maybe within Macao, broader thoughts on the local area there, possibly Hong Kong and then how that could branch out to China in terms of -- is that what we may need to really see a more concrete reopening for this entire market at this stage?"

I think, Shaun, firstly, we have to stand back and look at the domestic Chinese economy during the course of -- especially the second half of 2020. So it is different from the western economies, largely the domestic economy was recovering very strongly. So this is without, obviously, vaccination being applied to the whole population. And that's obviously attributable to the fantastic control of the pandemic. So as you look into the fourth quarter, you're getting the 6.5% GDP growth in domestic China without the vaccination. So that's a very, very strong outcome. And obviously, the consumer is getting stronger across the board. So I think we have to look at China in a slightly different way. The strategy is to continue to control to basically 0 local cases. And whether that is achieved through vaccination, whether that is achieved through what they've already been doing. Clearly, there is a path either way to clearing the locations and localities from the virus. And that will enable travel to resume more normally between Mainland China and Macao. So I think that's the first and most important point. 
In terms of the vaccine strategy, locally, you've seen comments from the local governments of both SARs, both Hong Kong and Macao, both have a strategy to procure a number of different vaccines, actually 3 from 3 different providers. And both cities are looking to procure the first batch during the first quarter as we understand. So the local populations in the SARs will also be looking at a vaccination program in the months ahead. But really, the most important thing is still controlling the pandemic in terms of the local cases inside China itself. 
And if Macao then can be part of the domestic travel bubble, in a bigger way, in an easier way in a more fluid way than has been the case up to now, then obviously, the tourism and the consumption spend will come back very strongly. And there has been progress. I think it's -- obviously, it's from a low base, but there has been progress. There has been a gradual easing up of the logistics and the getting used to some of the guidelines throughout the course of the fourth quarter. But again, the central point is as the worldwide pandemic got worse in the winter months, there are more imported cases that leads to more isolated outbreaks in some of the provinces in China. Then obviously, that puts pressure on restrictions again and the travel advisories that are issued by various different local governments and entities, especially prior to Chinese New Year, which is, as you know, a huge -- a period of huge migration of the population and travel. 
So that obviously rightly gives some consideration from the perspective of authorities that we need to be very careful at this stage, which is very delicate. So again, another important point is as the pandemic -- obviously, if it subsides in the rest of the world as well, than that imported risk reduces, and that obviously relieves the pressure inside China as well, which hopefully is another factor that would lead to a normalization of the travel between Macao and Mainland China."

Actually, the amendment to Article 303 of the criminal law has been enacted. It was enacted about 2 weeks ago. And as you appreciate, this law, this amendment deals with people organizing, gambling, running casinos and particularly organizing citizens of China to go outside of the country to participate in gambling. Now there were -- the inactive version made 2 changes of the previous draft. First, the definition of the criminal actor, which they tried to come up with a definition, was removed. So they just use a catch-all phrase of whoever organizes. So this is to avoid people arguing who falls into the net. 
The second change appears to be a bit positive, but it's still ambiguous for Macao is that in the legislation, they specifically say outside of the country, which, as you all appreciate, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan is generally considered within the country. But then they leave an ambiguity equity there by putting the word offshore inside the bracket after outside the country. Now this introduces the ambiguity, and I was discussing this with both our lawyers in Beijing and the local NPC, National People's Congress, people attending the session. 
And they said that while the central people's government recognizes the special status of Macao, they do not want Macao to be exploited as a base for organizing such activities to take people outside of the country, such as the Southeast Asian countries. And as we all know, the Ministry of Tourism has compiled and is compiling a black list of countries to which they are known to be accommodating gambling from Chinese citizen. So to us, there is certain ambiguity, which will ultimately be decided by the authorities and the courts going forward. But at this stage, it is for sure that any person or a junket trying to use Macao as a base to organize gambling to other countries would be condemned."

Structurally, we've seen, obviously, the power and the growth of the premium mass over the last several years, and that trend is going to continue, whether it's pre-pandemic, during and after. And the reality of that is because the players, the customers, they want to deal directly with the owners of operators of these great assets. And obviously, the great lifestyle destination that would provide the multitude of amenities and the services that we're able to offer is very, very appealing. 
So I think that will continue. So your reference to is there a transfer from one segment to another? I think structurally, there has been over the last several years anyway. And that's one of the brilliant things about Sheldon's Integrated Resort model is that we can offer everything from the entertainment, to the retail, to the food and beverage, the spas, all of these non-gaming lifestyle amenities. So that trend is structural, and that's why we strategically invested in products that serve this segment.
In terms of specifically what's happening now, the situation is -- you referenced, it's more related to issues specific to the system in the junket segment, and that has stabilized at low levels of volumes. And obviously, as a result of some of those issues, you may see that as new demand resurfaces resumes in the coming years that, that new demand is captured directly by the operators rather than through intermediaries. That also is true. But I think the overarching trend was there before anyway and would have continued in that manner. It's just that what's happened in the last 12 months may somewhat accelerate that trend. But it was going to be a big structural trend and driver for years to come anyway."

Some brief comments then we'll write the Q&A Our results reflect the pandemic impact we did generate $244 million of EBITDA for the quarter.

Obviously, we cannot define the timing of the full recovery, but it's underway and we will continue in 2021. 
At this time, Singapore is in the $500 million to $600 million range annually EBITDA. There is no visibility as to when air traffic will return to Singapore. And unlike Macao, it's more difficult to project additional our incremental EBITDA from MBS until the resumption of of the material air travel. Our investments in Macao continue to take shape as the market recovers, FCs and London will present at large growth opportunities for us, and we continue to have the largest structure in this incredible market of Macao. And China continues to demonstrate economic resilience. The spending in Macao is very strong at the premium mass level for both the gaming and a retail perspective and referenced on Page 29 and 30 invest from a retail perspective, there's some pleasant surprises there. But again, we have no reservations on our ability to perform to pre-pandemic levels once visitation returns.
Our company today is sort of divided in 3 different areas: The Asia portfolio, Macao and Singapore. And while believe Macao will accelerate this year and lead the recovery, Singapore follow-up on resumption of air travel and participate in the recovery as well, and we anticipate a return to a $5 billion-plus EBITDA from Asia in the future.

How do you think about the use of those proceeds in light of some of the opportunities?

We're hopeful that will happen sooner and later. You know that our project in Singapore, our Phase 2 project is -- we're still continuing to work through those issues there. We continue to look at other Asian opportune, large-scale fusion opportunities. And then, of course, we think in the U.S., there may be some opportunities for us here. And lastly, digital. I think we look at everything individually and look at the returns and -- but our priority remains getting back on our feet in Asia back to a $5-plus billion EBITDA and maintain -- that's the backbone of our company. That's what we'll start first. If something opportunistic opens up in U.S., Bob is with the bet. If something opens up digitally, we're deep into a digital and deep dig to figure out have deployed capital and intelligent to get a return.

And so when we look at the dividend, it really was and hopefully will be in the future, really the cornerstone, and you've heard me say that before, of a return of capital program. And I think where we are today is that we're going to look for operations to return to a baseline level and get a sense of where those operations are trending and then make an assessment with the Board and with management looking at our long-term potential to where the dividend should be given our ability to reinvest and allocate capital to other projects that are higher growth. And so I think it's pretty consistent with what you've heard us say before in calls, and nothing's changed from that perspective."

But obviously, There is some consternation in the investment community around the status of VIP in Macao and the direction of the IP going forward in Macao, whether or not there's a perception that, that will have a positive or negative impact on the premium mass segment. One could obviously make the case that VIP customers who are having a harder time accessing capital, who do like to could obviously move into the mass segment or premium mass segment, which wouldn't be the worst thing to happen or the fact that maybe some of that still overplay from VIP, if the VIP is softer doesn't show up in mass.

So The segments are actually following very different trajectories, and we would expect that to continue for the time being. And of course, your question about whether there's spillover, whether there's migration I don't think those dynamics have really changed since a few years ago that there is a structural change over time, where more of the customers and more of the new customers are dealing directly with the casino operators program. And of course, the great assets on the integrated resort that all of the operators, including us, we've built up, have attracted more and more of these consumers to the premium mass program, and we expect that to continue over time as these non-gaming lifestyle assets and products continue to attract people to play in our programs."

In March, we started to experience a pretty meaningful rebound in visitations versus January and February. And as you've seen from the figures released by MGTO, that has continued on a similar momentum in April with visitations reaching post-pandemic highs in the mid of April. So the acceleration is seen across -- very encouragingly across all the different segments, whether you're talking about premium mass, mass. But the encouraging thing is that since March, we've really seen an acceleration in the base mass as well as the leisure FIT guests at the hotel, of course, retail, especially at the high-end consumption end of things. And we've even had an initial resumption of the MICE segment activity in March and bookings for Q2 look encouraging for the MICE as well, which is a surprise.

It was a strong spot market before he got there, just has gotten better over the years with the -- our ability to provide a big quality product. But that's the driver, no question about it. But without that foreign visitation, it's hard to grow the premium mass in the high-end table business. So we convince drug line, I think we'll stay in this range until things improve.

On the subject of London, well, I think if you take a step back, we opened our first new product in the Four Seasons at Grand Suites last year, and that has progressed exceptionally well in terms of customer feedback. And so clearly, that is more targeted at the premium mass and the long-stay leisure family guests. And then when we got to early part of 2021, as you referenced, we opened the first phase of Londoner. That's really the main London hotel and the north side of the building with the Crystal Palace Atrium and some of the signature food and beverage outlets and some other tractions that we've opened up so far. And I think it's important to remember that a large part of the building, namely on the south side, the Sheraton side, is still under heavy construction actually both on the interior as well as the exterior side because we have been bringing forward the construction works on that side of the building to take advantage of the low levels of traffic. So in terms of your question about segmentation, it really follows the trajectory of the initial recovery that we see in Macao right now. Therefore, not very much in terms of base mass traffic, and that's both because of the demand side but also the fact that the south side of the building is undergoing large-scale construction, and it's really focused more on the premium mass segment as well as the FIT leisure gues. We've enjoyed a resumption of the FIT segment in the various hotels that we have in the London and Macao. But clearly, there's a lot more come in the remainder of the year into early part of next year in terms of the products that are coming online. We've got second or Suite Hotel London core opening up later on the year. The Sheraton side, we're going to have the second [ WOW ] space, Atrium shakes base hall coming online imminently in the second quarter. Obviously, we still have the London arena. and another, call it, 6, 7, 8 food and beverage outlets, together with the theme attractions in the property as well as the retiming of the retail shops.

In Macao, Singapore, the more difficult because, again, until the resumption of air traffic and foreign travel. I think Singapore is going to lag their pre-pandemic levels.

Some brief comments then we'll write the Q&A Our results reflect the pandemic's impact we did generate $244 million of EBITDA for the quarter. And we continue to have a strong belief in the Macao recovery because the March numbers were very different from those in January and February and the recent visitation numbers and whether in this for April reflect continued acceleration. Obviously, we cannot define the timing of the full recovery, but it's underway and we will continue in 2021.  
At this time, Singapore is in the $500 million to $600 million range annually EBITDA. There is no visibility as to when air traffic will return to Singapore. And unlike Macao, it's more difficult to project additional our incremental EBITDA from MBS until the resumption of the material air travel. Our investments in Macao continue to take shape as the market recovers, Four Seasons and Londoner will present, I think large growth opportunities for us, and we continue to have -- we do have the largest structure in this incredible market of Macao. And China continues to demonstrate economic resilience. The spending in Macao is very strong the premium mass level for both the gaming and a retail perspective and referenced on Page 29 and 30 in invest from a retail perspective, there's some pleasant surprises there. But again, we have no reservations on our ability to perform to pre-pandemic levels once visitation returns. 
Our company today is sort of divided in 3 different areas: The Asia portfolio, Macao and Singapore. And while we believe Macao will accelerate this year and lead the recovery, Singapore follow-up on resumption of air travel and participate in the recovery as well, and we anticipate a return to a $5 billion-plus EBITDA from Asia in the future. 
On the sale of Las Vegas assets enable us to have huge optionality to explore large sale land-based destination works in both United States and Asia. And finally, we have -- we're eager to have a material digital presence in the future. We are exploring multiple opportunities at the present time. This is obviously a departure from our historical approach, and we'll update you at the appropriate time.

But in your prepared remarks, obviously, you talked about some of the Asia opportunities. And clearly, upon the completion of the Las Vegas sale, which obviously came at a very nice multiple for you guys, and I'm sure you're having very nice proceeds coming out of it. How do you think about the use of those proceeds in light of some of the opportunities? You're obviously kind of eyeing in Asia relative to, obviously, the return of a dividend, potential for buybacks longer term, potentially owning more things China, all of the above? How do you kind of prioritize that pecking order and acknowledging you could do several of those things kind of what the balance sheet and the position that it's in?"

We're hopeful that'll happen sooner than later. You know that our project in Singapore, our phase 2 project is -- we're still continuing to work through those issues there. We continue to look at other Asian -- large-scale Asian opportunities. And then, of course, we think in the U.S., there may be some opportunities for us here. And lastly, digital. I think we look at everything individually and look at the returns and -- but our priority remains getting back on our feet in Asia be back to a $5-plus billion EBITDA and maintain -- that's the backbone of our company. That's what we'll start first. If something opportunistic opens up in U.S., Bob is with the bat and if something opens up digitally, we're deep into a digital and deep dive to figure out -- have deployed capital and intelligently to get a return.

And so when we look at the dividend, it really was and hopefully will be in the future, really the cornerstone, and you've heard me say that before, of a return of capital program. And I think where we are today is that we're going to look for operations to return to a baseline level and get a sense of where those operations are trending and then make an assessment with the Board and with management looking at our long-term potential to where the dividend should be given our ability to reinvest and allocate capital to other projects that are higher growth. And so I think it's pretty consistent with what you've heard us say before in calls, and nothing's changed from that perspective."

But obviously, There is some consternation in the investment community around the status of VIP in Macao and the direction of the VIP going forward in Macao, whether or not if there's a perception that, that will have a positive or negative impact on the premium mass segment. One could obviously make the case that VIP customers who are having a harder time accessing capital, who do like to go -- could obviously move into the mass segment or premium mass segment, which wouldn't be the worst thing to happen or the fact that maybe some of that still overplay from VIP, if the VIP is softer doesn't show up in mass.

So the segments are actually following very different trajectories, and we would expect that to continue for the time being. And of course, your question about whether there's spillover, whether there's migration I don't think those dynamics have really changed since a few years ago that there is a structural change over time, where more of the customers and more of the new customers are dealing directly with the casino operators program. And of course, the great assets on the integrated resort that all of the operators, including us, we've built up, have attracted more and more of these consumers to the premium mass program, and we expect that to continue over time as these non-gaming lifestyle assets and products continue to attract people to play in our programs."

In March, we started to experience a pretty meaningful rebound in visitations versus January and February. And as you've seen from the figures released by MGTO, that has continued on a similar momentum in April with visitations reaching post-pandemic highs in the mid of April. So the acceleration is seen across -- very encouragingly across all the different segments, whether you're talking about premium mass, mass. But the encouraging thing is that since March, we've really seen an acceleration in the base mass as well as the leisure FIT guests at the hotel, of course, retail, especially at the high-end consumption end of things. And we've even had an initial resumption of the MICE segment activity in March and bookings for Q2 look encouraging for the MICE as well, which is a surprise. But I think what you can see is a broad-based recovery in the different segments since early March."

On the subject of Londoner, well, I think if you take a step back, we opened our first new product in the Four Seasons, the Grand Suites last year, and that has progressed exceptionally well in terms of customer feedback. And so clearly, that is more targeted at the premium mass and the long-stay leisure family guests. And then when we got to early part of 2021, as you referenced, we opened the first phase of Londoner. That's really the main Londoner hotel and the north side of the building with the Crystal Palace Atrium and some of the signature food and beverage outlets and some other tractions that we've opened up so far. 
And I think it's important to remember that a large part of the building, namely on the south side, the Sheraton side, is still under heavy construction -- actually both on the interior as well as the exterior side because we have been bringing forward the construction works on that side of the building to take advantage of the low levels of traffic. So in terms of your question about segmentation, it really follows the trajectory of the initial recovery that we see in Macao right now. Therefore, not very much in terms of base mass traffic, and that's both because of the demand side but also the fact that the south side of the building is undergoing large-scale construction. And it's really focused more on the premium mass segment as well as the FIT leisure guest. We've enjoyed a resumption of the FIT segment in the various hotels that we have in the Londoner Macao. But clearly, there's a lot more to come in the remainder of the year into early part of next year in terms of the products that are coming online. We've got second all-suite hotel Londoner opening up later on the year. The Sheraton side, we're going to have the second wow space, atrium Shakespeare hall coming online imminently in the second quarter. Obviously, we still have the London arena. and another, call it, 6, 7, 8 food and beverage outlets, together with the theme attractions in the property as well as the retheming of the retail shops. So hopefully, that gives you a sense of where we are today."

So we -- I don't think there's any concerns that you've seen the correction on the rent concessions, you've seen it go the right direction. But we're very pleased with the caveat that we want to see a return to mass traffic as well as various people driving these large performances. But yes, we expect it to look a lot like pre-pandemic levels, hopefully, as the year continues. And in Macao -- Singapore, the more difficult because, but again, until the resumption of air traffic and foreign travel. I think Singapore is going to lag their pre-pandemic levels. And again, we feel much more aggressive in the return of Macao than we do at Singapore at this time because we don't see the vaccination kicking as large in the region, nor do we see air traffic -- any visibility in the resumption of air traffic.

And I don't think it necessarily in our thought process -- just simply in the U.S., it may be outside in Europe, it would not be in Asia because we would not do something that upsets the governments we do business within Asia.

And with our balance sheet with the sale of Las Vegas, again, we have outsized capital to look at these things. When we build organically or buy something remains to be determined. We won't do something just to do something. It'll be something that's intelligent, well thought out and profitable. And I think we all see -- not just LVS, but we can see the opportunities there for digital market that goes to 20%, 30%, 40%, who knows the numbers. The numbers keep growing in people's minds. And I think there is a belief that the digital market will become probably the hugely opportunistic for people like us, but we plan be part of that. But again, it's growing in each for us. We're just learning the business. And I don't think it's a question of selling Las Vegas takes off the table in fact. I think the sale Las Vegas puts us again even further because it provides the capital and the incentive to grow. 
At the same time, I think people have this speed and work concept or if you're a land-based, you can't be digital, you have to be -- we're not either we're going to be a land-based player for years to come, making probably $5-plus billion in Asia in the near future. We're going to be a digital player and we'll still look at -- there's some speculation we want to lead the U.S. market, which is absolutely untrue. We just felt it was a better place to earn more returns on our capital then in Las Vegas. And we think we can be in multiple businesses. We need digital, land-based, Asia, U.S., where the opportunities grow that's where we'll grow. And we're not tied to any one strategy and one thought process."

Just some brief comments, and we'll go right to Q&A. Our results continue to reflect the pandemic's impact. We did generate positive EBITDA of $244 million per quarter, about the same as the first quarter. Our 
Macau performance reflected sequential improvement but pandemic-related travel restrictions continue to impact our performance. We do remain confident in the eventual recovery in both Macao and Singapore, and we cannot define the timing of recovery that's underway and will continue in 2021. Singapore remains in the $500 million to $600 million range annually, although the second quarter was impacted by heightened pandemic-related restrictions for a portion of the quarter, will also be subject to closures of both portions of MBS from today through August 5 as part of COVID-19-related protocols. This will obviously have a negative impact on Q3 results. 
And as if, there remains no visibility as to when air traffic will return in Singapore, unless Macau, is difficult to project additional EBITDA from MBS until the resumption of their travel. 
Our considerable investments in Macao continues to date as the market recovers Four Seasons and Londoner will present growth opportunities, and we continue to have the largest footprint in this incredible market. China continues to demonstrate economic resilience. The spending in Macao's very strong at the premium mass level from both a gaming and retail perspective referenced pages 29 and 30 in the deck. 
We do have great optimism about our ability to form to pre-pandemic levels once [indiscernible] returns and other company is dividing the 3 areas, the Asian portfolio in Macau and Singapore, while we believe Macao will accelerate in the second half of this year in lead recovery. Singapore will follow up on the resumption of air travel. We are confident we'll return to a $5 billion plus EBITDA from Asia in the future.

And finally, in the early comes of building out our digital presence, we are exploring multiple opportunities present.

I think B2B presents a very significant opportunity for us. David has a has a great history, and we're really looking forward to him getting started, and we're happy that he joined us. 
I think we'll provide updates as we make progress. It's still very early stages, but we're looking forward to being able to deploy capital over many years, and really look at this from the long term and create a lot of long-term shareholder value. 
And I think in the future, you'll see us looking at other things and other opportunities. As Rob has said on other calls, we're going to be very patient. We're going to be prudent and we look for opportunities where we see ways to create real value in the long term.

And so from that standpoint, it's really a limited universe of people who are a true competitive set, particularly in some of the larger geographies where B2B services model could really be productive. So I think from our standpoint, we are a little bit neutral, like we believe we are from the sense that in a lot of the markets that we might look to target, we don't have any land-based operations and don't have any B2C operations where we could find customers from a B2B business model standpoint.

It's something that the Macao government and the Chinese government will have to look at very carefully. They also have their own preoccupation at this stage. For example, the Macao government, apart from still working very hard on making sure that Macao remains a safe city in all the precautionary measures against COVID. They are now preparing for the next legislative council election, which is due on the 12th of September. 
So the government is operating at a pace where they feel they want to launch the public consultation for the concession renewal towards the second half of this year, which we believe might mean that it will only happen after the legislative council election. 
Now I don't think the government is in a rush to renew the license because they want to do things right. And as we all know, there are many legal issues they have to attend to such as the concession and subconcession issue. And this -- they can only go to the legislative council when the new council is in place. 
And then so for -- at this stage, we are really focusing on doing our best, aligning our interest with the government, such as focusing on investment and reinvestment opportunities, building out our properties, improving our operational efficiencies, maintaining a stable workforce, which is very important during this pandemic. And I think if things will pan itself out eventually because as we move closer to the expiry of the concession naturally, the extension of the concession is an option which the government will have to look at. But at this stage, there is nothing official and we have no previous information."

I think the key thing is what Rob just said, which is there's a certain amount of uncertainty around the timing and availability of when we can actually get things done. A lot of the early parts of this project required us to work with certain government agencies to seek their approval and to work with them collaboratively to ensure that we fulfill the obligations and their desires as well as part of this project. 
It's a very tight site. It's 8 acres. There's a lot of programming, a lot of density, a lot of things that have to be worked through and a lot of things that have to be integrated into the current environment to make it right. And so we're starting to work through some of those things. But as a practical matter in the nature of a construction project of this complexity and size would always be challenging in a normal environment. So I think we're just trying to be cautious and make sure that we understand all the different parameters around labor and around construction time lines before we say that this is a schedule that is not achievable is achievable. 
I think a lot of it depends on the environment and how things go in terms of concession -- excuse me, COVID recovery over the next couple of months. We'll have a much better for you at that time.

But you go further down to mid level in the base mass, the spending power is definitely prominent. However, you can see from the visitations, they are still around, let's say, low 20% of where we were before the pandemic. 
So the base mass is clearly impacted by just the drastic reduction in the number of people visiting. But the people who are coming are actually staying longer and in most cases, even more. And I think what was encouraging sequentially, although June was somewhat of a temporary hiccup.

Just some brief comments, and we'll go right to Q&A. Our results continue to reflect the pandemic's impact. We did generate positive EBITDA of $244 million per quarter, about the same as the first quarter.
Our Macao performance reflected sequential improvement, but pandemic-related travel restrictions continue to impact our performance. We do remain confident in the eventual recovery in both Macao and Singapore, and we cannot define the timing of the full recovery that's underway and will continue in 2021. 
Singapore remains in the $500 million to $600 million range annually, although the second quarter was impacted by heightened pandemic-related restrictions for a portion of the quarter. We will also be subject to closures of both portions of MBS from today through August 5 as part of COVID-19-related protocols. This will obviously have a negative impact on Q3 results. 
And as if, there remains no visibility as to when air traffic will return in Singapore, unless Macao, it is difficult to project additional EBITDA from MBS until the resumption of air travel.
Our considerable investments in Macao continues to take shape as the market recovers Four Seasons and Londoner will present growth opportunities, and we continue to have the largest footprint in this incredible market. China continues to demonstrate economic resilience. The spending in Macao's very strong at the premium mass level from both a gaming and retail perspective. You may want to reference Pages 29 and 30 in your deck. 
We do have great optimism about our ability to form to pre-pandemic levels once [ the vacation ] returns. Our company is dividing the 3 areas, the Asian portfolio in Macao and Singapore. While we believe Macao will accelerate in the second half of this year and lead recovery, Singapore will follow up on the resumption of air travel. We are confident we'll return to a $5 billion plus EBITDA from Asia in the future. 
The sale of the Las Vegas assets create liquidity and vast optionality to explore large land-based destination resorts in United States and Asia.

For example, the Macao government, apart from still working very hard on making sure that Macao remain a safe city in all the precautionary measures against COVID. They are now preparing for the next legislative council election, which is due on the 12th of September. 
So the government is operating at a pace where they feel they want to launch the public consultation for the concession renewal towards the second half of this year, which we believe might mean that it will only happen after the legislative council election.
Now I don't think the government is in a rush to renew the license because they want to do things right. And as we all know, there are many legal issues they have to attend to such as the concession and subconcession issue. And this -- they can only go to the legislative council when the new council is in place. 
And then so for -- at this stage, we are really focusing on doing our best, aligning our interest with the government, such as focusing on investment and reinvestment opportunities, building out our properties, improving our operational efficiencies, maintaining a stable workforce, which is very important during this pandemic. 
And I think that things will pan itself out eventually because as we move closer to the expiry of the concession, naturally, the extension of the concession is an option which the government will have to look at. But at this stage, there is nothing official and we have no privy information."

A lot of the early parts of this project required us to work with certain government agencies to seek their approval and to work with them collaboratively to ensure that we fulfill the obligations and their desires as well as part of this project. 
It's a very tight site. It's 8 acres. There's a lot of programming, a lot of density, a lot of things that have to be worked through and a lot of things that have to be integrated into the current environment to make it right. And so we're starting to work through some of those things. 
But as a practical matter, the nature of the construction project of this complexity and size would always be challenging in a normal environment. So I think we're just trying to be cautious and make sure that we understand all the different parameters around labor and around construction time lines before we say that this schedule that is not achievable is achievable. 
I think a lot of it depends on the environment and how things go in terms of concession work -- excuse me, COVID recovery over the next couple of months. We'll have a much better view at that time.

I think the trends have been pretty consistent in the last 6 months. You see, I think, very strong consumption propensity, great strength in spending power for those who have returned to Macao for leisure trips. And I think that applies across the different segments. 
But obviously, clearly, the premium mass, the segment has returned in greater volume, greater number of patrons. But you go further down to mid-level in the base mass, the spending power is definitely prominent. However, you can see from the visitations, they are still around, let's say, low 20% of where we were before the pandemic. 
So the base mass is clearly impacted by just the drastic reduction in the number of people visiting. But the people who are coming are actually staying longer and in most cases, even more. And I think what was encouraging sequentially, although June was somewhat of a temporary hiccup. What was encouraging was we saw the greatest amount of sequential growth in the base mass and the FIT segments versus Q1 order premium mass continue to recover, the bigger bounce back was actually in the base mass. So we hope to see some of those mix of encouraging trends continue into the summer, summer holidays and beyond."

So I think it's hard to make inferences like into the future. It's probably a trend, it's just an anomaly. I think that's going to be the case until this thing resolves, as air traffic have been down on Singapore. You can see these trends, both good and bad, they are confusing. 
And I think in the case of it's very difficult to look at Singapore's numbers, come up with a clear direction where it goes and the sloppy performance confused all of us initially.

But the truth is if you look at the statistics, China today has already administered 1.5 billion doses of vaccine. Now that really means that over 50%, 60% of the population has been vaccinated. 
And if you assume everyone has 2 doses, that represents 53%. And they're still vaccinating at over 10 million doses a day. So what it means is that every 25 days, they can increase that vaccination rate by 10%. Now that is also, to some extent, true for Hong Kong and Macao. Hong Kong already administered 5 million doses and its vaccination rate is already over 40%.
Macao administered 460,000 doses. That's also over 40% of the population. So we're quite confident that if China continues in that rate, and with the increase of vaccination rate by about 10% per 25 days, when you come to winter, then almost the whole population, like 90%, 80% would be vaccinated.
Now I think once we reach that level, that travel bubble within China, including Hong Kong and Macao, it's really possible. Now what you have seen in the news is that because China adopts a non-tolerance policy towards COVID, so whenever there's some outbreak in certain areas in the country, it's widely reported and they immediately go back to lockdown.

And I think while we're doing that, we have ample liquidity to do anything we want to do anywhere and in a large scale. So that will be my thought 3 to 5 years from now. Patrick, your sentiments?"

And the great thing is that we've just invested $2.2 billion in Macao. We feel very strongly about the market. And the potential to invest more post concession renewals, we feel very strongly about the expansion in Singapore and our long-term commitment. Singapore is a very unique tourism destination and a high quality of earnings potential that we'll get from Singapore. 
And then looking to the U.S., these are just great locations. And looking at the digital opportunity, we feel really strongly about the returns and the potential growth that's in this area. So from a company standpoint, 5 years from now, we could be looking like a very different company in terms of our scale. 
And to Rob's point earlier, I think our balance sheet and the capability that the liquidity from the sale of Las Vegas presents -- allows us to pursue all of these opportunities. So we're very bullish about it."

Good afternoon, and good morning to our colleagues in Asia, and thank you for joining our call today. I'll provide some brief comments and we'll go to the Q&A. Our results continue to reflect the pandemic impact, heightened restrictions directly impacted our results in both Macau and Singapore this quarter, we did generate positive EBITDA for the quarter in both markets, and we remain confident in the eventual recovery in both with Macau and Singapore. gaming operations are closed for a portion of the quarter, enhanced restrictions were in place throughout the remainder of the quarter. The good news in Singapore is the travel corridors are being established with a number of source markets which hopefully will contribute to the strong recovery overtime. Our considerable investments in Macau continue to take shape. As the market recovers, we believe the Four Seasons in London will present growth opportunities in the future.
The spending in Macao has proven both resilient at the premium mass level from both a gaming and a retail perspective, you see on Page 29 and 30 deck, and we have great optimism about our ability to perform to a pre-pandemic level once visitation does return. Our company is divided to 3 areas. Most importantly is the Asia portfolio in Macau and Singapore. We remain confident we'll return to a strong positive cash flow in both Macau and Singapore in the future as restrictions are eased and travel and tourism recovery. The sale of our Las Vegas assets create liquidity and optionality as we pursue large-scale land-based destination resorts in both the U.S. and Asia. We will continue to build out our digital presence and we're exploring multiple opportunities at the appropriate time in the future. So thanks for your time again today. Let's go to the questions.

On the visas, I think the main point is the Visa channels for the individual business scheme remains open. I think if you look at the quarter in the third quarter, what really impacted results during the quarter, month by month is really the conditions on the ground in terms of domestic COVID cases. So you will see that in July, we had -- at one point for about 3 weeks in July, we had a pretty significant recovery in the visitation and also room occupancy. And we were starting to get a good momentum for the summer after the issues we had in the Guangdong outbreak in June. And then as we moved into late July and early August, we had more local cases, starting with the Nanjing Airport outbreak. And eventually, in early August, we did have 4 local cases. So that obviously curtailed the traffic immediately. And then as we move into September, again, we were recovering well, especially in the second and third week of September. And we were building up ready for the October Golden Week again. And unfortunately, we did have some local cases towards the last week of September, which again reduced the traffic immediately as it led to additional restrictions around the border. So that really explains how the traffic flow evolved during the quarter."

First, I think the fascinating part to me is we operate in 3 markets currently. And Las Vegas is the blueprint, I think for the we said about a year ago, I know is coming to work and someone told me, in Las Vegas, we wouldn't see normal returns here until revenues until '24 or '25. So in the fall of '21, the market is wide open. And what's the path. The path is pent-up demand, vaccinations and doors get opened. And I think Las Vegas will be the blueprint So vaccinations in Asia are booming, if you can look at what's happening in Singapore and Malaysia, Japan, China, Korea, it's all above the percentage-wise, what's happened in the U.S. So first, we have extremely strong vaccination rates in Asia surpassing the U.S. Number two, I think you've got to obviously have a government that wants to open the doors in Singapore is evidenced by their actions, they wanted just that. I think you're going to see a big turn in '22. The recovery will begin in '22. When do we get back to 1.7 and maybe beyond that I don't know. The exact date, I can't tell you. I can tell you this, it's going to be a lot better in '22 if the government continues their path, which has shown a lot of leadership, thoughtfulness, vaccination rates I think are actually approaching 80-plus percent. The market over there feels it's ready to come back in '22. As the government opens those travel lanes and we look at -- again, the demand issues here in Las Vegas have been, I think, very It's great to walk through here and see the numbers that's kicking out through the entire city. Why wouldn't that happen in Asia. Singapore is a hugely important market to us. Your point about Macau versus the Chinese market. Obviously, part of our business is dependent upon access to the Chinese market, but it's not dependent. We probably could still make a lot of money, maybe as much as $1 billion without a Chinese inputs. So if Korea opens up and Singapore opens up, Malaysia opens up, and Korea and Japan, those markets are very, very and happy for us. And I believe we'll see them start opening up throughout '22. That's the It's a vaccination rate, which is soaring. It's opened traveling. It's opening the doors up and then watching what's happened in Vegas, happened in Singapore. And I feel -- I don't want to identify a month or a quarter, but I think you're going to see a nice turn in '22. And then the same in Macao when the government decides to open those doors up. So I know there's people people say it's '25 to Macau '27. But the truth is, Vegas about 30 minutes. Once we open doors up, it just recovered. And as a gaming base recovery, it's not a convention banquet based recovery actually have to come. So I think the future in Vegas remains, as we've always said, very bright, and there's no reason why it can't be emulated in both Singapore and Macau as vaccination rates take off and governments get more confident and travel lanes reopened. So we're highly confident it's going to happen in Singapore in '22. To what degree, I won't predict, but it's just a question of time for goes right back to where it was pre COVID. It's just inevitable. So we're very confident."

That's something that we may consider in the future depending on where things go and what market opportunity we see. But I think the good news is we've got plenty of firepower.

The so-called 4-year recovery took again about less than a year. I think Singapore is a reliable Las Vegas in terms of the pre-COVID recovery being stronger, which means stronger margins for us and bigger growth. I think this market in Singapore is proving very resilient in the past. It's especially when the government open travelings open the doors up. I think margins will be just fine. We didn't -- by the way, we didn't furlough people a lots of people didn't squeeze people out we stood by our employees. And I think we didn't necessarily maximize We decided not to do that. And I think that's to our credit. But on the other hand, I think our business there will reoccur back to pre-COVID levels and probably beyond pre-COVID. And again, if Vegas is instructive, and I believe it is, the demand is going to be extraordinary in Asia. The lockdown here in Las Vegas was much shorter than lockdown in Asia. Yet the gambling for a lot of the Asian countries is stronger than Las Vegas. So anybody who thinks Singapore is not going to come back with a vengeance, I think is mistaken the same in Macau. And of course, those revenues will drive our margins. So I have no fear that we're going to return to pre-COVID margins and pre-COVID revenues exceed both. In fact, really bullish on Singapore. We're the first and the best place open next year for the gamer or for the tourists or for the leisure traveler. It's going to be exceptional plan to revisit. You see where the government is going. I mean they've indicated they're anxiously get open there. Vaccination rates are showing. The traveling to be established. The neighborhoods being better in Malaysia, Korea, Japan.

Obviously, we made our strength in the mass premium That's been our bread and butter and will continue to be, but I don't think he's every discount. Those who have discount this segment has done it at their own I think it can -- it could move to a different channel, a different way of being available. But the gamers are going to keep happening in all segments in Macau. I just as a to the Grant's comments, I think you have to realize how powerful this market has been the growth has been unbelievable. Those of us who started back in 2002, '03 and '04, never dreamed the way every segment just developed. In the 2010, '11, '12 year, it was the junkets that drove Macau morphed into a premium mass market in our premium mass mass market. And again, our our company has been more focused on those base mass and premium mass segments. But the VIP has served the market very well. So I think it will reemerge in a different form with different channels of distribution. And that's my take. Grant, you're much closer to this, please speak up."

But no matter what form it takes, the game is going to keep growing over there and the desire to come to Macau grows. So whether it be the new assets we built another company, it just enhances the market. And I don't think there will ever be a lack of customers, a lack of visitors to Macau. The problem will be and the market is going back and wherever it's '22, whatever, I think the problem will be lack of capacity, a lack of room. That market is always burdened by new capacity, these new lodging because whether it be base mass, premium mass is no longer a Hong Kong dependent overnight market. It's a market. It's a leisure market, a business market. It's a spectacular market. And we're going to be there with everybody else trying to get our fair share.

Good afternoon, and good morning to our colleagues in Asia, and thank you for joining our call today. I'll provide some brief comments and we'll go to the Q&A.
Our results continue to reflect the pandemic impact, heightened restrictions directly impacted our results in both Macao and Singapore this quarter, we did generate positive EBITDA for the quarter in both markets, and we remain confident in the eventual recovery in both Macao and Singapore. Singapore gaming operations were closed for a portion of the quarter, enhanced restrictions were in place throughout the remainder of the quarter. The good news in Singapore is the travel corridors are being established with a number of source markets which hopefully will contribute to the strong recovery overtime.
Our considerable investments in Macao continue to take shape. As the market recovers, we believe the Four Seasons in London will present growth opportunities in the future. The spending in Macao has proven both resilient at the premium mass level from both a gaming and a retail perspective, you see on Page 29 and 30 in your deck, and we have great optimism about our ability to perform to a pre-pandemic level once visitation does return.
Our company is divided into 3 areas. Most importantly the Asia portfolio in Macao and Singapore. We remain confident we'll return to a strong positive cash flow in both Macao and Singapore in the future as restrictions are eased and travel and tourism recover. The sale of our Las Vegas assets create liquidity and optionality as we pursue large-scale land-based destination resorts in both the U.S. and Asia. We will continue to build out our digital presence and we're exploring multiple opportunities we'll face at the appropriate time in the future.
So thanks for your time again today. Let's go to the questions. Dan?"

Yes, on the visas, I think the main point is the visa channels for the individual business scheme remains open. I think if you look at the quarter -- in the third quarter, what really impacted results during the quarter, month by month is really the conditions on the ground in terms of domestic COVID cases. So you will see that in July, we had -- at one point for about 3 weeks in July, we had a pretty significant recovery in the visitation and also room occupancy. And we were starting to get a good momentum for the summer after the issues we had in the Guangdong outbreak in June.
And then as we moved into late July and early August, we had more local cases, starting with the Nanjing airport outbreak. And eventually, in early August, we did have 4 local cases. So that obviously curtailed the traffic immediately. And then as we moved into September, again, we were recovering well, especially in the second and third week of September. And we were building up ready for the October Golden Week again. And unfortunately, we did have some local cases towards the last week of September, which again reduced the traffic immediately as it led to additional restrictions around the border. So that really explains how the traffic flow evolved during the quarter."

We said about a year ago, when I was coming to work and someone told me, in Las Vegas, we wo",616,"Sure. Yes. First of all I think the fascinating part to me is we operate in 3 markets currently. And Las Vegas is the blueprint, I think for the recovery of Asia. We said about a year ago, when I was coming to work and someone told me, in Las Vegas, we wouldn't see normal returns here until -- revenues until '24 or '25. So here we are in the fall of '21 and the market is blown wide open. And what's the path. The path is pent-up demand, vaccinations and doors get opened. And I think Las Vegas will be the blueprint for Asia. That's the path. So vaccinations in Asia are booming, if you can look at what's happening in Singapore and Malaysia, Japan, China, Korea, it's all above the percentage-wise, what's happened in the U.S. So first, we have extremely strong vaccination rates in Asia surpassing the U.S.
Number two, I think you've got to obviously have a government that wants to open the doors in Singapore is evidenced by their actions, they wanted just that. I think you're going to see a big turn in '22. The recovery will begin in '22. When do we get back to $1.7 million and maybe beyond that EBITDA, I don't know the exact date, I can't tell you. I can tell you this, it's going to be a lot better in '22 if the government continues their path, which has shown a lot of leadership, thoughtfulness, vaccination rates I think are actually approaching 80-plus percent. The market over there feels it's ready to come back in '22.
As the government opens those travel lanes and we look at -- again, the demand issues here in Las Vegas have been, I think, very instructive. It's great to walk through here and see the numbers that's kicking out through the entire city. Why wouldn't that happen in Asia. Singapore has been a hugely important market to us. Your point about Macao versus the Chinese market. Obviously, part of our business is dependent upon access to Chinese market, but it's not dependent. We probably could still make a lot of money, maybe as much as $1.5 billion without a lot of Chinese inputs. So if Korea opens up and Singapore opens up, Malaysia opens up, and Korea and Japan, those markets are very, very sad and happy for us. And I believe we'll see them start opening up throughout '22. That's the path.
It's a vaccination rate, which is soaring. It's opened traveling. It's opening the doors up and then watching what's happened in Vegas, happened in Singapore. And I feel -- I don't want to identify a month or a quarter, but I think you're going to see a nice turn in '22. And then the same will happen in Macao when the government decides to open those doors up. So I know there's people argue that people will say it's '25 to Macao, it end up '27. But the truth is, Vegas is just out 30 minutes. Once we open doors up, it just recovers.
And as a gaming base recovery, it's not a convention banquet-based recovery actually have to come. So I think the future in Vegas remains, as we've always said, very bright, and there's no reason why it can't be emulated in both Singapore and Macao as vaccination rates take off and governments get more confident and travel lanes reopen. So we're highly confident it's going to happen in Singapore in '22. To what degree, I won't predict, but it's just a question of time for LVS goes right back to where it was pre COVID. It's just inevitable. So we're very confident."

The so-called 4-year recovery took again about less than a year. I think Singapore is a viable Las Vegas in terms of the pre-COVID recovery being stronger, which means stronger margins for us and bigger growth. I think this market in Singapore is proving very resilient in the past, especially when the governments come open the travelings, open the doors up, I think margins will be just fine. We didn't -- by the way, we didn't furlough people and lay off lots of people, didn't squeeze people out the door, we stood by our employees. And I think we didn't necessarily maximizing credit. We decided not to do that. And I think that's to our credit.
But on the other hand, I think our business there will reoccur back to pre-COVID levels and probably beyond pre-COVID. And again, if Vegas is instructive, and I believe it is, the demand is going to be extraordinary in Asia. The lockdown here in Las Vegas was much shorter than the lockdown in Asia. Yet the gambling proclivity for lot of Asian countries is stronger than Las Vegas. So anybody who thinks Singapore is not going to come back with a vengeance, I think has mistaken, the same in Macao. And of course, those revenues will drive our margins. So I have no fear that we're going to return to pre-COVID margins and pre-COVID revenues and exceed both. In fact, I'm really bullish on Singapore, will be the first and the best place open next year for the gamer or for the tourists or for the leisure traveler. It's going to be exceptional plan to revisit.
You see where the government is going. I mean they've indicated they're anxiously get open there. Vaccination rates are soaring. The traveling to be established. The neighborhood is being better in Malaysia, Korea, Japan. Indonesia is still lagging, but coming on. So I think it's just question of time, '22 is a turn year.

Again, for the 20-plus years we've been doing business in Macao, we've heard this. This isn't going to work. That's not going to work. This is -- the revenues will never go anywhere. We've been hearing this for often lot. Segment is going to fall apart. The latest thing is to say the VIP is going to go away to the junket. So I just remain a huge believer in that market of all segments. Obviously, we made our strength in the mass premium. That's been our bread and butter and will continue to be, but I don't think there's every discount. Those who have discount this segment has done it at their own prowl. I think it can -- it could move to a different channel, a different way of being available. But the gamers are going to keep happening in all segments in Macao.
As a pre-cursor to Grant's comments, I think you have to realize how powerful this market has been, the growth has been unbelievable. Those of us who started back in 2002, '03 and '04, never have dreamed the way every segment just developed. In the 2010, '11, '12 year, it was the junkets that drilled Macao, that morphed into our premium mass market and now premium mass-mass market. And again, our company has been more focused on those base mass and premium mass segments. But the VIP has served the market very well. So I think it will reemerge in a different form with different channels of distribution. And that's my take. Grant, you're much closer to this, so please speak up."

I think it's important to remember, again, the -- that the proportion of profit coming from that segment especially, I think you're more referencing the junket segment versus our own VIP business is very, very small",121,"No, I think you said it very well, Rob. I think it's important to remember, again, the -- that the proportion of profit coming from that segment especially, I think you're more referencing the junket segment versus our own VIP business is very, very small. It's really low single digit on pre COVID. So I know people spend a lot of time talking about it, but our business is really geared to that large-scale destination resort with premium mass, mass, the leisure, the FIT and the future is going to be that structural growth in those segments as well as the non-gaming, the retail, the mice. And so that's where really our reinvestments and our asset base have really focused on."

That's where our investment is. You'll see the Londoner, that's where the focus was, the Four Seasons is more towards the very high-end premium mass. But no matter what form it takes, the gamer is going to keep growing over there and the desire to come to Macao is going to grow. So whether it'd be the new assets we built another company, it just enhances the market. And I don't think there will ever be a lack of customers, a lack of visitors to Macao.
The problem is going to be and the market is going to be back and wherever it's '22, whatever, I think the problem is going to be lack of capacity, I mean, lack of rooms. That market is always burdened by new capacity, new lodging because whether it's be base mass, premium mass is no longer a Hong Kong dependent overnight market. It's a stay overnight market. It's a leisure market, a business market. It's a spectacular market. And we're going to be there with everybody else trying to get our fair share. And I think our new assets, if you ever get to see them and we're open to the next year are going to surprise you. What we've done with the Londoner and Four Seasons is the best thing we've ever done in my opinion. So we look forward to getting back to Macao and getting back to business."
