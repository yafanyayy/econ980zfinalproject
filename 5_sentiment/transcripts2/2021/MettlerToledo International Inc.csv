I will start with a summary of the quarter, and then Shawn will provide details on our financials. I will then have some additional comments, and we will open the lines for Q&A.
The highlights for the quarter are on Page 3 of the presentation. We ended the year with a very strong fourth quarter, which came in better than we expected. Local currency sales increased 7% in the quarter, and growth was relatively broad-based throughout the world. Our laboratory business and our Chinese business did particularly well in the quarter. We benefited from strong execution, and we are well positioned to capture growth as customer demand improved. However, we continued to be negatively impacted by COVID-19 in certain areas.
From the onset of the global pandemic, our focus has been to identify and pursue pockets of growth within our end markets. And to be well positioned to capture growth as demand improved, which is what we saw in Q4. Our innovative go-to-market approach really played very well into this environment. And allowed us to capture this growth. Good cost control and the continued benefit of our margin and productivity initiatives contributed to strong growth in adjusted operating profit and very strong growth in adjusted EPS in the quarter.
Finally, cash flow, not one in the quarter, but also for the full year was excellent. 2020 was an extraordinary year with some of the most challenging market conditions we have faced in more than a decade. Our organizational agility helped us to quickly adapt approaches and processes to the new environment. Our broad end-market diversification and the use of sophisticated data analytics allowed us to shift our sales and marketing focus to the most promising end markets early on. It also helps to ensure we were well positioned to capture growth as demand improved during the latter part of the year. We adapted our supply chain and service organization to maintain superior performance that strengthened our franchise and introduced many new digital sales and support tools to provide top-quality customer interactions despite the remote settings of our customers and sales teams.
Throughout 2020, we increased our customer engagement and customer satisfaction, which translated into accelerated market share gains in many product categories. With the strong end to 2020, we have very good momentum as we start 2021 and believe we are well positioned to continue to gain share and deliver good results.
We will have some additional comments on 2021. But first, let me turn it to Shawn to cover the financial results."

Sales were $938 million in the quarter, an increase of 7% in local currency. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales increased 11% as currency benefited sales by 4% in the quarter.
On Slide #4, we show sales growth by region. Local currency sales increased 8% in the Americas, 7% in Europe and 8% in Asia/Rest of the World. Local currency sales increased 12% in China in the quarter.
The next slide shows sales growth by region for the full year 2020. Local currency sales increased 2% in the Americas, 1% in Europe and 3% in Asia/Rest of the World. China local currency sales grew 7% in 2020.
On Slide #6, we outlined local currency sales growth by product area. For the fourth quarter, laboratory sales increased 12% and industrial increased 1% with core industrial up 5% and product inspection down 5%. Food retail increased 7% in the quarter. We estimate that we benefited 1% to 2% from COVID tailwinds in the quarter related to our pipette business for COVID testing.
The next slide shows sales growth by product area for the full year. Laboratory sales increased 5%, industrial declined 1% with core industrial up 2% and product inspection down 7%. Food retail declined 4% in 2020.
Let me now move to the rest of the P&L for the fourth quarter, which is summarized on the next slide. Gross margin in the quarter was 59.6%, a 60 basis point increase over the prior year level of 59.0%. Our margin initiatives centered on pricing in Stern Drive as well as temporary cost savings contributed to the margin growth, offset in part by higher transportation costs and unfavorable business mix. R&D amounted to $39.9 million, which represents a 6% increase in local currency. SG&A amounted to $226.4 million, a 5% increase in local currency over the previous year. Increased variable compensation was offset in part by our temporary cost savings and ongoing cost containment initiatives. Adjusted operating profit amounted to $292.8 million in the quarter, which is a 14% increase over the prior year amount of $256.3 million. Operating margins increased 80 basis points in the quarter to 31.2%. We are very pleased with this margin growth. Currency benefited operating profit growth by approximately 2%, but actually hurt operating margin expansion by about 50 basis points.
A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization amounted to $14.7 million in the quarter, interest expense was $9.5 million in the quarter, and other income amounted to $3.7 million. We reduced our effective tax rate for the full year from 20.5% to 19.5%. This is the rate before discrete items and adjusting for the timing of stock option exercises in the quarter. We are very pleased with this reduction and expect to maintain this rate in 2021.
Moving to fully diluted shares, which amounted to $24 million in the quarter and is a 3% decline from the prior year. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $9.26 and 19% increase over the prior year amount of $7.78. Currency benefited adjusted EPS by approximately 2% in the quarter. On a reported basis in the quarter, EPS was $9.03 as compared to $7.84 in the prior year. Reported EPS in the quarter includes $0.12 of purchased intangible amortization and $0.11 of restructuring. We also had 2 offsetting items for income taxes. We had a $0.20 increase due to the difference between our quarterly and annual tax rate due to the timing of stock option exercises. This was offset by a $0.20 benefit from adjusting our tax rate to 19.5% for the first 3 quarters.
The next slide shows our full year results. Local currency sales increased 2% in 2020, while adjusted operating income increased 8% and adjusted operating margins were up 130 basis points. Adjusted EPS amounted to $25.72, an increase of 13% over the prior year amount of $22.77. Currency was neutral to the full year adjusted EPS. Given the unprecedented challenges we faced in 2020, we are very pleased with our performance and believes it reflects the agility and strong culture of our organization, the effectiveness of our growth and margin expansion initiatives and resiliency of our end markets. That is it for the P&L.
Now let me cover the cash flow. In the quarter, adjusted free cash flow amounted to $218 million, which is an increase of 20% on a per share basis as compared to the prior year. We are very happy with our cash flow generation. DSO declined approximately 3.5 days in the quarter to 36.5 days as compared to the prior year. We're seeing concrete results from the use of analytics and productivity improvements and receivable collections in cash flow management during this period. ITO came in at 4.3x. For the full year 2020, adjusted free cash flow was $648 million as compared to the prior year amount of $531 million. On a per share basis, this is a 26% increase in earnings flow-through of more than 100%. We are very pleased with this performance, which demonstrates the strength of our franchise as well as our focus on continuous process improvements to drive cash flow generation.
Let me now turn to guidance. Forecasting continues to be challenging, given the uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 and the ultimate impact for the global economy. Market dynamics are fluid and changes in customer demand can happen quickly. With our strong fourth quarter performance, we continue to feel confident about those factors within our control, namely executing on our sales and marketing initiatives and continuing to launch new products with clear value-added benefits to our customers. We believe we have been successful in identifying and capitalizing on pockets of growth and are well positioned to continue to gain share. We also continue to feel positive in our ability to generate margin improvement by our pricing and stern drive initiatives.
Now let me cover the specifics. For the full year 2021, we now expect local currency sales growth will be in the range of 5% to 7% and as compared to 2020. We expect full year adjusted EPS will be in the range of $29.2 to $29.8, which is a growth rate of 14% to 16%. And this compares to previous adjusted EPS guidance in the range of $27.5 to $28.3. With respect to the first quarter, we would expect local currency sales growth to be in the range of 11% to 13% and expected adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.55 to $5.7, a growth rate of 39% to 43%.
Some further comments on 2021 guidance. Let me start with the pacing of the year. We expect the first half of the year will be much stronger than the second half. We are starting the year with excellent momentum coming off a strong Q4. The first half of the year will also benefit from easier comparisons in the continued COVID tailwind in our pipette business. As we look to the second half, we'll face more difficult comparisons, particularly with respect to our business in China. Our COVID tailwinds will also turn to a headwind as we lap comparisons. We also feel more uncertainty exists for the second half of the year, especially with respect to COVID's potential impact to the global economy. We recognize that we're currently benefiting from strong momentum, which will not necessarily continue. We'll provide additional quarterly guidance on our next call, but I thought it would be helpful to provide this context now. Some additional comments on guidance. We expect interest expense to be approximately $40 million in 2021 and total amortization to be approximately $55 million. Other income, which is below operating profit will be approximately $9 million in 2021. As I mentioned earlier, we would expect our effective tax rate in 2021 to also remain at 19.5%. In terms of free cash flow for the year, we expect it to be approximately $690 million. We will continue to repurchase shares and expect to end 2021 in a targeted range of approximately 1.5x leverage ratio.
Some additional details. With respect to the impact of currency on sales growth, we expect currency to increase sales growth by approximately 3.5% in 2021 and 5% in the first quarter. In terms of adjusted EPS, currency will benefit growth by approximately 3% in 2021.
That is it from my side, and I'll now turn it back to Olivier."

Pipette had excellent growth and benefited from COVID-related testing demand. Process Analytics had another quarter of strong growth, while demand for analytical instruments and balances recovered nicely in the quarter. Sales growth in all regions was very strong. We expect lab to continue to be very strong in the first half of 2021 due to favorable biopharma trends, vaccine research and testing of bioproduction scale up and production. Lab will face tougher comparisons in the second half of the year. With our excellent lab product portfolio, including our power demand solutions, focused on automation, digital interfaces and data management and proven spin actor sales and marketing strategies, we believe we're well positioned to continue to capture share. In terms of industrial business, core industrial did well in the quarter with a 5% increase driven by double-digit growth in China. We will return to growth in core industrial in Europe, while Americas was flat, although they had very good growth in the prior year. We are particularly pleased at how resilient our core industrial has proven throughout 2020, given the challenges of the pandemic. We believe this reflects the strength and diversity of our product portfolio, our success in identifying and pursuing pockets of growth and strong focus on execution. Our outlook for core industrial remains solid, but we acknowledge we are not immune to the overall economy and will face difficult comparisons in China during the second half of the year. Product inspection came in weaker than we had anticipated with a 5% decline in the quarter. Both Europe and Asia declined, while Americas was flat with the prior year. While our outlook has improved for this business, and we expect to start 2021 with solid growth, we are cautious as large packaged food companies continue to face operational challenges at their manufacturing sites related to COVID. We believe pent-up demand exists for our instruments, but ultimate timing is still hard to determine. Food retailing came in better than we expected with 7% growth overall and growth in all region.
Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales in Europe increased 7% in the quarter with excellent growth in lab and good growth in core industrial and food retail. We expect solid growth in Europe in 2021. Americas increased 8% in the quarter with excellent growth in lab, offset by flat results in both product inspection and core industrial. We expect good growth in Americas in 2021. The finally, Asia/Rest of the World grew 8% in the quarter with both lab and core industrial doing very well. As mentioned, China had 12% growth in the quarter with excellent growth across product lines. We expect market conditions in China to be very favorable as we start 2021 while they face much tougher comparisons in the second half of the year.
One final comment on the business. Service and consumables were up 13% in the quarter and 8% for the full year.
That concludes my comments on the business. As I reflect on 2020, I'm very pleased with our performance given the exceptional challenges we faced. This performance would not have been possible without the strong foundation and well ingrained corporate programs that we have in place, which allowed us to quickly pivot and adapt to the new environment. We have always considered agility and focus on execution, a key pillar of Mettler-Toledo. And I think you saw evidence of both of these in our results. Probably most important, however, our success in 2020 sets the stage for us to continue to capture growth in 2021 and beyond.
Our strategy over many years has been remarkably consistent. As a leader in fragmented market, we have established strategies that allow us to gain a little market share each year while continuously expanding our margins. The initiatives within these strategies will evolve and develop, but strategies remain the same.
As we look to 2021, let me comment on how we are going about this. I will start with our Spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives. As we discussed on our last call, we made some leapfrog advances in digital transformation during 2020 that position us very well for the future. We will continue to refine our sophisticated analytics to guide our sales force to the best opportunities. We will continue to support our market organization with tools and methodologies to increase sales force time with the most strategic accounts, while leveraging our value selling and cross-selling tools to further penetrate opportunities. We will also continue to leverage digitalization to develop new approaches that drive sales force efficiency and refined techniques to improve the effectiveness of telesales teams but also look forward to returning to visit accounts to generate new opportunities.
Finally, we look to execute more telemarketing campaigns, enhanced tools to increase order conversion. Service will continue to be essential element of our customer value proposition. Our almost 3,000 service technicians are an important competitive advantage for us. This year, we will focus on further high base penetration and utilizing many of the same sales force guidance, telesales and digital tools that we use for product sales to further drive service sales. Our team in China did an exceptional job in 2020. Not one in continuing to serve customers and penetrate growth opportunities, but also in terms of manufacturing and supply chain. The team's priority is to continue to optimize the organization to focus on high potential growth areas and attractive segments and further leverage digital technology to engage customers and generate leads. Introducing products for the local market, such as an entry-level x-ray instrument for our product inspection portfolio is also an important element to growth in China and throughout emerging markets. We remain very optimistic about the growth potential, not one in China, but throughout emerging markets over the medium term. Constantly coming to market with new product launches is another important strategy. Given the diversification of our product portfolio, a new product launch will never be material by itself but together, these launches reinforces our market leadership, help trigger replacement in existing customers, help open doors to new customers and help support our price differentiation. Later this month, we will launch a new automatic laboratory balance that will set a new standard for weighing of powders and liquids in research lab, testing labs and quality control labs. Addressing the needs in the laboratory for automation, smaller sample sizes, flexibility, ease of use and seamless documentation, these new balances offers an unmatched value proposition. It is a simple, fully integrated solution that will support our customers in their everyday operations. It is just 1 example of the many product launches we will have this year, but illustrates how we are continually focused on bringing products to markets that demonstrate clear value to our customers. Similar to the continued evolution of growth strategies, we also continue to develop our pricing and productivity initiatives. We have good developments within pricing, utilizing analytics and some machine learning to most effectively price our offering. On the supply chain side, the team was able to continue to make progress on their turn drive productivity goals in 2020. But we will be able to make further progress in 2021 when the team won't have as many challenges as they faced last year.
Finally, I think you will continue to see us market strategic acquisitions that leverage our technology leadership and global distribution. I acknowledge that we have not had an acquisition for a while, but continue to be believe if we can benefit from acquisitions. However, these acquisitions will be small and strategic, not transformational. I believe our franchise is stronger than ever as demonstrated in how we performed in 2020 despite all the challenges. As I look back over the last decade plus years, we have made much progress in many areas. Our continuous improvement programs of Spinnakers sales and marketing and Stern Drive productivity, which I just discussed, are well engrained throughout our organization and will continue to evolve and be important ingredients for the future.
Emerging markets, an important growth driver are -- 35% of sales today compared with 25% in 2007. Similarly, our faster-growing laboratory business is now 54% of sales, up from 44%. Finally, service and consumables is now 33% of sales as compared to 28%. Redirecting resources and investments to faster-growing businesses has always been at the heart of our initiatives. And these businesses will continue to fuel growth in the future. The strength of the organization and how well we are positioned for the future contributed to my decision to step down as CEO. Under Patrick's leadership, I believe we have the organization, corporate programs, senior leadership team and tools in place to continue to gain share and continue our successful track record.
That concludes our prepared remarks. And now I want to open the line for questions."

And that really drives the demand. And I wouldn't be surprised that this takes another 6 months. There are money production companies here that really hold back on CapEx. And as a reminder, about more than 70% of our revenue in product inspection is coming from food production. So yes, we count on the second half that we would really see a strong pent-up demand.

Now Shawn, do you want to add some flavor to that last comment."

And right now, we're feeling that, that high single-digit would be both in the laboratory and the industrial business. But as Olivier mentioned, the pacing is going to be pretty unique just given the whole situation with the comparison in Q1 of last year and then when we look at the second half of last year as well. So just to be even a little bit more specific on that. In Q1, we're going to -- we expect China to be up mid- to high 20s in terms of growth. But again, that was versus a minus 13% in Q1 of last year. And then, of course, we're going to have to lab some of these tougher comparisons, which included 17% growth in Q3 of last year and now 12% in Q4 of this year."

So we did -- so in the fourth quarter, we did just under 2.5% in terms of price realization. So that was a little bit of an improvement from what we were seeing earlier in the year. I think each quarter, we started to see things progressively get a little bit better. Part of that improvement was that we were able to take a little bit more price on -- in the area of pipette, as you just mentioned. We also were able to do a couple of other things where we're trying to offset some of these higher transportation costs as well. As we look to 2021, we were previously guiding a little bit more cautiously in the 150 basis point kind of a range with the concern that inflationary forecast a few months ago were quite low for 2021, but still feel extremely good about the momentum in the program. Olivier also alluded to a few of those things in the prepared remarks as well. At this point in time, we're looking at probably a range of $150 million to $200 million wouldn't be surprised if we were more towards the higher end of that range. As we kind of see some of the dynamics in the market, we do see some opportunities to maybe gain a little bit more price than we saw maybe a few months ago, and we'll see how that plays out, but that's certainly something on our mind right now. Of course, the other side of that is that some of these opportunities on price are also looking at higher material costs in certain areas that we're mindful of that we might be facing as well, too."

We have this GDP benchmark, and I certainly feel that we are outpacing that. And so that gives us all this confidence. Of the share gain. There are some other data points that we use internally. I mentioned that we leverage data analytics to guide our sales force. Last year, we had a special effort to guide the sales force to noncustomers. We did so because certainly, our sales force spend much less time behind the wheel. They had much more time doing cold calling and engaging new customers through virtual demos and virtual calls. And that was then the base for us to expand the targets to our sales force, and we were very pleased to see the results in converting more than ever noncustomers. So that gives us kind of the confidence that this allows us to win share. So in a nutshell, we feel that we protected well our existing customer base, while we accelerated the access and the conversion to non customers. Certainly a strategy that we're going to pursue. I, many times said, the crisis last year was for us an opportunity to leapfrog some of the changes and that in terms of go to market, leapfrog the adaptation of internal new tools and techniques and 1 of them was certainly all about the sales force guidance and reaching out to non customers, we're going to certainly maintain that one."

We assume a relatively stable environment in terms of second wave. In Europe, we are in the middle of the second wave. We are definitely on a quite a strict lockdown in many of the countries, started already before Christmas. It feels very different to the first lockdown. The business, while we -- or many of us are in home offices we have here an infrastructure and an understanding with our customer base that business is going on. We definitely leverage all these. We have also less customer visits, but effective relationships. And we do not see that the core customer base is putting investments on hold. So that's why the second wave is very different to the first wave when it comes to the business impact. On personal levels, it feels kind of similar, but not on a business level. I if the environment stays about what it is right now, that's probably our base for our guidance here. And I'm not particularly worried that the knockdown situation will significantly impact our business. And that means if the lockdown gets more severe or if everything would certainly ease up, it looks like we have built here a certain resilience in our own business approach as well as the business or the industry segments that we are targeting. I want also to remind, we did quite a shift last year in terms of the industry segments that we are targeting. And that shift we're going to maintain. Don't read too much around the M&A language. It's really in the sense that a reinforcement of the strategy that we have been running in the past. We are very interested in adjacencies. We are interested in companies that fit well in our current business focus and my point was, even that we have here a leadership transition, Patrick and I share a common understanding here that we don't need any transformational acquisitions. We are not seeking any additional leg to the company. We feel we have an excellent franchise, but we want to leverage the franchise when there are good opportunities out there. Again, technology synergies or selected market consolidation opportunities. These are the typical adjacencies that we did in the past and that we certainly are going to continue to pursue."

But then just to kind of link it back to your comment about what we were saying before. We were saying before that we would be a little bit below our typical guide of 70 to 100 in terms of our midterm expectations. So we might be slightly lower, but we're a little bit more optimistic just given the higher sales volume as well in terms of what we'd expect. And I think the other thing to always remind of -- remember is we did 130 basis points this year. So now when we're looking at the 2-year combined growth, we're probably in the 190 to 200 basis point expansion, excluding currency, which we feel really good about.

I would think that the momentum that we see in in the industry segment, like in bioproduction. I don't think it goes necessarily away in the second part of the year. I think that can be actually quite sustainable. Yes, we had modest benefit from investments in vaccine production. But we're -- in terms of share of our total revenue, it remains very small. So if that would slow down, that wouldn't necessarily have a big impact on us. The investment in far more production and particularly also bioproduction, I think has a long way to go.

There was a question asked, which, frankly, I would have liked to have asked too, about market share gains and the success of what you've done in this operating environment where some of your nimble approaches really pay off in a unique way. I wonder if maybe we could just zoom in, though, maybe talk about it, particularly as it relates to service, where your ability to get people in the field in an appropriate way, of course, in the right place might be particularly helpful. Can you talk at all about the extent to which you might see service attach rates or service relationships evolving during the pandemic environment? And then -- sorry, after some very long-winded questions, I'll get back in queue."

We were extremely fast in making sure that we equip our service technician with all the safety gears, and we went very early on, made sure that our customers knew about that. And then we keep we keep really operations going. You will recall what we -- when we talked about Q2, how we did many good things to maintain production going. We were 1 of the first ones that we do production also in China. And similar things that we did also for the service technicians. So we will really up and running. And what we benefit -- continue to benefit from is we do this Net Promoter Score. And we had a very nice jump in customer satisfaction in Q2 that we saw in our NPS, it went on throughout the year. And I feel this gets tribute to our -- really our service force, how well they are performing. Having 3,000 people in the field here is is powerful. Then you need also to know that for service, our biggest competition are local, I would almost say, family-owned companies and for these companies, it is much more difficult to operate in the current COVID environment than for us, where we have a global organization, and we have a lot of professional support of the field force, that's one. And the second one, our efforts to migrate to contract based service was very beneficial that protects a lot of our business."

This -- these are new tools, and so I'm kind of happy to be able to respond to it. So like many other things in the company, I think it's just a really good example of agility. So back in March, we really kind of launched into a variety of crisis management initiatives around COVID. And then 1 of those initiatives, of course, was managed for cash. That's what we refer to it as internally. And so within that initiative, we challenged ourselves to come up with some new analytics, but even more importantly, to try to make the connection between the analytics and the actions to be more efficient. So we literally are broadcasting today individual KPI charge that are highly actionable with like top 10 lists as well on a very daily basis to each finance organization, going to the leader every single day. And we found that, that in itself has become very actionable, and it's allowed them to work with their local management teams and really get people behind areas for improvement. And so that's just 1 example. We've done a lot of other things in the managed for cash initiative during the course of the year. In terms of more legs, we'll see. I think we just hit another good milestone. But when I take a step back, I think the best way to look at it is that our free cash flow conversion this year was over 100%. When we look at next year, we'll probably be right around 100% again. And so I think this is a level that I don't think it's going to get too much more than 100%, but I just think that flow through around 100% is a good range. I'm comfortable looking at that for 2021. And I think as we go out, we'll kind of take it on a year-by-year basis. But right now, we feel really good about the cash flow conversion."

So hopefully, that will come back not to far away but then -- to be seen. So internally, I would say we count on the second part of the year. We were just talking also today with people from the industry.

We benefited from strong execution, and we are well positioned to capture growth as customer demand improved. However, we continued to be negatively impacted by COVID-19 in certain areas.
From the onset of the global pandemic, our focus has been to identify and pursue pockets of growth within our end markets and to be well positioned to capture growth as demand improved, which is what we saw in Q4. Our innovative go-to-market approach really played very well into this environment and allowed us to capture this growth. Good cost control and the continued benefit of our margin and productivity initiatives contributed to strong growth in adjusted operating profit and very strong growth in adjusted EPS in the quarter. Finally, cash flow not only in the quarter but also for the full year was excellent. 
2020 was an extraordinary year with some of the most challenging market conditions we have faced in more than a decade. Our organizational agility helped us to quickly adapt approaches and processes to the new environment. Our broad end market diversification and the use of sophisticated data analytics allowed us to shift our sales and marketing focus to the most promising end markets early on. It also helped to ensure we were well positioned to capture growth as demand improved during the latter part of the year. We adapted our supply chain and service organization to maintain superior performance that strengthened our franchise and introduced many new digital sales and support tools to provide top-quality customer interactions despite the remote settings of our customers and sales teams.
Throughout 2020, we increased our customer engagement and customer satisfaction, which translated into accelerated market share gains in many product categories. With the strong end to 2020, we have very good momentum as we start 2021 and believe we are well positioned to continue to gain share and deliver good results.
We will have some additional comments on 2021. But first, let me turn it to Shawn to cover the financial results."

Sales were $938 million in the quarter, an increase of 7% in local currency. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales increased 11% as currency benefited sales by 4% in the quarter.
On Slide #4, we show sales growth by region. Local currency sales increased 8% in the Americas, 7% in Europe and 8% in Asia/Rest of the World. Local currency sales increased 12% in China in the quarter.
The next slide shows sales growth by region for the full year 2020. Local currency sales increased 2% in the Americas, 1% in Europe and 3% in Asia/Rest of the World. China local currency sales grew 7% in 2020.
On Slide #6, we outline local currency sales growth by product area. For the fourth quarter, Laboratory sales increased 12%, Industrial increased 1% with Core Industrial up 5% and Product Inspection down 5%. Food Retail increased 7% in the quarter. We estimate that we benefited 1% to 2% from COVID tailwinds in the quarter related to our pipette business for COVID testing.
The next slide shows sales growth by product area for the full year. Laboratory sales increased 5%, Industrial declined 1% with Core Industrial up 2% and Product Inspection down 7%. Food Retail declined 4% in 2020.
Let me now move to the rest of the P&L for the fourth quarter, which is summarized on the next slide. Gross margin in the quarter was 59.6%, a 60 basis point increase over the prior year level of 59.0%. Our margin initiatives centered on pricing in Stern Drive as well as temporary cost savings contributed to the margin growth, offset in part by higher transportation costs and unfavorable business mix. R&D amounted to $39.9 million, which represents a 6% increase in local currency. SG&A amounted to $226.4 million, a 5% increase in local currency over the previous year. Increased variable compensation was offset in part by our temporary cost savings and ongoing cost containment initiatives. Adjusted operating profit amounted to $292.8 million in the quarter, which is a 14% increase over the prior year amount of $256.3 million. Operating margins increased 80 basis points in the quarter to 31.2%. We are very pleased with this margin growth. Currency benefited operating profit growth by approximately 2%, but actually hurt operating margin expansion by about 50 basis points.
A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization amounted to $14.7 million in the quarter, interest expense was $9.5 million in the quarter, and other income amounted to $3.7 million. We reduced our effective tax rate for the full year from 20.5% to 19.5%. This is the rate before discrete items and adjusting for the timing of stock option exercises in the quarter. We are very pleased with this reduction and expect to maintain this rate in 2021.
Moving to fully diluted shares, which amounted to $24 million in the quarter and is a 3% decline from the prior year. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $9.26, a 19% increase over the prior year amount of $7.78. Currency benefited adjusted EPS by approximately 2% in the quarter. 
On a reported basis in the quarter, EPS was $9.03 as compared to $7.84 in the prior year. Reported EPS in the quarter includes $0.12 of purchased intangible amortization and $0.11 of restructuring. We also had 2 offsetting items for income taxes. We had a $0.20 increase due to the difference between our quarterly and annual tax rate due to the timing of stock option exercises. This was offset by a $0.20 benefit from adjusting our tax rate to 19.5% for the first 3 quarters.
The next slide shows our full year results. Local currency sales increased 2% in 2020, while adjusted operating income increased 8% and adjusted operating margins were up 130 basis points. Adjusted EPS amounted to $25.72, an increase of 13% over the prior year amount of $22.77. Currency was neutral to the full year adjusted EPS. Given the unprecedented challenges we faced in 2020, we are very pleased with our performance and believe it reflects the agility and strong culture of our organization, the effectiveness of our growth and margin expansion initiatives and resiliency of our end markets. That is it for the P&L.
Now let me cover the cash flow. In the quarter, adjusted free cash flow amounted to $218 million, which is an increase of 20% on a per share basis as compared to the prior year. We are very happy with our cash flow generation. DSO declined approximately 3.5 days in the quarter to 36.5 days as compared to the prior year. We're seeing concrete results from the use of analytics and productivity improvements and receivable collections in cash flow management during this period. ITO came in at 4.3x. 
For the full year 2020, adjusted free cash flow was $648 million as compared to the prior year amount of $531 million. On a per share basis, this is a 26% increase in earnings flow-through of more than 100%. We are very pleased with this performance, which demonstrates the strength of our franchise as well as our focus on continuous process improvements to drive cash flow generation.
Let me now turn to guidance. Forecasting continues to be challenging given the uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 and the ultimate impact for the global economy. Market dynamics are fluid, and changes in customer demand can happen quickly. With our strong fourth quarter performance, we continue to feel confident about those factors within our control, namely executing on our sales and marketing initiatives and continuing to launch new products with clear value-added benefits to our customers. We believe we have been successful in identifying and capitalizing on pockets of growth and are well positioned to continue to gain share. We also continue to feel positive in our ability to generate margin improvement by our pricing and Stern Drive initiatives.
Now let me cover the specifics. For the full year 2021, we now expect local currency sales growth will be in the range of 5% to 7% as compared to 2020. We expect full year adjusted EPS will be in the range of $29.2 to $29.8, which is a growth rate of 14% to 16%. This compares to previous adjusted EPS guidance in the range of $27.5 to $28.3. 
With respect to the first quarter, we would expect local currency sales growth to be in the range of 11% to 13% and expected adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.55 to $5.7, a growth rate of 39% to 43%.
Some further comments on 2021 guidance. Let me start with the pacing of the year. We expect the first half of the year will be much stronger than the second half. We are starting the year with excellent momentum coming off a strong Q4. The first half of the year will also benefit from easier comparisons and the continued COVID tailwind in our pipette business. As we look to the second half, we'll face more difficult comparisons, particularly with respect to our business in China. Our COVID tailwinds will also turn to a headwind as we lap comparisons. We also feel more uncertainty exists for the second half of the year, especially with respect to COVID's potential impact to the global economy. We recognize that we're currently benefiting from strong momentum, which will not necessarily continue. We'll provide additional quarterly guidance on our next call, but I thought it would be helpful to provide this context now. 
Some additional comments on guidance. We expect interest expense to be approximately $40 million in 2021 and total amortization to be approximately $55 million. Other income, which is below operating profit, will be approximately $9 million in 2021. As I mentioned earlier, we would expect our effective tax rate in 2021 to also remain at 19.5%. In terms of free cash flow for the year, we expect it to be approximately $690 million. We will continue to repurchase shares and expect to end 2021 in a targeted range of approximately a 1.5x leverage ratio.
Some additional details. With respect to the impact of currency on sales growth, we expect currency to increase sales growth by approximately 3.5% in 2021 and 5% in the first quarter. In terms of adjusted EPS, currency will benefit growth by approximately 3% in 2021.
That is it from my side, and I'll now turn it back to Olivier."

Pipette had excellent growth and benefited from COVID-related testing demand. Process Analytics had another quarter of strong growth, while demand for Analytical Instruments and Balances recovered nicely in the quarter. Sales growth in all regions was very strong. 
We expect Lab to continue to be very strong in the first half of 2021 due to favorable biopharma trends, vaccine research and testing and bioproduction scale-up and production. Lab will face tougher comparisons in the second half of the year. With our excellent Lab product portfolio, including our power demand solutions, focused on automation, digital interfaces and data management and proven Spinnaker sales and marketing strategies, we believe we're well positioned to continue to capture share. 
In terms of Industrial business, Core Industrial did well in the quarter with a 5% increase driven by double-digit growth in China. We will return to growth in Core Industrial in Europe, while Americas was flat, although they had very good growth in the prior year. We are particularly pleased at how resilient our Core Industrial has proven throughout 2020 given the challenges of the pandemic. We believe this reflects the strength and diversity of our product portfolio, our success in identifying and pursuing pockets of growth and strong focus on execution. Our outlook for Core Industrial remains solid, but we acknowledge we are not immune to the overall economy and will face difficult comparisons in China during the second half of the year. 
Product Inspection came in weaker than we had anticipated with a 5% decline in the quarter. Both Europe and Asia declined, while Americas was flat with the prior year. While our outlook has improved for this business and we expect to start 2021 with solid growth, we are cautious as large packaged food companies continue to face operational challenges at their manufacturing sites related to COVID. We believe pent-up demand exists for our instruments, but ultimate timing is still hard to determine. 
Food Retail came in better than we expected with 7% growth overall and growth in all regions.
Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales in Europe increased 7% in the quarter with excellent growth in Lab and good growth in Core Industrial and Food Retail. We expect solid growth in Europe in 2021. Americas increased 8% in the quarter with excellent growth in Lab, offset by flat results in both Product Inspection and Core Industrial. We expect good growth in Americas in 2021. 
Finally, Asia/Rest of the World grew 8% in the quarter with both Lab and Core Industrial doing very well. As mentioned, China had 12% growth in the quarter with excellent growth across product lines. We expect market conditions in China to be very favorable as we start 2021 while they face much tougher comparisons in the second half of the year.
One final comment on the business. Service and consumables were up 13% in the quarter and 8% for the full year.
That concludes my comments on the business. As I reflect on 2020, I'm very pleased with our performance given the exceptional challenges we faced. This performance would not have been possible without the strong foundation and well-ingrained corporate programs that we have in place, which allowed us to quickly pivot and adapt to the new environment. We have always considered agility and focus on execution a key pillar of Mettler-Toledo, and I think you saw evidence of both of these in our results. Probably most important, however, our success in 2020 sets the stage for us to continue to capture growth in 2021 and beyond.
Our strategy over many years has been remarkably consistent. As a leader in fragmented market, we have established strategies that allow us to gain a little market share each year while continuously expanding our margin. The initiatives within these strategies will evolve and develop, but strategies remain the same.
As we look to 2021, let me comment on how we are going about this. I will start with our Spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives. As we discussed on our last call, we made some leapfrog advances in digital transformation during 2020 that position us very well for the future. We will continue to refine our sophisticated analytics to guide our sales force to the best opportunities. We will continue to support our market organization with tools and methodologies to increase sales force time with the most strategic accounts while leveraging our value selling and cross-selling tools to further penetrate opportunities. We will also continue to leverage digitalization to develop new approaches that drive sales force efficiency and refine techniques to improve the effectiveness of telesales teams but also look forward to returning to visit accounts to generate new opportunities.
Finally, we look to execute more telemarketing campaigns and enhanced tools to increase order conversion. 
Service will continue to be essential element of our customer value proposition. Our almost 3,000 service technicians are an important competitive advantage for us. This year, we will focus on further high base penetration and utilizing many of the same sales force guidance, telesales and digital tools that we use for product sales to further drive service sales. 
Our team in China did an exceptional job in 2020 not only in continuing to serve customers and penetrate growth opportunities, but also in terms of manufacturing and supply chain. The team's priority is to continue to optimize the organization to focus on high-potential growth areas and attractive segments and further leverage digital technology to engage customers and generate leads. 
Introducing products for the local market, such as an entry-level x-ray instrument for our Product Inspection portfolio, is also an important element to growth in China and throughout emerging markets. We remain very optimistic about the growth potential, not only in China but throughout emerging markets over the medium term. 
Constantly coming to market with new product launches is another important strategy. Given the diversification of our product portfolio, a new product launch will never be material by itself. But together, these launches reinforce our market leadership, help trigger replacement in existing customers, help open doors to new customers and help support our price differentiation. Later this month, we will launch a new automatic laboratory balance that will set a new standard for weighing of powders and liquids in research lab, testing labs and quality control labs. Addressing the needs in the laboratory for automation, smaller sample sizes, flexibility, ease of use and seamless documentation, these new balances offers an unmatched value proposition. It is a simple, fully integrated solution that will support our customers in their everyday operations. It is just one example of the many product launches we will have this year that illustrates how we are continually focused on bringing products to market that demonstrate clear value to our customers. 
Similar to the continued evolution of growth strategies, we also continue to develop our pricing and productivity initiatives. We have good developments within pricing, utilizing analytics and some machine learning to most effectively price our offering. On the supply chain side, the team was able to continue to make progress on the Stern Drive productivity goals in 2020. But we will be able to make further progress in 2021 when the team won't have as many challenges as they faced last year.
Finally, I think you will continue to see market strategic acquisitions that leverage our technology leadership and global distribution. I acknowledge that we have not had an acquisition for a while but continue to believe we can benefit from acquisition. However, these acquisitions will be small and strategic, not transformational. 
I believe our franchise is stronger than ever as demonstrated in how we performed in 2020 despite all the challenges. As I look back over the last decade-plus years, we have made much progress in many areas. Our continuous improvement programs of Spinnaker sales and marketing and Stern Drive productivity, which I just discussed, are well engrained throughout our organization and will continue to evolve and be important ingredients for the future.
Emerging markets, an important growth driver, are 35% of sales today compared with 25% in 2007. Similarly, our faster-growing Laboratory business is now 54% of sales, up from 44%. Finally, service and consumables is now 33% of sales as compared to 28%. 
Redirecting resources and investments to faster-growing businesses has always been at the heart of our initiatives, and these businesses will continue to fuel growth in the future. The strength of the organization and how well we are positioned for the future contributed to my decision to step down as CEO. Under Patrick's leadership, I believe we have the organization, corporate programs, senior leadership team and tools in place to continue to gain share and continue our successful track record.
That concludes our prepared remarks. And now I want to open the line for questions."

But we see that customers are just not committing to upgrades and new packaging lines and so on, which is not surprising. All these food companies really need to protect the protection -- protect their production from any COVID exposures. And you can imagine, they have very rigid safety procedures, not wanting to let in any external suppliers, and that really drives the demand. 
And I wouldn't be surprised that this takes another 6 months. There are many production companies here that really hold back on CapEx. And as a reminder, about more than 70% of our revenue in Product Inspection is coming from food production. So yes, we count on the second half that we would really see a strong pent-up demand. But I do expect that already, Q1, we will see better numbers but not necessarily coming from pent-up."

The investments also go in the right market segments for us that we can benefit from, and I would certainly expect that this momentum will still go on for a while.

For the second part of the year, however, we are going to face tougher comparisons, and that's certainly one of the reasons why we guide, when it comes to China, a good start but then a slowdown in the second part of the year. Now Shawn, do you want to add some flavor to that last comment?"

But as Olivier mentioned, the pacing is going to be pretty unique just given the whole situation with the comparison in Q1 of last year and then when we look at the second half of last year as well. 
So just to be even a little bit more specific on that. In Q1, we're going to -- we expect China to be up mid- to high 20s in terms of growth. But again, that was versus a minus 13% in Q1 of last year. And then, of course, we're going to have to lap some of these tougher comparisons, which included 17% growth in Q3 of last year and now 12% in Q4 of this year."

So we did -- so in the fourth quarter, we did just under 2.5% in terms of price realization. So that was a little bit of an improvement from what we were seeing earlier in the year. I think each quarter, we started to see things progressively get a little bit better. Part of that improvement was that we were able to take a little bit more price on -- in the area of pipettes, as you just mentioned. We also were able to do a couple of other things, where we're trying to offset some of these higher transportation costs as well. 
As we look to 2021, we were previously guiding a little bit more cautiously in the 150 basis point kind of a range with the concern that inflationary forecasts a few months ago were quite low for 2021, but still feel extremely good about the momentum in the program. Olivier also alluded to a few of those things in the prepared remarks as well. 
At this point in time, we're looking at probably a range of $150 million to $200 million. Wouldn't be surprised if we were more towards the higher end of that range. As we kind of see some of the dynamics in the market, we do see some opportunities to maybe gain a little bit more price than we saw maybe a few months ago, and we'll see how that plays out. But that's certainly something on our mind right now. Of course, the other side of that is that some of these opportunities on price are also looking at higher material costs in certain areas that we're mindful of that we might be facing as well, too."

And so we need to base this on the observation of our field force. We certainly also observe it kind of the growth momentum we see in the different industry segments and what we can expect. And based on that, we feel actually really good. We have also clear anecdotes that we are winning share, and I feel we are outpacing the market. We have this [ end GDP ] benchmark, and I certainly feel that we are outpacing that. And so that gives us all this confidence. 
Of the share gain. There are some other data points that we use internally. I mentioned that we leverage data analytics to guide our sales force. Last year, we had a special effort to guide the sales force to noncustomers. We did so because certainly, our sales force spend much less time behind the wheel. They had much more time doing cold calling and engaging new customers through virtual demos and virtual calls. And that was then the base for us to expand the targets to our sales force, and we were very pleased to see the results in converting more than ever noncustomers. So that gives us kind of the confidence that this allows us to win share. 
So in a nutshell, we feel that we protected well our existing customer base, while we accelerated the access and the conversion to noncustomers. Certainly a strategy that we're going to pursue. I, many times said, the crisis last year was, for us, an opportunity to leapfrog some of the changes and that in terms of go to market, leapfrog the adaptation of internal new tools and techniques, and one of them was certainly all about the sales force guidance and reaching out to noncustomers. We're going to certainly maintain that one."

We assume a relatively stable environment in terms of second wave. In Europe, we are in the middle of the second wave. We are definitely on a quite a strict lockdown in many of the countries, started already before Christmas. It feels very different to the first lockdown. The business, while we -- or many of us are in home offices, we have here an infrastructure and an understanding with our customer base that business is going on. We definitely leverage all these. We have also less customer visits, but effective relationships. And we do not see that the core customer base is putting investments on hold. So that's why the second wave is very different to the first wave when it comes to the business impact. 
On personal levels, it feels kind of similar, but not on a business level. I -- if the environment stays about what it is right now, that's probably our base for our guidance here. And I'm not particularly worried that the knockdown situation will significantly impact our business. And that means if the lockdown gets more severe or if everything would certainly ease up, it looks like we have built here a certain resilience in our own business approach as well as the business or the industry segments that we are targeting. I want also to remind, we did quite a shift last year in terms of the industry segments that we are targeting. And that shift we're going to maintain. 
Don't read too much around the M&A language. It's really in the sense that a reinforcement of the strategy that we have been running in the past. We are very interested in adjacencies. We are interested in companies that fit well in our current business focus. And my point was, even that we have here a leadership transition, Patrick and I share a common understanding here that we don't need any transformational acquisitions. We are not seeking any additional leg to the company. We feel we have an excellent franchise. But we want to leverage the franchise when there are good opportunities out there. Again, technology synergies or selected market consolidation opportunities. These are the typical adjacencies that we did in the past and that we certainly are going to continue to pursue."

So currency will be favorable to operating profit, but it will actually have a negative impact on the margin. And that negative impact will probably be in the range of 20 basis points. 
But then just to kind of link it back to your comment about what we were saying before. We were saying before that we would be a little bit below our typical guide of 70 to 100 in terms of our midterm expectations. So we might be slightly lower, but we're a little bit more optimistic just given the higher sales volume as well in terms of what we'd expect. And I think the other thing to always remind of -- remember is we did 130 basis points this year. So now when we're looking at the 2-year combined growth, we're probably in the 190 to 200 basis point expansion, excluding currency, which we feel really good about. And as we kind of made it -- mentioned in the comments before, we feel like there's really excellent momentum on all the different margin expansion initiatives, whether it be pricing or Stern Drive, et cetera."

I would attribute it to a little bit the same things that we see for the whole group that we early on did go for the pockets of growth that still exist in this market, redirecting our resources and our attention to the most attractive accounts, and that played well. There are industry segments that are very healthy at this stage. The whole pharma production. There is transport and logistics that is healthy for us and many other subsegments and in combination with the sales force guidance topic that I raised before, offered really good opportunities in spite that the overall economy is challenging.

But then on the flip side, you have, of course, the comparison topic. So China will, for example, be rather down in the same -- not down, no -- not the same growth rate in the second part of the year. So that a bit. In terms of where we might experience positive, or hopefully not negative surprises, product inspection in China are certainly the ones that are -- that have potentially both directions."

I would think that the momentum that we see in the industry segment, like in bioproduction. I don't think it goes necessarily away in the second part of the year. I think that can be actually quite sustainable. Yes, we had modest benefit from investments in vaccine production. But we're -- in terms of share of our total revenue, it remains very small. So if that would slow down, that wouldn't necessarily have a big impact on us. The investment in far more production and particularly also bioproduction, I think, has a long way to go.

We were one of the first ones that resumed production also in China. And similar things that we did also for the service technicians. So we were really up and running. 
And what we benefit -- continue to benefit from is we do this Net Promoter Score, and we had a very nice jump in customer satisfaction in Q2 that we saw in our NPS. And it went on throughout the year. And I feel this gets tribute to our -- really our service force, how well they are performing. Having 3,000 people in the field here is powerful. Then you need also to know that for service, our biggest competition are local, I would almost say, family-owned companies. And for these companies, it is much more difficult to operate in the current COVID environment than for us, where we have a global organization, and we have a lot of professional support of the field force.

This -- these are new tools, and so I'm kind of happy to be able to respond to it. So like many other things in the company, I think it's just a really good example of agility. So back in March, we really kind of launched into a variety of crisis management initiatives around COVID. And then one of those initiatives, of course, was manage for cash. That's what we refer to it as internally. And so within that initiative, we challenged ourselves to come up with some new analytics, but even more importantly, to try to make the connection between the analytics and the actions to be more efficient. So we literally are broadcasting today individual KPI charge that are highly actionable with like top 10 lists as well on a very daily basis to each finance organization, going to the leader every single day. And we found that, that in itself has become very actionable, and it's allowed them to work with their local management teams and really get people behind areas for improvement. And so that's just one example. 
We've done a lot of other things in the manage for cash initiative during the course of the year. In terms of more legs, we'll see. I think we just hit another good milestone. But when I take a step back, I think the best way to look at it is that our free cash flow conversion this year was over 100%. When we look at next year, we'll probably be right around 100% again. And so I think this is a level that I don't think it's going to get too much more than 100%, but I just think that flow through around 100% is a good range. I'm comfortable looking at that for 2021. And I think as we go out, we'll kind of take it on a year-by-year basis. But right now, we feel really good about the cash flow conversion."

So hopefully, that will come back not to far away, but then to be seen. 
So internally, I would say we count on the second part of the year. We were just talking also today with people from the industry.

We also have very long-standing shareholders who are also listening in. I look forward to our future interactions and hope that they can take place in person in the not-so-distant future. Let me make some brief comments on my impressions of the first several months at Mettler-Toledo. It is clear that the company's strategies and initiatives are well developed and well ingrained throughout the organization. A high level of accountability is evident throughout the company, which underpins the culture of strong execution. I am impressed with the interactions I have had with colleagues around the world, and I share their passion for customers and innovation that is very apparent in how they approach their responsibilities. It is exciting to join Mettler-Toledo at a time of such strong momentum, which I think is also a great reflection on Olivier's legacy as a CEO. Under his leadership, the company developed a strong foundation for future growth. I'm also grateful for the thorough onboarding process Olivier prepared for me. I am committed to the organic growth strategy of Mettler-Toledo, and will work with the team to enhance our performance and continue the strong track record of top and bottom line growth that has been in place for many years. Now let me turn to our financial results. The highlights are on Page 3 of the presentation, and you can see we are off to a fantastic start to 2021. It was apparent with our Q1 guidance that we expected a very good quarter. However, it came in even better than we expected. Local currency growth was 18%, and we had strong broad-based growth in all regions. China, in particular, had outstanding growth, and our growth in Americas and Europe was also better than we expected. Since the onset of the pandemic, the organization has been focused on identifying areas of growth and ensuring that we are strongly positioned once demand recovered. The team executed well to capitalize on recovering market demand and to meet customer needs. With the excellent sales growth, combined with good cost control and benefit of our margin and productivity initiatives, we achieved a 64% growth in adjusted EPS. Cash flow generation was also impressive as we achieved an almost 200% increase in our free cash flow generation. We believe the positive momentum will continue into Q2 and expect another quarter of robust sales and earnings growth. As we look to the full year 2021, we believe we can continue to gain market share and deliver very strong results. Let me now turn it to Shawn to cover the financial and guidance details, and then I will come back with some additional commentary on the business and an overview of the PendoTECH acquisition that we completed in the quarter.

Sales were $804.4 million in the quarter, an increase of 18% in local currency. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales increased 24% as currency benefited sales growth by 6% in the quarter. On Slide #4, we show sales growth by region. Local currency sales increased 14% in both the Americas and Europe and increased 29% in Asia Rest of the World. Local currency sales increased 44% in China in the first quarter. On Slide #5, we outline local currency sales growth by product area. In the quarter, Laboratory sales increased 20%, Industrial increased 17%, with Core Industrial up 26% and product inspection up 5%. Food Retail increased 13% in the quarter. We estimate that we benefited approximately 2% from COVID tailwinds in the quarter, mainly related to our pipette business for COVID testing. Let me now move to the rest of the P&L, which is summarized on the next slide. Gross margin in the quarter was 58.6%, a 90 basis point increase over the prior year level of 57.7%. We benefited from pricing, volume and temporary cost savings initiatives. These benefits were offset in part by higher transportation and material costs. R&D amounted to $39.3 million, which represents a 7% increase in local currency. SG&A amounted to $221.8 million, a 7% increase in local currency over the prior year. Increased variable compensation was offset in part by our temporary cost savings and ongoing cost containment initiatives. Adjusted operating profit amounted to $210.7 million in the quarter, a 49% increase over the prior year amount of $141.3 million. Adjusted operating margins increased 440 basis points in the quarter to 26.2%. We are extremely pleased with this margin growth, which reflects excellent sales growth combined with good margin and cost initiatives. Currency benefited operating profit growth by approximately 6%, but had very little impact on operating margins. A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization amounted to $13.9 million in the quarter, interest expense was $9.5 million in the quarter. Other income in the quarter amounted to $2.1 million, primarily reflecting nonservice-related pension income. Offsetting this was $2.8 million in acquisition costs that is excluded from adjusted EPS. Our effective tax rate before discrete items and adjusted for the timing of stock option deductions was 19.5% as compared to 21.5% in the first quarter of last year. Fully diluted shares amounted to $23.7 million in the quarter, which is a 3% decline from the prior year. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $6.56, a 64% increase over the prior year amount of $4. Currency benefited adjusted EPS growth by approximately 7% in the quarter. On a reported basis in the quarter, EPS was $6.32 as compared to $4.03 in the prior year. Reported EPS in the quarter includes $0.12 of purchased intangible amortization, $0.10 of cost related to the PendoTECH acquisition, $0.04 of restructuring and a $0.02 benefit due to the difference between our quarterly and annual tax rate due to the timing of stock option exercises. That covers the P&L, and I'll now comment on the cash flow. In the quarter, adjusted free cash flow amounted to $139 million, which is an increase of 196% on a per share basis as compared to the prior year. We are very happy with our cash flow generation. DSO declined by approximately 6.5 days to 40 days as compared to the prior year. We continue to see good results from the new initiatives we put in place last year on the use of analytics and productivity improvements in accounts receivables collections in cash flow management. ITO came in at 4.4x, similar to last year. Before I turn to guidance, let me provide some financial information on PendoTECH acquisition, which we completed late in Q1. We paid $185 million upfront, and there is a $20 million potential earnout as well as some post-closing amounts. We expect PendoTECH to contribute approximately 1% to sales growth beginning in Q2. The transaction was financed through borrowings under our bank facility. Patrick will have some additional comments on PendoTECH shortly. Let me now turn to guidance. Forecasting continues to be challenging. Market conditions are dynamic and changes to the business environment can happen quickly. Uncertainty also remains surrounding COVID-19 and the ultimate impact for the global economy. In addition, further shutdowns, unexpected material shortages and unforeseen logistic challenges can also create potential volatility. Our end markets have good momentum, and we are well positioned to capitalize on this growth potential by leveraging our Spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives, excellent product portfolio and service network. The organization continues to execute very well and has demonstrated a high level of resilience and agility in adapting to rapidly changing market conditions. We continue to feel positive in our ability to gain market share and generate margin improvement with our pricing and productivity initiatives. We will also resume our field turbo program and expect to add sales resources in the second half of 2021. 
Now let me cover the specifics. For the full year 2021, primarily due to the benefit of our Q1 results and with a strong outlook for Q2, we now expect local currency sales growth for the full year will be in the range of 10% to 12%. This compares to previous guidance range of 5% to 7%. We expect full year adjusted EPS guidance to be in the range of $31.45 to $31.90, which is a growth rate of 22% to 24%. This compares to our previous guidance of adjusted EPS in the range of $29.20 and to $29.80. With respect to the second quarter, we would expect local currency sales growth to be in the range of 19% to 21% and expect adjusted EPS to be in a range of $7.50 to $7.65, a growth rate of 42% to 45%. 
Let me provide you with some additional details and guidance. As mentioned, we expect PendoTECH to contribute 1% to sales growth for the remaining quarters of the year. The impact to EPS from the acquisition is relatively neutral. We would expect local currency sales growth for the second half of the year to be in the mid-single-digit range as we will face tougher comparisons. The COVID-19 testing tailwind in our pipette business will turn into a headwind, and we won't see the same level of pent-up demand that we're currently seeing. We expect reported amortization will amount to $62 million, which is higher than previously communicated due to the PendoTECH acquisition. The purchased intangible adjustment for EPS will increase to $0.66 for 2021. 
Other income, which is below operating profit, will approximately -- will approximate $2 million per quarter for the remainder of 2021. We  expect our effective tax rate in 2021 to remain at 19.5%. In terms of free cash flow for the full year, we now expect it to be approximately $735 million. We expect to repurchase $637 million shares in 2021 for the remaining 3 quarters of 2021. We would expect to end 2021 in our targeted net debt-to-EBITDA range of approximately a 1.5x leverage ratio. Some final details on guidance. With respect to the impact of currency on sales growth, we expect currency to increase sales growth by approximately 3.5% in 2021 and 6% in the second quarter. In terms of adjusted EPS, currency will benefit growth by approximately 7.5% in the second quarter and 4% for the full year 2021. That is it from my side, and I'll now turn it back to Patrick."

Let me start with some comments on our operating results. Our lab business had outstanding growth in the quarter. Pipettes had excellent growth and continued to benefit from COVID-19 related testing demand. All other product categories had also robust sales growth and growth in all regions was very strong. Biopharma trends continue to be very favorable and we also experienced improved customer demand in other segments such as chemical. We expect LAP to be very strong in the second quarter due to favorable biopharma trends, vaccine research and bioproduction scale-up and production. We also expect to continue to benefit from pent-up demand in segments outside biopharma. While LAP will face tougher comparisons in the second half of the year, We believe we are well positioned to continue to capture share given the strength of our product portfolio and continued strong execution of our Spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives. In terms of our Industrial business, Core Industrial did very well in the quarter with a 26% increase in sales driven by China, which had growth in Core Industrial in excess of 60%. Europe and Americas also had strong low to mid-teens growth in Core Industrial. Improving market conditions combined with the strength and diversity of our product portfolio, and our focus on attractive market segments contributed to the strong results. Our outlook for Core Industrial is very good for Q2, while they will face more difficult comparisons, particularly in China in the second half of the year. Product inspection came in pretty much as we expected with a 5% local currency sales growth in the quarter. Europe and Asia had growth, while Americas was flat with the prior year. We would expect modestly better growth in Q2, but this business continues to be challenged as large packaged food companies continue to face operational challenges related to COVID-19 and are careful with installing new equipment or even bringing service people into their facilities. We believe pent-up demand exists for our instruments, but ultimate timing is still hard to determine. Food retailing came in better than expected with 13% growth because of better market demand in Europe and Asia and the rest of the world. Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales in Europe increased 14% in the quarter, with excellent growth in Lab, Core Industrial and Food Retail. Americas also increased 14% in the quarter with excellent growth in Lab and Core Industrial, offset by flat results in Product Inspection and a decline in Food Retail. Finally, Asia and the Rest of the World grew 29% in the quarter with very strong growth in most product lines. As you heard from Shawn, China had outstanding growth of 44% in the quarter with excellent growth across most product lines. We are benefiting from robust demand in many of the market segments we serve. This includes very strong growth in Life Sciences, Food and Chemical. From a product point of view, our industrial customers are seeking greater automation and digitalization, which bodes very well for our product offering. We're also seeing benefits of government spending in key priority areas, such as new research labs, safety in food supply and packaged foods and investments in various strategic priorities. Our achievement in China are a great example of how we positioned ourselves to capture growth as demand recovered. Our Spinnaker sales and marketing techniques, including our go-to-market approach, which we adapted due to a new environment, have served us very well in terms of identifying and capturing these growth opportunities. We have also worked over many years to ensure that our product portfolio in China is well suited for the local market, which gives us an advantage. We expect good momentum to continue in China this quarter, And then you will see a more modest growth in the second half of the year due to very strong growth in the prior year. 
One final comment on the business. Service and Consumables performed well and were up 11% in the quarter. That concludes my comments on the business. Not only is our business off to a great start in 2021, we also made a strategic bolt-on acquisition to further expand one of our most attractive businesses, process analytics. Let me provide some additional insights into the acquisition. We are a global leader in real-time measurement of key process control parameters, which customers use to optimize their production processes. About 50% of the Process Analytics business is to the pharma and biopharma market, with an emphasis on sensors to monitor PH, dissolved oxygen, carbon dioxide and other parameters. Our solutions combine sensor technologies for specific measurements, transmitters and services. The sensors must be calibrated, maintained and replaced on a timely basis, which create an attractive consumable stream. Process Analytics has achieved above-market growth for numerous years, benefiting from the strength in bioproduction and very successful Spinnaker sales and marketing strategies and techniques. We also have a great track record of technology innovation. We are a leader in the market with our innovative intelligent sensor management technology, which optimizes sensor replacement to avoid unexpected downtime. Other examples of innovations include in-line measurement of carbon dioxide and high-performance optical sensors for dissolved oxygen. The company we acquired, PendoTECH, is a manufacturer and distributor of single-use sensors, transmitters, control systems and software, serving the biopharmaceutical manufacturers and life science laboratories. Their primary focus is pressure, which is a common control parameter used in bioprocess applications. They are well recognized for the leading edge innovation in single-use sensors that are becoming increasingly important in bioproduction as it provides greater manufacturing flexibility. They have extensive knowledge surrounding disposable flow cells and connector designs, and have strong bioprocess downstream application know-how. 
This is an excellent strategic acquisition as it expands our presence in the very attractive high-growth bioprocess market. We have a complementary offering in bioprocessing applications of our strength in upstream and PendoTECH in Downstream. With the combination, we will create 1 of the most competitive single-use sensor offerings in the market. We see attractive cross-selling opportunities as we believe there is significant customer benefit from using the same vendor in upstream and downstream bioprocess applications. Finally, we see good opportunity to expand PendoTECH's presence on a global basis, leveraging our global reach and large customer base. We are excited about this transaction and believe it will further our already strong leadership position in Process Analytics. 
Let me wrap up by commenting that we are off to a very good start to the year. The team has shown a tremendous level of resilience and agility in adapting and reacting to market conditions that are changing rapidly. We remain focused on meeting our customer needs and believe we can continue to gain market share and deliver strong results. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we now want to open the line for questions."

I'm just interested, I just would like some a little bit more color there. And also, how has that sort of been contributed to your overall pricing? I assume that if there's a pipette shortage and that means that people are willing to pay more for it. So can you talk about have you seen some incremental pricing gains in the business as a result of that, and so do those sort of dissipate as well?"

Well, first on the shortage of pipettes and pipette tips in the market right now. You're absolutely spot on. There is still a shortage in the market, especially related to COVID-19 testing. But as Shawn elaborated, we definitely expect the testing demand for COVID-19 going down towards the second half of the year. And there's probably not the same amount in life science research or other areas that would compensate fully for that demand. This is why we are more cautious about the outlook, and don't expect the same tailwind from the pipette business in terms of revenues in the second half. On pricing, we had the first pricing round this year already, and I'll let Shawn also comment about the overall impact of that."

And we see that growth story to continue for quite some time. We still have plenty of headroom to grow. That will not change. It's fundamentally an organic growth story. We continue to do bolt-on acquisitions, tuck-in acquisitions. You could all recall them wherever we think it makes sense from a technology perspective or where it complements our product portfolio.

We didn't necessarily build that into our guidance. But we do feel like we're well positioned there, but it's still difficult to tell the timing and when that's all going to happen. In terms of government stimulus, also difficult to judge. I mean we -- I would expect we would have some level of benefit. Some of it probably more indirect than direct.

Well, let me take it, Patrick. Look, we -- really, really happy with our results in China, I think it was truly exceptional, much better than we expected, and we commend the team for the excellent execution and capitalizing on the growth opportunities we have there. There have been several dynamics that you should consider when evaluating our China results. First year, the number looks very high for the first quarter, but the comparisons are very easy because they were down 13% in the prior year. However, the 2-year combined growth rate is still very good. We are very strongly positioned in China with our sales and marketing initiatives, which are allowing us to gain share and support customers. We also have worked over the last numerous years to adapt our products for the local market, which helps to support our leading position in many of the product categories in China. And in terms of the underlying dynamics, Shawn said, we see strong recovery in many of our end markets. Life Sciences, in particular, is very strong and continue -- we continue to expect growth from this end market. 
Other dynamics we are seeing is that although we primarily serve local markets in China, our local customers there see some greater demand from the western world, actually. And that, of course, fueled some of the end markets for us like chemical. And finally, I think we're also benefiting from the government spending. If you look at China's 5-year plan and the investments behind it, in things like new labs, funding research also continue to fund safety in food supply also in packaged food is impacted as well, that plays out for us very well. So -- and then last but not least, Similar to the rest of the world, there is an increasing focus also on automation, which plays very well for our offerings in China. So we are pretty confident that the momentum in China will continue and we strongly believe we will have a very good Q2. And then, as we said, also more moderate growth because of tougher compares in the second half of the year."

In the short term, right now, we're not -- we haven't built anything in particular in terms of our projections in terms of any supply chain disruptions. And right now, we feel like we can continue to manage it. We also benefit, I think, a little bit from the diversity in our business.

Take the automobile industry, where they have sent thousands of workers home last week, for example, in Germany because of shortage of electronic components. Again, our supply chain team is working with our vendors very closely to make sure that we understand the overall supply chain situation, build safety stock wherever possible and then continue to mitigate. We also continue to mitigate internally, looking into even potential design changes where it would be adequate to make sure that we can continue to manufacture with other components if needed. Pretty unpredictable right now. I would say that the supply chain spends more energy than ever on this topic, to ensure that we are not facing any major shortage, but we are certainly not immune from the overall trends. So no guarantees, but I can tell you that we, at least for the most competitive components, we know of, we handle them also with some we have some safety stock, et cetera."

What you'll kind of see as the year progresses, I think you'll start to see a little bit more improvement from the pricing program that we talked about in the initial question from Derik. We'll continue to also have benefits, especially in the second quarter from higher volumes. But kind of on the other side of that, we do have higher costs related to material costs as well as freight. And then another dynamic that we're going to see in the second quarter is that if you think back a year ago, that's the quarter when we started to have a lot of temporary cost savings in the business. And a lot of those cost savings will now be coming back into the cost structure in the second quarter. And so that would be kind of like a, something kind of going the other way."

I think it's really complementary also to our strength that we already have in some of the bioprocessing and even some single-use sensors that we also have at Mettler-Toledo. So it's complementing the portfolio very nicely. PendoTECH definitely stronger in downstream. We are more at the moment, stronger ups in upstream. But if you look at the combination of the 2 businesses, as I said, it's actually very beneficial for customers to have the same window for both upstream and downstream applications. I think we, from as Mettler-Toledo, bring a lot to the table for PendoTECH in terms of our global reach, global footprint, our customer base and expand actually the market reach for them worldwide. We also have definitely sensor technology know-how in areas where they don't play today. But they have, on the other hand, a lot of design knowhow of how to implement sensors in single-use designs that are used in downstream applications. So I think there's a lot of technology leverage that comes together, as well as a good market leverage in terms of our strength and our global reach that we have as Mettler-Toledo. The integration is going extremely well. We are very pleased of how things are going. There was 0 disruption for our customers. Actually, the response we have received from PendoTECH customers was extremely positive. We are helping them also on the supply chain side, securing supply for actually increased demands in -- for their products as well. So I think this is really a combination of 2 companies that will provide a lot of benefit for customers in the biopharma space."

But I can tell you that the sales cycle, of course, for investments like you would see it in product inspections are definitely longer. I mean these products are in most of the cases, is it designed for the specific application and the specific line of the customer. So you have to think about the customer has basically a food manufacturing line, and they will ask -- they want to add some specific product inspection, whether it's metal detection, whether it's X-ray, whether it's visual inspection, and the devices have to fit their manufacturing line. So part of the process is basically that our sales rep would come in and work with the customer on, number one, what -- what his needs are in terms of the subject that he wants to detect in there, whether it's X-ray, whether it's metal detection, whether it's visual or check lane, even. And then it comes to the point where we say, okay, we have the right solutions. And then it comes to designing to the installed base of the rest of the manufacturing line that is in place there. So it fits. And that cycle actually takes a couple of days to several weeks to get through to final approval process with the customer as well and then the system is built. So it's not something that's that will turn around in a couple of weeks. When you talk about pent-up demand. What we're doing, however, is, we start -- we increased our marketing efforts. We also brought our demo trucks back on the road, especially in Europe, to be close to customers who cannot go to trade shows, et cetera. So we bring the product to customers so they can see them, how they look like and then can basically start the conversation with the whole sales rep about potential investments for the next couple of quarters.

One, we have a more difficult comparison, but I guess that would neutralize in the multiyear. But if you look at the, this Q1, Q2 and even as we kind of ended 2020, we did feel like there was an element of pent-up demand and various dynamics kind of going around, already starting in China in Q3 of last year, starting to accelerate in other parts of the world in Q4. And then we saw a very significant momentum gain here in Q1 with other markets outside of biopharma really starting to recover. And so always difficult to really determine and quantify how much is attributable pent-up. Right now, as we talked about earlier, we're just not assuming that there's any additional pent-up for the second half of the year. But if you look at our multiyear growth rates for the second half.

I'm not saying that -- I'm not saying we're -- the economies are resilient to COVID and that there couldn't ultimately be some kind of a knock-on risk effect. But if we just observe things like Europe's been in a pretty heavy lockdown for the last few months and you see the business environment. But then you look at the rest of the world, like a country like India, who's going through a very severe situation at the moment, our end markets are still actually doing well there.

I think it also demonstrates how we feel about the business and the growth potential, especially as we're kind of preparing for 2022. We're going to be making investments in the Field Turbo program as well as other investments for growth and other types of investments for growth in other parts of the business as well, too. When we look at the program, it is global in nature. And -- but it will have a little bit of a disproportional investment in China, just given the significant opportunity we see in China in the medium to long term. And if you look at the types of resources, it will be kind of similar to the past where there'll be kind of a good mixture of field resources, but also inside resources. including telesales resources. And we just continue to see really excellent returns, in terms of our investments in the field, but also the inside resources. I mean the telesales program continues to generate very significant leads for the company. These resources also do a fantastic job of leveraging our field sales so that they're even more effective as well, too. So we feel very good about making these investments, and I think you'll start to see them happen in the second half of the year."

And then, of course, it also includes 1% for PendoTECH. And if you look at it from an EPS perspective, I'd say just under half of the increase is related to the Q1 beat. And then probably something more like in the 60% kind of range was related to higher sales volume as well as a little bit of benefit from currency, which improved a little bit since the last time we spoke, offset by some of these growth investments that we talked about. In terms of process analytics, maybe I'll start that one, and then I'll let Patrick add some comments if he has any additional color. But hey, Process Analytics is doing extremely well, about half of the business or so has an exposure to bioproduction. As you can imagine, that part of the business is doing really well. We've had a lot of really great photo ops in that business actually around the world over the last few months with leaders around the world visiting bioproduction plants. And then our equipment's behind it, a recent 1 was when President Biden was at the Pfizer plant in Michigan. So that business is doing really well. We've always felt very strongly about that. Patrick talked about that when he talked about PendoTECH as well. But what we're also seeing is that the end markets other than  biopharma are also coming back quite strongly there also."

I want to start by thanking you for your interest and commitment to Mettler-Toledo. I knew many of the analysts on the call have covered us for quite some time and know us well. We also have very long-standing shareholders who are also listening in. I look forward to our future interactions and hope that they can take place in person in the not-so-distant future. Let me make some brief comments on my impressions of the first several months at Mettler-Toledo. It is clear that the company's strategies and initiatives are well developed and well ingrained throughout the organization. A high level of accountability is evident throughout the company, which underpins the culture of strong execution. I am impressed with the interactions I have had with colleagues around the world, and I share their passion for customers and innovation that is very apparent in how they approach their responsibilities. It is exciting to join Mettler-Toledo at a time of such strong momentum, which I think is also a great reflection on Olivier's legacy as a CEO. Under his leadership, the company developed a strong foundation for future growth. I'm also grateful for the thorough onboarding process Olivier prepared for me. I am committed to the organic growth strategy of Mettler-Toledo, and will work with the team to enhance our performance and continue the strong track record of top and bottom line growth that has been in place for many years. 
Now let me turn to our financial results. The highlights are on Page 3 of the presentation, and you can see we are off to a fantastic start to 2021. It was apparent with our Q1 guidance that we expected a very good quarter. However, it came in even better than we expected. Local currency growth was 18%, and we had strong broad-based growth in all regions. China, in particular, had outstanding growth, and our growth in Americas and Europe was also better than we expected. Since the onset of the pandemic, the organization has been focused on identifying areas of growth and ensuring that we are strongly positioned once demand recovered. The team executed well to capitalize on recovering market demand and to meet customer needs. With the excellent sales growth, combined with good cost control and benefit of our margin and productivity initiatives, we achieved a 64% growth in adjusted EPS. Cash flow generation was also impressive as we achieved an almost 200% increase in our free cash flow generation. We believe the positive momentum will continue into Q2 and expect another quarter of robust sales and earnings growth. As we look to the full year 2021, we believe we can continue to gain market share and deliver very strong results. Let me now turn it to Shawn to cover the financial and guidance details, and then I will come back with some additional commentary on the business and an overview of the PendoTECH acquisition that we completed in the quarter. Shawn?"

Sales were $804.4 million in the quarter, an increase of 18% in local currency. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales increased 24% as currency benefited sales growth by 6% in the quarter. On Slide #4, we show sales growth by region. Local currency sales increased 14% in both the Americas and Europe and increased 29% in Asia/Rest of the World. Local currency sales increased 44% in China in the first quarter. On Slide #5, we outline local currency sales growth by product area. In the quarter, Laboratory sales increased 20%, Industrial increased 17%, with Core Industrial up 26% and product inspection up 5%. Food Retail increased 13% in the quarter. We estimate that we benefited approximately 2% from COVID tailwinds in the quarter, mainly related to our pipette business for COVID testing. Let me now move to the rest of the P&L, which is summarized on the next slide. Gross margin in the quarter was 58.6%, a 90 basis point increase over the prior year level of 57.7%. We benefited from pricing, volume and temporary cost savings initiatives. These benefits were offset in part by higher transportation and material costs. R&D amounted to $39.3 million, which represents a 7% increase in local currency. SG&A amounted to $221.8 million, a 7% increase in local currency over the prior year. Increased variable compensation was offset in part by our temporary cost savings and ongoing cost containment initiatives. Adjusted operating profit amounted to $210.7 million in the quarter, a 49% increase over the prior year amount of $141.3 million. Adjusted operating margins increased 440 basis points in the quarter to 26.2%. We are extremely pleased with this margin growth, which reflects excellent sales growth combined with good margin and cost initiatives. Currency benefited operating profit growth by approximately 6%, but had very little impact on operating margins. A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization amounted to $13.9 million in the quarter, interest expense was $9.5 million in the quarter. Other income in the quarter amounted to $2.1 million, primarily reflecting nonservice-related pension income. Offsetting this was $2.8 million in acquisition costs that is excluded from adjusted EPS. Our effective tax rate before discrete items and adjusted for the timing of stock option deductions was 19.5% as compared to 21.5% in the first quarter of last year. Fully diluted shares amounted to $23.7 million in the quarter, which is a 3% decline from the prior year. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $6.56, a 64% increase over the prior year amount of $4. Currency benefited adjusted EPS growth by approximately 7% in the quarter. On a reported basis in the quarter, EPS was $6.32 as compared to $4.03 in the prior year. Reported EPS in the quarter includes $0.12 of purchased intangible amortization, $0.10 of cost related to the PendoTECH acquisition, $0.04 of restructuring and a $0.02 benefit due to the difference between our quarterly and annual tax rate due to the timing of stock option exercises. .
That covers the P&L, and I'll now comment on the cash flow. In the quarter, adjusted free cash flow amounted to $139 million, which is an increase of 196% on a per share basis as compared to the prior year. We are very happy with our cash flow generation. DSO declined by approximately 6.5 days to 40 days as compared to the prior year. We continue to see good results from the new initiatives we put in place last year on the use of analytics and productivity improvements in accounts receivables collections in cash flow management. ITO came in at 4.4x, similar to last year. 
Before I turn to guidance, let me provide some financial information on PendoTECH acquisition, which we completed late in Q1. We paid $185 million upfront, and there is a $20 million potential earnout as well as some post-closing amounts. We expect PendoTECH to contribute approximately 1% to sales growth beginning in Q2. The transaction was financed through borrowings under our bank facility. Patrick will have some additional comments on PendoTECH shortly. Let me now turn to guidance. Forecasting continues to be challenging. Market conditions are dynamic and changes to the business environment can happen quickly. Uncertainty also remains surrounding COVID-19 and the ultimate impact for the global economy. In addition, further shutdowns, unexpected material shortages and unforeseen logistic challenges can also create potential volatility. Our end markets have good momentum, and we are well positioned to capitalize on this growth potential by leveraging our Spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives, excellent product portfolio and service network. The organization continues to execute very well and has demonstrated a high level of resilience and agility in adapting to rapidly changing market conditions. We continue to feel positive in our ability to gain market share and generate margin improvement with our pricing and productivity initiatives. We will also resume our field turbo program and expect to add sales resources in the second half of 2021. 
Now let me cover the specifics. For the full year 2021, primarily due to the benefit of our Q1 results and with a strong outlook for Q2, we now expect local currency sales growth for the full year will be in the range of 10% to 12%. This compares to previous guidance range of 5% to 7%. We expect full year adjusted EPS guidance to be in the range of $31.45 to $31.90, which is a growth rate of 22% to 24%. This compares to our previous guidance of adjusted EPS in the range of $29.20 to $29.80. With respect to the second quarter, we would expect local currency sales growth to be in the range of 19% to 21% and expect adjusted EPS to be in a range of $7.50 to $7.65, a growth rate of 42% to 45%. 
Let me provide you with some additional details and guidance. As mentioned, we expect PendoTECH to contribute 1% to sales growth for the remaining quarters of the year. The impact to EPS from the acquisition is relatively neutral. We would expect local currency sales growth for the second half of the year to be in the mid-single-digit range as we will face tougher comparisons. The COVID-19 testing tailwind in our pipette business will turn into a headwind, and we won't see the same level of pent-up demand that we're currently seeing. We expect reported amortization will amount to $62 million, which is higher than previously communicated due to the PendoTECH acquisition. The purchased intangible adjustment for EPS will increase to $0.66 for 2021. 
Other income, which is below operating profit, will approximately -- will approximate $2 million per quarter for the remainder of 2021. We  expect our effective tax rate in 2021 to remain at 19.5%. In terms of free cash flow for the full year, we now expect it to be approximately $735 million. We expect to repurchase 637 million shares in 2021 for the remaining 3 quarters of 2021. We would expect to end 2021 in our targeted net debt-to-EBITDA range of approximately a 1.5x leverage ratio. 
Some final details on guidance. With respect to the impact of currency on sales growth, we expect currency to increase sales growth by approximately 3.5% in 2021 and 6% in the second quarter. In terms of adjusted EPS, currency will benefit growth by approximately 7.5% in the second quarter and 4% for the full year 2021. That is it from my side, and I'll now turn it back to Patrick."

Let me start with some comments on our operating results. Our lab business had outstanding growth in the quarter. Pipettes had excellent growth and continued to benefit from COVID-19 related testing demand. All other product categories had also robust sales growth and growth in all regions was very strong. Biopharma trends continue to be very favorable and we also experienced improved customer demand in other segments such as chemical. We expect Lab to be very strong in the second quarter due to favorable biopharma trends, vaccine research and bioproduction scale-up and production. We also expect to continue to benefit from pent-up demand in segments outside biopharma. While Lab will face tougher comparisons in the second half of the year, we believe we are well positioned to continue to capture share given the strength of our product portfolio and continued strong execution of our Spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives. In terms of our Industrial business, Core Industrial did very well in the quarter with a 26% increase in sales driven by China, which had growth in Core Industrial in excess of 60%. Europe and Americas also had strong low to mid-teens growth in Core Industrial. Improving market conditions combined with the strength and diversity of our product portfolio, and our focus on attractive market segments contributed to the strong results. Our outlook for Core Industrial is very good for Q2, while they will face more difficult comparisons, particularly in China in the second half of the year. 
Product inspection came in pretty much as we expected with a 5% local currency sales growth in the quarter. Europe and Asia had growth, while Americas was flat with the prior year. We would expect modestly better growth in Q2, but this business continues to be challenged as large packaged food companies continue to face operational challenges related to COVID-19 and are careful with installing new equipment or even bringing service people into their facilities. We believe pent-up demand exists for our instruments, but ultimate timing is still hard to determine. Food retailing came in better than expected with 13% growth because of better market demand in Europe and Asia and the rest of the world. 
Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales in Europe increased 14% in the quarter, with excellent growth in Lab, Core Industrial and Food Retail. Americas also increased 14% in the quarter with excellent growth in Lab and Core Industrial, offset by flat results in Product Inspection and a decline in Food Retail. Finally, Asia and the Rest of the World grew 29% in the quarter with very strong growth in most product lines. As you heard from Shawn, China had outstanding growth of 44% in the quarter with excellent growth across most product lines. We are benefiting from robust demand in many of the market segments we serve. This includes very strong growth in Life Sciences, Food and Chemical. From a product point of view, our industrial customers are seeking greater automation and digitalization, which bodes very well for our product offering. We're also seeing benefits of government spending in key priority areas, such as new research labs, safety in food supply and packaged foods and investments in various strategic priorities. Our achievement in China are a great example of how we positioned ourselves to capture growth as demand recovered. Our Spinnaker sales and marketing techniques, including our go-to-market approach, which we adapted due to a new environment, have served us very well in terms of identifying and capturing these growth opportunities. We have also worked over many years to ensure that our product portfolio in China is well suited for the local market, which gives us an advantage. We expect good momentum to continue in China this quarter, And then you will see a more modest growth in the second half of the year due to very strong growth in the prior year. 
One final comment on the business. Service and Consumables performed well and were up 11% in the quarter. That concludes my comments on the business. Not only is our business off to a great start in 2021, we also made a strategic bolt-on acquisition to further expand one of our most attractive businesses, process analytics. Let me provide some additional insights into the acquisition. We are a global leader in real-time measurement of key process control parameters, which customers use to optimize their production processes. About 50% of the Process Analytics business is to the pharma and biopharma market, with an emphasis on sensors to monitor PH, dissolved oxygen, carbon dioxide and other parameters. Our solutions combine sensor technologies for specific measurements, transmitters and services. The sensors must be calibrated, maintained and replaced on a timely basis, which creates an attractive consumable stream. Process Analytics has achieved above-market growth for numerous years, benefiting from the strength in bioproduction and very successful Spinnaker sales and marketing strategies and techniques. We also have a great track record of technology innovation. We are a leader in the market with our innovative intelligent sensor management technology, which optimizes sensor replacement to avoid unexpected downtime. Other examples of innovations include in-line measurement of carbon dioxide and high-performance optical sensors for dissolved oxygen. The company we acquired, PendoTECH, is a manufacturer and distributor of single-use sensors, transmitters, control systems and software, serving the biopharmaceutical manufacturers and life science laboratories. Their primary focus is pressure, which is a common control parameter used in bioprocess applications. They are well recognized for the leading edge innovation in single-use sensors that are becoming increasingly important in bioproduction as it provides greater manufacturing flexibility. They have extensive knowledge surrounding disposable flow cells and connector designs, and have strong bioprocess downstream application know-how. 
This is an excellent strategic acquisition as it expands our presence in the very attractive high-growth bioprocess market. We have a complementary offering in bioprocessing applications of our strength in upstream and PendoTECH in downstream. With the combination, we will create one of the most competitive single-use sensor offerings in the market. We see attractive cross-selling opportunities as we believe there is significant customer benefit from using the same vendor in upstream and downstream bioprocess applications. Finally, we see good opportunity to expand PendoTECH's presence on a global basis, leveraging our global reach and large customer base. We are excited about this transaction and believe it will further our already strong leadership position in Process Analytics. 
Let me wrap up by commenting that we are off to a very good start to the year. The team has shown a tremendous level of resilience and agility in adapting and reacting to market conditions that are changing rapidly. We remain focused on meeting our customer needs and believe we can continue to gain market share and deliver strong results. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we now want to open the line for questions."

I mean, the -- whenever I read the scientific Twitter feeds, there's still tons of articles and complaints about the pipette shortages. I'm just interested -- I just would like a little bit more color there. And also, how has that sort of been contributed to your overall pricing? I assume that if there's a pipette shortage and that means that people are willing to pay more for it. So can you talk about have you seen some incremental pricing gains in the business as a result of that, and so do those sort of dissipate as well?"

Well, first on the shortage of pipettes and pipette tips in the market right now. You're absolutely spot on. There is still a shortage in the market, especially related to COVID-19 testing. But as Shawn elaborated, we definitely expect the testing demand for COVID-19 going down towards the second half of the year. And there's probably not the same amount in life science research or other areas that would compensate fully for that demand.

Our business model is really on increasing market share every year by better go-to-market strategy with our Spinnaker sales and marketing technologies, having unique products in the market in terms of our design, usability, et cetera, they are very much favored by our customers. And we see that growth story to continue for quite some time. We still have plenty of headroom to grow. That will not change. It's fundamentally an organic growth story. We continue to do bolt-on acquisitions, tuck-in acquisitions. You could all recall them wherever we think it makes sense from a technology perspective or where it complements our product portfolio. So I'm personally, of course, very committed to the organic growth strategy, which doesn't mean we are looking at potential acquisitions as they would make sense.

We continue to evolve also the underlying strong programs and strategies we have put in place around Spinnaker sales and marketing, which is -- has been an evolution in strategies for more than 10 or 15 years already. 
The same is true on the Stern Drive program regarding operational excellence and productivity projects across the company. I will definitely continue to work with the team on those, both of those programs because we think and we are convinced they still have a lot of headroom. I was talking a little bit about our opportunity to gain market share, it's very tangible for us. We see the opportunities. We see the market opportunities. We guide the sales force into the right directions. And frankly, we also have very solid product development, new product development program underway that we continue to exit. That will be definitely also a strategic focus area for myself, to make sure that we launch products into market segments where we see the strongest underlying growth. Over the last 10, 15 years, Mettler continuously made a shift more towards faster-growing market spaces in the Lab and life science market, which continues to grow. And there's definitely, again, an emphasis also on my side to continue that trajectory to find, identify and capture these faster-growing market segments for Mettler-Toledo.

Well, let me take it, Patrick. Look, we are really, really happy with our results in China. I think it was truly exceptional, much better than we expected, and we commend the team for the excellent execution and capitalizing on the growth opportunities we have there. There have been several dynamics that you should consider when evaluating our China results. First, the number looks very high for the first quarter, but the comparisons are very easy because they were down 13% in the prior year. However, the 2-year combined growth rate is still very good. We are very strongly positioned in China with our sales and marketing initiatives, which are allowing us to gain share and support customers. 
We also have worked over the last numerous years to adapt our products for the local market, which helps to support our leading position in many of the product categories in China. And in terms of the underlying dynamics, Shawn said, we see strong recovery in many of our end markets. Life Sciences, in particular, is very strong and continue -- we continue to expect growth from this end market. Other dynamics we are seeing is that although we primarily serve local markets in China, our local customers there see some greater demand from the western world, actually. And that, of course, fueled some of the end markets for us like chemical. And finally, I think we're also benefiting from the government spending. If you look at China's 5-year plan and the investments behind it, in things like new labs, funding research also continue to fund safety in food supply, also in packaged food is impacted as well, that plays out for us very well. So -- and then last but not least, similar to the rest of the world, there is an increasing focus also on automation, which plays very well for our offerings in China. So we are pretty confident that the momentum in China will continue and we strongly believe we will have a very good Q2. And then, as we said, also more moderate growth because of tougher compares in the second half of the year."

We still -- but at the same time, we have challenges as well. I just feel like the team has done a good job of overcoming those challenges. In the short term, right now, we're not -- we haven't built anything in particular in terms of our projections in terms of any supply chain disruptions. And right now, we feel like we can continue to manage it. We also benefit, I think, a little bit from the diversity in our business. And so if there is a component shortage in a particular area, so far, it hasn't been that significant to the overall group. But certainly, don't want to downplay it either. It's certainly a topic that the team's working really hard at globally."

We -- in some areas, we have built some safety stock, especially in areas of semiconductors that are under pressure right now as you have heard from other parts of the industry. Take the automobile industry, where they have sent thousands of workers home last week, for example, in Germany because of shortage of electronic components. Again, our supply chain team is working with our vendors very closely to make sure that we understand the overall supply chain situation, build safety stock wherever possible and then continue to mitigate. We also continue to mitigate internally, looking into even potential design changes where it would be adequate to make sure that we can continue to manufacture with other components if needed. Pretty unpredictable right now. I would say that the supply chain spends more energy than ever on this topic, to ensure that we are not facing any major shortage, but we are certainly not immune from the overall trends. So no guarantees, but I can tell you that we, at least for the most competitive components, we know of, we handle them also with some -- we have some safety stock, et cetera."

What you'll kind of see as the year progresses, I think you'll start to see a little bit more improvement from the pricing program that we talked about in the initial question from Derik. We'll continue to also have benefits, especially in the second quarter from higher volumes. But kind of on the other side of that, we do have higher costs related to material costs as well as freight. And then another dynamic that we're going to see in the second quarter is that if you think back a year ago, that's the quarter when we started to have a lot of temporary cost savings in the business. And a lot of those cost savings will now be coming back into the cost structure in the second quarter. And so that would be kind of like a, something kind of going the other way."

So as I said, extremely pleased with the acquisition of PendoTECH. I think it's really complementary also to our strength that we already have in some of the bioprocessing and even some single-use sensors that we also have at Mettler-Toledo. So it's complementing the portfolio very nicely. PendoTECH definitely stronger in downstream. We are more at the moment, stronger in upstream. But if you look at the combination of the 2 businesses, as I said, it's actually very beneficial for customers to have the same window for both upstream and downstream applications. I think we, from as Mettler-Toledo, bring a lot to the table for PendoTECH in terms of our global reach, global footprint, our customer base and expand actually the market reach for them worldwide. 
We also have definitely sensor technology know-how in areas where they don't play today. But they have, on the other hand, a lot of design knowhow of how to implement sensors in single-use designs that are used in downstream applications. So I think there's a lot of technology leverage that comes together, as well as a good market leverage in terms of our strength and our global reach that we have as Mettler-Toledo. The integration is going extremely well. We are very pleased of how things are going. There was 0 disruption for our customers. Actually, the response we have received from PendoTECH customers was extremely positive. We are helping them also on the supply chain side, securing supply for actually increased demands in -- for their products as well. So I think this is really a combination of 2 companies that will provide a lot of benefit for customers in the biopharma space."

But I can tell you that the sales cycle, of course, for investments like you would see it in product inspections are definitely longer. I mean these products are in most of the cases, is it designed for the specific application and the specific line of the customer. So you have to think about the customer has basically a food manufacturing line, and they will ask -- they want to add some specific product inspection, whether it's metal detection, whether it's X-ray, whether it's visual inspection, and the devices have to fit their manufacturing line. 
So part of the process is basically that our sales rep would come in and work with the customer on, number one, what -- what his needs are in terms of the subject that he wants to detect in there, whether it's x-ray, whether it's metal detection, whether it's visual or check lane, even. And then it comes to the point where we say, okay, we have the right solutions. And then it comes to designing to the installed base of the rest of the manufacturing line that is in place there. So it fits. And that cycle actually takes a couple of days to several weeks to get through to final approval process with the customer as well and then the system is built. So it's not something that's will turn around in a couple of weeks when you talk about pent-up demand. What we're doing, however, is, we start -- we increased our marketing efforts. We also brought our demo trucks back on the road, especially in Europe, to be close to customers who cannot go to trade shows, et cetera. So we bring the product to customers so they can see them, how they look like and then can basically start the conversation with the our sales rep about potential investments for the next couple of quarters.

In fact, I think if you look at the multiyear stack, it's actually going to be very similar even, excluding the PendoTECH acquisition. I think as we look at the second half of the year, as we kind of talked about earlier, there's a few different factors. One, we have a more difficult comparison, but I guess that would neutralize in the multiyear. But if you look at the, this Q1, Q2 and even as we kind of ended 2020, we did feel like there was an element of pent-up demand and various dynamics kind of going around, already starting in China in Q3 of last year, starting to accelerate in other parts of the world in Q4. And then we saw a very significant momentum gain here in Q1 with other markets outside of biopharma really starting to recover. And so it's always difficult to really determine and quantify how much is attributable to pent-up. Right now, as we talked about earlier, we're just not assuming that there's any additional pent-up for the second half of the year. But if you look at our multiyear growth rates for the second half, I think it's more consistent with our historical, normalized growth rates.

And it seems to be affecting things more from a social lockdown perspective and less business impact. I'm not saying that -- I'm not saying we're -- the economies are resilient to COVID and that there couldn't ultimately be some kind of a knock-on risk effect. But if we just observe things like Europe's been in a pretty heavy lockdown for the last few months and you see the business environment. But then you look at the rest of the world, like a country like India, who's going through a very severe situation at the moment, our end markets are still actually doing well there. We'll continue to monitor that. Of course, that's 2%-3% of our business, probably more in the 2% kind of a range.

But hey, Process Analytics is doing extremely well, about half of the business or so has an exposure to bioproduction. As you can imagine, that part of the business is doing really well. We've had a lot of really great photo ops in that business actually around the world over the last few months with leaders around the world visiting bioproduction plants and then our equipment's behind it. A recent one was when President Biden was at the Pfizer plant in Michigan. So that business is doing really well. We've always felt very strongly about that.

Several factors contributed to these",332,"Thanks, Mary, and good evening, everyone. I am pleased to host the call tonight, which we are doing from Switzerland as Shawn and Mary are here with me, too. I'm excited to report another quarter of excellent results. Several factors contributed to these results. First, demand in our markets was very strong and broad-based. Second, we were able to capture these growth opportunities as a key priority since the onset of the pandemic was to stay close -- in close contact with our customers and be strongly positioned once customer demand recovered. And finally, the teams around the world have done an excellent job in execution and customer support. Our supply chain team has had more than the share of challenges due to part availability and logistics complications while our market organizations have executed well to meet increasing customer demands. Our teams have shown resiliency and agility in an environment where conditions change rapidly.
Now let me turn to our financial results. The highlights are on Page 3 of the presentation and you can see we had a great quarter. Local currency sales growth was 27%, and we had very strong broad-based growth in all regions and most product lines. With the exception with this exceptional sales growth and combined with focused execution of our margin initiatives, we achieved a 45% growth in adjusted operating income and 53% increase in adjusted EPS. Cash flow generation was excellent in the quarter. Demand in our end markets remains positive, although our growth for the remainder of the year will reflect more challenging comparisons than we had in the first half of the year. We are making incremental investments, which will position us very well for future growth. We remain confident that we can continue to gain market share and deliver strong results in 2021 and beyond.
Let me now turn it to Shawn to cover the financials and guidance details, and then I will come back with some additional commentary on the business. Shawn?"

On a U.S. dollar basis, sales increased 34% as currency benefited sales growth by 7% in the quarter. The PendoTECH acquisition contributed approximately 1% to sales growth in the quarter.
On Slide #4, we show sales growth by region. Local currency sales increased 29% in the Americas, 23% in Europe and 28% in Asia/Rest of World. Local currency sales increased 35% in China in the quarter.
The next slide shows sales growth by region for the first half of the year. Local currency sales grew 23% for the first 6 months with a 22% increase in the Americas, 18% in Europe and 28% growth in Asia/Rest of World.
On Slide #6, we summarized local currency sales growth by product area. For the second quarter, laboratory sales increased 35%, industrial increased 20%, with core industrial up 27% and product inspection up 9%. Food retail increased 9% in the quarter.
The next slide shows local currency sales growth by product area for the first half. Laboratory sales increased 27% and industrial increased 19% with core industrial up 27% and product inspection up 7%. Food Retail increased 11% for the first 6 months.
Let me now move to the rest of the P&L, which is summarized on Slide #8. Gross margin in the quarter was 58.1%, a 50 basis point increase over the prior year level of 57.6%. We benefited from volume and pricing, which was offset in part by challenges in the global supply chain, namely higher transportation, logistics and raw material costs. These items are even more challenging than we had expected the last time we spoke. One additional factor, as you compare to the prior year, we now have in our cost structure, the impact of the temporary cost actions we undertook in 2020.
R&D amounted to $42.6 million in the quarter, which is a 28% increase in local currency over the prior period. The impact of the temporary cost reductions undertaken last year as well as the timing of project activity contributed to this increase.
SG&A amounted to $239 million, a 20% increase in local currency over the prior year. The impact of the temporary cost savings that we undertook last year, higher variable compensation and increased investments in sales and marketing were the principal factors driving the increase.
Adjusted operating profit amounted to $255.3 million in the quarter, a 45% increase over the prior year amount of $176.6 million. Adjusted operating margins increased 200 basis points in the quarter to 27.6%. We are pleased with this margin growth, which reflects excellent sales growth, combined with focused execution on our margin initiatives. Currency benefited operating profit growth by approximately 7%, but had little impact on operating margins.
A couple of final comments on the P&L. Operating -- I'm sorry, amortization amounted to $16.2 million in the quarter. Interest expense was $10.4 million in the quarter and other income in the quarter amounted to $2.7 million primarily reflecting non-service-related pension income.
Our effective tax rate before discrete items and adjusted for the timing of stock option deductions was 19.5%. Fully diluted shares amounted to $23.5 million in the quarter, which is a 3% decline from the prior year. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $8.10, a 53% increase over the prior year amount of $5.29. Currency benefited adjusted EPS growth by approximately 7% in the quarter. On a reported basis in the quarter, EPS was $7.85 as compared to $5.22 in the prior year. Reported EPS in the quarter includes $0.19 of purchased intangible amortization, $0.03 of restructuring and $0.03 due to the difference between our quarterly and annual tax rate due to the timing of stock option exercises.
The next slide shows our P&L for the first half. Local currency sales grew 23% for the 6 months. Adjusted operating income increased 47% with margins up 330 basis points. Adjusted EPS grew 58% on a year-to-date basis. That covers the P&L, and let me now comment on cash flow. In the quarter, adjusted free cash flow amounted to $233.3 million, which is an increase of 41% on a per share basis as compared to the prior year. We are very happy with our cash flow generation.
DSO was 36 days, which is 4 days less than the prior year. ITO came in at 4.6x, which is slightly better than last year. For the first half, adjusted free cash flow amounted to $372.2 million, an increase of 75% on a per share basis as compared to the prior year.
Let me now turn to guidance. Forecasting continues to be challenging. Market conditions are very dynamic and changes to the business environment can happen quickly. Uncertainty remains surrounding COVID-19, in particular, the impact of the latest variance, the worldwide pace of vaccinations and related potential shutdowns and/or restrictions. The ultimate impact on the global economy is also still uncertain. In addition, we are monitoring our supply chain very closely and recognize we must remain very agile in order to adapt to unexpected material shortages, inflationary pressures and unforeseen logistic challenges, which can create unexpected volatility. As we enter the second half of the year, demand in our end markets is positive, although we face more challenging comparisons for the remainder of the year as compared to the first half of this year. The organization continues to execute well and has demonstrated a high level of resilience and agility and adapting to rapidly changing market conditions. We are making incremental investments for future growth and continue to feel confident in our ability to gain market share and drive earnings growth in 2021 and beyond.
Now let me cover the specifics. For the full year 2021, with the benefit of our strong Q2 results and improved outlook for the remainder of the year, we now expect local currency sales growth for the full year to be approximately 15%. This compares to our previous guidance range of 10% to 12%. We expect full year adjusted EPS to be in the range of $32.60 to $32.90, which is a growth rate of 27% to 28%. This compares to previous guidance of adjusted EPS in the range of $31.45 to $31.90. With respect to the third quarter, we would expect local currency sales growth to be in the range of 11% to 13% and expect adjusted EPS to be in a range of $8.12 to $8.27, a growth rate of 16% to 18%. In terms of free cash flow for the year, we now expect it to be in the range of $770 million. We expect to repurchase in total 1 billion in shares in 2021, which should put us in the range of a net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio of approximately 1.5x at the end of the year.
Some final details on guidance. With respect to the impact of currency on sales growth, we expect currency to increase sales growth by approximately 3% in 2021 and 2% in the third quarter. In terms of adjusted EPS, currency will benefit growth by approximately 3% in the quarter and approximately 3.5% for the full year 2021.
That is it from my side, and I'll now turn it back to Patrick."

Let me make some comments on our operating businesses, starting with Lab, which had an outstanding growth of 35% in the quarter. Pipettes had excellent growth. all other major product categories also had robust sales growth and growth in all regions was very strong. Biopharma continues to be very favorable and continuing the trend we saw in the first quarter. We see strong customer demand in other segments such as chemical. We expect demand for our laboratory products to continue to be positive due to favorable biopharma trends, vaccine research and bioproduction scale-up and production. While we faced tougher comparisons in the second half of the year, we remain confident we can continue to capture share, given the strength of our product portfolio and continued execution of our Spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives. In terms of our industrial business, core industrial did very well in the quarter with a 27% increase in sales. All 3 regions of the world had robust core industrial growth. Improving market conditions, including some benefit from pent-up demand, combined with the strength and diversity of our product portfolio and our focus on attractive market segments contributed to the strong results. Similar to my comments on laboratory, we will face tougher comparisons for the second half of the year, but our outlook and our confidence in gaining market share remains positive for this business. Product Inspection had increased momentum and solid sales growth of 9% in the quarter. We saw good growth in all regions. We expect good growth in product inspection for the remainder of the year as we are gaining better access to our customer facilities and believe we will benefit from some pent-up demand in the business. Food retailing grew 9% in the quarter.
Let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales in Europe increased 23% in the quarter with excellent growth in lab, core industrial and food retail. Americas increased 29% in the quarter with excellent growth in lab and core industrial. Product Inspection did well in the Americas, while food retail declined. Finally, Asia and the rest of the world grew 28% in the quarter with outstanding growth in Laboratory and Industrial. As you hear from Shawn, China had another quarter of stellar growth. We would expect another good quarter of growth in Q3 in China, although not at the same level of the first half as China faces more challenging comparisons. We are strongly positioned in China, and the team is executing very well.
One final comment on the business. Service and consumables performed very well and were up 23% in the quarter. We are very happy with the growth in this important and profitable part of the business.
That concludes my comments on the business. With our better-than-expected sales growth in the first half, we are making incremental investments for future growth. These investments are centered on innovation and operational excellence. In product development, in our manufacturing facilities and in our corporate programs such as pinnacle sales and marketing. Let me give you some recent examples, starting with product development, where we have a proven track record of launching market-leading technologies. It all stems from our deep knowledge of customer processes and what our solutions can do to enhance or improve these processes. We think of innovation in product development as customer-centric rather than technology-centric. We are focused on the specific value of our solutions can provide to customers, for example, in terms of productivity, compliance-related matters, safety or data integrity. On the website, we have recently launched our newest version of our LabX instrument control and data management software. This latest vision fully supports the lab digitalization, and with the strong adoption of our customer base, we have doubled the number of instruments that can be networked. LabX increases our customers' productivity by speeding up daily work through the management of data and development of workflows. It enhances security and compliance, ensuring data quality and full data traceability. Finally, LabX helps reduce complexity in asset managers data, assets and workflow centrally and seamlessly integrates into laboratory data management systems such as LIMS. Software is progressively becoming a deciding factor for customers in choosing a supplier for BenchTop Lab Solutions. With the increasing importance of software, LabX is helping to position us as a trusted adviser for certain global pharma customers as we meet their demands for instruments, service and software. While Lab receives the greater share of R&D investments, we also have some great examples of new products on the industrial side, including a best-in-class industrial terminal, which provides fully integrated weighing applications for -- with the industry's fastest processing speed. Similarly, we launched new load cell technology in our product inspection business, which provides industry-leading checkweighing throughputs with maximum precision. Both of these products provide value by increasing customers' productivity. New products highlight our deep and great knowledge of our customers' processes and pain points and allow us to lead the market with technology to provide specific value to customers. We are also investing in our manufacturing facilities to boost productivity. Last quarter, we rolled out significant automation in our pet harvesting process, resulting in a meaningful increase in yield per molding machine. This quarter, we are unveiling a new expanded clean room for our pipette manufacturing as well as inaugurating a new facility for our secondary brand, Biotics, that will expand our pipette and tip manufacturing capacity and efficiency. We are also launching a project for our Process Analytics business in the U.S. to optimize production and its warehouse warehouse layout, which will yield improvements in material flow in productivity and production capacity. We also continue to invest in innovation in our corporate programs. You have seen over many years for tremendous innovation in our Spinnaker sales and marketing programs. A current priority area for us is maximizing our cross-selling capabilities. Because we utilize a specialized sales force, cross-selling techniques are different than what you might hear from companies that help that use a more generalist sales force approach. Our goal is to use data analytics to identify customer sites in which we have low cross-selling penetration. We then use contacts and references to develop warm and hot leads to other product categories. It involves data and qualification analytics, and these leads have proven to be very effective in converting to sales. Another innovative techniques we are using to stay fully engaged with customer is greater use of webinars. In the past, we would conduct a few hundred webinars annually. While our goal this year is to launch 2,000 webinars in local languages, which helps to overcome the limitations we face with customer interactions due to the pandemic. We have professionalized the delivery of the webinars and have expanded our topics to include items such as compliance, productivity, Industry 4.0 and data integrity. From a customer's perspective, webinars are very cost and time efficient while still allowing for interactions with experts from various businesses. Our supply chain team and pricing team are also demonstrating a high level of innovation. For our supply chain team, agility continues to be a necessity in overcoming the many challenges of the current environment. At the same time, they also continue to make excellent progress on Stern Drive, our corporate initiative to continuously improve and drive world-class operations and supply chain. Stern Drive comprises several hundred projects throughout manufacturing and back-office operations, focused on material cost reductions, shop floor productivity and back office productivity.
Finally, the pricing team also shown great resilience and agility in reacting to inflationary pressures. They moved quickly earlier this year to implement certain midyear price changes and at the same time, they continue to work strategically on some pricing initiatives to help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of life quotes to customers. Incorporating data analytics into upfront processes will make quoting more effective and easier and more efficient for our salespeople. These are just a few of many examples we have internally in which we continue to move our initiatives to another level. We recently held a virtual leadership meeting with senior leaders from around the world with the theme of doubling down to drive growth. What we emphasize to our senior leaders and to you today is we have a great strategy in place, and we'll execute on it in an even more determined way than before. We will continue to invest in innovation to double down on enhancing our initiatives that are the foundation of our future growth. We remain confident that our strategies are effective in capturing market share and driving sales and operating profit.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and I want to ask the operator to open the line for questions."

But for Q3 right now, we're looking at high teens growth for Q3, and then for the full year, we're looking at mid-20s. But we fully agree. We enter the second half of the year with extremely strong momentum in China. Also very strong execution from our team there. There's very -- there's many favorable dynamics in China at the moment, whether it's life sciences, whether it's investments in industrial, whether it's trends towards automation and digitalization many strategic investments in different subsegments like microelectronics or lithium batteries. And I feel like our team continues to do an excellent job of capturing these opportunities. One of the challenges we start to have in the second half, though, of course, is that we start to lap some pretty significant comparisons to the previous year. And as you said, too, like there is a topic of pent-up demand and when the recovery started in Q3 of last year, that was very much a local recovery. And then as kind of we started to progress through 2021, it became -- China was benefiting much more from the global recovery. And what's always hard to tell is how much are we benefiting from pent up. And there also is an element of stimulus in China. We talked a lot about this last quarter as well. But clearly, the government is investing very heavily in many different sectors, whether it's programs related to the 5-year plan, or whether it's investments in the industrial sector further developing the economic zone going out to the western part of the country. And it's always difficult to tell how much we're benefiting from these trends as well."

I guess I'm just sort of asking for a little bit of detail on how we should chart the course for PI over the next, call it, couple of quarters?"

But I think there's still this pent-up opportunity for all geographies as we go forward. I think there will be an element, and I think we're well positioned for it.

The reason why I mentioned it with product inspection, though, is if you just think back from the beginning of the pandemic, product inspection has been the 1 business that's arguably been the most impacted just from some of the dynamics in the food manufacturing sector. We're not necessary -- we've seen improvement in those dynamics over the course of this quarter, things are starting to, I'd say, reopen more so. We have more access to plants and facilities to work on projects than we did a quarter ago. But I just mentioned it because those things -- dynamics can also change quickly if if the variance start to create a situation where packaged food companies start to prohibit access to their facilities."

Maybe I can answer the second part of your question and just kind of like walk down the different businesses and geographies just to kind of get that out there as well, too. So if we kind of start with the lab business, we're looking at mid-teens growth in Q3. And then we're looking at high teens for the full year. If we look at product inspection, I think I already said this, low double digit in Q3 and high single digit for the full year. If we look at core industrial, we're looking at low double digit for Q3 and mid-teens for the full year. And then if we look at food retailing, we're looking to be down low to mid-teens in Q3 and flattish for the full year. And then by geography, we're looking to be high single digit for Q3 and low double digit for the full year. For the Americas, we're looking to be low to mid-teens in Q3 and mid-teens for the full year. And then for China, we already mentioned high teens for Q3 and mid-20s for the full year."

I think a lot of it is based on our outstanding portfolio that we have that we continue to improve. And you hear in my comments as well about the new products we just recently launched. There is very strong demand across all regions in the lab business. As you know, over time, we have increased our share in Lab as a total part of the business significantly over the last years, and that will most likely continue as the underlying momentum in the end markets is also very strong. I mean a lot of it is driven by the life sciences market where we see a lot of adoption of our products. Our AutoChem business is doing extremely well and is adopted also in new segments like battery manufacturing and better development for e-mobility. So we are very confident in our Lab growth, and that will probably moving forward, given also the strong into biopharma, [ B2 to 1 ] segment that will continue to lead the growth for all of the businesses.

So the supply chain, supply chain side is -- I would say the supplier situation is particularly challenging with respect to electronics. That's probably the most concerning part for us right now, and you hear it also from a different part of industries. In that regard, we are also facing longer lead times. We are starting to battle obsolescence issues. We have short-term notices from our suppliers which then will require also R&D teams to jump in and to redesign some of the products. On top of that, transportation and logistics, as Shawn said are also challenging for our team. We do see bottlenecks and delays there. However, we are really doing working on these topics to help offset. In terms of mitigation strategies, again, on material shortages, what we do for electronic components, some of it is redesigning short term our products to make sure that we can deliver. We have been very successful so far. I would say we have been very successful, fulfilling our customer demand this quarter. But it's definitely locking in more resources than we initially thought. And we also, of course, as Shawn said, we are facing some price increases on components -- electronic components, for example, which go now through  situations, where you just have to pay much higher prices than you used to. And that impacts us a little bit on the gross margin side as well. Moving forward, we are closely monitoring the situation. Again, we have team prepared with mitigation strategies in case situations get more tricky, but it's hard to predict where it might hit you next. Again, we are most exposed currently on some of the economic parts. Some of it will more impact retail for Q3 as well as retailers leveraging also components that are used in consumer electronics and those are under most pressure right now. So again, there are several areas where we have to tackle these issues. We have the right teams in place. And of course, we are also trying different ways to supply material for Q3, I think it will not be so far, but we see not be a major one, but we are on our toes to make sure that we can react as quickly as possible if the situation gets more intense."

And look, what we're hearing from our customers, they actually love the new ways of -- that we have engaging with them. I mentioned in my remarks upfront, webinars, where we really scaled up significantly. Last year, we did a couple of hundreds of webinars, and we now go to 2,000 because we see such a strong resonance from our customers on having that information and interaction channel that on top with a really specialized sales force, which is also fully back in action. It gives us an opportunity to, again, to use our direct sales force to really go also after competitive accounts in new accounts, approaching these with our solutions and their deep knowledge about our product portfolio, but use the broader digital channel also for existing customers and again, broadcasting solutions in a much better way than we could in the past. Our customers, I think, at the moment, if you look at the amount of trade shows that are, for example, available still limited. So they're really looking also to us to say, give us different ways of how you can demonstrate your products in if you're not a trade shows, if you cannot attend plays so we use digital demos. We have studios and every major site to virtual product demos, and that has been very well received by our customers. And I trust that it will continue that way. We will have a very complementary setup where our direct sales force will be in terms of consultative selling and product solutions will be on customer sites, but we will use the broader channel and e-commerce channel, also to digitally interface with customers. It will be -- it will drive efficiency gains. Is it cost saving, I would say, it's an efficiency gain for us moving forward. We do not think about this that that is necessarily an opportunity to scale back our sales force. It's again an additional channel and a competitive advantage for us to engage with customers on many different levels, face-to-face interaction as well as digital interaction. By the way, we also scaled up telesales over the last several years, significantly to back up our direct sales force and that has been proven to be very effective as well."

And then second, as we look to 2022 and potentially revenue growth maybe starts to normalize from a higher level this year.

So of course, there's a lot of different moving pieces with our expense growth. I think 1 of the big piece is to not lose sight of is that we had prior year cost savings. And of course, that that optically affects this year's number as we kind of bring back the workforce and things like that where we had some workforce savings from last year. We still have an element -- And we also had some discretionary topics last year as well where we had savings. The 1 area where we have not brought things back 100% would be in the area of travel, and I think that one will play out over time. And then -- but then kind of another factor, of course, is variable compensation. And so if you think about like last year, we had much lower variable compensation this year, we're going to have much higher variable compensation. And then the third piece I would say is kind of this element of the investments. And the investments are very much a sign of the strength of of the organization in terms of our end markets and trying to pursue growth opportunities for the future and really take advantage of the situation. So I'd say these are certainly incremental investments. There are a wide range of different types of investments. We talked about field turbo resources during our last call. That program is going to be a little bit more disproportionately invested towards China versus the rest of the world, but it is a very global program. We're doing other things that are more sales and marketing in nature that we do on an ongoing basis, but we're going to do a little bit more than we normally do during the second half of the year. And then we're investing in other things in terms of -- from a product perspective. But I wouldn't say we're necessarily accelerating things, but we certainly are working on our priority list. And so I think every company has a priority list, and we're able to work down that list at a more accelerated rate, just given the strong results that we see in the business."

They're using them these leads to send basically other dedicated sales team members with the right background and know-how to these other accounts within a customer count.

I am pleased to host the call tonight, which we are doing from Switzerland as Shawn and Mary are here with me, too. I'm excited to report another quarter of excellent results. Several factors contributed to these results. First, demand in our markets was very strong and broad-based. Second, we were able to capture these growth opportunities as a key priority since the onset of the pandemic was to stay close -- in close contact with our customers and be strongly positioned once customer demand recovered. And finally, the teams around the world have done an excellent job in execution and customer support. Our supply chain team has had more than the share of challenges due to part availability and logistics complications while our market organizations have executed well to meet increasing customer demands. Our teams have shown resiliency and agility in an environment where conditions change rapidly.
Now let me turn to our financial results. The highlights are on Page 3 of the presentation and you can see we had a great quarter. Local currency sales growth was 27%, and we had very strong broad-based growth in all regions and most product lines. With the exception with this exceptional sales growth and combined with focused execution of our margin initiatives, we achieved a 45% growth in adjusted operating income and 53% increase in adjusted EPS. Cash flow generation was excellent in the quarter. Demand in our end markets remains positive, although our growth for the remainder of the year will reflect more challenging comparisons than we had in the first half of the year. We are making incremental investments, which will position us very well for future growth. We remain confident that we can continue to gain market share and deliver strong results in 2021 and beyond.
Let me now turn it to Shawn to cover the financials and guidance details, and then I will come back with some additional commentary on the business. Shawn?"

On a U.S. dollar basis, sales increased 34% as currency benefited sales growth by 7% in the quarter. The PendoTECH acquisition contributed approximately 1% to sales growth in the quarter.
On Slide #4, we show sales growth by region. Local currency sales increased 29% in the Americas, 23% in Europe and 28% in Asia/Rest of World. Local currency sales increased 35% in China in the quarter.
The next slide shows sales growth by region for the first half of the year. Local currency sales grew 23% for the first 6 months with a 22% increase in the Americas, 18% in Europe and 28% growth in Asia/Rest of World.
On Slide #6, we summarized local currency sales growth by product area. For the second quarter, laboratory sales increased 35%, industrial increased 20%, with core industrial up 27% and product inspection up 9%. Food retail increased 9% in the quarter.
The next slide shows local currency sales growth by product area for the first half. Laboratory sales increased 27% and industrial increased 19% with core industrial up 27% and product inspection up 7%. Food Retail increased 11% for the first 6 months.
Let me now move to the rest of the P&L, which is summarized on Slide #8. Gross margin in the quarter was 58.1%, a 50 basis point increase over the prior year level of 57.6%. We benefited from volume and pricing, which was offset in part by challenges in the global supply chain, namely higher transportation, logistics and raw material costs. These items are even more challenging than we had expected the last time we spoke. One additional factor, as you compare to the prior year, we now have in our cost structure, the impact of the temporary cost actions we undertook in 2020.
R&D amounted to $42.6 million in the quarter, which is a 28% increase in local currency over the prior period. The impact of the temporary cost reductions undertaken last year as well as the timing of project activity contributed to this increase.
SG&A amounted to $239 million, a 20% increase in local currency over the prior year. The impact of the temporary cost savings that we undertook last year, higher variable compensation and increased investments in sales and marketing were the principal factors driving the increase.
Adjusted operating profit amounted to $255.3 million in the quarter, a 45% increase over the prior year amount of $176.6 million. Adjusted operating margins increased 200 basis points in the quarter to 27.6%. We are pleased with this margin growth, which reflects excellent sales growth, combined with focused execution on our margin initiatives. Currency benefited operating profit growth by approximately 7%, but had little impact on operating margins.
A couple of final comments on the P&L. Operating -- I'm sorry, amortization amounted to $16.2 million in the quarter. Interest expense was $10.4 million in the quarter and other income in the quarter amounted to $2.7 million primarily reflecting non-service-related pension income.
Our effective tax rate before discrete items and adjusted for the timing of stock option deductions was 19.5%. Fully diluted shares amounted to $23.5 million in the quarter, which is a 3% decline from the prior year. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $8.10, a 53% increase over the prior year amount of $5.29. Currency benefited adjusted EPS growth by approximately 7% in the quarter. On a reported basis in the quarter, EPS was $7.85 as compared to $5.22 in the prior year. Reported EPS in the quarter includes $0.19 of purchased intangible amortization, $0.03 of restructuring and $0.03 due to the difference between our quarterly and annual tax rate due to the timing of stock option exercises.
The next slide shows our P&L for the first half. Local currency sales grew 23% for the 6 months. Adjusted operating income increased 47% with margins up 330 basis points. Adjusted EPS grew 58% on a year-to-date basis. That covers the P&L, and let me now comment on cash flow. In the quarter, adjusted free cash flow amounted to $233.3 million, which is an increase of 41% on a per share basis as compared to the prior year. We are very happy with our cash flow generation.
DSO was 36 days, which is 4 days less than the prior year. ITO came in at 4.6x, which is slightly better than last year. For the first half, adjusted free cash flow amounted to $372.2 million, an increase of 75% on a per share basis as compared to the prior year.
Let me now turn to guidance. Forecasting continues to be challenging. Market conditions are very dynamic and changes to the business environment can happen quickly. Uncertainty remains surrounding COVID-19, in particular, the impact of the latest variance, the worldwide pace of vaccinations and related potential shutdowns and/or restrictions. The ultimate impact on the global economy is also still uncertain. In addition, we are monitoring our supply chain very closely and recognize we must remain very agile in order to adapt to unexpected material shortages, inflationary pressures and unforeseen logistic challenges, which can create unexpected volatility. As we enter the second half of the year, demand in our end markets is positive, although we face more challenging comparisons for the remainder of the year as compared to the first half of this year. The organization continues to execute well and has demonstrated a high level of resilience and agility and adapting to rapidly changing market conditions. We are making incremental investments for future growth and continue to feel confident in our ability to gain market share and drive earnings growth in 2021 and beyond.
Now let me cover the specifics. For the full year 2021, with the benefit of our strong Q2 results and improved outlook for the remainder of the year, we now expect local currency sales growth for the full year to be approximately 15%. This compares to our previous guidance range of 10% to 12%. We expect full year adjusted EPS to be in the range of $32.60 to $32.90, which is a growth rate of 27% to 28%. This compares to previous guidance of adjusted EPS in the range of $31.45 to $31.90. With respect to the third quarter, we would expect local currency sales growth to be in the range of 11% to 13% and expect adjusted EPS to be in a range of $8.12 to $8.27, a growth rate of 16% to 18%. In terms of free cash flow for the year, we now expect it to be in the range of $770 million. We expect to repurchase in total 1 billion in shares in 2021, which should put us in the range of a net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio of approximately 1.5x at the end of the year.
Some final details on guidance. With respect to the impact of currency on sales growth, we expect currency to increase sales growth by approximately 3% in 2021 and 2% in the third quarter. In terms of adjusted EPS, currency will benefit growth by approximately 3% in the quarter and approximately 3.5% for the full year 2021.
That is it from my side, and I'll now turn it back to Patrick."

Let me make some comments on our operating businesses, starting with Lab, which had an outstanding growth of 35% in the quarter. Pipettes had excellent growth. all other major product categories also had robust sales growth and growth in all regions was very strong. Biopharma continues to be very favorable and continuing the trend we saw in the first quarter, we see strong customer demand in other segments such as chemical. We expect demand for our laboratory products to continue to be positive due to favorable biopharma trends, vaccine research and bioproduction scale-up and production. While we faced tougher comparisons in the second half of the year, we remain confident we can continue to capture share, given the strength of our product portfolio and continued execution of our Spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives. In terms of our industrial business, core industrial did very well in the quarter with a 27% increase in sales. All 3 regions of the world had robust core industrial growth. Improving market conditions, including some benefit from pent-up demand, combined with the strength and diversity of our product portfolio and our focus on attractive market segments contributed to the strong results. Similar to my comments on laboratory, we will face tougher comparisons for the second half of the year, but our outlook and our confidence in gaining market share remains positive for this business. Product Inspection had increased momentum and solid sales growth of 9% in the quarter. We saw good growth in all regions. We expect good growth in product inspection for the remainder of the year as we are gaining better access to our customer facilities and believe we will benefit from some pent-up demand in the business. Food retailing grew 9% in the quarter.
Let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales in Europe increased 23% in the quarter with excellent growth in lab, core industrial and food retail. Americas increased 29% in the quarter with excellent growth in lab and core industrial. Product Inspection did well in the Americas, while food retail declined. Finally, Asia and the rest of the world grew 28% in the quarter with outstanding growth in Laboratory and Industrial. As you hear from Shawn, China had another quarter of stellar growth. We would expect another good quarter of growth in Q3 in China, although not at the same level of the first half as China faces more challenging comparisons. We are strongly positioned in China, and the team is executing very well.
One final comment on the business. Service and consumables performed very well and were up 23% in the quarter. We are very happy with the growth in this important and profitable part of the business.
That concludes my comments on the business. With our better-than-expected sales growth in the first half, we are making incremental investments for future growth. These investments are centered on innovation and operational excellence. In product development, in our manufacturing facilities and in our corporate programs such as Spinnaker sales and marketing. Let me give you some recent examples, starting with product development, where we have a proven track record of launching market-leading technologies. It all stems from our deep knowledge of customer processes and what our solutions can do to enhance or improve these processes. We think of innovation in product development as customer-centric rather than technology-centric. We are focused on the specific value of our solutions can provide to customers, for example, in terms of productivity, compliance-related matters, safety or data integrity. On the website, we have recently launched our newest version of our LabX instrument control and data management software. This latest vision fully supports the lab digitalization, and with the strong adoption of our customer base, we have doubled the number of instruments that can be networked. LabX increases our customers' productivity by speeding up daily work through the management of data and development of workflows. It enhances security and compliance, ensuring data quality and full data traceability. Finally, LabX helps reduce complexity in asset managers data, assets and workflow centrally and seamlessly integrates into laboratory data management systems such as LIMS. Software is progressively becoming a deciding factor for customers in choosing a supplier for Benchtop lab solutions. With the increasing importance of software, LabX is helping to position us as a trusted adviser for certain global pharma customers as we meet their demands for instruments, service and software. While lab receives the greater share of R&D investments, we also have some great examples of new products on the industrial side, including a best-in-class industrial terminal, which provides fully integrated weighing applications for -- with the industry's fastest processing speed. Similarly, we launched new load cell technology in our product inspection business, which provides industry-leading checkweighing throughputs with maximum precision. Both of these products provide value by increasing customers' productivity. New products highlight our deep and great knowledge of our customers' processes and pain points and allow us to lead the market with technology to provide specific value to customers. We are also investing in our manufacturing facilities to boost productivity. Last quarter, we rolled out significant automation in our pipette and tip harvesting process, resulting in a meaningful increase in yield per molding machine. This quarter, we are unveiling a new expanded clean room for our pipette manufacturing as well as inaugurating a new facility for our secondary brand, Biotix, that will expand our pipette and tip manufacturing capacity and efficiency. We are also launching a project for our Process Analytics business in the U.S. to optimize production and its warehouse layout, which will yield improvements in material flow, in productivity and production capacity. We also continue to invest in innovation in our corporate programs. You have seen over many years for tremendous innovation in our Spinnaker sales and marketing programs. A current priority area for us is maximizing our cross-selling capabilities. Because we utilize a specialized sales force, cross-selling techniques are different than what you might hear from companies that have -- that use a more generalist sales force approach. Our goal is to use data analytics to identify customer sites in which we have low cross-selling penetration. We then use contacts and references to develop warm and hot leads to other product categories. It involves data and qualification analytics, and these leads have proven to be very effective in converting to sales. Another innovative techniques we are using to stay fully engaged with customer is greater use of webinars. In the past, we would conduct a few hundred webinars annually. While our goal this year is to launch 2,000 webinars in local languages, which helps to overcome the limitations we face with customer interactions due to the pandemic. We have professionalized the delivery of the webinars and have expanded our topics to include items such as compliance, productivity, Industry 4.0 and data integrity. From a customer's perspective, webinars are very cost and time-efficient while still allowing for interactions with experts from various businesses. Our supply chain team and pricing team are also demonstrating a high level of innovation. For our supply chain team, agility continues to be a necessity in overcoming the many challenges of the current environment. At the same time, they also continue to make excellent progress on Stern Drive, our corporate initiative to continuously improve and drive world-class operations and supply chain. Stern Drive comprises several hundred projects throughout manufacturing and back-office operations, focused on material cost reductions, shop floor productivity and back office productivity.
Finally, the pricing team also shown great resilience and agility in reacting to inflationary pressures. They moved quickly earlier this year to implement certain midyear price changes and at the same time, they continue to work strategically on some pricing initiatives to help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of life quotes to customers. Incorporating data analytics into upfront processes will make quoting more effective and easier and more efficient for our salespeople. These are just a few of many examples we have internally in which we continue to move our initiatives to another level. We recently held a virtual leadership meeting with senior leaders from around the world with the theme of doubling down to drive growth. What we emphasize to our senior leaders and to you today is we have a great strategy in place, and we'll execute on it in an even more determined way than before. We will continue to invest in innovation to double down on enhancing our initiatives that are the foundation of our future growth. We remain confident that our strategies are effective in capturing market share and driving sales and operating profit.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and I want to ask the operator to open the line for questions."

But for Q3 right now, we're looking at high teens growth for Q3, and then for the full year, we're looking at mid-20s. But we fully agree. We enter the second half of the year with extremely strong momentum in China. Also very strong execution from our team there. There's very -- there's many favorable dynamics in China at the moment, whether it's life sciences, whether it's investments in industrial, whether it's trends towards automation and digitalization, many strategic investments in different subsegments like microelectronics or lithium batteries. And I feel like our team continues to do an excellent job of capturing these opportunities. One of the challenges we start to have in the second half, though, of course, is that we start to lap some pretty significant comparisons to the previous year. And as you said, too, like there is a topic of pent-up demand and when the recovery started in Q3 of last year, that was very much a local recovery. And then as kind of we started to progress through 2021, it became -- China was benefiting much more from the global recovery. And what's always hard to tell is how much are we benefiting from pent up. And there also is an element of stimulus in China. We talked a lot about this last quarter as well. But clearly, the government is investing very heavily in many different sectors, whether it's programs related to the 5-year plan, or whether it's investments in the industrial sector further developing the economic zone going out to the western part of the country. And it's always difficult to tell how much we're benefiting from these trends as well."

We're typically at 1.5 or a little bit more than 1.5 months of backlog. So it's always a little bit more difficult for us to forecast beyond the current quarter that we're in.

Maybe I can answer the second part of your question and just kind of like walk down the different businesses and geographies just to kind of get that out there as well, too. So if we kind of start with the lab business, we're looking at mid-teens growth in Q3. And then we're looking at high teens for the full year.

So on the supply chain, supply chain side is just -- I would say the supplier situation is particularly challenging with respect to electronics. That's probably the most concerning part for us right now, and you hear it also from a different part of industries. In that regard, we are also facing longer lead times. We are starting to battle obsolescence issues. We have short-term notices from our suppliers which then will require also R&D teams to jump in and to redesign some of the products. On top of that, transportation and logistics, as Shawn said, are also challenging for our team. We do see bottlenecks and delays there. However, we are really diligently working on these topics to help offset. In terms of mitigation strategies, again, on material shortages, what we do for electronic components, some of it is redesigning short term our products to make sure that we can deliver. We have been very successful so far. I would say we have been very successful fulfilling our customer demand this quarter. But it's definitely locking in more resources than we initially thought. And we also, of course, as Shawn said, we are facing some price increases on components -- electronic components, for example, which go now through prorate situations, where you just have to pay much higher prices than you used to. And that impacts us a little bit on the gross margin side as well. Moving forward, we are closely monitoring the situation. Again, we have team prepared with mitigation strategies in case situations get more tricky, but it's hard to predict where it might hit you next. Again, we are most exposed currently on some of the electronic parts. Some of it will more impact retail for Q3 as well as retailers leveraging also components that are used in consumer electronics and those are under most pressure right now. So again, there are several areas where we have to tackle these issues. We have the right teams in place. And of course, we are also trying different ways to supply material for Q3, I think it will not be so far, but we see not be a major one, but we are on our toes to make sure that we can react as quickly as possible if the situation gets more intense."

So as I kind of mentioned in the pricing question, we expect the benefits from pricing to slightly increase in the second half. But of course, going the other side of that is these increased material costs that Patrick was just speaking to. The other thing that we see in the back half is that we will not have the same level of benefit that we've had in the first half of the year regarding volume. And so that's probably the other thing that kind of stands out in terms of comparing the first half versus the second half. So if you kind of like put that together, the full year is probably up in the whatever, 20 to 30 basis point kind of a range."

I think Shawn mentioned the fact already that we are not only benefiting from a strong recovery in our end markets, including some pent-up demand here. But we are also capitalizing on the growth with our specific sales and marketing tools around Spinnaker. And we also benefit from our diversity of our product portfolio in our end markets. We see also in China, I would say, particularly in China, some investments, benefits from government investments and our customers, as Shawn said, demand for automation, for connectivity, for digitalization, which plays really well in our product portfolio that we have. So I think this also has clearly lagged. So I think the advantage of our product portfolio is the underlying momentum and the focus on automation and productivity gains will continue -- will help us to continue to drive this momentum.

But as you've had conversations with customers and getting back engaging in person, have you seen that customers are more -- have a greater desire to actually continue that digital engagement, and therefore, on the SG&A side, there might actually be some cost savings that are more durable than you might have thought?

And look, what we're hearing from our customers, they actually love the new ways of -- that we have engaging with them. I mentioned in my remarks upfront, webinars, where we really scaled up significantly. Last year, we did a couple of hundreds of webinars, and we are now digitally going to 2,000 because we see such a strong resonance from our customers on having that information and interaction channel. That on top with a really specialized sales force, which is also fully back in action. It gives us an opportunity to, again, to use our direct sales force to really go also after competitive accounts and new accounts, approaching these with our solutions and their deep knowledge about our product portfolio, but use the broader digital channel also for existing customers and again, broadcasting solutions in a much better way than we could in the past. Our customers, I think, at the moment, if you look at the amount of trade shows that are, for example, available still limited. So they're really looking also to us to say, give us different ways of how you can demonstrate your products in -- if you're not at trade shows, if you cannot attend trade shows so we use digital demos. We have studios and every major site to do virtual product demos, and that has been very well received by our customers. And I trust that it will continue that way. We will have a very complementary setup where our direct sales force will be in terms of consultative selling and product solutions will be on customer sites, but we will use the broader channel and e-commerce channel, also to digitally interface with customers. It will be -- it will drive efficiency gains. Is it cost saving, I would say, it's an efficiency gain for us moving forward. We do not think about this that it's necessarily an opportunity to scale back our sales force. It's again an additional channel and a competitive advantage for us to engage with customers on many different levels, face-to-face interaction as well as digital interaction. By the way, we also scaled up telesales over the last several years, significantly to back up our direct sales force and that has been proven to be very effective as well."

So of course, there's a lot of different moving pieces with our expense growth. I think one of the big piece to not lose sight of is that we had prior year cost savings. And of course, that optically affects this year's number as we kind of bring back the workforce and things like that where we had some workforce savings from last year. We still have an element -- And we also had some discretionary topics last year as well where we had savings. The one area where we have not brought things back 100% would be in the area of travel, and I think that one will play out over time. And then -- but then kind of another factor, of course, is variable compensation. And so if you think about like last year, we had much lower variable compensation. This year, we're going to have much higher variable compensation. And then the third piece I would say is kind of this element of the investments. And the investments are very much a sign of the strength of the organization in terms of our end markets and trying to pursue growth opportunities for the future and really take advantage of the situation. So I'd say these are certainly incremental investments. There are a wide range of different types of investments. We talked about field turbo resources during our last call. That program is going to be a little bit more disproportionately invested towards China versus the rest of the world, but it is a very global program. We're doing other things that are more sales and marketing in nature that we do on an ongoing basis, but we're going to do a little bit more than we normally do during the second half of the year. And then we're investing in other things in terms of -- from a product perspective. But I wouldn't say we're necessarily accelerating things, but we certainly are working on our priority list. And so I think every company has a priority list, and we're able to work down that list at a more accelerated rate, just given the strong results that we see in the business."

We are now looking at -- more intensely at cross-selling opportunities in the -- on the customer side and also starting from one existing sales contact on, let's say, a specific R&D contact to make sure that we understand better the customer side in terms of what other opportunities are for us to penetrate in other parts of the customer organization, maybe QC, maybe -- it may be manufacturing, maybe in production scale-up. And we're using then these leads to send basically other dedicated sales team members with the right background and know-how to these other accounts within a customer account.

Now let me turn to our financial results. The highlights are on Page 3 of the presentation, and you can see we had another very favorable quarter. Local currency sales was 16%, and we had broad-based growth in all regions. Our Laboratory business had excellent growth and our industrial product lines also performed very well. Food retail was a headwind, drove overall sales growth as we had significant decline in the quarter. 
With our strong sales growth and good execution, we achieved a 19% growth in adjusted operating income and a 24% increase in adjusted EPS. Cash flow generation was very strong in the quarter. Our end markets remain favorable, and our strategic initiatives are very effective at capturing growth. Our Spinnaker sales and marketing approach provides the framework to identify and pursue the most attractive market segments while also increasing our sales force exposure to the most strategic customers. 
We also continue to invest in the strength and breadth of our product portfolio, further extending our technology lead and reinforcing customer trust through our global service offering, which supports customers' productivity. We have several -- we have successfully navigated the challenges of the global supply chain to date, but are cautious as demand dynamics remain challenging and conditions can change rapidly. 
Although pockets of uncertainty exists in the global economy, we believe we are ideally positioned to gain market share. With proven strategies, good demand in our end markets and continued focused execution on our growth and margin initiatives, we believe we are in an excellent position to deliver strong results in 2021 and 2022. 
Let me now turn it to Shawn to cover the financial and guidance details, and then I will come back with some additional commentary on the business, and our outlook for next year. Shawn?"

Sales were $952 million in the quarter, an increase of 16% in local currency. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales increased 18% as currency benefited sales growth by 2% in the quarter. The PendoTECH acquisition contributed approximately 1% to local currency sales growth in the quarter, while we estimate that COVID testing was a headwind of approximately 1% to sales growth. Last year, the benefit in our pipette business from COVID testing labs was particularly strong. 
On Slide #4, we show sales growth by region. Local currency sales increased 20% in the Americas, 10% in Europe and 16% in Asia/Rest of the World. Local currency sales increased 19% in China in the quarter. 
The next slide shows sales growth by region year-to-date. Local currency sales grew 20% for the 9 months with a 21% increase in the Americas, 15% in Europe, and 23% growth in Asia/Rest of World. 
On Slide #6, we summarize local currency sales growth by product area. For the third quarter, Laboratory sales increased 23%, Industrial increased 12%, with core Industrial up 11% and product inspection up 13%. Food Retail came in worse than we expected with a decline of 19% in the quarter. 
The next slide shows local currency sales growth by product area year-to-date. Laboratory sales increased 26%, Industrial increased 16%, with core Industrial up 21% and product inspection up 9%. Food Retail declined 1% for the 9-month period. 
Let me now move to the rest of the P&L, which is summarized on Slide #8. Gross margin in the quarter was 58.4%, a 20 basis point increase over the prior year level of 58.2%. We benefited from volume and pricing which was offset in part by the challenges in the global supply chain, namely higher transportation, logistics and material costs as well as the impact of temporary cost actions we undertook in 2020. 
R&D amounted to $42.3 million in the quarter, which is a 19% increase in local currency over the prior period. The impact of temporary cost savings undertaken last year and greater project activity contributed to this increase. 
SG&A amounted to $240.7 million, a 16% increase in local currency over the prior year. The impact of the temporary cost savings that we undertook last year, higher variable compensation, and increased investments in sales and marketing were the principal factors driving the increase. 
Adjusted operating profit amounted to $272.8 million in the quarter, a 19% increase over the prior year amount of $230 million. We are pleased with this increase, which reflects very strong sales growth combined with good execution. Adjusted operating margins reached 28.7%, a 20 basis point increase over the prior year level of 28.5%. On a 2-year combined basis, our margins were up 270 basis points as the prior year margin benefited from the cost actions we implemented due to the pandemic. 
A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization amounted to $16 million in the quarter, interest expense was $11.8 million in the quarter, other income in the quarter amounted to $3.3 million primarily reflecting nonservice-related pension income. Our effective tax rate before discrete items and adjusted for the timing of stock option deductions was 19.5%. 
Fully diluted shares amounted to $23.4 million in the quarter, which is a 3% decline from the prior year. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $8.72, a 24% increase over the prior year amount of $7.02. On a reported basis in the quarter, EPS was $8.71 as compared to $6.68 in the prior year. Reported EPS in the quarter includes $0.18 of purchased intangible amortization, $0.02 of restructuring offset by $0.19 due to the difference between our quarterly and annual tax rate due to the timing of stock option exercises. 
The next slide shows our P&L year-to-date. Local currency sales grew 20%, adjusted operating income increased 35%, with margins up 210 basis points. Adjusted EPS grew 43% on a year-to-date basis. 
That covers the P&L, and let me now comment on cash flow. In the quarter, adjusted free cash flow amounted to $243.1 million, which is an increase of 19% and on a per share basis as compared to the prior year. We are very happy with our cash flow generation. DSO was 35 days, which is 2 days less than the prior year. ITO came in at 4.5x, which is slightly better than last year. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted free cash flow amounted to $615.3 million, an increase of 48% on a per share basis as compared to the prior year. 
Let me now turn to guidance. While our end markets remain favorable, forecasting continues to be challenging. There are pockets of uncertainty in the global economy, most notably in China. Furthermore, the widespread challenges within the supply chain and in transportation and logistics and the corresponding inflationary impact also creates uncertainty. Finally, we have seen over the last several months how COVID variance and lockdowns can occur quickly. We recognize the importance of remaining agile and adapting to unexpected changes in the environment. 
We are very pleased with our ability to navigate the unprecedented challenges of the last 2 years, which we believe reflects the strength of our organization. While we remain cautious about factors outside of our control, we feel very good about our growth initiatives and our ability to continue to gain market share and drive margin improvement via our pricing and Stern Drive initiatives. 
Now let me cover the specifics. For the full year 2021, we now expect local currency sales growth in 2021 and to be approximately 17%. This compares to previous guidance of 15%. We expect full year adjusted EPS to be in the range of $33.35 to $33.40, which is a growth rate of 30%. This compares to previous guidance of adjusted EPS in the range of $32.60 to $32.90. 
With respect to the fourth quarter, we would expect local currency sales growth to be approximately 8% and expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $10 to $10.05, a growth rate of 8% to 9%. For the full year 2022, based on our assessment of market conditions today, we would expect local currency sales growth to be approximately 6% and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $37.25 to $37.65. Using the midpoint of 2021 guidance, this reflects a growth rate of 12% to 13%. 
Some further comments on 2022 guidance. We expect a slight headwind to sales growth from the impact of COVID testing on our pipette business. We expect interest expense to be approximately $50 million in 2022 in total amortization, including purchase intangible amortization to be $65 million. Purchase intangible amortization is excluded from adjusted EPS and is estimated at $24 million on a pretax basis or $0.79 per share in 2022. 
In 2022, other income, which is below operating profit, will amount to approximately $13.5 million. This is higher than the $10.7 million expected in 2021 due to an expected increase in pension income. Finally, we assume our effective tax rate before discrete items will be 19.5% in both 2021 and 2022. In terms of free cash flow for 2021, we now estimate it will reach $810 million, which reflects a 29% growth on a per share basis. 
For 2022, we would estimate free cash flow in the range of $845 million. Cash flow in 2022 is impacted by higher variable compensation payments related to the very strong performance in 2021. Once we get beyond 2022, we expect free cash flow per share will grow in line with earnings per share and net income conversion will be in the 100% range. We expect to repurchase approximately $1 billion in shares in both 2021 and 2022, which should allow us to maintain a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of approximately 1.5x. 
Some final details on guidance. With respect to the impact of currency on sales growth, we expect currency to increase sales growth by approximately 3% in 2021 and be relatively neutral to sales growth in Q4. In 2022, we would expect currency to decrease sales growth by approximately 1%. In terms of adjusted EPS, currency will benefit growth by approximately 4% in 2021 and be a slight headwind to adjusted EPS growth in 2022. We do not expect currency to impact adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter. 
That is it from my side, and I'll now turn it back to Patrick."
31468,1684286587,2426271,"Mettler-Toledo International Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Mettler-Toledo International Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Sean.

Our Lab business had outstanding growth in the third quarter despite having more challenging comparisons than it faced in the first half of the year.

Our Lab business had outstanding growth in the third quarter despite having more challenging comparisons than it faced in the first half of the year. Almost all product lines and regions had very strong growth. We expect good growth in the fourth quarter, but it won't be the same level we have seen year-to-date. As we look at 2022, we expect the strong biopharma trends to continue to be favorable and expect other end markets to do well, but we won't benefit from catch-up demand segments like chemical that we benefited from this year. 
We also expect a bit of headwind in our pipette business from lower COVID testing activity. Overall, we believe we are well positioned to continue to capture growth and gain market share in our Laboratory business. An additional nice development within our Lab business is that we obtained a $36 million grant from the U.S. Department of Defense to expand our pipette tip production in California. We estimate that by the end of 2023, we will expand our global tip production by approximately 15% and the grant will also allow us to enhance manufacturing, automation and warehouse and logistics surrounding tips. We are happy with this grant, which allows us to cost effectively increase tip capacity while at the same time, improving productivity. 
Turning to our Industrial business. Core Industrial did well in the third quarter as we are benefiting from some catch-up in demand and have been well positioned to benefit from increasing trends in automation and digitalization. Core Industrial should have a solid fourth quarter. We will face tougher comparisons in core Industrial in 2022, but expect to continue to drive market share gains overall. 
Product Inspection grew 13% in the quarter. Growth was especially strong in the Americas. We expect good growth in the fourth quarter and we are cautiously optimistic about solid growth in 2022 as we should benefit from some pent-up investments from large packaged food customers and our strong product portfolio. 
Finally, Food Retail declined 19% with pronounced declines in Americas and Asia and Rest of the World. Our production was impacted by shortages of electronic components as these products use more standardized components that are also used in consumer electronic products. We were also impacted by the timing of project activity. We would expect Food Retail to also decline in the fourth quarter. We are not forecasting much growth in 2022 as we continue to manage this business for profitability. 
Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales in Europe increased 10% in the quarter with very strong growth in Lab. We would expect solid growth in Europe in 2022 against very good growth in 2021. Americas increased 20% in the quarter with excellent growth in Lab, core Industrial and Product Inspection. As mentioned earlier, Food Retail was down significantly in the Americas. While we will face challenging comparisons in the Americas in 2022, we expect overall good growth. 
Finally, Asia and the Rest of the World grew 16% in the quarter with outstanding growth in Laboratory and good growth in Product Inspection. Core Industrial also did well. China had good growth, particularly given the strong growth in the prior year. We expect good growth in China in Q4 and in 2022, although it won't be at the same level we have seen year-to-date. We continue to feel good about China over the medium term, but acknowledge that there can be volatility in the shorter term. We are very strongly positioned in China, and the team is executing well. 
One final comment on the business. Service and Consumables performed well and were up 12% in the quarter. We continue to be very pleased with the growth of -- in this important and profitable part of the business. That concludes my comments on the business. And now let me provide some context on our 2022 guidance. 
We believe we are emerging from this pandemic as a stronger company and are further distancing ourselves from competition in several ways. During the last 2 years, we have accelerated our digital transformation in sales and marketing. We had already started on this path, but the disruption from COVID-19 allowed us to significantly accelerate our digital approach. Our use of eDemos, our vast and expanded digital library of selling materials, further development of selling guides and greater utilization of telesales and telemarketing resources are clear differentiators for remote selling. 
And while we expect our face-to-face customer interactions to continue to increase in 2022, these digital tools allow us to expand our customer reach in a cost-effective manner. In addition to the digital gains in sales and marketing, we have also made great strides in sharpening our focus on the most attractive market segments, allowing us to accelerate market share gains. Increasing sophistication in data analytics is fundamental to our ability to guide our sales force to the best growth opportunities. We continue to provide what we refer to internally as Top K alerts. These alerts provide tailored actionable information about potential sales opportunities, which our market organizations qualify and integrate into the territory planning and target setting. We see the trend for greater use and sophistication of data analytics continuing in 2022 and beyond. 
Our global service network and our ability to continue to service our customers during this period has led to steady increases in customer satisfaction. Service keeps us close to customers, builds trust and the customer is much more likely to purchase additional products if they utilize our service offering. We continue to develop service tailored specific to customer needs. For example, we quickly developed a service tool for customers who utilize analytical balances and quality control to meet new requirements from the European pharmacopeia that goes into effect in January. 
In addition, as software is becoming an integral part of our solutions, harmonized services for software are becoming increasingly important. A new service offering supports our instrument control software LabX to enable customers to achieve consistent performance and meet regulatory compliance. These are just 2 examples. We have many more within our portfolio. We believe service will continue to provide a good opportunity for growth and differentiation from our competitors, and we use the same data analytics approach to leverage service opportunities within our installed base. 
New product development also continues to be core to our growth potential. I am excited about the many launches that will take place over the coming year. Our product pipeline continues to be very strong and product launches reinforce our technology leadership. While most product and software development will continue to be done in-house, we will also complement this with small acquisitions like the one we completed in October. 
We acquired a software company Scale Up Systems, which is the leading provider of scale-up and reaction modeling software for pharma and chemical customers. It is a great addition to our AutoChem offering. And we now have a comprehensive offering for process development and scale-up for the pharma and chemical industries. 
Turning now to supply chain and margin initiatives. As already mentioned, our supply chain team has shown tremendous agility in adapting to very dynamic market conditions and continuing to support customers. There are risks and increasing inflationary pressures in the supply chain and transportation and logistics markets. We have mitigation strategies in place to help offset and believe we can continue to manage effectively, but are cautious as conditions can change quickly. 
Our pricing program and Stern Drive productivity initiatives have good traction and will help us to offset inflationary pressures that we will likely continue to face in the coming months. I trust this provides some context to our guidance and shows the confidence we have in our ability to continue to capture growth, gain market share, and deliver solid earnings growth in 2021 and in 2022 and beyond. 
I would now like to ask the operator to open the line for questions."

So we're really thrilled with how well both businesses are performing. And as a reminder, our Industrial business grew particularly strong in Q3 of last year. In particular, our core Industrial business was up by 24% in Q3 of last year. 
So when you kind of look at these numbers on a 2-year basis, we feel really good. Overall, we feel very good about the competitive environment.

So we think we have the right portfolio to really continue to see growth in the lab side as well. 
And on Industrial, the demand in China is actually not similar from what we see in the rest of the world. There is a lot of demand for automation and productivity solutions. And with our industry solutions, especially new products that we also launched like the Industry 360 [indiscernible], et cetera, we are extremely well positioned to help our customers to drive productivity and automation. And we see -- what I'm hearing from China is that demand will not continue to slow down. They continue to upgrade their installed systems, and they're looking for ways to become more productive."

But now I think we are very well positioned to serve the market with that site. 
In terms of the demand for Q4, actually, we see still very good momentum for PI. And also, as I said, looking forward in 2022, we are cautiously optimistic there is additional pent-up demand in the market that we can continue to serve. We have an extremely strong product portfolio. We just recently launched a couple of new additions to the portfolio, which underlines our technology leadership in the market and we continue to also do that in China as well.

There's certainly -- it's a competitive labor market in all parts of the world. As we kind of look at our cost structure for next year, our overall cost structure will go up about 4% or so. And of course, wages are a significant component of our overall cost structure. But if you look at it by geography, of course, it's going to be highly differentiated based upon local labor markets."

And you mentioned both the digital approaches as well as the field turbos. We see a lot of demand out there and as well actually invested quite a bit this year in Field Turbo. So we made significant investments there, putting more feet on the street because we saw the demand and actually it's paying back very quickly for us. It's great returns. And on the digital side, we continue to move our digital engine overall, whether it's the marketing engine, whether it's direct sales engine, et cetera. We are very effective on that. It has been -- it has also provided for us great returns. And we will always have both -- we always see both approach we have in direct consultative sales force, which is interactive with customers for our very dedicated higher-end product, et cetera, that also need more consultative selling. 
And then we have -- we continue to build out our digital capabilities to serve more transactional sales and continue to strengthen our digital marketing capabilities. I think this year, we did a significant number, more webinars and other things to interact with customers, which has been extremely well received. It's a great tool for us to increase leads despite all the SCA things that we do. So we are -- again, I think we are very well positioned. We made great strides forward during the pandemic.

We will have a much better reach into regions where Scale-up Systems couldn't go with their sales force. I think it's a very well-received solution by the customers, and we have received also very positive feedback by the existing customers of Scale-up Systems on the acquisition of all. They see that 1 plus 1 actually equals more than 2 in this regard.

We are, of course, continuing to broaden that portfolio moving forward, both on the consumable side for our products, but we're also increasingly providing higher-value services for our products, and I mentioned the one example, for the European pharmacopeia solution out there that we just launched. 
That is -- I think we have a lot of opportunities for our installed base of products that we have out there to increase service contracts overall and provide more differentiated services to our customers. We serve a lot of our products, but there's, of course, also competition in some areas like the scale areas. We -- I think we are positioning ourselves also in the future by providing higher sophisticated services, preventive maintenance and other things, a very comprehensive inventory management as well solutions as well.

It's about back office automation ideas, it's manufacturing setup ideas. It's -- in some areas, it's product redesign. And we -- it's a program that has been running for many years, and the team is actually going through several waves of Stern Drive, we call them internal new ways. We just launched the next way this year. The team has come up with whole a long list of good ideas that we just recently our head of auto fulfillment top line chain showed us the potential of all these activities. 
We had some concerns this year that our Stern Drive activities could be impacted actually by all the other activities given that were necessary given the restrictions we have seen in the market, logistics challenges, et cetera. But I'm happy to say the team didn't skip a beat there, and they actually delivered on the promised savings that they have poised us for 2021 as well, which helps us to also counter some of the inflationary pressures. 
Now do we make a significant shift in terms of the activities, given the lot challenges right now? I would say no because, again, they are very focused on productivity gains, on sometimes product redesigns, driving productivity and efficiency, we have -- on the supply chain side, we have a dedicated team in place who tackled all the other logistical challenges on the supply chain side, like shipments and shipment alternatives, et cetera, access to different suppliers when it comes to components. We have dedicated resources who constantly screen the market for best opportunities for supply. 
I think this is also why we probably came through this crisis so far very well, not having a lot of issues with component shortages except for retail that we mentioned, but in other areas where we also use semiconductors. I think the team has been very effective in finding alternatives and also working closely with the internal engineering teams in case we would have to redesign products and use alternative products. I think it's working very well. I mean, it was a long-winded answer, but overall we are extremely pleased with Stern Drive. I think it's still a lot of runway. We're driving this with a constant improvement process mindset. And again, we have dedicated teams in all of our major sites who capture these opportunities."

Customer demand was robust and our growth initiatives continue to be very effective. Our teams throughout the world are executing very well. 
I want to give a special acknowledgment to our global supply chain team, which is navigating a myriad of challenges with respect to raw materials, components and transportation. Our ability to continue to meet heightened customer demand while overcoming the dynamic challenges in the supply chain is proving to be a competitive advantage in this environment. 
Now let me turn to our financial results. The highlights are on Page 3 of the presentation, and you can see we had another very favorable quarter. Local currency sales was 16%, and we had broad-based growth in all regions. Our Laboratory business had excellent growth and our industrial product lines also performed very well. Food retail was a headwind, drove overall sales growth as we had significant decline in the quarter. 
With our strong sales growth and good execution, we achieved a 19% growth in adjusted operating income and a 24% increase in adjusted EPS. Cash flow generation was very strong in the quarter. Our end markets remain favorable, and our strategic initiatives are very effective at capturing growth. Our Spinnaker sales and marketing approach provides the framework to identify and pursue the most attractive market segments while also increasing our sales force exposure to the most strategic customers. 
We also continue to invest in the strength and breadth of our product portfolio, further extending our technology lead and reinforcing customer trust through our global service offering, which supports customers' productivity. We have several -- we have successfully navigated the challenges of the global supply chain to date, but are cautious as demand dynamics remain challenging and conditions can change rapidly. 
Although pockets of uncertainty exists in the global economy, we believe we are ideally positioned to gain market share. With proven strategies, good demand in our end markets and continued focused execution on our growth and margin initiatives, we believe we are in an excellent position to deliver strong results in 2021 and 2022. 
Let me now turn it to Shawn to cover the financial and guidance details, and then I will come back with some additional commentary on the business, and our outlook for next year. Shawn?"

Sales were $952 million in the quarter, an increase of 16% in local currency. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales increased 18% as currency benefited sales growth by 2% in the quarter. The PendoTECH acquisition contributed approximately 1% to local currency sales growth in the quarter, while we estimate that COVID testing was a headwind of approximately 1% to sales growth. Last year, the benefit in our pipette business from COVID testing labs was particularly strong. 
On Slide #4, we show sales growth by region. Local currency sales increased 20% in the Americas, 10% in Europe and 16% in Asia/Rest of the World. Local currency sales increased 19% in China in the quarter. 
The next slide shows sales growth by region year-to-date. Local currency sales grew 20% for the 9 months with a 21% increase in the Americas, 15% in Europe, and 23% growth in Asia/Rest of World. 
On Slide #6, we summarize local currency sales growth by product area. For the third quarter, Laboratory sales increased 23%, Industrial increased 12%, with core Industrial up 11% and product inspection up 13%. Food Retail came in worse than we expected with a decline of 19% in the quarter. 
The next slide shows local currency sales growth by product area year-to-date. Laboratory sales increased 26%, Industrial increased 16%, with core Industrial up 21% and product inspection up 9%. Food Retail declined 1% for the 9-month period. 
Let me now move to the rest of the P&L, which is summarized on Slide #8. Gross margin in the quarter was 58.4%, a 20 basis point increase over the prior year level of 58.2%. We benefited from volume and pricing which was offset in part by the challenges in the global supply chain, namely higher transportation, logistics and material costs as well as the impact of temporary cost actions we undertook in 2020. 
R&D amounted to $42.3 million in the quarter, which is a 19% increase in local currency over the prior period. The impact of temporary cost savings undertaken last year and greater project activity contributed to this increase. 
SG&A amounted to $240.7 million, a 16% increase in local currency over the prior year. The impact of the temporary cost savings that we undertook last year, higher variable compensation, and increased investments in sales and marketing were the principal factors driving the increase. 
Adjusted operating profit amounted to $272.8 million in the quarter, a 19% increase over the prior year amount of $230 million. We are pleased with this increase, which reflects very strong sales growth combined with good execution. Adjusted operating margins reached 28.7%, a 20 basis point increase over the prior year level of 28.5%. On a 2-year combined basis, our margins were up 270 basis points as the prior year margin benefited from the cost actions we implemented due to the pandemic. 
A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization amounted to $16 million in the quarter, interest expense was $11.8 million in the quarter, other income in the quarter amounted to $3.3 million primarily reflecting nonservice-related pension income. Our effective tax rate before discrete items and adjusted for the timing of stock option deductions was 19.5%. 
Fully diluted shares amounted to $23.4 million in the quarter, which is a 3% decline from the prior year. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $8.72, a 24% increase over the prior year amount of $7.02. On a reported basis in the quarter, EPS was $8.71 as compared to $6.68 in the prior year. Reported EPS in the quarter includes $0.18 of purchased intangible amortization, $0.02 of restructuring offset by $0.19 due to the difference between our quarterly and annual tax rate due to the timing of stock option exercises. 
The next slide shows our P&L year-to-date. Local currency sales grew 20%, adjusted operating income increased 35%, with margins up 210 basis points. Adjusted EPS grew 43% on a year-to-date basis. 
That covers the P&L, and let me now comment on cash flow. In the quarter, adjusted free cash flow amounted to $243.1 million, which is an increase of 19% and on a per share basis as compared to the prior year. We are very happy with our cash flow generation. DSO was 35 days, which is 2 days less than the prior year. ITO came in at 4.5x, which is slightly better than last year. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted free cash flow amounted to $615.3 million, an increase of 48% on a per share basis as compared to the prior year. 
Let me now turn to guidance. While our end markets remain favorable, forecasting continues to be challenging. There are pockets of uncertainty in the global economy, most notably in China. Furthermore, the widespread challenges within the supply chain and in transportation and logistics and the corresponding inflationary impact also creates uncertainty. Finally, we have seen over the last several months how COVID variance and lockdowns can occur quickly. We recognize the importance of remaining agile and adapting to unexpected changes in the environment. 
We are very pleased with our ability to navigate the unprecedented challenges of the last 2 years, which we believe reflects the strength of our organization. While we remain cautious about factors outside of our control, we feel very good about our growth initiatives and our ability to continue to gain market share and drive margin improvement via our pricing and Stern Drive initiatives. 
Now let me cover the specifics. For the full year 2021, we now expect local currency sales growth in 2021 and to be approximately 17%. This compares to previous guidance of 15%. We expect full year adjusted EPS to be in the range of $33.35 to $33.40, which is a growth rate of 30%. This compares to previous guidance of adjusted EPS in the range of $32.60 to $32.90. 
With respect to the fourth quarter, we would expect local currency sales growth to be approximately 8% and expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $10 to $10.05, a growth rate of 8% to 9%. For the full year 2022, based on our assessment of market conditions today, we would expect local currency sales growth to be approximately 6% and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $37.25 to $37.65. Using the midpoint of 2021 guidance, this reflects a growth rate of 12% to 13%. 
Some further comments on 2022 guidance. We expect a slight headwind to sales growth from the impact of COVID testing on our pipette business. We expect interest expense to be approximately $50 million in 2022 in total amortization, including purchase intangible amortization to be $65 million. Purchase intangible amortization is excluded from adjusted EPS and is estimated at $24 million on a pretax basis or $0.79 per share in 2022. 
In 2022, other income, which is below operating profit, will amount to approximately $13.5 million. This is higher than the $10.7 million expected in 2021 due to an expected increase in pension income. Finally, we assume our effective tax rate before discrete items will be 19.5% in both 2021 and 2022. In terms of free cash flow for 2021, we now estimate it will reach $810 million, which reflects a 29% growth on a per share basis. 
For 2022, we would estimate free cash flow in the range of $845 million. Cash flow in 2022 is impacted by higher variable compensation payments related to the very strong performance in 2021. Once we get beyond 2022, we expect free cash flow per share will grow in line with earnings per share and net income conversion will be in the 100% range. We expect to repurchase approximately $1 billion in shares in both 2021 and 2022, which should allow us to maintain a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of approximately 1.5x. 
Some final details on guidance. With respect to the impact of currency on sales growth, we expect currency to increase sales growth by approximately 3% in 2021 and be relatively neutral to sales growth in Q4. In 2022, we would expect currency to decrease sales growth by approximately 1%. In terms of adjusted EPS, currency will benefit growth by approximately 4% in 2021 and be a slight headwind to adjusted EPS growth in 2022. We do not expect currency to impact adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter. 
That is it from my side, and I'll now turn it back to Patrick."
31468,1684286587,2426465,"Mettler-Toledo International Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Mettler-Toledo International Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Sean.

Our Lab business had outstanding growth in the third quarter despite having more challenging comparisons than it faced in the first half of the year.

Our Lab business had outstanding growth in the third quarter despite having more challenging comparisons than it faced in the first half of the year. Almost all product lines and regions had very strong growth. We expect good growth in the fourth quarter, but it won't be the same level we have seen year-to-date. As we look at 2022, we expect the strong biopharma trends to continue to be favorable and expect other end markets to do well, but we won't benefit from catch-up demand segments like chemical that we benefited from this year. 
We also expect a bit of headwind in our pipette business from lower COVID testing activity. Overall, we believe we are well positioned to continue to capture growth and gain market share in our Laboratory business. An additional nice development within our Lab business is that we obtained a $36 million grant from the U.S. Department of Defense to expand our pipette tip production in California. We estimate that by the end of 2023, we will expand our global tip production by approximately 15% and the grant will also allow us to enhance manufacturing, automation and warehouse and logistics surrounding tips. We are happy with this grant, which allows us to cost effectively increase tip capacity while at the same time, improving productivity. 
Turning to our Industrial business. Core Industrial did well in the third quarter as we are benefiting from some catch-up in demand and have been well positioned to benefit from increasing trends in automation and digitalization. Core Industrial should have a solid fourth quarter. We will face tougher comparisons in core Industrial in 2022, but expect to continue to drive market share gains overall. 
Product Inspection grew 13% in the quarter. Growth was especially strong in the Americas. We expect good growth in the fourth quarter and we are cautiously optimistic about solid growth in 2022 as we should benefit from some pent-up investments from large packaged food customers and our strong product portfolio. 
Finally, Food Retail declined 19% with pronounced declines in Americas and Asia and Rest of the World. Our production was impacted by shortages of electronic components as these products use more standardized components that are also used in consumer electronic products. We were also impacted by the timing of project activity. We would expect Food Retail to also decline in the fourth quarter. We are not forecasting much growth in 2022 as we continue to manage this business for profitability. 
Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales in Europe increased 10% in the quarter with very strong growth in Lab. We would expect solid growth in Europe in 2022 against very good growth in 2021. Americas increased 20% in the quarter with excellent growth in Lab, core Industrial and Product Inspection. As mentioned earlier, Food Retail was down significantly in the Americas. While we will face challenging comparisons in the Americas in 2022, we expect overall good growth. 
Finally, Asia and the Rest of the World grew 16% in the quarter with outstanding growth in Laboratory and good growth in Product Inspection. Core Industrial also did well. China had good growth, particularly given the strong growth in the prior year. We expect good growth in China in Q4 and in 2022, although it won't be at the same level we have seen year-to-date. We continue to feel good about China over the medium term, but acknowledge that there can be volatility in the shorter term. We are very strongly positioned in China, and the team is executing well. 
One final comment on the business. Service and Consumables performed well and were up 12% in the quarter. We continue to be very pleased with the growth of -- in this important and profitable part of the business. That concludes my comments on the business. And now let me provide some context on our 2022 guidance. 
We believe we are emerging from this pandemic as a stronger company and are further distancing ourselves from competition in several ways. During the last 2 years, we have accelerated our digital transformation in sales and marketing. We had already started on this path, but the disruption from COVID-19 allowed us to significantly accelerate our digital approach. Our use of eDemos, our vast and expanded digital library of selling materials, further development of selling guides and greater utilization of telesales and telemarketing resources are clear differentiators for remote selling. 
And while we expect our face-to-face customer interactions to continue to increase in 2022, these digital tools allow us to expand our customer reach in a cost-effective manner. In addition to the digital gains in sales and marketing, we have also made great strides in sharpening our focus on the most attractive market segments, allowing us to accelerate market share gains. Increasing sophistication in data analytics is fundamental to our ability to guide our sales force to the best growth opportunities. We continue to provide what we refer to internally as Top K alerts. These alerts provide tailored actionable information about potential sales opportunities, which our market organizations qualify and integrate into the territory planning and target setting. We see the trend for greater use and sophistication of data analytics continuing in 2022 and beyond. 
Our global service network and our ability to continue to service our customers during this period has led to steady increases in customer satisfaction. Service keeps us close to customers, builds trust and the customer is much more likely to purchase additional products if they utilize our service offering. We continue to develop service tailored specific to customer needs. For example, we quickly developed a service tool for customers who utilize analytical balances and quality control to meet new requirements from the European pharmacopeia that goes into effect in January. 
In addition, as software is becoming an integral part of our solutions, harmonized services for software are becoming increasingly important. A new service offering supports our instrument control software LabX to enable customers to achieve consistent performance and meet regulatory compliance. These are just 2 examples. We have many more within our portfolio. We believe service will continue to provide a good opportunity for growth and differentiation from our competitors, and we use the same data analytics approach to leverage service opportunities within our installed base. 
New product development also continues to be core to our growth potential. I am excited about the many launches that will take place over the coming year. Our product pipeline continues to be very strong and product launches reinforce our technology leadership. While most product and software development will continue to be done in-house, we will also complement this with small acquisitions like the one we completed in October. 
We acquired a software company Scale Up Systems, which is the leading provider of scale-up and reaction modeling software for pharma and chemical customers. It is a great addition to our AutoChem offering. And we now have a comprehensive offering for process development and scale-up for the pharma and chemical industries. 
Turning now to supply chain and margin initiatives. As already mentioned, our supply chain team has shown tremendous agility in adapting to very dynamic market conditions and continuing to support customers. There are risks and increasing inflationary pressures in the supply chain and transportation and logistics markets. We have mitigation strategies in place to help offset and believe we can continue to manage effectively, but are cautious as conditions can change quickly. 
Our pricing program and Stern Drive productivity initiatives have good traction and will help us to offset inflationary pressures that we will likely continue to face in the coming months. I trust this provides some context to our guidance and shows the confidence we have in our ability to continue to capture growth, gain market share, and deliver solid earnings growth in 2021 and in 2022 and beyond. 
I would now like to ask the operator to open the line for questions."

So in terms of the third quarter, China was up overall -- just hold on a second, I'm getting my notes here, 19%. We had growth, particularly strong on the laboratory side of the business in the high 30s, but we also had double-digit growth on our Industrial business. So we're really thrilled with how well both businesses are performing. And as a reminder, our Industrial business grew particularly strong in Q3 of last year. In particular, our core Industrial business was up by 24% in Q3 of last year. 
So when you kind of look at these numbers on a 2-year basis, we feel really good. Overall, we feel very good about the competitive environment. I feel like our supply chain, in general, has been a competitive advantage in China as well as globally, as Patrick mentioned in the prepared comments. And then when you look at our competitive -- the competitive landscape in China, I feel like we continue to take market share there and we're positioned well.

I think our team is exceptionally well positioned to serve that market with our products that we have, high end as well as local products that we manufacture in China. So we think we have the right portfolio to really continue to see growth in the Lab side as well. 
And on Industrial, the demand in China is actually not similar from what we see in the rest of the world. There is a lot of demand for automation and productivity solutions. And with our industry solutions, especially new products that we also launched like the Industry 360 Troemner, et cetera, we are extremely well positioned to help our customers to drive productivity and automation. And we see -- what I'm hearing from China is that demand will not continue to slow down. They continue to upgrade their installed systems, and they're looking for ways to become more productive."

When we consolidated a couple of sites a couple of years ago in Tampa, of course, there was some initial effort to pull everything together. But now I think we are very well positioned to serve the market with that site. 
In terms of the demand for Q4, actually, we see still very good momentum for PI. And also, as I said, looking forward in 2022, we are cautiously optimistic there is additional to pent-up demand in the market that we can continue to serve. We have an extremely strong product portfolio. We just recently launched a couple of new additions to the portfolio, which underlines our technology leadership in the market and we continue to also do that in China as well.

We expect kind of going forward to be down similarly in the fourth quarter. But then for 2022, we don't expect much growth in the business, probably up low single digit. And as I always say, if you look at that business over a longer-term period of time, it's probably a low single-digit business, but it will be lumpy every now and then from quarter to quarter."

And on the digital side, we continue to move our digital engine overall, whether it's the marketing engine, whether it's direct sales engine, et cetera. We are very effective on that.

I think this year, we did a significant number, more webinars and other things to interact with customers, which has been extremely well received. It's a great tool for us to increase leads despite all the SCA things that we do. So we are -- again, I think we are very well positioned. We made great strides forward during the pandemic.

That is -- I think we have a lot of opportunities for our installed base of products that we have out there to increase service contracts overall and provide more differentiated services to our customers. We serve a lot of our products, but there's, of course, also competition in some areas like the scale areas.

It's about back office automation ideas, it's manufacturing setup ideas. It's -- in some areas, it's product redesign. And we -- it's a program that has been running for many years, and the team is actually going through several waves of Stern Drive, we call them internal new ways. We just launched the next way this year. The team has come up with whole a long list of good ideas that we just recently our head of auto fulfillment top line chain showed us the potential of all these activities. 
We had some concerns this year that our Stern Drive activities could be impacted actually by all the other activities given that were necessary given the restrictions we have seen in the market, logistics challenges, et cetera. But I'm happy to say the team didn't skip a beat there, and they actually delivered on the promised savings that they have promised us for 2021 as well, which helps us to also counter some of the inflationary pressures. 
Now do we make a significant shift in terms of the activities, given the logistics challenges right now? I would say no because, again, they are very focused on productivity gains, on sometimes product redesigns, driving productivity and efficiency, we have -- on the supply chain side, we have a dedicated team in place who tackled all the other logistical challenges on the supply chain side, like shipments and shipment alternatives, et cetera, access to different suppliers when it comes to components. We have dedicated resources who constantly screen the market for best opportunities for supply. 
I think this is also why we probably came through this crisis so far very well, not having a lot of issues with component shortages except for retail that we mentioned, but in other areas where we also use semiconductors. I think the team has been very effective in finding alternatives and also working closely with the internal engineering teams in case we would have to redesign products and use alternative products. I think it's working very well. I mean it was a long-winded answer, but overall we are extremely pleased with Stern Drive. I think it's still a lot of runway.
