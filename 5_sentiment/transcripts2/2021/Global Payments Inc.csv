We delivered fourth quarter and full year results that exceeded our expectations because of our focus on technology enablement, coupled with ongoing excellence and execution. Our fourth quarter results demonstrated continued sequential improvement despite the impact of a more challenging macroeconomic environment in a number of our markets for much of the period. None of this would have been possible without the dedication of our exceptional team members during this difficult time. And we thank them for their commitment to our customers, to each other and to our communities. 
We are very pleased to have delivered substantial margin improvement for the fourth quarter, while also setting aside funds to pay partial cash bonuses to our non-executive team members. Because of the actions we took early in the pandemic and our consistency and execution, we were able to deliver double-digit earnings per share growth in the fourth quarter, positioning us well heading into 2021. We believe that we exited 2020 in a better position than we entered. 
We also accomplished a great deal over the last 12 months. Specifically, we signed Truist Financial Corporation, the sixth largest commercial bank in the United States, a competitive win twice over. Entered a new collaboration with AWS, our preferred provider of Issuer cloud services, to launch a unique go-to-market distribution strategy, coupled with transformative cloud-native technologies. Expanded and extended our partnership with Taishan, on increasing ownership of our joint venture and executing a new referral agreement through 2040. Renewed agreements with a number of the most complex and sophisticated financial institutions globally, including TD Bank in North America, HSBC in Europe and CIBC in Canada. Assisted in the rapid distribution of more than $2.5 billion in stimulus funds for our Netspend customers days faster than other financial technology participants. And announced today a new partnership with Google to deliver innovative and seamless digital services to all manner of merchants worldwide. Our collaboration with Google substantially advances our Merchant business by driving incremental revenue and lowering operating costs to a worldwide go-to-market distribution relationship and co-innovation agreement focused on transformative cloud-native technologies. Together, we will bring new best-in-class digital products to market on a global basis more quickly and we will further catalyze our culture of market leading innovation. 
Cameron will provide more detail on Google in a minute. But it's worth noting that in the last 6 months, we have struck significant and unique distribution relationships with 2 of the world's largest and most respected technology companies, with a combined market capitalization of nearly $3 trillion. This is a first for the payments technology industry. And we did this in the midst of a once in a century pandemic, while delivering adjusted earnings per share growth and gaining market share. These collaborations also are consistent with our long-held distinctive strategies to drive digital penetration. Our business is the combination of 2 halves: distinctive distribution and cutting-edge technologies. AWS and Google enhanced both parts of the equation. Together, we will leapfrog legacy analog means of distribution and redefine how payment solutions and services are sold and consumed in the digital age for our Issuing and Merchant businesses. We already have reached the threshold of 60% of our business coming from technology enablement, a goal we set in March 2018 for year-end 2020 and achieved early last July. And roughly 25% of our business is now related to our e-commerce and omnichannel initiatives. But together with AWS and Google, we expect to do more by driving further technology enablement and omnichannel penetration as legs at the stool for future growth. I cannot think of 2 better partners to catalyze further migration of our Issuing and Merchant businesses to cloud native technologies and expand our competitive moat. These partnerships provide proof points at the momentum we have entering 2021 and will accelerate the transformation of our businesses for years to come. 
Just a reminder of the composition of the businesses driving our growth. Starting with our Merchant business, which is 2/3 of our company. Our technology-enabled portfolio consists of 3 roughly equally sized channels. Our omnichannel, hardware and software and owned software vertical markets businesses collectively represent nearly 60% of Merchant adjusted net revenue. Our relationship-led businesses make up the remaining portion and continue to differentiate themselves in the markets we serve based on the strength of our technologies. Our omnichannel businesses delivered accelerated sequential growth in the fourth quarter of 2020, again, excluding travel and entertainment. As we said at the beginning of the pandemic, we continue to see and expect ongoing sustained share shifts toward omnichannel acceptance brought forward 3 to 5 years by COVID-19. We launched our Unified Commerce or UCP Cloud POS solution this quarter, which connects any commerce software to our wireless payment terminals through our API to help merchants more easily unify their in-person and online payment experiences. Our Citi partnership also continues to expand worldwide. And we expect new Citi customers on UCP to include one of the leading global food companies, one of the preeminent global beverage brands, and one of the largest multinational auto manufacturing companies across multiple continents. And of course, with today's announcement, we also expect Google to become a UCP partner. Additionally, we signed an agreement with Texas Instruments across Taiwan, the Philippines and India. And we expect to expand our relationship to additional geographies later this year. We also reached an agreement with Wolverine to consolidate their U.K. and European acquiring across 32 countries. And we have now successfully launched with both Uber Ride and Uber Eats in our Asia Pacific region. 
Moving to Global Payments integrated, which drives another nearly 20% of our Merchant adjusted net revenue. We generated growth for the fourth quarter and for the full year because of the unrivaled breadth of our partnership portfolio in the most attractive vertical markets. The strength of our combined integrated offerings allowed us to exceed our budgeted new sales forecast for calendar 2020, with new partner production increasing 171% versus 2019. Our own software businesses represent the remaining roughly 20% of our merchant adjusted net revenue. And our leading SaaS solutions in health care, higher education and quick service restaurants or QSRs have been more resilient in the current environment. To that end, our AdvancedMD business delivered a record performance in 2020, achieving double-digit revenue and bookings growth. And our higher education business produced one of its highest years to date. Lastly, our Enterprise QSR business continued its success with Xenios Cloud POS and Omni Solutions, enabling over 100 million transactions and $1.5 million in sales for the year. In addition to serving 26 of the top 50 QSR brands, we are also pleased to announce the signing of for cloud-based SaaS solutions, extending our addressable market to the fast casual category. 
Today, we lead with technology and innovative solutions across all of our merchant businesses. This includes our relationship-led channels, where we continue to see stronger sales performance fueled by our suite of differentiated products and solutions. For example, our U.S. business is seeing significant uptake of its SaaS point-of-sale solutions, with adjusted net revenue and new sales both exceeding 20% growth in 2020. one recent novel win is with the Milwaukee Bucks, where we'll be deploying our cloud-based POS solution across merchandise stores and outlets in the arena. 
Issuer is the next largest segment of our business. In August 2020, we announced a transformational go-to-market collaboration with AWS to provide an industry-leading cloud-based Issuer processing platform for customers regardless of size, location or processing preference. We currently have one LOI and 3 other mid- to late-stage opportunities together with AWS that we are actively working. And we now believe that the win in Asia in a similar large market from a legacy competitor and we have already secured with AWS will likely expand in several markets across Asia over time. 
We continue to capitalize on the broad and deep pipeline we have the good fortune to have in our Issuer business. We currently have 11 letters of intent with financial institutions worldwide, 6 of which are competitive takeaways. In the last 18 months, we have had 36 competitive wins across North America and international markets. And our customers continue to win in the marketplace, a key element of our Issuer strategy to align with market leaders. During the first quarter of 2021, we will complete the first phase of the conversion of over 4 million accounts from a competitor for one of our largest customers. In Germany, we have successfully expanded our long-standing and successful partnership with Deutsche Bank, our largest client in the DACH region. We are pleased to announce that TSYS has been selected in a competitive process as Deutsche Bank's partner of choice for their scheme branded card portfolios across all brands, including Deutsche Bank and Postbank. We are also proud to have signed a new multiyear agreement with Marlette Funding, owner and operator of the [ best ag ] lending platform, for the processing of a new consumer credit card product, which will launch in the second quarter of this year. We are pleased to have secured long-term extensions in multiple geographies with President's Choice, a subsidiary of L and Canadian Tire financial services, both large retailers in Canada, Scotia Bank in Central America, Bank of Ireland and Banco Invex in Mexico. 
Finally, our business and consumer segment delivered another quarter of solid growth, as we continued to pivot our strategic focus to digitization, international expansion and business-to-business opportunities. That shift is underway without any compromise in execution, as we also achieved adjusted net revenue in excess of $200 million for the first time in the fourth quarter. The move toward cash flow solutions is benefiting the portfolio, with customers remaining active longer and utilizing our products more online. 
I am proud that Netspend has once again facilitated the rapid distribution of stimulus funds to customers and play an important role during this most challenging period. Since late December, we have processed more than 1 million deposits accounting for just over $1 billion in stimulus payments to American consumers dispersed by the IRS. And this was done days in advance of many of our traditional financial institutions and financial technology peers. In combination with the 2020 stimulus payments, we will have dispersed more than $2.5 billion in aid to customers through the first quarter of 2021. 
I think it's fair to ask how our business has been able to deliver results that are orders of magnitude better than our markets. Our strategic focus on the diversity of our business mix has enabled us to gain share. We are diverse across channels, geographies, software ownership and partnership, vertical markets, and new and durable partnerships. We are diverse by design. We couple that diversity with a long track record of execution consistency, years of sustained technology investment and the unmatched global experience of our long tenured team. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Cameron to provide more detail on our new partnership with Google. Cameron?"

We are delighted to announce today our new multiyear strategic partnership with Google that we expect will meaningfully enhance our ability to deliver new, innovative cloud-based products and capabilities, advance our technology-enabled distribution strategy, and deliver significant operational efficiencies, while improving speed to market and the scalability of our Merchant Solutions business. 
This exciting partnership has a number of facets that collectively serve to further distinguish our digital capabilities worldwide. 
First, together, we will collaborate on product development and innovation to enhance and differentiate the suite of cloud-based solutions available to our Merchant customers. These distinctive solutions will create stickier and longer-term customer relationships, building on our competitive advantages. As just one example of the types of enhanced capabilities we will offer together, Google's Business Services, including Google My Business, Workspace and Ads, will be integrated with Global Payments leading value-added software and payments ecosystem, creating a single destination and seamless digital experience for the full spectrum of solutions that merchants need to run and grow their businesses globally. Merchant customers will be able to digitally access the industry's most robust value stack of SaaS offerings, including point of sale, omnichannel ordering and integrated payments, advertising, data and analytics, email marketing, online presence and reputation management, and loyalty and gift card solutions, as well as capital access and payroll and human capital management solutions. These products will be delivered through Global Payment cloud-native operating environment, driving better customer engagement and ease of use. 
Second, our joint go-to-market efforts will drive significant referral and new customer acquisition opportunities for businesses of all sizes across our combined customer bases worldwide on an omni-channel basis. Specifically, Google Workspace serves as the cloud-native operating backbone for small and medium-sized businesses as well as many of the most sophisticated enterprise organizations globally, while Global Payments provides payments technology solutions to roughly 3.5 million merchant locations, in addition to some of the most complex multinational corporations across 60 countries. By leveraging our complementary customer bases, we will create attractive cross-selling opportunities for our digital solutions and meaningfully expand our addressable market. Further, together, we will be able to connect consumers with merchants by a search in new and innovative ways, driving commerce and growth in a differentiated way for our customers. And of course, our ability to secure net new customers will be significantly enhanced through the strength of this partnership with Google. 
Third, Global Payments is pleased to be selected as the preferred payment provider for Google. Today, Google executes approximately 3 billion transactions annually. And Global Payments is well positioned to meet the complex payment needs of one of the world's largest and most sophisticated technology companies by leveraging our unified commerce platform. We are humbled by the confidence our partners at Google have placed in us. 
Lastly, in addition to our commercial partnership, Google will become our preferred cloud provider for our Merchant payment technologies. Over the next several years, we will migrate the vast majority of our Merchant technology workloads to Google Cloud, significantly reducing our data center footprint and streamlining our operating environment to enhance performance and drive meaningful cost efficiencies. By moving our acquiring applications and workload to the Google Cloud, we will maintain the highest level of scalability, reliability and security, while increasing our speed of innovation and ability to seamlessly deploy products and services on demand anywhere in the world. 
We are thrilled to have established this partnership with Google. Together, we are on a transformational journey that will further enhance our industry-leading Merchant Solutions ecosystem with additional scale, reach and speed to market to seamlessly deliver new innovative digital technologies to customers worldwide. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul."

Our performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2020 exceeded our post COVID-19 expectations and highlight our outstanding execution and the resiliency of our business model. 
For the full year, we delivered adjusted net revenue of $6.75 billion, down 5% compared to 2019 on a combined basis. Importantly, our adjusted operating margin increased 210 basis points on a combined basis to 39.7%, as we benefited from the broad expense actions we implemented to address the impact of the pandemic and the realization of cost synergies related to the merger, which continue to track ahead of plan. It is worth highlighting that our full year adjusted operating margin performance was largely consistent with the guidance we gave at the start of 2020 and prior to the pandemic. The net result was adjusted earnings per share of $6.40, an increase of 3% over 2019. We are extremely pleased that we were able to grow our bottom line in 2020, enabled by continued execution on our differentiated strategy and our unwavering focus on all things within our control despite the impacts of COVID-19 on the worldwide economy. 
Moving to the fourth quarter. Adjusted net revenue was $1.75 billion, a 3% decline relative to 2019, as underlying trends in our business continued to recover from third quarter levels. Adjusted operating margin was 41.5%, a 320 basis point improvement from the fourth quarter of 2019. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.80 for the quarter, an increase of 11% compared to the prior year period, an impressive outcome that highlights the durability of our model and momentum we have heading into 2021. 
Taking a closer look at our performance by segment. 
Merchant Solutions achieved adjusted net revenue of $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter, a 4% decline from the prior year, which marked a 200 basis point improvement from the third quarter. Notably, we delivered an adjusted operating margin of 47.5% in this segment, an increase of 250 basis points from 2019, as our cost initiatives, expense synergies and the underlying strength of our business mix more than offset top line headwinds from the macro environment. 
Our technology-enabled portfolio continues to prove relatively resilient, with several of our businesses delivering year-over-year growth again this quarter. Specifically, worldwide omnichannel volume growth, excluding T&E, accelerated to the high teens, as our value proposition, including our unified commerce platform or UCP continues to resonate with customers. 
Additionally, Global Payments Integrated delivered adjusted net revenue growth for a second consecutive quarter. The leading scale and scope of our Integrated ecosystem across more vertical market markets and more geographies than our peers also enabled another record year for new partner production. 
As for our own software portfolio, AdvancedMD remained a bright spot and once again produced strong double-digit adjusted net revenue growth for the quarter and achieved a record bookings year in 2020. Indeed, booking trends across our vertical markets portfolio remains solid, providing us with a positive tailwind heading into 2021. 
We are also pleased that our U.S. relationship-led business saw adjusted net revenue returned to slight growth for the fourth quarter, enabled by the innovative technology and software solutions we are delivering in this channel. And despite a more challenging macroeconomic environment in several of our international markets this period, demand for our differentiated capabilities outside of the U.S. remains strong, as our solutions are well aligned with shifting customer needs coming out of the pandemic. 
Moving to Issuer Solutions. We delivered $457 million in adjusted net revenue for the fourth quarter, which was essentially flat to the prior year period. Transaction volumes recovered further, while traditional accounts on file continued to grow, setting a new record. Additionally, our bundled pricing model, including value-added products and services, also benefited performance. 
Excluding our commercial card business, which represents approximately 20% of our Issuer portfolio and is being impacted by the slow recovery in corporate travel, this segment delivered low single-digit growth for the quarter. Notably, this business achieved record adjusted operating income, and adjusted segment operating margin expanded 450 basis points from the prior year, also reaching a new record of 44.7%, as we continue to benefit from our efforts to drive efficiencies in the business. As Jeff highlighted, our Issuer team successfully signed 5 long-term contract extension and one new contract in the quarter. 
Finally, our Business and Consumer Solutions segment delivered adjusted net revenue of $205 million, a record fourth quarter result, representing growth of 3% from the prior year. Gross dollar volume increased more than 5% for the quarter, a result including little impact from the late December incremental stimulus, which we expect to primarily benefit us in Q1. We are particularly pleased with trends with our DDA products, which includes an acceleration in active account growth of 29% compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margin for this segment improved 260 basis points to 24.1%, as we benefited from our efforts to drive greater operational efficiencies as well as favorable revenue mix dynamics toward higher-margin channels. 
The solid performance we delivered across our segments highlights the powerful combination of Global Payments and TSYS, which has provided us with multiple levers to mitigate the headwinds we have faced from the pandemic. We made great progress on our integration during the crisis, which I mentioned, continues to track ahead of plan. As a result, we are pleased to again raise our estimate for annual run rate expense synergies from the merger to at least $400 million within 3 years, up from the previous estimate of $375 million. This marks the fourth time we have increased our cost synergy expectations. Additionally, our early success in leveraging our complementary products and capabilities worldwide also gives us the confidence to increase our expectation for annual run rate synergies, again, to $150 million, up from our previous forecast of $125 million. 
From a cash flow standpoint, we generated adjusted free cash flow of roughly $780 million for the quarter and approximately $2 billion for the year. These are both records for us. This is after reinvesting $107 million of CapEx for the quarter and $436 million for the year. As you may recall, we indicated we expected to invest between $400 million and $500 million of CapEx back into the business following the onset of the pandemic. 
Consistent with our announcement on our last call, we are also pleased to have now returned to our traditional capital allocation priorities. And during the quarter, we purchased 1.2 million of our shares for approximately $230 million. Our balance sheet is extremely healthy. And we ended 2020 with roughly $3 billion of liquidity and a leverage position of roughly 2.6x on a net debt basis. Further, our Board of Directors has again approved an increase through our share repurchase authorization to $1.5 billion. As part of this program, we intend to execute an accelerated share repurchase program for $500 million in the coming days. 
Turning to our outlook for 2021. Based on our current expectations for continued recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide, we expect adjusted net revenue to range from $7.5 billion to $7.6 billion, reflecting growth of 11% to 13% over 2020. This outlook is consistent with the high end of our long-term target of high single-digit to low double-digit growth, and it is also reflects the benefit of the year-on-year comparisons due to the pandemic. Considering this top line forecast, we would expect to deliver normalized adjusted operating margin expansion of up to 450 basis points, given the natural operating leverage in our business and expense synergy actions related to the TSYS merger. However, this will be partially offset by the reinstatement of certain expenses that were temporarily reduced at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic for most of 2020. Therefore, we are currently forecasting adjusted operating margin expansion of up to 250 basis points compared to 2020 levels on a net basis. 
To provide some color at the segment level. We expect adjusted net revenue growth for our Merchant Solutions segment to be in the mid to high teens, which assumes the current pace of recovery continues worldwide. We expect underlying trends in our issuing business to be in the mid to high single-digit growth range and above our mid-single-digit growth target. 
These trends should be normalized for 2 distinct and relatively equal sized headwinds. First, we are not anticipating a recovery in our commercial card business as we expect corporate travel to remain depressed throughout 2021. Second, we will be absorbing the impact of a portfolio sale by one of our customers, which will impact us for the remainder of the year. Taking these 2 items into account, we are forecasting our issuing business to deliver adjusted net revenue growth in the low single-digit range for the full year. 
Lastly, we expect underlying trends in our business and consumer segment to be consistent with our long-term expectations of mid to high single-digit growth. This outlook reflects the expected benefits of the recent stimulus announced at the end of December, but it does not assume any additional stimulus. Adjusting for the impact of the larger 2020 CARES Act stimulus on comparative results for 2021, we are forecasting adjusted net revenue growth to be in the mid-single digits for this segment. 
Regarding segment margins. We expect up to 250 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement for the total company, to be driven largely by Merchant Solutions, while we expect Issuer and Business and Consumer to deliver normalized margin expansion consistent with the underlying leverage profile of these businesses. This follows a 500 and 400 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion delivered by Issuer and Business and Consumer, respectively, in 2020. 
Lastly, I would highlight that from a quarterly phasing perspective, we will not lap the initial impact of the pandemic until mid-March. Therefore, we will have pandemic affected first quarter comparisons, resulting in more muted growth characteristics early in 2021, with the opposite effect occurring in the second quarter, before returning to more normalized rates of growth in the back half of the year. Our outlook is for adjusted net revenue growth, adjusted operating margin expansion and adjusted earnings per share growth for each quarter of 2021. 
Moving to a couple of nonoperating items. We currently expect net interest expense to be slightly lower in 2021 relative to 2020, while we anticipate our adjusted effective tax rate to be relatively consistent with last year and expect our capital expenditures for 2021 to be in the $500 million to $600 million range. Putting it all together, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year in a range of $7.75 to $8.05, reflecting growth of 21% to 26% over 2020. This is consistent with the adjusted earnings per share target of roughly $8 that we provided on our third quarter call despite the incremental adverse impact of additional lockdowns and social distancing protocols in a number of our markets since late October. 
In summary, our 2021 guidance assumes an improving economy for the first half of the year and a stronger second half of the year, with continued progress toward normalization. We are pleased with how well we are positioned as we enter 2021. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff."

We didn't spend the past year waiting for a better day. Our resilience is self-evident. The technology investments we made over the last 7-plus years, our distinctive strategy and execution consistency has served us well.

And then further, as we co-develop and innovate new products with Google, we'll obviously look to layer those into the portal environment as well. The nice thing about the portal environment is completely self-select. Our customers can choose what products and solutions that they need to run and grow their business. And they'll be able to effectively determine the pricing outcome that they desire based on their need for products and services.

Maybe I'll start with just a little commentary about the expectations for the business and I'll let Paul jump in with a few more of the details. 
So I would say if you look at the business overall, given that North America represents about 70% of the Merchant business globally, obviously, it's going to drive the lion's share of the outcome for the entire segment for the full year. And I would say we are looking for pretty good recoveries, obviously, in the payments and payroll business as well as the integrated business in the U.S. So I would say both of those would be towards the higher end of that targeted expectation that we have for the merchant business in aggregate. And as the vertical markets that we participate in continue to recover as well, we would expect our vertical market business to be towards the higher end of that range also just given, obviously, the impacts on 2020 for that business as well as a strong new sales performance that we saw in 2020 giving us good momentum kind of heading into 2021 as we start to lap the impacts of the pandemic. 
I think Europe, our expectations are a little more modest. They're probably in that kind of mid teens range, just given some of the incremental impacts of new shutdowns and restrictions in the first part of the year in Europe. And maybe just a slightly more benign expectation around the recovery environment in Europe, particularly as it relates to cross-border throughout the course of 2021. 
And then I would say Asia has recovered reasonably well heading into the year. And I think we have pretty good expectations that Asia gets back to a fairly strong growth rate in the year towards, again, the high end of that guidance range overall for 2021. 
So I think when you put it all together, we feel good about the mix of businesses we have and the overall expectation for mid to high-teens growth for the full year. I would tell you, Bryan, that basically assumes kind of an ongoing gradual recovery from where we are today. We've seen results in January that are better than December. And we expect the recovery to continue to grind higher through the balance of the year. Such that by the time we're exiting '21, we expect domestic volumes to be more normalized. And obviously, we think cross-border is going to continue to lag slightly kind of heading into 2022. And that's consistent with the commercial card commentary that Paul provided in his script. 
So we're not expecting a heroic recovery as we think about the outlook for 2021. We expect a gradual recovery kind of throughout the year. We know it won't be linear. There'll be puts and takes as we continue to progress throughout the year. But by and large, expect a continued gradual recovery, and that's really what supports the overall Merchant expectation for the year. 
Paul, I don't know if you'd add anything to that."

So we're delighted about that and think there's a lot that we can do together with Google to drive new revenue growth in the business through this cross-sell relationship. 
And then reflecting back a little bit on the comments that I made to Bryan's question. If you think about the business, these solutions will be delivered through our cloud-based digital portal that is in operation today and running in Google Cloud today. So the idea is as we continue to integrate new products and solutions and services into our digital portal, they'll be available to our entire merchant base regardless of what distribution and channel that merchant customer comes to us. So since it's all consolidated on the back end, those merchant customers will have the ability to access all of those value-added solutions and capabilities, whether or not they're a traditional relationship-led customer coming through us through that channel or they're an integrated customer coming through us through an ISV relationship. And we think that's unique and distinctive to Global Payments, our ability to integrate those solutions and make them available through a digital portal to the entire suite of customers that we serve around the globe."

We kind of hit on it a little bit on the merchant side in the earlier question around kind of that phasing. And that same kind of concept kind of plays through to a large degree with other segments, particularly as it relates to the pre-pandemic comp in 1Q and then the pandemic comp going the other way in the second quarter and then kind of more normalized in the back half of the year. So clearly, that's the case in Merchant. And that mid to high teens growth rate, as I said, kind of averages out between the first 2 quarters with those 2 impacts and then is pretty consistent for the back 2 quarters. 
On the issuing side, as we said, from a kind of organic standpoint, we start kind of that mid to high-growth rate. And then if we're going to actually look to be it or a low single-digit as a reported matter, the only thing I would highlight there is we did not assume commercial card recovering throughout the year. So that's a headwind that plays itself out throughout the whole year. I would say we also have some -- in addition to just the pre-pandemic comps, we also have some headwinds as it relates to just credit transaction volumes in the issuing business year-over-year as -- and we're seeing consistent with what the Visa numbers that they talked about for January. And as Cameron mentioned earlier, we did see improvement from January to December, but we still have some headwind on the transaction volume side and issuing that will play itself through the first quarter. 
And then on the Business and Consumer side, we kind of talked about it. We've got some tailwind as it relates to stimulus in the first quarter and then kind of more normalized kind of that mid-single-digit growth rate that we talked about for the remaining 3 quarters. 
As it relates to expenses and margin, there isn't anything necessary on the expense side. Obviously, where -- we've done a really good job over the last 2 quarters of managing that expense rate to a pretty consistent year-over-year growth rate of roughly about 8%. And there's nothing I would necessarily highlight other than the variable expenses that come with that revenue that I would call out on the expense side. So obviously, we're very pleased to be in a position to yet again have a very impressive margin expansion as a consolidated matter. We did, as we said in our prepared remarks, have a much higher weighting of that margin expansion on the Merchant side than we did this last year, but we still expect to have nice margin expansion in both Issuing and Business and Consumer. And there wouldn't be necessarily anything on a quarterly basis I could call out there."

We are looking for revenue growth opportunities on our side because we've got plenty of earnings. And obviously, showing our ability to grow margin very substantially even difficult macro economic environments in '20, and that's obviously our outlook for '21, too. So I don't think any of that's changed. These things aren't usually exclusive.

That continues to be true today and that's going to be true tomorrow. So having more scale in the scale business is always a good idea. I think we've shown this with Harland. I think we've shown it with TSYS partnership. So I don't think having scale in the technology business is really ever going to go out of favor. I think the fruit's in the pudding, and you saw that in 2020, right? Double-digit earnings growth in the fourth quarter coming out of the depression while the networks are shrinking. I don't think you have to look further than that to realize that, that was a good idea. So I think at the end of day, those type of scale economies will drive further consolidation. But it's not just consolidation for consolidation's sake. I think the reasons in part that we look for further scale of opportunities is to make more investments back in our businesses. If you look at the areas that are growing most quickly for us during the pandemic, look at our omnichannel business, which accelerated again to the high teens in the fourth quarter of '20, which, by the way, Google is going on too Under our UCP product, look at our integrated business, which showed absolute growth in the fourth quarter and for the year, those are businesses, and of course, our software businesses, which did as well in certain of their vertical markets like AdvancedMD. Those are all businesses where we've made very substantial investments in over the last number of years. We couldn't make those investments worldwide as we're doing if we didn't have the scale in the first place. So listen, my own view on the -- in the business is we need to continue to invest in those areas that we think are ripe for future growth. We never could have pivoted this quickly to omnichannel to safer commerce if we hadn't had those on the product development board in the first place and if we didn't have the access to capital that we do from free cash flow, like to continue to make those investments. So in those context, obviously, additional scale makes sense. But very similar to the response, Darrin, because he has a very similar question to Ashwin, at the end of the day, none of that changes the strategy, really that we've been running the company with over the last 7-plus years, which is to say, focus on the 3 prongs at the end of the day, software partnership and ownership, on omnichannel acceptance and delivery and on the most attractive market. So the nice thing about 2020 with all the challenges it on every one of us was that it really validated all things that we've been talking about. So if we can find future transactions or partnerships that align with the 3 things that we've been talking about since 2013, but of course, scale and a scale business is going to be a good idea. So I think we view '20 and the recent events as really the validation of all stuff that we've been talking about. If we can find further ways to accelerate those investments, then we will."

Maybe I'll jump in on that one and I'll ask Jeff or Paul to chime in as well if they'd like to add anything. So maybe if I just step back and look at it from a macro standpoint in terms of overall net new sales performance for the year, I think it's pretty easy to say that we're delighted with the outcome, particularly given the backdrop that we were executing again for the full year. 
So just a few highlights that I would share. One, Heartland for the year had new sales growth year-over-year relative to 2019 despite the pandemic, which I think speaks volumes to our relationship-led managers' ability to go out and generate new business even in a really difficult environment. And obviously, they've been very creative and nimble in terms of how they've been able to do that. So Heartland grew net sales in 2020 notwithstanding the pandemic environment. 
Integrated exceeded our budgeted new sales forecast for the year by a pretty meaningful amount, an excellent new sales year for our Integrated business. New partner production was also about 140% of our budget. So not only did we see good, strong new sales of merchants, we saw good new business development partner production in that channel as well. 
And then in some of the vertical market businesses, AdvancedMD grew bookings 15% year-over-year. Our Xmal SaaS solution was up 20% year-over-year. Cuts Net had new sales performance that was pretty consistent with '19, again, notwithstanding the fact that many university and campuses were closed for much of the year with the beginning of the pandemic. 
So that just gives you a few ideas. Canada was up 20% in new sales year-over-year. So from a new sales execution standpoint, I think our performance was exemplary in 2020. And I'm really delighted with the teams and what they were able to accomplish given the backdrop. 
I think the most important thing is we grew net [ mid ] count globally in 2020. So notwithstanding all the concerns around the SMB markets and all the concerns about small business failure, we grew mid count year-over-year, which is a good accomplishment in any market, in any environment, but a particularly good outcome in 2020 given the backdrop. 
So we feel very good about the health of the underlying portfolios that we are managing. We feel very good about the diversification of the businesses that we have, the vertical markets exposures we have. To Jeff's point in his script, we are diverse by design. Obviously, we've put a lot of effort into making sure that we have a Merchant business in particular that has a good mix of credit exposure, that is not taking undue credit risk. It's well diversified across geographies, verticals, types of underlying merchant customers. And I think that has helped us to have a more -- relatively more resilient sort of performance over the course of 2020. And I think we exited the year at a pretty good place and have a lot of confidence heading into 2021 that the expectations we've set forth today are achievable, and we feel good about delivering against this. As I said earlier, January was better than December for us in our Merchant business and very much consistent with our expectations. It gives us confidence at least one month into the year, that we're in a good trajectory to get to the outcomes we've provided today."

So both businesses, both TSYS and Global Payments have had historical relationships with each of Amazon and Google for many years. So I think we've had a first row seat as to what those companies look like. We have a lot of respect for each. 
So why don't I start with AWS? So our Issuer folks have worked with them for a number of years as part of their modernization initiatives. We've been very, very happy with them. I think you have to realize that it's a slightly different proposition that we're undertaking in the Issuer versus Merchant. So on the Issuer side, it's technology modernization and transformation really at the same time, which is to say that code is going from more of a legacy code into cloud-enabled, able where it probably is today, and then into cloud-native ultimately, while it's being lifted and shifted over to a cloud-hosted environment. So in the case of Google Hub, on the Merchant side, we're really already there. Our businesses are really either cloud-enabled or cloud native already in their own rights. So the Google proposition is a little bit different on the technology side. It's more of a shift rather than a lift and shift in the case of the Merchant business. I would say in the case of each, the go-to-market proposition though is very similar. We think AWS has a very distinctive and strong proposition among financial institution issuers. You can look up a lot of folks that they announced recently going to AWS Cloud. But we've had, as we said in our prepared remarks, we had very good experience already with one announced win and I think 3 to 4, we said are already mid- to high probabilities in the pipeline. And probably another 4 or 5 that are lower probabilities, but also in the pipeline on the co-sell with AWS in the Issuer environment. So we view AWS, and I think it's been proven so far in our experience today as having fantastic technologies, which we need for a long time, but also having terrific distribution to in the FI segment. Google, of course, has very many of the same things, but we view the Google co-sell more on the Merchant side, which is what Cameron was talking about, too. And really, there's 2 pieces there that are also unique. So in the case of AWS, that's a unique co-sell in FI land in the case of Google, it's unique co-sell into merchant land. And on the merchant side, it's really 2 pieces, as Cameron's articulated with Google. The first 1 really is embedding their products and services uniquely into our already live Merchant portal, which, by the way, is already resonant for Global Payments and has been for years in the Google Cloud already, right? So we already have that. We're just blending their products into our Merchant cloud environment more seamlessly. And then the second piece, similar to AWS is a co-sale, meaning there's actual quota at the Google level for Google sales reps to sell our products and services into the Google base. And we also have that ability of selling Google's products and services into our portal like environment, which Cameron described some time ago. Very similar to what we're doing with AWS, there's quota on their sales reps and selling on the FI base. 
So while I would say that they're very similar in the sense of contract, they're a bit different when you think about where their target Issuer versus Merchant and when you think about the nature of the lifting shift that's really going on in the case of the AWS side and the Google side is more of a shift."

I just add a couple of things on that, particularly as it relates to the Google partnership, just building on Jeff's commentary. So first of all, as Jeff noted, we have a very long history with Google. We know them in the Merchant business extraordinarily well. They've been a terrific partner to us. And we expect them to be obviously a fantastic partner going forward. 
I think what struck me most as we thought about the opportunity is just the shared vision that we both have as it relates to helping Merchant customers do a couple of things. One is drive top of funnel opportunities for their business with new products and capability and innovation, particularly digitally, that will help do that for Merchant customers, particularly in an environment where they need that now more than ever. And then secondly, delivering products and capabilities that help businesses run more efficiently and more effectively. And I think we have Google Payments -- excuse me, Global Payments and what Google has tried to accomplish are really geared towards those elements of supporting Merchant customers. And then lastly, we have very shared visions around innovation. And those things that we can do, again, that are going to help drive more customers through our customers' businesses, while at the same time, again, helping them to run their businesses more effectively. And although we're starting with Google My Business, Work Space and Ads, integrating that into our portal environment, we hope to add omnichannel ordering and search, service appointment availability, inventory, those types of solutions as well, again, trying to create a more distinctive, holistic offering of value-added services through our digital portal that we think will be, again, differentiated in the market for Global Payments, but more importantly, will really help our customers, again, to run and grow their businesses effectively."

We delivered fourth quarter and full year results that exceeded our expectations because of our focus on technology enablement, coupled with ongoing excellence in execution. Our fourth quarter results demonstrated continued sequential improvement despite the impact of a more challenging macroeconomic environment in a number of our markets for much of the period. None of this would have been possible without the dedication of our exceptional team members during this difficult time, and we thank them for their commitment to our customers, to each other and to our communities. 
We are very pleased to have delivered substantial margin improvement for the fourth quarter while also setting aside funds to pay partial cash bonuses to our non-executive team members. Because of the actions we took early in the pandemic and our consistency in execution, we were able to deliver double-digit earnings per share growth in the fourth quarter, positioning us well heading into 2021. We believe that we exited 2020 in a better position than we entered. 
We also accomplished a great deal over the last 12 months. Specifically, we signed Truist Financial Corporation, the sixth largest commercial bank in the United States, a competitive win twice over; entered a new collaboration with AWS, our preferred provider of issuer cloud services, to launch a unique go-to-market distribution strategy, coupled with transformative cloud-native technologies; expanded and extended our partnership with CaixaBank on increasing ownership of our joint venture and executing a new referral agreement through 2040; renewed agreements with a number of the most complex and sophisticated financial institutions globally, including TD Bank in North America, HSBC in Europe and CIBC in Canada; assisted in the rapid distribution of more than $2.5 billion in stimulus funds for our Netspend customers days faster than other financial technology participants; and announced today a new partnership with Google to deliver innovative and seamless digital services to all manner of merchants worldwide. 
Our collaboration with Google substantially advances our merchant business by driving incremental revenue and lowering operating costs to a worldwide go-to-market distribution relationship and co-innovation agreement focused on transformative cloud-native technologies. Together, we will bring new best-in-class digital products to market on a global basis more quickly, and we will further catalyze our culture of market-leading innovation. 
Cameron will provide more detail on Google in a minute, but it's worth noting that in the last 6 months, we have struck significant and unique distribution relationships with 2 of the world's largest and most respected technology companies with a combined market capitalization of nearly $3 trillion. This is a first for the payments technology industry, and we did this in the midst of a once-in-a-century pandemic while delivering adjusted earnings per share growth and gaining market share. These collaborations also are consistent with our long-held distinctive strategies to drive digital penetration. 
Our business is the combination of 2 halves: distinctive distribution and cutting-edge technologies. AWS and Google enhanced both parts of the equation. Together, we will leapfrog legacy analog means of distribution and redefine how payment solutions and services are sold and consumed in the digital age for our issuing and merchant businesses. 
We already have reached the threshold of 60% of our business coming from technology enablement, a goal we set in March 2018 for year-end 2020 and achieved early last July. And roughly 25% of our business is now related to our e-commerce and omnichannel initiatives. But together with AWS and Google, we expect to do more by driving further technology enablement and omnichannel penetration as legs of the stool for future growth. I cannot think of 2 better partners to catalyze further migration of our issuing and merchant businesses to cloud-native technologies and expand our competitive moat. These partnerships provide proof points of the momentum we have entering 2021 and will accelerate the transformation of our businesses for years to come. 
Just a reminder of the composition of the businesses driving our growth, starting with our merchant business, which is 2/3 of our company. Our technology-enabled portfolio consists of 3 roughly equally sized channels. Our omnichannel, hardware and software and owned software vertical markets businesses collectively represent nearly 60% of merchant adjusted net revenue. Our relationship-led businesses make up the remaining portion and continue to differentiate themselves in the markets we serve based on the strength of our technologies. 
Our omnichannel businesses delivered accelerated sequential growth in the fourth quarter of 2020, again, excluding travel and entertainment. As we said at the beginning of the pandemic, we continue to see and expect ongoing sustained share shifts toward omnichannel acceptance brought forward 3 to 5 years by COVID-19. 
We launched our unified commerce or UCP cloud POS solution this quarter, which connects any commerce software to our wireless payment terminals through our API to help merchants more easily unify their in-person and online payment experiences. Our Citi partnership also continues to expand worldwide, and we expect new Citi customers on UCP to include one of the leading global food companies, one of the preeminent global beverage brands and one of the largest multinational auto manufacturing companies across multiple continents. And of course, with today's announcement, we also expect Google to become a UCP partner. 
Additionally, we signed an agreement with Texas Instruments across Taiwan, the Philippines and India, and we expect to expand our relationship to additional geographies later this year. We also reached an agreement with Wolverine to consolidate their U.K. and European acquiring across 32 countries, and we have now successfully launched with both Uber Rides and Uber Eats in our Asia Pacific region. 
Moving to Global Payments Integrated, which drives another nearly 20% of our merchant adjusted net revenue. We generated growth for the fourth quarter and for the full year because of the unrivaled breadth of our partnership portfolio in the most attractive vertical markets. The strength of our combined integrated offerings allowed us to exceed our budgeted new sales forecast for calendar 2020, with new partner production increasing 171% versus 2019. 
Our owned software businesses represent the remaining roughly 20% of our merchant adjusted net revenue, and our leading SaaS solutions in health care, higher education and quick service restaurants or QSRs have been more resilient in the current environment. To that end, our AdvancedMD business delivered a record performance in 2020, achieving double-digit revenue and bookings growth, and our higher education business produced one of its finest years to date. 
Lastly, our enterprise QSR business continued its success with Xenial's cloud POS and omni solutions, enabling over 100 million transactions and $1.5 million in sales for the year. In addition to serving 26 of the top 50 QSR brands, we were also pleased to announce the signing of Denny's for cloud-based SaaS solutions, extending our addressable market to the fast-casual category. 
Today, we lead with technology and innovative solutions across all of our merchant businesses. This includes our relationship-led channels, where we continue to see stronger sales performance fueled by our suite of differentiated products and solutions. For example, our U.S. business is seeing significant uptake of its SaaS point-of-sale solutions with adjusted net revenue and new sales both exceeding 20% growth in 2020. One recent notable win is with the Milwaukee Bucks, where we'll be deploying our cloud-based POS solution across merchandise stores and outlets in the arena. 
Issuer is the next largest segment of our business. In August 2020, we announced a transformational go-to-market collaboration with AWS to provide an industry-leading cloud-based issuer processing platform for customers regardless of size, location or processing preference. We currently have 1 LOI and 3 other mid- to late-stage opportunities together with AWS that we are actively working. And we now believe that the win in Asia in a single large market from a legacy competitor that we have already secured with AWS will likely expand to several markets across Asia over time. 
We continue to capitalize on the broad and deep pipeline we have the good fortune to have in our issuer business. We currently have 11 letters of intent with financial institutions worldwide, 6 of which are competitive takeaways. In the last 18 months, we have had 36 competitive wins across North America and international markets, and our customers continue to win in the marketplace, a key element of our issuer strategy to align with market leaders. During the first quarter of 2021, we will complete the first phase of the conversion of over 4 million accounts from a competitor for one of our largest customers. 
In Germany, we have successfully expanded our long-standing and successful partnership with Deutsche Bank, our largest client in the DACH region. We are pleased to announce that TSYS has been selected in a competitive process as Deutsche Bank's partner of choice for their esteemed branded card portfolios across all brands, including Deutsche Bank and Postbank. 
We are also proud to have signed a new multiyear agreement with Marlette Funding, owner and operator of the Best Egg lending platform, for the processing of a new consumer credit card product which will launch in the second quarter of this year. We are pleased to have secured long-term extensions in multiple geographies with President's Choice, a subsidiary of Loblaws, and Canadian Tire Financial Services, both large retailers in Canada; Scotiabank in Central America; Bank of Ireland; and Banco INVEX in Mexico. 
Finally, our business and consumer segment delivered another quarter of solid growth as we continue to pivot our strategic focus to digitization, international expansion and business-to-business opportunities. That shift is underway without any compromise in execution as we also achieved adjusted net revenue in excess of $200 million for the first time in a fourth quarter. The move toward cash flow solutions is benefiting the portfolio, with customers remaining active longer and utilizing our products more online. 
I am proud that Netspend has once again facilitated the rapid distribution of stimulus funds to customers and played an important role during this most challenging period. Since late December, we have processed more than 1 million deposits accounting for just over $1 billion in stimulus payments to American consumers dispersed by the IRS, and this was done days in advance of many of our traditional financial institutions and financial technology peers. In combination with the 2020 stimulus payments, we will have dispersed more than $2.5 billion in aid to customers through the first quarter of 2021. 
I think it's fair to ask how our business has been able to deliver results that are orders of magnitude better than our markets. Our strategic focus on the diversity of our business mix has enabled us to gain share. We are diverse across channels, geographies, software ownership and partnership, vertical markets and new and durable partnerships. We are diverse by design. We couple that diversity with a long track record of execution consistency, years of sustained technology investment and the unmatched global experience of our long tenured team. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Cameron to provide more detail on our new partnership with Google. Cameron?"

We are delighted to announce today our new multiyear strategic partnership with Google that we expect will meaningfully enhance our ability to deliver new innovative cloud-based products and capabilities, advance our technology-enabled distribution strategy and deliver significant operational efficiencies while improving speed to market and the scalability of our Merchant Solutions business. 
This exciting partnership has a number of facets that collectively serve to further distinguish our digital capabilities worldwide. First, together, we will collaborate on product development and innovation to enhance and differentiate the suite of cloud-based solutions available to our merchant customers. These distinctive solutions will create stickier and longer-term customer relationships, building on our competitive advantages. 
As just one example of the types of enhanced capabilities we will offer together, Google's business services, including Google My Business, Workspace and Ads, will be integrated with Global Payments' leading value-added software and payments ecosystem, creating a single destination and seamless digital experience for the full spectrum of solutions that merchants need to run and grow their businesses globally. Merchant customers will be able to digitally access the industry's most robust value stack of SaaS offerings, including point of sale, omnichannel ordering and integrated payments; advertising, data and analytics; email marketing, online presence and reputation management; and loyalty and gift card solutions; as well as capital access in payroll and human capital management solutions. These products will be delivered through Global Payment's cloud-native operating environment, driving better customer engagement and ease of use. 
Second, our joint go-to-market efforts will drive significant referral and new customer acquisition opportunities for businesses of all sizes across our combined customer bases worldwide on an omnichannel basis. Specifically, Google Workspace serves as the cloud-native operating backbone for small and medium-sized businesses as well as many of the most sophisticated enterprise organizations globally while Global Payments provides payments technology solutions to roughly 3.5 million merchant locations, in addition to some of the most complex multinational corporations across 60 countries. By leveraging our complementary customer bases, we will create attractive cross-selling opportunities for our digital solutions and meaningfully expand our addressable market. Further, together, we will be able to connect consumers with merchants via search in new and innovative ways, driving commerce and growth in a differentiated way for our customers, and of course, our ability to secure net new customers will be significantly enhanced through the strength of this partnership with Google. 
Third, Global Payments is pleased to be selected as the preferred payment provider for Google. Today, Google executes approximately 3 billion transactions annually, and Global Payments is well positioned to meet the complex payment needs of one of the world's largest and most sophisticated technology companies by leveraging our unified commerce platform. We are humbled by the confidence our partners at Google have placed in us. 
Lastly, in addition to our commercial partnership, Google will become our preferred cloud provider for our merchant payment technologies. Over the next several years, we will migrate the vast majority of our merchant technology workloads to Google Cloud, significantly reducing our data center footprint and streamlining our operating environment to enhance performance and drive meaningful cost efficiencies. By moving our acquiring applications and workload to the Google Cloud, we will maintain the highest level of scalability, reliability and security while increasing our speed of innovation and ability to seamlessly deploy products and services on demand anywhere in the world. 
We are thrilled to have established this partnership with Google. Together, we are on a transformational journey that will further enhance our industry-leading Merchant Solutions ecosystem with additional scale, reach and speed to market to seamlessly deliver new innovative digital technologies to customers worldwide. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul."
813574,701609602,2198227,"Global Payments Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 08, 2021",2021-02-08,"Earnings Calls","Global Payments Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Cameron. Our performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2020 exceeded our post-COVID-19 expectations and highlight our outstanding execution and the resiliency of our business model. For the full year, we delivered adjusted net reve",1875,"Thanks, Cameron. Our performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2020 exceeded our post-COVID-19 expectations and highlight our outstanding execution and the resiliency of our business model. 
For the full year, we delivered adjusted net revenue of $6.75 billion, down 5% compared to 2019 on a combined basis. Importantly, our adjusted operating margin increased 210 basis points on a combined basis to 39.7% as we benefited from the broad expense actions we implemented to address the impact of the pandemic and the realization of cost synergies related to the merger, which continue to track ahead of plan. 
It is worth highlighting that our full year adjusted operating margin performance was largely consistent with the guidance we gave at the start of 2020 and prior to the pandemic. The net result was adjusted earnings per share of $6.40, an increase of 3% over 2019. We are extremely pleased that we were able to grow our bottom line in 2020, enabled by continued execution on our differentiated strategy and our unwavering focus on all things within our control despite the impact of COVID-19 on the worldwide economy. 
Moving to the fourth quarter. Adjusted net revenue was $1.75 billion, a 3% decline relative to 2019, as underlying trends in our business continued to recover from third quarter levels. Adjusted operating margin was 41.5%, a 320 basis point improvement from the fourth quarter of 2019. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.80 for the quarter, an increase of 11% compared to the prior year period, an impressive outcome that highlights the durability of our model and momentum we have heading into 2021. 
Taking a closer look at our performance by segment.  Merchant Solutions achieved adjusted net revenue of $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter, a 4% decline from the prior year, which marked a 200 basis point improvement from the third quarter. Notably, we delivered an adjusted operating margin of 47.5% in this segment, an increase of 250 basis points from 2019, as our cost initiatives, expense synergies and the underlying strength of our business mix more than offset top line headwinds from the macro environment. 
Our technology-enabled portfolio continues to prove relatively resilient, with several of our businesses delivering year-over-year growth again this quarter. Specifically, worldwide omnichannel volume growth excluding T&E accelerated to the high teens as our value proposition, including our unified commerce platform or UCP, continues to resonate with customers. Additionally, Global Payments Integrated delivered adjusted net revenue growth for a second consecutive quarter. The leading scale and scope of our integrated ecosystem across more vertical markets and more geographies than our peers also enabled another record year for new partner production. 
As for our owned software portfolio, AdvancedMD remained a bright spot and once again produced strong double-digit adjusted net revenue growth for the quarter and achieved a record bookings year in 2020. Indeed, booking trends across our vertical markets portfolio remains solid, providing us with a positive tailwind heading into 2021. 
We are also pleased that our U.S. relationship-led business saw adjusted net revenue return to slight growth for the fourth quarter, enabled by the innovative technology and software solutions we are delivering in this channel. And despite a more challenging macroeconomic environment in several of our international markets this period, demand for our differentiated capabilities outside of the U.S. remained strong as our solutions are well aligned with shifting customer needs coming out of the pandemic. 
Moving to Issuer Solutions. We delivered $457 million in adjusted net revenue for the fourth quarter, which was essentially flat to the prior year period. Transaction volumes recovered further while traditional accounts on file continued to grow, setting a new record. Additionally, our bundled pricing model, including value-added products and services, also benefited performance. 
Excluding our commercial card business, which represents approximately 20% of our issuer portfolio and is being impacted by the slow recovery in corporate travel, this segment delivered low single-digit growth for the quarter. Notably, this business achieved record adjusted operating income, and adjusted segment operating margin expanded 450 basis points from the prior year, also reaching a new record of 44.7%, as we continue to benefit from our efforts to drive efficiencies in the business. As Jeff highlighted, our issuer team successfully signed 5 long-term contract extensions and 1 new contract in the quarter. 
Finally, our Business and Consumer Solutions segment delivered adjusted net revenue of $205 million, a record fourth quarter result, representing growth of 3% from the prior year. Gross dollar volume increased more than 5% for the quarter, a result including little impact from the late December incremental stimulus, which we expect to primarily benefit us in Q1. We are particularly pleased with trends with our DDA products, which includes an acceleration in active account growth of 29% compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margin for this segment improved 260 basis points to 24.1% as we benefited from our efforts to drive greater operational efficiencies as well as favorable revenue mix dynamics toward higher-margin channels. 
The solid performance we delivered across our segments highlights the powerful combination of  Global Payments and TSYS, which has provided us with multiple levers to mitigate the headwinds we have faced from the pandemic. We made great progress on our integration during the crisis, which I mentioned continues to track ahead of plan. 
As a result, we are pleased to again raise our estimate for annual run rate expense synergies from the merger to at least $400 million within 3 years, up from the previous estimate of $375 million. This marks the fourth time we have increased our cost synergy expectations. Additionally, our early success in leveraging our complementary products and capabilities worldwide also gives us the confidence to increase our expectation for annual run rate synergies again to $150 million, up from our previous forecast of $125 million. 
From a cash flow standpoint, we generated adjusted free cash flow of roughly $780 million for the quarter and approximately $2 billion for the year. These are both records for us. This is after reinvesting $107 million of CapEx for the quarter and $436 million for the year. As you may recall, we indicated we expected to invest between $400 million and $500 million of CapEx back into the business following the onset of the pandemic. 
Consistent with our announcement on our last call, we are also pleased to have now returned to our traditional capital allocation priorities and during the quarter, repurchased 1.2 million of our shares for approximately $230 million. Our balance sheet is extremely healthy, and we ended 2020 with roughly $3 billion of liquidity and a leverage position of roughly 2.6x on a net debt basis. 
Further, our Board of Directors has again approved an increase to our share repurchase authorization to $1.5 billion. As part of this program, we intend to execute an accelerated share repurchase program for $500 million in the coming days. 
Turning to our outlook for 2021. Based on our current expectations for continued recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide, we expect adjusted net revenue to range from $7.5 billion to $7.6 billion, reflecting growth of 11% to 13% over 2020. This outlook is consistent with the high end of our long-term target of high single-digit to low double-digit growth, and it also reflects the benefit of the year-on-year comparisons due to the pandemic. 
Considering this top line forecast, we would expect to deliver normalized adjusted operating margin expansion of up to 450 basis points, given the natural operating leverage in our business and expense synergy actions related to the TSYS merger. However, this will be partially offset by the reinstatement of certain expenses that were temporarily reduced at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic for most of 2020. Therefore, we are currently forecasting adjusted operating margin expansion of up to 250 basis points compared to 2020 levels on a net basis. 
To provide some color at the segment level, we expect adjusted net revenue growth for our Merchant Solutions segment to be in the mid to high teens, which assumes the current pace of recovery continues worldwide. We expect underlying trends in our issuing business to be in the mid to high single-digit growth range and above our mid-single-digit growth target. 
These trends should be normalized for 2 distinct and relatively equal sized headwinds. First, we are not anticipating a recovery in our commercial card business as we expect corporate travel to remain depressed throughout 2021. Second, we will be absorbing the impact of a portfolio sale by one of our customers, which will impact us for the remainder of the year. Taking these 2 items into account, we are forecasting our issuing business to deliver adjusted net revenue growth in the low single-digit range for the full year. 
Lastly, we expect underlying trends in our business and consumer segment to be consistent with our long-term expectations of mid- to high single-digit growth. This outlook reflects the expected benefits of the recent stimulus announced at the end of December, but it does not assume any additional stimulus. Adjusting for the impact of the larger 2020 CARES Act stimulus on comparative results for 2021, we are forecasting adjusted net revenue growth to be in the mid-single digits for this segment. 
Regarding segment margins, we expect up to 250 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement for the total company, to be driven largely by Merchant Solutions while we expect issuer and business and consumer to deliver normalized margin expansion consistent with the underlying leverage profile of these businesses. This follows a 500 and 400 basis point of adjusted operating margin expansion delivered by issuer and business and consumer, respectively, in 2020. 
Lastly, I would highlight that from a quarterly phasing perspective, we will not lap the initial impact of the pandemic until mid-March. Therefore, we will have pandemic-affected first quarter comparisons resulting in more muted growth characteristics early in 2021, with the opposite effect occurring in the second quarter before returning to more normalized rates of growth in the back half of the year. Our outlook is for adjusted net revenue growth, adjusted operating margin expansion and adjusted earnings per share growth for each quarter of 2021. 
Moving to a couple of nonoperating items. We currently expect net interest expense to be slightly lower in 2021 relative to 2020 while we anticipate our adjusted effective tax rate to be relatively consistent with last year and expect our capital expenditures for 2021 to be in the $500 million to $600 million range.  
Putting it all together, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year in a range of $7.75 to $8.05, reflecting growth of 21% to 26% over 2020. This is consistent with the adjusted earnings per share target of roughly $8 that we provided on our third quarter call despite the incremental adverse impact of additional lockdowns and social distancing protocols in a number of our markets since late October. 
In summary, our 2021 guidance assumes an improving economy for the first half of the year and a stronger second half of the year with continued progress toward normalization. We are pleased with how well we are positioned as we enter 2021. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff."

So basically, what we're really trying to do is create an even more differentiated portal offering to our customer base by enhancing our existing value-added services with Google products and capabilities that exist in the market today. And then further, as we co-develop and innovate new products with Google, we'll obviously look to layer those into the portal environment as well. 
The nice thing about the portal environment is it's completely self-select. Our customers can choose what products and solutions they need to run and grow their business, and they'll be able to effectively determine the pricing outcome that they desire based on their need for products and services. 
So like anything else we do, there'll be different levels of availability to customers from lower end, very basic to mid-market, to higher-end complete sets that will have different price points associated with them. But end of day, the idea is our customers have the opportunity to self-select the products, services, capabilities and solutions they need to run and grow their businesses more effectively. And by working with Google, we expect to be able to innovate new products and capabilities that will be distinctive in the marketplace for them."

Maybe I'll start with just a little commentary about the expectations for the business, and I'll let Paul jump in with a few more of the details. 
So I would say, if you look at the business overall, given that North America represents about 70% of the merchant business globally, obviously, it's going to drive the lion's share of the outcome for the entire segment for the full year. And I would say we are looking for pretty good recoveries, obviously, in the payments and payroll business as well as the integrated business in the U.S. So I would say both of those would be towards the higher end of that targeted expectation that we have for the merchant business in aggregate. And as the vertical markets that we participate in continue to recover as well, we would expect our vertical market business to be towards the higher end of that range also, just given, obviously, the impacts on 2020 for that business as well as strong new sales performance that we saw in 2020 giving us good momentum kind of heading into 2021 as we start to lap the impacts of the pandemic. 
I think Europe, our expectations are a little more modest. They're probably in that kind of mid-teens range, just given some of the incremental impacts of new shutdowns and restrictions in the first part of the year in Europe, and maybe just a slightly more benign expectation around the recovery environment in Europe, particularly as it relates to cross-border throughout the course of 2021. 
And then I would say Asia has recovered reasonably well heading into the year. And I think we have pretty good expectations that Asia gets back to a fairly strong growth rate in the year; towards, again, the high end of that guidance range overall for 2021. 
So I think when you put it all together, we feel good about the mix of businesses we have and the overall expectation for mid- to high-teens growth for the full year. I would tell you, Bryan, that basically assumes kind of an ongoing gradual recovery from where we are today. We've seen results in January that are better than December, and we expect the recovery to continue to grind higher through the balance of the year such that by the time we're exiting '21, we expect domestic volumes to be more normalized. And obviously, we think cross-border is going to continue to lag slightly kind of heading into 2022, and that's consistent with the commercial card commentary that Paul provided in his script. 
So we're not expecting a heroic recovery as we think about the outlook for 2021. We expect a gradual recovery kind of throughout the year. We know it won't be linear. There'll be puts and takes as we continue to progress throughout the year. But by and large, expect a continued gradual recovery. And that's really what supports the overall merchant expectation for the year. 
Paul, I don't know if you'd add anything to that."

There's one, obviously, the co-sell relationship that we'll have with Google as it relates to our go-to-market strategy going forward. And obviously, being able to work with Google Cloud, co-sell solutions with them, having them refer business into us from a payment standpoint creates a strong new technology-enabled distribution stream that really, I think, augments and complements our existing go-to-market strategies very nicely. So we're delighted about that and think there's a lot that we can do together with Google to drive new revenue growth in the business through this cross-sell relationship. 
And then reflecting back a little bit on the comments that I made to Bryan's question. If you think about the business, these solutions will be delivered through our cloud-based digital portal that is in operation today and running in Google Cloud today. So the idea is as we continue to integrate new products and solutions and services into our digital portal, they will be available to our entire merchant base regardless of what distribution channel that merchant customer comes to us. So since it's all consolidated on the back end, those merchant customers will have the ability to access all of those value-added solutions and capabilities whether or not they're a traditional relationship-led customer coming through -- us through that channel or they're an integrated customer coming through us through an ISV relationship. And we think that's unique and distinctive to Global Payments, our ability to integrate those solutions and make them available through a digital portal to the entire suite of customers that we serve around the globe."

We kind of hit on it a little bit on the merchant side in the earlier question around kind of that phasing. And that same kind of concept kind of plays through to a large degree with other segments, particularly as it relates to the pre-pandemic comp in 1Q and then the pandemic comp going the other way in the second quarter and then kind of more normalized in the back half of the year. So clearly, that's the case in merchant. And that mid- to high-teens growth rate, as I said, kind of averages out between the first 2 quarters with those 2 impacts and then is pretty consistent for the back 2 quarters. 
On the issuing side, as we said, from a kind of organic standpoint, we start kind of that mid- to high-growth rate. And then we're going to actually look to be it or the low single digit as a reported matter. The only thing I would highlight there is we did not assume commercial card recovering throughout the year, so that's a headwind that plays itself out throughout the whole year. 
I would say we also have some -- in addition to just the pre-pandemic comps, we also have some headwinds as it relates to just credit transaction volumes in the issuing business year-over-year, as -- and we're seeing consistent with what the Visa numbers that they talked about for January. And as Cameron mentioned earlier, we did see improvement from January to December, but we still have some headwind on the transaction volume side and issuing that will play itself through the first quarter. 
And then on the business and consumer side, we kind of talked about it. We've got some tailwind as it relates to stimulus in the first quarter and then kind of more normalized, kind of that mid-single-digit growth rate that we talked about for the remaining 3 quarters. 
As it relates to expenses and margin, there isn't anything necessary on the expense side. Obviously, where -- we've done a really good job over the last 2 quarters of managing that expense rate to a pretty consistent year-over-year growth rate of roughly about 8%. And there's nothing I would necessarily highlight other than the variable expenses that come with that revenue that I would call out on the expense side. 
So obviously, we're very pleased to be in a position to yet again have a very impressive margin expansion as a consolidated matter. We did, as we said in our prepared remarks, have a much higher weighting of that margin expansion on the merchant side than we did this last year, but we still expect to have nice margin expansion in both issuing and business and consumer. And there wouldn't be necessarily anything on a quarterly basis I could call out there."

As we usually point out, we did almost $780 million of free cash flow just in the fourth quarter of 2020 and over $2 billion during the course of '20 in a pandemic-caused depression. So we feel pretty good about our ability to generate free cash flow. So I would say nothing has changed there. 
We are looking for revenue growth opportunities on our side because we've got plenty of earnings. And obviously, we've shown our ability to grow margin very substantially even at difficult macroeconomic environments in '20, and that's obviously our outlook for '21, too. So I don't think any of that's changed. These things aren't mutually exclusive. 
We've got plenty of firepower at 2.6x net leverage and $2 billion of free cash flow from last year to continue to make concurrent investments in ourselves, which we think is a good idea to do right now, just like we thought it was in October in our third quarter call. We've got the flexibility thankfully and the wherewithal to do both those things, and that's what we'll continue doing."

That continues to be true today, and that's going to be true tomorrow. 
So having more scale in a scale business is always a good idea. I think we've shown this with Heartland. I think we've shown it with TSYS partnership. So I don't think having scale in a technology business is really ever going to go out of favor. I think the proof's in the pudding, and you saw that in 2020, right? Double-digit earnings growth in the fourth quarter coming out of the depression while the networks are shrinking. I don't think you have to look further than that to realize that, that was a good idea. 
So I think at the end of day, those type of scale economies will drive further consolidation. But it's not just consolidation for consolidation's sake. I think the reasons in part that we look for further scale opportunities is to make more investments back in our businesses. If you look at the areas that are growing most quickly for us during the pandemic, look at our omnichannel business, which accelerated, again, to the high teens in the fourth quarter of '20, which, by the way, Google is going onto, under our UCP product. Look at our integrated business, which showed absolute growth in the fourth quarter and for the year. Those are businesses -- and of course, our software businesses, which did as well in certain of their vertical markets like AdvancedMD. Those are all businesses where we've made very substantial investments in over the last number of years. We couldn't make those investments worldwide as we're doing if we didn't have the scale in the first place. 
So listen, my own view on the -- in the business is we need to continue to invest in those areas that we think are ripe for future growth. We never could have pivoted this quickly to omnichannel, to safer commerce if we hadn't had those on the product development board in the first place and if we didn't have the access to capital that we do from our own free cash flow, right, to continue to make those investments. So in those contexts, obviously, additional scale makes sense. But very similar to the response, Darrin, because he has a very similar question, to Ashwin, at the end of the day, none of that changes the strategy really that we've been running the company with over the last 7-plus years, which is to say focus on the 3 prongs at the end of the day: software partnership and ownership, omnichannel acceptance and delivery and on the most attractive markets. 
So the nice thing about 2020 with all the challenges it threw at every one of us was that it really validated all things that we've been talking about. If we can find future transactions or partnerships that align with the 3 things that we've been talking about since 2013, then, of course, scale in a scale business is going to be a good idea. So I think we view '20 and the recent events as really just the validation of all the stuff that we've been talking about. If we can find further ways to accelerate those investments, then we will."

Maybe I'll jump in on that one, and I'll ask Jeff or Paul to chime in as well if they'd like to add anything. So maybe if I just step back and look at it from a macro standpoint in terms of overall net new sales performance for the year, I think it's pretty easy to say that we're delighted with the outcome, particularly given the backdrop that we were executing against for the full year. 
So just a few highlights that I would share. One, Heartland for the year had new sales growth year-over-year relative to 2019 despite the pandemic, which I think speaks volumes to our relationship-led managers' ability to go out and generate new business even in a really difficult environment. And obviously, they've been very creative and nimble in terms of how they've been able to do that. So Heartland grew net sales in 2020 notwithstanding the pandemic environment. 
Integrated exceeded our budgeted new sales forecast for the year by a pretty meaningful amount, an excellent new sales year for our integrated business. New partner production was also about 140% of our budget. So not only did we see good, strong new sales of merchants, we saw good new business development and partner production in that channel as well. 
And then in some of the vertical market businesses, AdvancedMD grew bookings 15% year-over-year. Our Xenial SaaS solution was up 20% year-over-year. TouchNet had new sales performance that was pretty consistent with '19, again, notwithstanding the fact that many university and campuses were closed for much of the year with the beginning of the pandemic. So that just gives you a few ideas. 
Canada was up 20% in new sales year-over-year. So from a new sales execution standpoint, I think our performance was exemplary in 2020. And I'm really delighted with the teams and what they were able to accomplish given the backdrop. 
I think the most important thing is we grew net MID count globally in 2020. So notwithstanding all the concerns around the SMB markets and all the concerns about small business failure, we grew MID count year-over-year, which is a good accomplishment in any market, in any environment, but a particularly good outcome in 2020 given the backdrop. 
So we feel very good about the health of the underlying portfolios that we are managing. We feel very good about the diversification of the businesses that we have, the vertical markets exposures we have. To Jeff's point in his script, we are diverse by design. Obviously, we've put a lot of effort into making sure that we have a merchant business in particular that has a good mix of credit exposure, that is not taking undue credit risk, is well diversified across geographies, verticals, types of underlying merchant customers. 
And I think that has helped us to have a more -- relatively more resilient sort of performance over the course of 2020. And I think we exited the year at a pretty good place and have a lot of confidence heading into 2021 that the expectations we've set forth today are achievable, and we feel good about delivering against those. As I said earlier, January was better than December for us in our merchant business and very much consistent with our expectations. It gives us confidence, at least 1 month into the year, that we're in a good trajectory to get to the outcomes we've provided today."

813574,701609602,2198227,"Global Payments Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 08, 2021",2021-02-08,"Earnings Calls","Global Payments Inc.","Executives","Yes, Lisa. It's Jeff. I'll start, and I'm sure Cameron will add. It's an excellent question. So both businesses, both TSYS and Global Payments have had historical relationships with each of Amazon and Google for many years. So I think we've had a first-",635,"Yes, Lisa. It's Jeff. I'll start, and I'm sure Cameron will add. It's an excellent question. 
So both businesses, both TSYS and Global Payments have had historical relationships with each of Amazon and Google for many years. So I think we've had a first-row seat as to what those companies look like. We have a lot of respect for each. 
So why don't I start with AWS? So our issuer folks have worked with them for a number of years as part of their modernization initiatives. We've been very, very happy with them. 
I think you have to realize that it's a slightly different proposition that we're undertaking in the issuer versus merchant. So on the issuer side, it's technology modernization and transformation really at the same time, which is to say that code is going from more of a legacy code into cloud-enabled where it probably is today and then into cloud-native ultimately while it's being lifted and shifted over to a cloud-hosted environment. 
So in the case of Google hub -- or on the merchant side, we're really already there. Our businesses are really either cloud-enabled or cloud-native already in their own rights. So the Google proposition is a little bit different on the technology side. It's more of a shift rather than a lift and shift in the case of the merchant business. 
I would say in the case of each, the go-to-market proposition though is very similar. We think AWS has a very distinctive and strong proposition among financial institution issuers. You can look up a lot of folks that they announced recently going to AWS cloud. But we've had -- as we said in our prepared remarks, we had very good experience already, with 1 announced win, and I think 3 to 4 we said are already mid- to high probabilities in the pipeline and probably another 4 or 5 that are lower probabilities but also in the pipeline on the co-sell with AWS in the issuer environment. So we view AWS, and I think it's been proven so far in our experience today, as having fantastic technologies, which we knew for a long time, but also having terrific distribution into the FI segment. 
Google, of course, has very many of the same things, but we view the Google co-sell more on the merchant side here, which is what Cameron was talking about, too. And really, there's 2 pieces there that are also unique. So in the case of AWS, that's a unique co-sell in FI land. In the case of Google, it's unique co-sell into merchant land. 
And on the merchant side, it's really 2 pieces, as Cameron's articulated, with Google. The first one really is embedding their products and services uniquely into our already live merchant portal, which, by the way, is already resonant for Global Payments and has been for years in the Google Cloud already, right? So we already have that. We're just blending their products into our merchant cloud environment more seamlessly. 
And then the second piece, similar to AWS, is co-sale, meaning there's actual quota at the Google level for Google sales reps to sell our products and services into the Google base. And we also have that ability of selling Google's products and services into our portal-like environment, which Cameron described some time ago. Very similar to what we're doing with AWS, right? There's quota on their sales reps selling on the FI base. So while I would say that they're very similar in the sense of contract, they're a bit different when you think about their target, issuer versus merchant; and when you think about the nature of the lift and shift that's really going on in the case of the AWS side and the Google side is more of a shift."

I'd just add a couple of things on that, particularly as it relates to the Google partnership, just building on Jeff's commentary. 
So first of all, as Jeff noted, we have a very long history with Google. We know them in the merchant business extraordinarily well. They've been a terrific partner to us, and we expect them to be, obviously, a fantastic partner going forward. 
I think what struck me most as we thought about the opportunity is just the shared vision that we both have as it relates to helping merchant customers do a couple of things. One is drive top-of-funnel opportunities for their business with new products and capability and innovation, particularly digitally, that will help do that for merchant customers, particularly in an environment where they need that now more than ever. And then secondly, delivering products and capabilities that help businesses run more efficiently and more effectively. And I think what Google Payments -- excuse me, Global Payments and what Google has tried to accomplish are really geared towards those elements of supporting merchant customers. 
And then lastly, we have very shared visions around innovation and those things that we can do, again, that are going to help drive more customers through our customers' businesses while, at the same time, again, helping them to run their businesses more effectively. And although we're starting with Google My Business, Workspace and Ads, integrating that into our portal environment, we hope to add omnichannel ordering and search, service appointment availability, inventory, those types of solutions as well, again, trying to create a more distinctive, holistic offering of value-added services through our digital portal that we think will be, again, differentiated in the market for Global Payments, but more importantly, will really help our customers, again, to run and grow their businesses effectively."

We delivered our best performance since the end of 2019 because of our focus on technology enablement coupled with excellence in execution. Our results demonstrated strong sequential momentum from the fourth quarter of 2020 and improved monthly throughout the first quarter of 2021. We are encouraged by the overall run rates we are seeing in the business. We exited the first quarter in a better position than we entered it. 
We are delighted to have to return to growth in the first quarter of 2021. We were able to deliver revenue, margin and earnings per share growth despite facing difficult year-over-year comparisons as the pandemic did not begin to impact our business until mid-March 2020. None of this would have been possible without the dedication of our exceptional team members, and we thank them for their commitment to our customers, our communities and each other. 
And we continue to expand our competitive moat. We are pleased today to announce 2 strategic acquisitions for approximately $1 billion in total that further our software-driven, technology-enabled strategy and deepen our presence in the most attractive markets globally. We expect to continue to gain market share and extend our lead. 
In combination with the roughly $1 billion in share repurchases we've effected since returning to our capital allocation strategy at the end of last year, we continue to balance appropriately reinvestment in the future growth of our business with efficient return of capital. 
First, with our agreement to acquire Zego, we enter one of the largest and most attractive vertical markets worldwide. Real estate is the quintessence of the type of market that we seek, sizable, global in scope, fragmented and ripe for further software, digital commerce and payments penetration. And COVID-19 has accelerated the underlying changes that make this $6.5 billion target addressable market so attractive. 
Zego is a leading software and payment technology company with significant scale, delivering a comprehensive real estate technology platform to 7,300 customers, representing more than 11 million residential units in the United States. Zego's digital omnichannel solutions support property managers and residents throughout the real estate life cycle, from leasing and onboarding, to work orders, utility management, resident communications, renewals, offboarding, and, of course, payments. Through its integrated payments offering, Zego processes approximately $30 billion in payments annually in a market with a volume opportunity that exceeds $1 trillion. The company delivers its full value stack through a cloud-native SaaS platform to enable seamless digital property management and best-in-class resident engagement and omnichannel experiences. It is a highly scalable and predictable flywheel with compelling recurring revenue, strong retention rates, booking trends and lifetime customer value returns with double-digit organic revenue growth. 
Importantly, we have significant opportunities to accelerate Zego's growth. We intend to leverage Global Payments' scale and digital expertise to further payments penetration into Zego's base, generate incremental property and software partner referrals to our more than 3,500 sales and sales support professionals, expand its footprint outside the United States and generate meaningful cross-selling opportunities into its vertical market, including innovative products we already deliver into our merchant business, like payroll, data and analytics and reputation management. We could not be more excited about further capitalizing on the convergence of software and payments, and we look forward to welcoming Zego team members to Global Payments. 
Second, we are excited to have reached an agreement through our Erste joint venture to purchase Worldline's PAYONE business in Austria, consisting of roughly 8,000 primarily SMB merchant customers in Erste Bank's home market. 
We entered Austria through organic market expansion of our Continental European joint venture roughly 18 months ago. This pending acquisition enables us to bring our distinctive distribution and market-leading technologies at scale to yet another attractive market. 
In addition to these strategic accomplishments in early 2021, we also produced a solid first quarter results across our existing businesses. 
First, in our merchant segment, we delivered significant sequential improvement fueled by our technology-enabled focus and the conversion of last year's share and bookings gains into revenue. And we generated these results while absorbing ongoing lockdowns in Canada and renewed restrictions in selected markets in Europe and Asia Pacific. 
Some highlights in the first quarter of 2021 include: record new sales in our Global Payments Integrated business in March and in our U.S. relationship-led business for the quarter; record revenue growth at GPI for the quarter well in excess of pre-pandemic levels; record bookings at Xenial for a cloud-based restaurant POS software and solutions; and continued sequential acceleration in our omnichannel businesses. It is worth highlighting that volumes accelerated throughout the quarter. That trend that has continued into April. Key customer wins include Subway, CKE Restaurants, A&W Foods and Bojangles. 
It's also notable that several of these businesses that were most impacted by COVID-19 saw substantial sequential growth in revenue and bookings in the first quarter as our home market enter recovery. For example, active and gaming achieved significant improvement as better macro trends, strong execution and solid bookings over the course of 2020 benefited performance in 2021. In fact, we have continued to see positive booking trends across our software portfolio as the ability to deliver a full value stack is increasingly becoming table stakes in the markets we serve. 
We also made considerable progress on the partnership with Google that we announced in February. We expect to board Google as a merchant customer in select Asian markets in the third quarter, with North America 
[Audio Gap] 
Google Solutions with our innovative capabilities in our digital portal environment in the fourth quarter of this year. And we have launched our co-innovation efforts to develop new commerce enablement tools for our merchant customers. 
Second, our issuer business continues to benefit from strong relationships with market leaders, and we are excited to announce today that we have entered into a multiyear renewal with Barclays Consumer Bank in the United States. Barclays is one of our largest customers globally, and we provide a range of processing and support technologies for both Barclays consumer and commercial credit card portfolios. We look forward to working with Barclays to enable a best-in-class customer experience with unparalleled levels of security and resiliency for its newest partner, the gap in its portfolio of accounts, yet another competitive takeaway. Partnering with issuers that are gaining share in the marketplace is a key element of our strategy. 
We were also pleased to have signed agreements with Mission Lane and UMB financial, with the latter being a competitive takeaway in which with the prior processing relationship had spanned decades. In collaboration with AWS, UMB will adopt our cloud-based data and analytics platform, which we also successfully deployed during the quarter for a multi-country customer in Latin America. 
We continue to capitalize on the broad and deep pipeline we have the good fortune to have in our issuer business. Today, we have 12 letters of intent with financial institutions worldwide, 6 of which are competitive takeaways. 
Turning to AWS. We expect to go live with our first [ joint ] takeaway with a multinational financial institution in Asia by the end of the year. Our cloud prime instance is now up and running currently in that market in preparation for the launch. We have another dozen active customers in our pipeline of AWS, up from 4 at the end of 2020. 
Third, our business and consumer segment delivered record revenue growth. I am very proud that Netspend once again facilitated the rapid distribution of stimulus funds to customers most in need. Since late December 2020, we have processed more than 2 million deposits, accounting for over $3.5 billion in stimulus payments disbursed by the IRS to American consumers. And this was done days in advance of many of our traditional financial institutions and financial and technology peers. In combination with the 2020 stimulus payments, we have disbursed more than $5 billion in aid to customers through the first quarter of 2021. 
The pandemic-accelerated move to our cash flow solutions is also benefiting Netspend. For example, we are seeing rapid adoption of our [ PIPS ] solution, and we reached a new agreement with Flynn Restaurant Group for its Pizza Hut and Wendy's franchise locations which will drive additional pay card and potential tips opportunities across a combined footprint of more than 1,000 restaurants. 
We also launched our cashless Stadium Card linked to a digital wallet with the Phoenix Suns at the Phoenix Suns Arena. These achievements serve as proof points of our differentiated strategy that includes product extensions into the P2P, B2B and B2C segments. 
I could not be more pleased with all that we accomplished across our businesses this quarter. In March, we returned the year-over-year growth in each of our 3 segments, and the underlying trajectories are tracking for our longer-term goals, just as we predicted they would, despite the impact of ongoing restrictions and lockdowns in some of our markets outside the United States.

We are pleased with our financial performance in the first quarter of 2021, which demonstrated meaningful sequential momentum and reflected our ongoing strong execution across the business.

We are pleased with our financial performance in the first quarter of 2021, which demonstrated meaningful sequential momentum and reflected our ongoing strong execution across the business. Specifically, we delivered adjusted net revenue of $1.81 billion, representing 5% growth compared to the prior year and marking an 800 basis point improvement relative to the performance we reported in the fourth quarter of 2020. 
Adjusted operating margin for the first quarter was 40.6%, a 160 basis point improvement from the prior year that was achieved despite the return of certain costs we temporarily reduced at the onset of the pandemic. On a comparable basis, underlying margin trends would have improved approximately 300 basis points. 
Adjusted earnings per share were $1.82 for the quarter, an increase of 15% compared to the prior year period and was especially impressive in light of the difficult year-on-year comparison due to COVID-19. The pandemic did not begin to impact our business meaningfully until the second half of March of last year. And as a reminder, we delivered 18% adjusted earnings per share growth in the first quarter of 2020. 
Taking a closer look at our performance by segment. Merchant Solutions achieved adjusted net revenue of $1.15 billion for the first quarter, a 4.4% improvement from the prior year which marked a nearly 900 basis point improvement from the fourth quarter. We delivered an adjusted operating margin of 46.3% in this segment, an increase of 90 basis points from the same period in 2020 as we continue to benefit from our improving technology-enabled business mix. 
Global Payments Integrated produced a stellar quarter, generating in excess of 20% adjusted net revenue improvement, which is ahead of the levels of growth this business was delivering pre pandemic. Additionally, our worldwide e-commerce and omnichannel businesses, excluding T&E, delivered roughly 20% growth as our value proposition that seamlessly spans both the physical and virtual worlds continues to resonate with customers. 
As for our own software portfolio, we are encouraged to see that several of our businesses most impacted by the pandemic improved meaningfully sequentially, as Jeff mentioned. And it is worth highlighting that our gaming business returned to growth this quarter. And across our vertical markets portfolio, bookings continued to prove resilient in the first quarter, providing us with a positive tailwind for the balance of 2021. 
We are also pleased that our U.S. relationship-led business generated high single-digit adjusted net revenue growth for the first quarter which is consistent with our long-term targeted growth rate for this channel despite a difficult comparison to the first quarter of 2020. 
And notwithstanding a challenging environment in several of our international markets, our portfolio of businesses across Europe and Asia improved significantly and delivered adjusted net revenue that was essentially flat with last year for the quarter. Importantly, because our international businesses are largely focused on domestic spending in the markets in which we operate, we are seeing improvement in these businesses well in advance of cross-border commerce recovering. 
Moving to Issuer Solutions. We delivered $439 million in adjusted net revenue for the first quarter, which was roughly flat versus the prior year period and exceeded our expectations given traditional fourth quarter to first quarter sequential trends. Excluding the commercial card business, our issuer segment grew in the low single digits for the quarter. And in the month of March, issuer delivered growth in aggregate despite continued commercial card headwinds as we benefited from the ongoing recovery in transaction volumes across many of our markets. We also saw nonvolume-based revenue increased mid-single digits in the first quarter. 
Notably, our issuer business achieved record first quarter adjusted operating income, and adjusted segment operating margin expanded 370 basis points from the prior year, also reaching a new first quarter record of 43.2% as we continue to benefit from our efforts to drive efficiencies in the business. 
Additionally, our issuer team signed 3 long-term contract extensions and 3 new contracts since the start of the year, and our strong pipeline bodes well for future performance, consistent with our long-term expectations. 
Finally, our Business and Consumer Solutions segment delivered record adjusted net revenue of $244 million, representing growth of nearly 20% from the prior year. Gross dollar volume increased 26% or $2.5 billion as we benefited from the stimulus we dispersed to our customers. Trends within our DDA products were also very strong, helped by the stimulus, and we realized an acceleration in active account growth of more than 45% compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of stimulus payments and tax, we believe that this business achieved underlying growth in the roughly mid single-digit range, in line with our long-term targets. 
Adjusted operating margin for this segment improved an impressive 750 basis points to a record 33.2% as the benefits of the stimulus and long-term cost initiatives post merger took effect. 
The solid performance we delivered across our segments highlights the resiliency of our technology-enabled portfolio, consistency of our execution and the strong tailwinds in our business coming out of the pandemic. We are also pleased that our integration continues to progress well, and we remain on track to achieve our increased goals from the TSYS merger of annual run rate expense synergies of at least $400 million and annual run rate revenue synergies of at least $150 million within 3 years. 
From a cash flow standpoint, we generated adjusted first quarter free cash flow of roughly $583 million after reinvesting $86 million in capital expenditures. We expect adjusted free cash flow of more than $2 billion and capital expenditures to be in the $500 million to $600 million range for the full year. 
In mid-February, we successfully issued $1.1 billion in senior unsecured notes maturing in 2026 at an attractive interest rate of 1.2%. The transaction was credit-neutral, with the proceeds used to redeem $750 million of notes outstanding with a rate of 3.8% due in April 2021. The balance of the proceeds were used to reduce our outstanding revolver. We have no significant maturities until 2023. 
Our strong cash generation and healthy balance sheet have enabled us to create significant value through our capital allocation strategy to the benefit of our shareholders. 
We are pleased to have repurchased roughly 4 million of our shares for approximately $783 million during the first quarter, which includes the execution of the $500 million accelerated share repurchase program we announced last quarter. 
We ended the quarter with roughly $3 billion of liquidity and a leverage position of roughly 2.6x on a net debt basis. 
And we are excited to announce that we have reached agreements to make additional investments in our technology-enabled strategy and market expansion. As Jeff highlighted, we executed a definitive agreement to acquire Zego and Worldline's PAYONE business in Austria for an aggregate of approximately $1 billion. We expect to finance these transactions using cash on hand and our existing credit facility. We are targeting closing the Zego transaction by the end of the second quarter and the Worldline acquisition in the second half of 2021, both subject to regulatory approvals. 
Upon completion of both transactions, given our current cash balance and strong cash generation, we expect our leverage position will be relatively consistent with current levels, leaving us with ample continuing firepower. 
Based on our current expectations for continued recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide, we have increased our guidance for adjusted net revenue to now be in a range of $7.55 billion to $7.625 billion, reflecting growth of 12% to 13% over 2020. 
We expect adjusted operating margin expansion of up to 250 basis points compared to 2020 levels. This outlook is consistent with an adjusted operating margin expansion of up to 450 basis points on a normalized basis given the operating leverage in our business and expense synergy actions related to the TSYS merger. However, this is being partially offset by the reinstatement of certain expenses in 2021 that were temporarily reduced at the onset of COVID-19 for most of 2020. 
At the segment level, we have increased our expectations for adjusted net revenue growth for our Merchant Solutions segment to be in the high teens, which assumes the current pace of recovery continues worldwide. 
We expect underlying trends in our issuing business to be in the mid to high single-digit range and above our mid single-digit growth target. It is worth noting that our issuer business generated high single-digit growth on a normalized basis for the month of March as we began to lap the pandemic impact. 
As we discussed last quarter, issuer is being impacted by 2 distinct and relatively equal sized headwinds. First, we are not anticipating a recovery in our commercial card business as we expect corporate travel to remain depressed throughout 2021. Second, we are absorbing a portfolio sale by one of our customers which will impact us for the remainder of the year. Taking these 2 items into account, we forecast our issuer business to deliver adjusted net revenue growth in the low single-digit range for the year. 
Lastly, incorporating the benefits of the incremental March stimulus, we are now forecasting adjusted net revenue growth for our business and consumer segment to be in the mid- to high-single digits for the full year, consistent with our long-term expectations for this business. This guidance takes into account lapping the benefits of the 2020 CARES Act, which will provide for a more difficult comparison in the second quarter of 2021. 
Regarding segment margins, we expect the up to 250 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement for the total company to be driven largely by Merchant Solutions, while we expect issuer and business and consumer to deliver normalized margin expansion consistent with the underlying profiles of these businesses. This follows the 500 and 400 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion delivered by issuer and business and consumer, respectively, in 2020. 
From a quarterly phasing perspective, having now lapped muted growth characteristics in the first quarter given the start of the pandemic in mid-March 2020, we will experience the opposite effect in the second quarter before returning to more normalized rates of growth in the back half of the year. I highlight that while we expect to achieve our strongest adjusted revenue growth, adjusted margin expansion and adjusted earnings per share growth for the total company in the second quarter, our business and consumer segment will be lapping the impact of the CARES Act stimulus last year. While we anticipate Netspend to deliver modest adjusted net revenue growth for the second quarter, we expect adjusted operating margins to decline for that segment year-on-year as a result. On an absolute basis, we would expect business and consumer adjusted operating margins for the second quarter to be consistent with the levels achieved in the fourth quarter of 2020, a period that also saw more limited benefits from stimulus. 
Moving to nonoperating items. We continue to expect net interest expense to be slightly lower in 2021 relative to 2020, but we anticipate our adjusted tax rate will be relatively consistent with last year. 
Putting it all together, we now have increased our expected adjusted earnings per share for the full year to a range of $7.87 to $8.07, reflecting growth of 23% to 26% over 2020. Our raised outlook presumes we remain on a path toward recovery worldwide over the balance of the year, and it does not include any impact from the Zego and Worldline Austrian business acquisitions we announced today. We will further update our guidance when these transactions close, but it is worth noting now that we do not expect these transactions to have a discernible impact on adjusted earnings per share for 2021. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff."

It's Jeff, and I'll start and maybe Cameron and Paul will join me thereafter. It's hard to say with any certainty because we've had the integrated business now at legacy Global Payments for probably 8.5 years. But I would say that our Global Payments Integrated business just delivered its best quarter ever from a revenue point of view, and that's especially noteworthy when we haven't lapped the majority in the first quarter of '21, the majority of the rollover from the first quarter of '20. So I think what you're really seeing in the integrated business is the solid bookings growth, the new partner additions that we saw last year really flowing into revenue, and I think we have [ applied on that ] business really just right. So we can't be more pleased with our team on integrated. 
I'd say on the omnichannel business, really pretty much the same thing. Our business accelerated sequentially in the first quarter of '21 relative to the fourth quarter of '20 and grew absolutely at the rate [indiscernible] 20% year-over-year, again without lapping the pandemic pretty much from the first quarter -- from the first quarter of '20. So we feel really good about that performance as well. So we couldn't be more pleased. 
Listen, our home market in the United States, it's 70% to 75% of of the company. You really have to go, and you're pointing about the rest of geographies and the rest of the market, you really have to go kind of country-by-country to see what's happening. I would say we do see areas of growth in Asia Pacific, but, of course, India and Philippines are more difficult, as I'm sure [indiscernible] been reading about the difficult -- the terrible situation in India. Canada, really, at the end of the quarter and really post the quarter, has enacted pretty strict lockdowns. But that's probably about 3% or 4% of the company, Andrew, just to kind of quantify what the size of that market is. And in Europe, it's really a mixed bag. I would say our business in Spain domestically is growing at very high rates. Notwithstanding broader macro issues across the European Union, the U.K. has really started to recover. But there are other markets, like in Continental Europe and our Czech Republic business, of course, we announced the deal today with Erste Bank, but that market also remains under substantial lockdown. 
So listen, I think the good news for us is we're growing right through it. We did mention today that active and gaming in some of our markets here in the United States have recovered pretty substantially. They still present some headwinds relative to the rate of growth that we just announced today, but to be able to show 900 basis points of sequential expansion from the fourth to the first quarter of '21 in our merchant business, I think is one of the most noteworthy things of today. Cameron and Paul, you guys want to add to that?"

The only other point I would make, just to top that off, Andrew, is just as it relates to new sales. In both of those businesses that you highlighted, in particular, integrated and omni, continue to be very, very strong. 
In our e-com business here in the U.S. market, our e-com sales were up something like 330% year-over-year, so clearly demonstrating that the trends we've seen around consumer buying patterns as well as merchant adoption of omnichannel and e-commerce capabilities continues to be quite strong, even a year after, obviously, the onset of the pandemic. So we think that's a very positive sign as it relates to the future growth of the e-com and omni business. 
And then on the integrated front, again, our new sales in the quarter were 120% of our target, up something like 120% kind of year-over-year. So again, we're seeing great momentum in the business continuing as we enter the second quarter as well. 
So as Jeff highlighted, I think the strong new bookings and new sales performance we saw last year clearly contributed to the performance in Q1, and we -- it's nice to see that, that same execution has continued into 2021 as well."

So it's still a majority payments today, but the software elements of the business are growing more rapidly, and I would expect over time that they will flip and become the majority of the business long term. 
So it's about $30 billion of payment volume today. It's a very healthy portfolio from a payment standpoint. The nice thing about the business is it's not that penetrated within its existing customer base from a payments perspective. And obviously, the ability to cross-sell software into that base of existing partners today as well as to take Global Payments software and sell into that environment with our own value-added services drive some meaningful revenue tailwinds, we think, for the business in the future."

So let me just start by saying by kind of not answering the question, but I do want to call out our relationship-led businesses. So they also had a very good quarter. So we produced high single-digit growth in our relationship-led businesses compared to the first quarter of '20, for which 85% in the first quarter of '20 had no pandemic. So I want to call that out. 
As we also said in our prepared remarks, we had record new sales in our relationship-led businesses in the first quarter of '21, again, coming out of pandemic. So I don't want to lose sight of that before we address your question more directly. 
Second, as it relates to your question, look, I don't think consumers are going to go backward. I don't think people are going to say, I want to spend more time online. Where can we find the ATM to get more cash? There is no bull market for cash. I think what we've seen that pandemic do is accelerate 3 to 5 years behavioral change on the consumer side. 
Cameron just went a minute ago, in response to Andrew's question, the bookings growth in our e-comm, omni businesses, which is extraordinary, again, not lapping the pandemic for the first quarter of 2020. 
So listen, I think at the end of the day, in my opinion, the answer to your question is, I just don't see the trends of safer commerce, [indiscernible] commerce, omnichannel acceptance, I don't see folks moving backwards. I think it's going to accelerate the underlying trends that we've seen over time. 
I'd also say relative to kind of credit-debit mix, I don't see that changing either. The only time that we've really seen debit cannibalized credit was back in the early '09 recession when credit was really tapped. So all that was left is debit. We really haven't seen that here. I do think you'll see alternative means of payment, of course, in Europe, where I know you're focused in particularly. We've got assets, account-to-account transactions. We've got real-time payments, that kind of thing. Of course, we've got afterpay and those types of installment payment plans, which I think we're a market leader in, both in our issuing business and our acquiring business. 
So I think there may be mix changes in terms of how people actually pay for things, but I don't think we're going to see debit cannibalized credit like we saw in '08, we have not seen that really throughout the pandemic, and I don't see people kind of going backwards on convenience of use."

So I would say, on balance, I would think it's probably easier to monetize the payment opportunity in the real estate space. There's obviously secular trends there that we think are very powerful around the digitization of the payment stream within real estate, whether it's recurring monthly rental payments, HOA fees or other one-off fees that lessees need to pay. So we think the opportunity to drive better penetration from a payment standpoint in that market is going to be easier than some of the other vertical markets we've been in. I think we view real estate really as the quintessential vertical market, where you have the intersection of software and [ drain ] payments where that nexus is very strong and obviously creates a significant opportunity for us to drive meaningful growth and share gains and, obviously, margin expansion over a period of time. 
We expect the business, to your second question, to generate roughly $100 million of revenue in 2021. It's growing double digits nicely. It sort of fits the rule of 40 for a software business very nicely today.

The second reason, as we had outlined before when we said that we expected that positive decoupling to occur once things got to a much more kind of normalized basis, the only other thing I would highlight is, as you look at that overall revenue growth number, do recall that we have probably 300 basis points of headwind related to those 3 vertical market businesses that are still, while they've improved from the depths of the pandemic and we highlighted gaming as being now an absolute grower, we're still seeing some meaningful headwind related to the active school business and the gaming business, that if you kind of looked at it ex those, you kind of add 300 basis points to the overall growth rate.

So even more decoupling than I think the sort of highlights represent. 
And the other thing I would say is, over time, I expect that decoupling continue partially because our international businesses are more exposed to domestic trends in those markets. So as those markets reopen, we're not as reliant upon the cross-border volume to drive revenue growth in those businesses. As domestic markets reopen internationally, we'll obviously see a nice tailwind as a result of that."

It's Cameron, and then I'll ask Paul maybe to jump in with a little bit more color as well. 
So I would say, maybe to start, even well before the pandemic, we've been equipping our sales professionals around the globe with the best technology, the best capabilities to be able to sell. And obviously, we think that paid meaningful dividends through the course of the pandemic in our ability to continue to sell at very strong levels, notwithstanding, obviously, the impact of the pandemic. And I think partly a credit to our sales teams in particular, they found new and innovative ways to continue to sell in a difficult environment. In particular our relationship-led sales professionals here in the U.S. market that really operate under a commission only model, they were very motivated and incentivized to go out and find greater ways to be able to sell into the marketplace. So the use of technology and deploying more technology towards the sales process itself as well as the ingenuity, I would say, of our sales professionals, I don't expect that to change post pandemic. And I think a lot of the lessons we've learned through this process will allow us to continue to be very effective and very productive from a new sales point of view as a go-forward matter. 
I'll call out a few particular highlights on the first quarter bookings performance, and I'll ask Paul maybe to jump in. 
If I start with our U.S. relationship-led business, we had a record sales quarter, as Jeff and Paul highlighted in the prepared remarks. It was about 5% higher than our old record and up about 27% year-over-year, which I think is a really important metric as well, given that, again, kind of the 12 weeks of the first quarter of 2020 were really not impacted by the pandemic. So very strong performance from a new sales point. Again, with particular strength in our e-commerce, Bill Pay, Text buy Pay Solutions within our relationship-led channel. 
We also had great new booking performance in our payroll business as well. We had record sales in that business, up again 42% year-over-year. So very strong performance in our U.S. relationship-led payments and payroll business in the first quarter. 
Integrated, as I mentioned previously, they were above plan and well above last year's new sales performance and bookings performance in the first quarter as well. 
Within our vertical market business, we saw very strong, I'd say, booking trends across the business. TouchNet had record first quarter bookings performance, which I think is a very good sign as it relates to the university environment heading into the fall. 
We actually started to see some falling of new sales in our schools business, our lower school K-12. We had 3 significant new wins in the quarter from a new sales point of view. Obviously, we're still waiting and relying upon kids getting back in through K-12 environment for that business to recover fully. But obviously, it was encouraging to see new sales begin to fall in that business in the first quarter as well. 
And we also had record bookings in our enterprise SaaS QSR business in the first quarter as well. So again, good trends across the board, I would say, in our vertical market business. 
If we look internationally, again, despite the macro environment being challenging in some of the markets that we operate in, I would characterize new sales performance across the board internationally and sort of aggregating a bunch of different markets there. It was above plan for the first quarter above last year. Canada, for example, was up 40% year-over-year. 
So again, the trend of new booking performance being very strong, continued well into the first quarter and thus far in the second quarter as well. Paul, I don't know if you'd add any detail."

Can you just touch on what's implied or what's embedded in the guide outlook in terms of macro assumptions from here on out? Just looks like the trends and the current trajectory should allow for potentially more upside than you even raised so far. So just really where are you keeping some elements of conservatism in the outlook versus including some things?"

And we continue to -- while we're very optimistic about the future and very pleased with the results, we also want to kind of see how things play out as it relates to particularly around the world where we have different kind of dynamics playing around the different geographies. 
But we've said before and it's still true, the top end of the range is not perfection. It does not assume any type of -- just kind of some massive kind of kick back to normal. But instead, a grind back to normal, with the third and fourth quarter kind of being a much more normal kind of -- or more normal environment. 
I would say as it relates to just March, we were very pleased with the kind of overall growth rates that we saw in March, and those were sequentially better on a monthly basis than, obviously, what we saw in February and January and particularly, some kind of more normalized kind of growth rate there. But that's the way I always frame it from an overall standpoint. Cameron, do you have anything to add on that?"

But obviously, we're targeting well north of 70%, 25% of the company. Think about just directionally up from 60 last summer where we'd like to be longer term. And that's percentage of revenue, which means the vast majority of the growth, by definition, is coming from those areas. So we're really pleased. 
Our pipeline is full, and that includes a whole array of things, post Zego, post PAYONE, our pipeline remains full. It includes more software assets in it. So time will tell if we get those over the finish line. But I think you're directionally right in where we're going. 
I'll start with AWS and Cameron can comment on Google. Look, we couldn't have been more pleased with our relationship with AWS. We're absolutely on track for all the things that we outlined last August. We announced the relationship in the first place that stuff sells, we talked today about UNB, competitive takeaway, client somebody else for 3 decades. They're going to be our first instance in data and analytics in the cloud jointly with AWS. The Asian Bank we've referred to now, that testing environment is live, we'll be live in a year, another competitive takeaway. And I think what we said in our prepared remarks is we tripled the number of LOIs jointly with Amazon there initiated stages today versus where we were at year-end of '20. So I think you're right to say that we're firing in all cylinders there, and we really couldn't be more pleased with the transition we've made there to cloud environment.

We're already in the midst of having conversations with a variety of medium- to enterprise-sized customers who are leveraging Google Cloud services today.

One, what stimulus have as it relates to our business in consumer business. And then the second, as it relates to stimulus across really all 3 of our segments. 
As it relates to stimulus in our business and consumer, it is a piece and the driving piece around us as it relates to our overall revenue outlook for that segment of moving to that kind of from mid-single digits kind of mid to mid to high. So that's kind of -- you want to try to kind of quantify the impact of additional stimulus net of the effect that stimulus has on other products, on yield, the overall tax season picture, so that gives you kind of a quantification of kind of that difference between kind of mid single-digit growth for that business in that kind of more mid to high kind of single-digit growth as it relates to just a revenue matter. And we've obviously kind of talked about the margin impact. You saw what we had for marginal impact in the first quarter. And then obviously that will play through in the second quarter the other direction as we grow over the stimulus in 2Q of last year of roughly kind of from a margin standpoint of kind of a similar size. 
I would say as it relates to stimulus across our overall business, I think time will tell. Clearly, you're getting some impact in volumes related to stimulus. We're just seeing it kind of across the board. I think it gets a little bit harder to kind of pick part that into the overall volume picture and say, well, how much is stimulus, how much is unemployment benefits, what all that kind of looks like. 
And so when we're looking at the overall volume landscape, obviously, we're taking some of that versus what we saw last year and the impact of stimulus and kind of embedding that into our overall picture. But outside of our business in consumer segment, it's very hard to kind of get discrete around what kind of revenue impact that's discretely having.

If you think about it and we've talked about this before, we're more exposed to credit than we are debit in our merchant business, and stimulus isn't really driving incremental credit spend. What we're really seeing in the merchant business, I think, obviously, is the impact of the recovery as well as the fact that savings rates are at generational highs and there's a lot of pent-up demand. And obviously, we expect that trend to continue Obviously as we progress through the end of 2021 and probably well into 2022, sitting here today. 
So certainly, on the margin, putting more dollars in consumers' pockets, it's going to be helpful to the merchant business. But I don't view sort of the expansion we saw in Q4 to Q1 to really be driven predominantly by stimulus. I think it's more just a macro recovery in general and the fact that, obviously, consumers are very well positioned to be able to spend in the current environment as the recovery progresses."

We delivered our best performance since the end of 2019 because of our focus on technology enablement coupled with excellence in execution. Our results demonstrated strong sequential momentum from the fourth quarter of 2020 and improved monthly throughout the first quarter of 2021. We are encouraged by the overall run rates we are seeing in the business. We exited the first quarter in a better position than we entered it. 
We are delighted to have to return to growth in the first quarter of 2021. We were able to deliver revenue, margin and earnings per share growth despite facing difficult year-over-year comparisons as the pandemic did not begin to impact our business until mid-March 2020. None of this would have been possible without the dedication of our exceptional team members, and we thank them for their commitment to our customers, our communities and each other. 
And we continue to expand our competitive moat. We are pleased today to announce 2 strategic acquisitions for approximately $1 billion in total that further our software-driven, technology-enabled strategy and deepen our presence in the most attractive markets globally. We expect to continue to gain market share and extend our lead. 
In combination with the roughly $1 billion in share repurchases we've effected since returning to our capital allocation strategy at the end of last year, we continue to balance appropriately reinvestment in the future growth of our business with efficient return of capital. 
First, with our agreement to acquire Zego, we enter one of the largest and most attractive vertical markets worldwide. Real estate is the quintessence of the type of market that we seek, sizable, global in scope, fragmented and ripe for further software, digital commerce and payments penetration. And COVID-19 has accelerated the underlying changes that make this $6.5 billion target addressable market so attractive. 
Zego is a leading software and payment technology company with significant scale, delivering a comprehensive real estate technology platform to 7,300 customers, representing more than 11 million residential units in the United States. Zego's digital omnichannel solutions support property managers and residents throughout the real estate life cycle, from leasing and onboarding, to work orders, utility management, resident communications, renewals, offboarding, and, of course, payments. Through its integrated payments offering, Zego processes approximately $30 billion in payments annually in a market with a volume opportunity that exceeds $1 trillion. The company delivers its full value stack through a cloud-native SaaS platform to enable seamless digital property management and best-in-class resident engagement and omnichannel experiences. It is a highly scalable and predictable flywheel with compelling recurring revenue, strong retention rates, booking trends and lifetime customer value returns with double-digit organic revenue growth. 
Importantly, we have significant opportunities to accelerate Zego's growth. We intend to leverage Global Payments' scale and digital expertise to further payments penetration into Zego's base, generate incremental property and software partner referrals to our more than 3,500 sales and sales support professionals, expand its footprint outside the United States and generate meaningful cross-selling opportunities into its vertical market, including innovative products we already deliver into our merchant business, like payroll, data and analytics and reputation management. We could not be more excited about further capitalizing on the convergence of software and payments, and we look forward to welcoming Zego team members to Global Payments. 
Second, we are excited to have reached an agreement through our Erste joint venture to purchase Worldline's PAYONE business in Austria, consisting of roughly 8,000 primarily SMB merchant customers in Erste Bank's home market. 
We entered Austria through organic market expansion of our Continental European joint venture roughly 18 months ago. This pending acquisition enables us to bring our distinctive distribution and market-leading technologies at scale to yet another attractive market. 
In addition to these strategic accomplishments in early 2021, we also produced a solid first quarter results across our existing businesses. 
First, in our merchant segment, we delivered significant sequential improvement fueled by our technology-enabled focus and the conversion of last year's share and bookings gains into revenue. And we generated these results while absorbing ongoing lockdowns in Canada and renewed restrictions in selected markets in Europe and Asia Pacific. 
Some highlights in the first quarter of 2021 include: record new sales in our Global Payments Integrated business in March and in our U.S. relationship-led business for the quarter; record revenue growth at GPI for the quarter well in excess of pre-pandemic levels; record bookings at Xenial for a cloud-based restaurant POS software and solutions; and continued sequential acceleration in our omnichannel businesses. It is worth highlighting that volumes accelerated throughout the quarter. That trend that has continued into April. Key customer wins include Subway, CKE Restaurants, A&W Foods and Bojangles. 
It's also notable that several of these businesses that were most impacted by COVID-19 saw substantial sequential growth in revenue and bookings in the first quarter as our home market enter recovery. For example, active and gaming achieved significant improvement as better macro trends, strong execution and solid bookings over the course of 2020 benefited performance in 2021. In fact, we have continued to see positive booking trends across our software portfolio as the ability to deliver a full value stack is increasingly becoming table stakes in the markets we serve. 
We also made considerable progress on the partnership with Google that we announced in February. We expect to board Google as a merchant customer in select Asian markets in the third quarter, with North America to follow shortly thereafter. We have initiated our co-sell program and are beginning to see referrals from Google on a number of their enterprise cloud clients. We anticipate launching our [indiscernible] my business product that integrates Google Solutions with our innovative capabilities in our digital portal environment in the fourth quarter of this year. And we have launched our co-innovation efforts to develop new commerce enablement tools for our merchant customers. 
Second, our issuer business continues to benefit from strong relationships with market leaders, and we are excited to announce today that we have entered into a multiyear renewal with Barclays Consumer Bank in the United States. Barclays is one of our largest customers globally, and we provide a range of processing and support technologies for both Barclays consumer and commercial credit card portfolios. We look forward to working with Barclays to enable a best-in-class customer experience with unparalleled levels of security and resiliency for its newest partner, the gap in its portfolio of accounts, yet another competitive takeaway. Partnering with issuers that are gaining share in the marketplace is a key element of our strategy. 
We were also pleased to have signed agreements with Mission Lane and UMB financial, with the latter being a competitive takeaway in which with the prior processing relationship had spanned decades. In collaboration with AWS, UMB will adopt our cloud-based data and analytics platform, which we also successfully deployed during the quarter for a multi-country customer in Latin America. 
We continue to capitalize on the broad and deep pipeline we have the good fortune to have in our issuer business. Today, we have 12 letters of intent with financial institutions worldwide, 6 of which are competitive takeaways. 
Turning to AWS. We expect to go live with our first [ joint ] takeaway with a multinational financial institution in Asia by the end of the year. Our cloud prime instance is now up and running currently in that market in preparation for the launch. We have another dozen active customers in our pipeline of AWS, up from 4 at the end of 2020. 
Third, our business and consumer segment delivered record revenue growth. I am very proud that Netspend once again facilitated the rapid distribution of stimulus funds to customers most in need. Since late December 2020, we have processed more than 2 million deposits, accounting for over $3.5 billion in stimulus payments disbursed by the IRS to American consumers. And this was done days in advance of many of our traditional financial institutions and financial and technology peers. In combination with the 2020 stimulus payments, we have disbursed more than $5 billion in aid to customers through the first quarter of 2021. 
The pandemic-accelerated move to our cash flow solutions is also benefiting Netspend. For example, we are seeing rapid adoption of our [ PIPS ] solution, and we reached a new agreement with Flynn Restaurant Group for its Pizza Hut and Wendy's franchise locations which will drive additional pay card and potential tips opportunities across a combined footprint of more than 1,000 restaurants. 
We also launched our cashless Stadium Card linked to a digital wallet with the Phoenix Suns at the Phoenix Suns Arena. These achievements serve as proof points of our differentiated strategy that includes product extensions into the P2P, B2B and B2C segments. 
I could not be more pleased with all that we accomplished across our businesses this quarter. In March, we returned the year-over-year growth in each of our 3 segments, and the underlying trajectories are tracking for our longer-term goals, just as we predicted they would, despite the impact of ongoing restrictions and lockdowns in some of our markets outside the United States.

We are pleased with our financial performance in the first quarter of 2021, which demonstrated meaningful sequential momentum and reflected our ongoing strong execution across the business. Specifically, we delivered adjusted net revenue of",1960,"Thanks, Jeff. We are pleased with our financial performance in the first quarter of 2021, which demonstrated meaningful sequential momentum and reflected our ongoing strong execution across the business. Specifically, we delivered adjusted net revenue of $1.81 billion, representing 5% growth compared to the prior year and marking an 800 basis point improvement relative to the performance we reported in the fourth quarter of 2020. 
Adjusted operating margin for the first quarter was 40.6%, a 160 basis point improvement from the prior year that was achieved despite the return of certain costs we temporarily reduced at the onset of the pandemic. On a comparable basis, underlying margin trends would have improved approximately 300 basis points. 
Adjusted earnings per share were $1.82 for the quarter, an increase of 15% compared to the prior year period and was especially impressive in light of the difficult year-on-year comparison due to COVID-19. The pandemic did not begin to impact our business meaningfully until the second half of March of last year. And as a reminder, we delivered 18% adjusted earnings per share growth in the first quarter of 2020. 
Taking a closer look at our performance by segment. Merchant Solutions achieved adjusted net revenue of $1.15 billion for the first quarter, a 4.4% improvement from the prior year which marked a nearly 900 basis point improvement from the fourth quarter. We delivered an adjusted operating margin of 46.3% in this segment, an increase of 90 basis points from the same period in 2020 as we continue to benefit from our improving technology-enabled business mix. 
Global Payments Integrated produced a stellar quarter, generating in excess of 20% adjusted net revenue improvement, which is ahead of the levels of growth this business was delivering pre pandemic. Additionally, our worldwide e-commerce and omnichannel businesses, excluding T&E, delivered roughly 20% growth as our value proposition that seamlessly spans both the physical and virtual worlds continues to resonate with customers. 
As for our own software portfolio, we are encouraged to see that several of our businesses most impacted by the pandemic improved meaningfully sequentially, as Jeff mentioned. And it is worth highlighting that our gaming business returned to growth this quarter. And across our vertical markets portfolio, bookings continued to prove resilient in the first quarter, providing us with a positive tailwind for the balance of 2021. 
We are also pleased that our U.S. relationship-led business generated high single-digit adjusted net revenue growth for the first quarter which is consistent with our long-term targeted growth rate for this channel despite a difficult comparison to the first quarter of 2020. 
And notwithstanding a challenging environment in several of our international markets, our portfolio of businesses across Europe and Asia improved significantly and delivered adjusted net revenue that was essentially flat with last year for the quarter. Importantly, because our international businesses are largely focused on domestic spending in the markets in which we operate, we are seeing improvement in these businesses well in advance of cross-border commerce recovering. 
Moving to Issuer Solutions. We delivered $439 million in adjusted net revenue for the first quarter, which was roughly flat versus the prior year period and exceeded our expectations given traditional fourth quarter to first quarter sequential trends. Excluding the commercial card business, our issuer segment grew in the low single digits for the quarter. And in the month of March, issuer delivered growth in aggregate despite continued commercial card headwinds as we benefited from the ongoing recovery in transaction volumes across many of our markets. We also saw nonvolume-based revenue increased mid-single digits in the first quarter. 
Notably, our issuer business achieved record first quarter adjusted operating income, and adjusted segment operating margin expanded 370 basis points from the prior year, also reaching a new first quarter record of 43.2% as we continue to benefit from our efforts to drive efficiencies in the business. 
Additionally, our issuer team signed 3 long-term contract extensions and 3 new contracts since the start of the year, and our strong pipeline bodes well for future performance, consistent with our long-term expectations. 
Finally, our Business and Consumer Solutions segment delivered record adjusted net revenue of $244 million, representing growth of nearly 20% from the prior year. Gross dollar volume increased 26% or $2.5 billion as we benefited from the stimulus we dispersed to our customers. Trends within our DDA products were also very strong, helped by the stimulus, and we realized an acceleration in active account growth of more than 45% compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of stimulus payments and tax, we believe that this business achieved underlying growth in the roughly mid single-digit range, in line with our long-term targets. 
Adjusted operating margin for this segment improved an impressive 750 basis points to a record 33.2% as the benefits of the stimulus and long-term cost initiatives post merger took effect. 
The solid performance we delivered across our segments highlights the resiliency of our technology-enabled portfolio, consistency of our execution and the strong tailwinds in our business coming out of the pandemic. We are also pleased that our integration continues to progress well, and we remain on track to achieve our increased goals from the TSYS merger of annual run rate expense synergies of at least $400 million and annual run rate revenue synergies of at least $150 million within 3 years. 
From a cash flow standpoint, we generated adjusted first quarter free cash flow of roughly $583 million after reinvesting $86 million in capital expenditures. We expect adjusted free cash flow of more than $2 billion and capital expenditures to be in the $500 million to $600 million range for the full year. 
In mid-February, we successfully issued $1.1 billion in senior unsecured notes maturing in 2026 at an attractive interest rate of 1.2%. The transaction was credit-neutral, with the proceeds used to redeem $750 million of notes outstanding with a rate of 3.8% due in April 2021. The balance of the proceeds were used to reduce our outstanding revolver. We have no significant maturities until 2023. 
Our strong cash generation and healthy balance sheet have enabled us to create significant value through our capital allocation strategy to the benefit of our shareholders. 
We are pleased to have repurchased roughly 4 million of our shares for approximately $783 million during the first quarter, which includes the execution of the $500 million accelerated share repurchase program we announced last quarter. 
We ended the quarter with roughly $3 billion of liquidity and a leverage position of roughly 2.6x on a net debt basis. 
And we are excited to announce that we have reached agreements to make additional investments in our technology-enabled strategy and market expansion. As Jeff highlighted, we executed a definitive agreement to acquire Zego and Worldline's PAYONE business in Austria for an aggregate of approximately $1 billion. We expect to finance these transactions using cash on hand and our existing credit facility. We are targeting closing the Zego transaction by the end of the second quarter and the Worldline acquisition in the second half of 2021, both subject to regulatory approvals. 
Upon completion of both transactions, given our current cash balance and strong cash generation, we expect our leverage position will be relatively consistent with current levels, leaving us with ample continuing firepower. 
Based on our current expectations for continued recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide, we have increased our guidance for adjusted net revenue to now be in a range of $7.55 billion to $7.625 billion, reflecting growth of 12% to 13% over 2020. 
We expect adjusted operating margin expansion of up to 250 basis points compared to 2020 levels. This outlook is consistent with an adjusted operating margin expansion of up to 450 basis points on a normalized basis given the operating leverage in our business and expense synergy actions related to the TSYS merger. However, this is being partially offset by the reinstatement of certain expenses in 2021 that were temporarily reduced at the onset of COVID-19 for most of 2020. 
At the segment level, we have increased our expectations for adjusted net revenue growth for our Merchant Solutions segment to be in the high teens, which assumes the current pace of recovery continues worldwide. 
We expect underlying trends in our issuing business to be in the mid to high single-digit range and above our mid single-digit growth target. It is worth noting that our issuer business generated high single-digit growth on a normalized basis for the month of March as we began to lap the pandemic impact. 
As we discussed last quarter, issuer is being impacted by 2 distinct and relatively equal sized headwinds. First, we are not anticipating a recovery in our commercial card business as we expect corporate travel to remain depressed throughout 2021. Second, we are absorbing a portfolio sale by one of our customers which will impact us for the remainder of the year. Taking these 2 items into account, we forecast our issuer business to deliver adjusted net revenue growth in the low single-digit range for the year. 
Lastly, incorporating the benefits of the incremental March stimulus, we are now forecasting adjusted net revenue growth for our business and consumer segment to be in the mid- to high-single digits for the full year, consistent with our long-term expectations for this business. This guidance takes into account lapping the benefits of the 2020 CARES Act, which will provide for a more difficult comparison in the second quarter of 2021. 
Regarding segment margins, we expect the up to 250 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement for the total company to be driven largely by Merchant Solutions, while we expect issuer and business and consumer to deliver normalized margin expansion consistent with the underlying profiles of these businesses. This follows the 500 and 400 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion delivered by issuer and business and consumer, respectively, in 2020. 
From a quarterly phasing perspective, having now lapped muted growth characteristics in the first quarter given the start of the pandemic in mid-March 2020, we will experience the opposite effect in the second quarter before returning to more normalized rates of growth in the back half of the year. I highlight that while we expect to achieve our strongest adjusted revenue growth, adjusted margin expansion and adjusted earnings per share growth for the total company in the second quarter, our business and consumer segment will be lapping the impact of the CARES Act stimulus last year. While we anticipate NetSpend to deliver modest adjusted net revenue growth for the second quarter, we expect adjusted operating margins to decline for that segment year-on-year as a result. On an absolute basis, we would expect business and consumer adjusted operating margins for the second quarter to be consistent with the levels achieved in the fourth quarter of 2020, a period that also saw more limited benefits from stimulus. 
Moving to nonoperating items. We continue to expect net interest expense to be slightly lower in 2021 relative to 2020, but we anticipate our adjusted tax rate will be relatively consistent with last year. 
Putting it all together, we now have increased our expected adjusted earnings per share for the full year to a range of $7.87 to $8.07, reflecting growth of 23% to 26% over 2020. Our raised outlook presumes we remain on a path toward recovery worldwide over the balance of the year, and it does not include any impact from the Zego and Worldline Austrian business acquisitions we announced today. We will further update our guidance when these transactions close, but it is worth noting now that we do not expect these transactions to have a discernible impact on adjusted earnings per share for 2021. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff."

As a result of our team members' terrific efforts, 2020 bookings have begun to translate into 2021 outsized revenue gains. The announcement today of our return to strategic investments will provide further avenues for future growth. And all that is playing out against the backdrop of recovery further differentiation from technology enablement, deeper penetration into attractive markets, sustained share gains and substantial and efficient returns of capital.

It's Jeff, and I'll start and maybe Cameron and Paul will join me thereafter. It's hard to say with any certainty because we've had the integrated business now at legacy Global Payments for probably 8.5 years. But I would say that our Global Payments Integrated business just delivered its best quarter ever from a revenue point of view, and that's especially noteworthy when we haven't lapped the majority in the first quarter of '21, the majority of the rollover from the first quarter of '20. So I think what you're really seeing in the integrated business is the solid bookings growth, the new partner additions that we saw last year really flowing into revenue, and I think we have [ applied on that ] business really just right. So we can't be more pleased with our team on integrated. 
I'd say on the omnichannel business, really pretty much the same thing. Our business accelerated sequentially in the first quarter of '21 relative to the fourth quarter of '20 and grew absolutely at the rate [indiscernible] 20% year-over-year, again without lapping the pandemic pretty much from the first quarter -- from the first quarter of '20. So we feel really good about that performance as well. So we couldn't be more pleased. 
Listen, our home market in the United States, it's 70% to 75% of of the company. You really have to go, and you're pointing about the rest of geographies and the rest of the market, you really have to go kind of country-by-country to see what's happening. I would say we do see areas of growth in Asia Pacific, but, of course, India and Philippines are more difficult, as I'm sure [indiscernible] been reading about the difficult -- the terrible situation in India. Canada, really, at the end of the quarter and really post the quarter, has enacted pretty strict lockdowns. But that's probably about 3% or 4% of the company, Andrew, just to kind of quantify what the size of that market is. And in Europe, it's really a mixed bag. I would say our business in Spain domestically is growing at very high rates. Notwithstanding broader macro issues across the European Union, the U.K. has really started to recover. But there are other markets, like in Continental Europe and our Czech Republic business, of course, we announced the deal today with Erste Bank, but that market also remains under substantial lockdown. 
So listen, I think the good news for us is we're growing right through it. We did mention today that active and gaming in some of our markets here in the United States have recovered pretty substantially. They still present some headwinds relative to the rate of growth that we just announced today, but to be able to show 900 basis points of sequential expansion from the fourth to the first quarter of '21 in our merchant business, I think is one of the most noteworthy things of today. Cameron and Paul, you guys want to add to that?"

The only other point I would make, just to top that off, Andrew, is just as it relates to new sales. In both of those businesses that you highlighted, in particular, integrated and omni, continue to be very, very strong. 
In our e-com business here in the U.S. market, our e-com sales were up something like 330% year-over-year, so clearly demonstrating that the trends we've seen around consumer buying patterns as well as merchant adoption of omnichannel and e-commerce capabilities continues to be quite strong, even a year after, obviously, the onset of the pandemic. So we think that's a very positive sign as it relates to the future growth of the e-com and omni business. 
And then on the integrated front, again, our new sales in the quarter were 120% of our target, up something like 120% kind of year-over-year. So again, we're seeing great momentum in the business continuing as we enter the second quarter as well. 
So as Jeff highlighted, I think the strong new bookings and new sales performance we saw last year clearly contributed to the performance in Q1, and we -- it's nice to see that, that same execution has continued into 2021 as well."

So it's about $30 billion of payment volume today. It's a very healthy portfolio from a payment standpoint. The nice thing about the business is it's not that penetrated within its existing customer base from a payments perspective. And obviously, the ability to cross-sell software into that base of existing partners today as well as to take Global Payments software and sell into that environment with our own value-added services drive some meaningful revenue tailwinds, we think, for the business in the future."

So we produced high single-digit growth in our relationship-led businesses compared to the first quarter of '20, for which 85% in the first quarter of '20 had no pandemic. So I want to call that out. 
As we also said in our prepared remarks, we had record new sales in our relationship-led businesses in the first quarter of '21, again, coming out of pandemic. So I don't want to lose sight of that before we address your question more directly. 
Second, as it relates to your question, look, I don't think consumers are going to go backward. I don't think people are going to say, I want to spend more time online. Where can we find the ATM to get more cash? There is no bull market for cash. I think what we've seen that pandemic do is accelerate 3 to 5 years behavioral change on the consumer side. 
Cameron just went a minute ago, in response to Andrew's question, the bookings growth in our e-comm, omni businesses, which is extraordinary, again, not lapping the pandemic for the first quarter of 2020. 
So listen, I think at the end of the day, in my opinion, the answer to your question is, I just don't see the trends of safer commerce, [indiscernible] commerce, omnichannel acceptance, I don't see folks moving backwards. I think it's going to accelerate the underlying trends that we've seen over time. 
I'd also say relative to kind of credit-debit mix, I don't see that changing either. The only time that we've really seen debit cannibalized credit was back in the early '09 recession when credit was really tapped. So all that was left is debit. We really haven't seen that here. I do think you'll see alternative means of payment, of course, in Europe, where I know you're focused in particularly. We've got assets, account-to-account transactions. We've got real-time payments, that kind of thing. Of course, we've got afterpay and those types of installment payment plans, which I think we're a market leader in, both in our issuing business and our acquiring business. 
So I think there may be mix changes in terms of how people actually pay for things, but I don't think we're going to see debit cannibalized credit like we saw in '08, we have not seen that really throughout the pandemic, and I don't see people kind of going backwards on convenience of use."

So we think the opportunity to drive better penetration from a payment standpoint in that market is going to be easier than some of the other vertical markets we've been in. I think we view real estate really as the quintessential vertical market, where you have the intersection of software and [ drain ] payments where that nexus is very strong and obviously creates a significant opportunity for us to drive meaningful growth and share gains and, obviously, margin expansion over a period of time. 
We expect the business, to your second question, to generate roughly $100 million of revenue in 2021. It's growing double digits nicely. It sort of fits the rule of 40 for a software business very nicely today. And obviously, we think we can do a variety of things to accelerate that rate of revenue growth over time and scale the business more effectively by leveraging the broader Global Payments ecosystem."

We've been talking for several quarters now about this positive decoupling. And obviously, we saw in a more dramatic way, certainly on the positive side, this last quarter. And so yes, we continue to kind of see that positive decoupling continue, and we would expect that continue. 
The second reason, as we had outlined before when we said that we expected that positive decoupling to occur once things got to a much more kind of normalized basis, the only other thing I would highlight is, as you look at that overall revenue growth number, do recall that we have probably 300 basis points of headwind related to those 3 vertical market businesses that are still, while they've improved from the depths of the pandemic and we highlighted gaming as being now an absolute grower, we're still seeing some meaningful headwind related to the active school business and the gaming business, that if you kind of looked at it ex those, you kind of add 300 basis points to the overall growth rate. And then if you do that, you can see really some, on a volume to volume basis, some very positive decouple. And Cameron, I don't know if you have anything to add to that."

So if you really look at U.S. payments and our growth in U.S. payments, it was probably high single digits, maybe almost 10%, pure payments in the U.S. market in the first quarter. So even more decoupling than I think the sort of highlights represent. 
And the other thing I would say is, over time, I expect that decoupling continue partially because our international businesses are more exposed to domestic trends in those markets. So as those markets reopen, we're not as reliant upon the cross-border volume to drive revenue growth in those businesses. As domestic markets reopen internationally, we'll obviously see a nice tailwind as a result of that."

It's Cameron, and then I'll ask Paul maybe to jump in with a little bit more color as well. 
So I would say, maybe to start, even well before the pandemic, we've been equipping our sales professionals around the globe with the best technology, the best capabilities to be able to sell. And obviously, we think that paid meaningful dividends through the course of the pandemic in our ability to continue to sell at very strong levels, notwithstanding, obviously, the impact of the pandemic. And I think partly a credit to our sales teams in particular, they found new and innovative ways to continue to sell in a difficult environment. In particular our relationship-led sales professionals here in the U.S. market that really operate under a commission only model, they were very motivated and incentivized to go out and find greater ways to be able to sell into the marketplace. So the use of technology and deploying more technology towards the sales process itself as well as the ingenuity, I would say, of our sales professionals, I don't expect that to change post pandemic. And I think a lot of the lessons we've learned through this process will allow us to continue to be very effective and very productive from a new sales point of view as a go-forward matter. 
I'll call out a few particular highlights on the first quarter bookings performance, and I'll ask Paul maybe to jump in. 
If I start with our U.S. relationship-led business, we had a record sales quarter, as Jeff and Paul highlighted in the prepared remarks. It was about 5% higher than our old record and up about 27% year-over-year, which I think is a really important metric as well, given that, again, kind of the 12 weeks of the first quarter of 2020 were really not impacted by the pandemic. So very strong performance from a new sales point. Again, with particular strength in our e-commerce, Bill Pay, Text buy Pay Solutions within our relationship-led channel. 
We also had great new booking performance in our payroll business as well. We had record sales in that business, up again 42% year-over-year. So very strong performance in our U.S. relationship-led payments and payroll business in the first quarter. 
Integrated, as I mentioned previously, they were above plan and well above last year's new sales performance and bookings performance in the first quarter as well. 
Within our vertical market business, we saw very strong, I'd say, booking trends across the business. TouchNet had record first quarter bookings performance, which I think is a very good sign as it relates to the university environment heading into the fall. 
We actually started to see some falling of new sales in our schools business, our lower school K-12. We had 3 significant new wins in the quarter from a new sales point of view. Obviously, we're still waiting and relying upon kids getting back in through K-12 environment for that business to recover fully. But obviously, it was encouraging to see new sales begin to fall in that business in the first quarter as well. 
And we also had record bookings in our enterprise SaaS QSR business in the first quarter as well. So again, good trends across the board, I would say, in our vertical market business. 
If we look internationally, again, despite the macro environment being challenging in some of the markets that we operate in, I would characterize new sales performance across the board internationally and sort of aggregating a bunch of different markets there. It was above plan for the first quarter above last year. Canada, for example, was up 40% year-over-year. 
So again, the trend of new booking performance being very strong, continued well into the first quarter and thus far in the second quarter as well. Paul, I don't know if you'd add any detail."

But obviously, we're targeting well north of 70%, 25% of the company. Think about just directionally up from 60 last summer where we'd like to be longer term.

And we've obviously kind of talked about the margin impact. You saw what we had for marginal impact in the first quarter. And then obviously that will play through in the second quarter the other direction as we grow over the stimulus in 2Q of last year of roughly kind of from a margin standpoint of kind of a similar size. 
I would say as it relates to stimulus across our overall business, I think time will tell. Clearly, you're getting some impact in volumes related to stimulus. We're just seeing it kind of across the board. I think it gets a little bit harder to kind of pick part that into the overall volume picture and say, well, how much is stimulus, how much is unemployment benefits, what all that kind of looks like. 
And so when we're looking at the overall volume landscape, obviously, we're taking some of that versus what we saw last year and the impact of stimulus and kind of embedding that into our overall picture. But outside of our business in consumer segment, it's very hard to kind of get discrete around what kind of revenue impact that's discretely having. Cameron, I don't know if you have anything to add to that."

If you think about it and we've talked about this before, we're more exposed to credit than we are debit in our merchant business, and stimulus isn't really driving incremental credit spend. What we're really seeing in the merchant business, I think, obviously, is the impact of the recovery as well as the fact that savings rates are at generational highs and there's a lot of pent-up demand. And obviously, we expect that trend to continue Obviously as we progress through the end of 2021 and probably well into 2022, sitting here today. 
So certainly, on the margin, putting more dollars in consumers' pockets, it's going to be helpful to the merchant business. But I don't view sort of the expansion we saw in Q4 to Q1 to really be driven predominantly by stimulus. I think it's more just a macro recovery in general and the fact that, obviously, consumers are very well positioned to be able to spend in the current environment as the recovery progresses."

We delivered our best performance since the end of 2019 because of our focus on technology enablement coupled with excellence in execution. Our results demonstrated strong sequential momentum from the fourth quarter of 2020 and improved monthly throughout the first quarter of 2021. We are encouraged by the overall run rates we are seeing in the business. We exited the first quarter in a better position than we entered it. 
We are delighted to have to return to growth in the first quarter of 2021. We were able to deliver revenue, margin and earnings per share growth despite facing difficult year-over-year comparisons as the pandemic did not begin to impact our business until mid-March 2020. None of this would have been possible without the dedication of our exceptional team members, and we thank them for their commitment to our customers, our communities and each other. 
And we continue to expand our competitive moat. We are pleased today to announce 2 strategic acquisitions for approximately $1 billion in total that further our software-driven, technology-enabled strategy and deepen our presence in the most attractive markets globally. We expect to continue to gain market share and extend our lead. 
In combination with the roughly $1 billion in share repurchases we've affected since returning to our capital allocation strategy at the end of last year, we continue to balance appropriately reinvestment in the future growth of our business with efficient return of capital. 
First, with our agreement to acquire Zego, we enter one of the largest and most attractive vertical markets worldwide. Real estate is the quintessence of the type of market that we seek, sizable, global in scope, fragmented and ripe for further software, digital commerce and payments penetration. And COVID-19 has accelerated the underlying changes that make this $6.5 billion target addressable market so attractive. 
Zego is a leading software and payment technology company with significant scale, delivering a comprehensive real estate technology platform to 7,300 customers, representing more than 11 million residential units in the United States. Zego's digital omnichannel solutions support property managers and residents throughout the real estate life cycle, from leasing and onboarding, to work orders, utility management, resident communications, renewals, offboarding, and, of course, payments. Through its integrated payments offering, Zego processes approximately $30 billion in payments annually in a market with a volume opportunity that exceeds $1 trillion. 
The company delivers its full value stack through a cloud-native SaaS platform to enable seamless digital property management and best-in-class resident engagement and omnichannel experiences. It is a highly scalable and predictable flywheel with compelling recurring revenue, strong retention rates, booking trends and lifetime customer value returns with double-digit organic revenue growth. 
Importantly, we have significant opportunities to accelerate Zego's growth. We intend to leverage Global Payments' scale and digital expertise to further payments penetration into Zego's base, generate incremental property and software partner referrals to our more than 3,500 sales and sales support professionals, expand its footprint outside the United States and generate meaningful cross-selling opportunities into its vertical market, including innovative products we already deliver into our merchant business, like payroll, data and analytics and reputation management. We could not be more excited about further capitalizing on the convergence of software and payments, and we look forward to welcoming Zego team members to Global Payments. 
Second, we are excited to have reached an agreement through our Erste joint venture to purchase Worldline's PAYONE business in Austria, consisting of roughly 8,000 primarily SMB merchant customers in Erste Bank's home market. 
We entered Austria through organic market expansion of our Continental European joint venture roughly 18 months ago. This pending acquisition enables us to bring our distinctive distribution and market-leading technologies at scale to yet another attractive market. 
In addition to these strategic accomplishments in early 2021, we also produced a solid first quarter results across our existing businesses. 
First, in our merchant segment, we delivered significant sequential improvement fueled by our technology-enabled focus and the conversion of last year's share and bookings gains into revenue. And we generated these results while absorbing ongoing lockdowns in Canada and renewed restrictions in selected markets in Europe and Asia Pacific. 
Some highlights in the first quarter of 2021 include: record new sales in our Global Payments Integrated business in March and in our U.S. relationship-led business for the quarter; record revenue growth at GPI for the quarter well in excess of pre-pandemic levels; record bookings at Xenial for a cloud-based restaurant POS software and solutions; and continued sequential acceleration in our omnichannel businesses. It is worth highlighting that volumes accelerated throughout the quarter, a trend that has continued into April. Key customer wins include Subway, CKE Restaurants, A&W Foods and Bojangles. 
It's also notable that several of these businesses that were most impacted by COVID-19 saw substantial sequential growth in revenue and bookings in the first quarter as our home market entered recovery. For example, ACTIVE and gaming achieved significant improvement as better macro trends, strong execution and solid bookings over the course of 2020 benefited performance in 2021. In fact, we have continued to see positive booking trends across our software portfolio as the ability to deliver a full value stack is increasingly becoming table stakes in the markets we serve. 
We also made considerable progress on the partnership with Google that we announced in February. We expect to board Google as a merchant customer in select Asian markets in the third quarter, with North America to follow shortly thereafter. We have initiated our co-sell program and are beginning to see referrals from Google on a number of their enterprise cloud clients. We anticipate launching our run and grow my business product that integrates Google Solutions with our innovative capabilities in our digital portal environment in the fourth quarter of this year. And we have launched our co-innovation efforts to develop new commerce enablement tools for our merchant customers. 
Second, our Issuer business continues to benefit from strong relationships with market leaders, and we are excited to announce today that we have entered into a multiyear renewal with Barclays Consumer Bank in the United States. Barclays is one of our largest customers globally, and we provide a range of processing and support technologies for both Barclays consumer and commercial credit card portfolios. We look forward to working with Barclays to enable a best-in-class customer experience with unparalleled levels of security and resiliency for its newest partner, the gap in its portfolio of accounts, yet another competitive takeaway. Partnering with issuers that are gaining share in the marketplace is a key element of our strategy. 
We were also pleased to have signed agreements with Mission Lane and UMB financial, with the latter being a competitive takeaway in which with the prior processing relationship had spanned decades. In collaboration with AWS, UMB will adopt our cloud-based data and analytics platform, which we also successfully deployed during the quarter for a multi-country customer in Latin America. 
We continue to capitalize on the broad and deep pipeline we have the good fortune to have in our issuer business. Today, we have 12 letters of intent with financial institutions worldwide, 6 of which are competitive takeaways. 
Turning to AWS. We expect to go live with our first joint takeaway with a multinational financial institution in Asia by the end of the year. Our cloud PRIME instance is now up and running currently in that market in preparation for the launch. We have another dozen active customers in our pipeline of AWS, up from 4 at the end of 2020. 
Third, our business and consumer segment delivered record revenue growth. I am very proud that Netspend once again facilitated the rapid distribution of stimulus funds to customers most in need. Since late December 2020, we have processed more than 2 million deposits, accounting for over $3.5 billion in stimulus payments disbursed by the IRS to American consumers. And this was done days in advance of many of our traditional financial institutions and financial and technology peers. In combination with the 2020 stimulus payments, we have disbursed more than $5 billion in aid to customers through the first quarter of 2021. 
The pandemic-accelerated move to our cash flow solutions is also benefiting Netspend. For example, we are seeing rapid adoption of our tips solution, and we reached a new agreement with Flynn Restaurant Group for its Pizza Hut and Wendy's franchise locations which will drive additional pay card and potential tips opportunities across a combined footprint of more than 1,000 restaurants. 
We also launched our cashless stadium card linked to a digital wallet with the Phoenix Suns at the Phoenix Suns Arena. These achievements serve as proof points of our differentiated strategy that includes product extensions into the P2P, B2B and B2C segments. 
I could not be more pleased with all that we accomplished across our businesses this quarter. In March, we returned the year-over-year growth in each of our 3 segments, and the underlying trajectories are tracking for our longer-term goals, just as we predicted they would, despite the impact of ongoing restrictions and lockdowns in some of our markets outside the United States.

We are pleased with our financial performance in the first quarter of 2021, which demonstrated meaningful sequential momentum and reflected our ongoing strong execution across the business. Specifically, we delivered adjusted net revenue of",1957,"Thanks, Jeff. We are pleased with our financial performance in the first quarter of 2021, which demonstrated meaningful sequential momentum and reflected our ongoing strong execution across the business. Specifically, we delivered adjusted net revenue of $1.81 billion, representing 5% growth compared to the prior year and marking an 800 basis point improvement relative to the performance we reported in the fourth quarter of 2020. 
Adjusted operating margin for the first quarter was 40.6%, a 160 basis point improvement from the prior year that was achieved despite the return of certain costs we temporarily reduced at the onset of the pandemic. On a comparable basis, underlying margin trends would have improved approximately 300 basis points. 
Adjusted earnings per share were $1.82 for the quarter, an increase of 15% compared to the prior year period and was especially impressive in light of the difficult year-on-year comparison due to COVID-19. The pandemic did not begin to impact our business meaningfully until the second half of March of last year. And as a reminder, we delivered 18% adjusted earnings per share growth in the first quarter of 2020. 
Taking a closer look at our performance by segment. Merchant Solutions achieved adjusted net revenue of $1.15 billion for the first quarter, a 4.4% improvement from the prior year which marked a nearly 900 basis point improvement from the fourth quarter. We delivered an adjusted operating margin of 46.3% in this segment, an increase of 90 basis points from the same period in 2020 as we continue to benefit from our improving technology-enabled business mix. 
Global Payments Integrated produced a stellar quarter, generating in excess of 20% adjusted net revenue improvement, which is ahead of the levels of growth this business was delivering pre pandemic. Additionally, our worldwide e-commerce and omnichannel businesses, excluding T&E, delivered roughly 20% growth as our value proposition that seamlessly spans both the physical and virtual worlds continues to resonate with customers. 
As for our own software portfolio, we are encouraged to see that several of our businesses most impacted by the pandemic improved meaningfully sequentially, as Jeff mentioned. And it is worth highlighting that our gaming business returned to growth this quarter. And across our vertical markets portfolio, bookings continued to prove resilient in the first quarter, providing us with a positive tailwind for the balance of 2021. 
We are also pleased that our U.S. relationship-led business generated high single-digit adjusted net revenue growth for the first quarter which is consistent with our long-term targeted growth rate for this channel despite a difficult comparison to the first quarter of 2020. 
And notwithstanding a challenging environment in several of our international markets, our portfolio of businesses across Europe and Asia improved significantly and delivered adjusted net revenue that was essentially flat with last year for the quarter. Importantly, because our international businesses are largely focused on domestic spending in the markets in which we operate, we are seeing improvement in these businesses well in advance of cross-border commerce recovering. 
Moving to Issuer Solutions. We delivered $439 million in adjusted net revenue for the first quarter, which was roughly flat versus the prior year period and exceeded our expectations given traditional fourth quarter to first quarter sequential trends. Excluding the commercial card business, our Issuer segment grew in the low single digits for the quarter. And in the month of March, Issuer delivered growth in aggregate despite continued commercial card headwinds as we benefited from the ongoing recovery in transaction volumes across many of our markets. We also saw nonvolume-based revenue increased mid-single digits in the first quarter. 
Notably, our Issuer business achieved record first quarter adjusted operating income, and adjusted segment operating margin expanded 370 basis points from the prior year, also reaching a new first quarter record of 43.2% as we continue to benefit from our efforts to drive efficiencies in the business. Additionally, our Issuer team signed 3 long-term contract extensions and 3 new contracts since the start of the year, and our strong pipeline bodes well for future performance, consistent with our long-term expectations. 
Finally, our Business and Consumer Solutions segment delivered record adjusted net revenue of $244 million, representing growth of nearly 20% from the prior year. Gross dollar volume increased 26% or $2.5 billion as we benefited from the stimulus we dispersed to our customers. Trends within our DDA products were also very strong, helped by the stimulus, and we realized an acceleration in active account growth of more than 45% compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of stimulus payments and tax, we believe that this business achieved underlying growth in the roughly mid single-digit range, in line with our long-term targets. 
Adjusted operating margin for this segment improved an impressive 750 basis points to a record 33.2% as the benefits of the stimulus and long-term cost initiatives post-merger took effect. 
The solid performance we delivered across our segments highlights the resiliency of our technology-enabled portfolio, consistency of our execution and the strong tailwinds in our business coming out of the pandemic. We are also pleased that our integration continues to progress well, and we remain on track to achieve our increased goals from the TSYS merger of annual run rate expense synergies of at least $400 million and annual run rate revenue synergies of at least $150 million within 3 years. 
From a cash flow standpoint, we generated adjusted first quarter free cash flow of roughly $583 million after reinvesting $86 million in capital expenditures. We expect adjusted free cash flow of more than $2 billion and capital expenditures to be in the $500 million to $600 million range for the full year. 
In mid-February, we successfully issued $1.1 billion in senior unsecured notes maturing in 2026 at an attractive interest rate of 1.2%. The transaction was credit-neutral, with the proceeds used to redeem $750 million of notes outstanding with a rate of 3.8% due in April 2021. The balance of the proceeds were used to reduce our outstanding revolver. We have no significant maturities until 2023. 
Our strong cash generation and healthy balance sheet have enabled us to create significant value through our capital allocation strategy to the benefit of our shareholders. 
We are pleased to have repurchased roughly 4 million of our shares for approximately $783 million during the first quarter, which includes the execution of the $500 million accelerated share repurchase program we announced last quarter. 
We ended the quarter with roughly $3 billion of liquidity and a leverage position of roughly 2.6x on a net debt basis. 
And we are excited to announce that we have reached agreements to make additional investments in our technology-enabled strategy and market expansion. As Jeff highlighted, we executed a definitive agreement to acquire Zego and Worldline's PAYONE business in Austria for an aggregate of approximately $1 billion. We expect to finance these transactions using cash on hand and our existing credit facility. We are targeting closing the Zego transaction by the end of the second quarter and the Worldline acquisition in the second half of 2021, both subject to regulatory approvals. 
Upon completion of both transactions, given our current cash balance and strong cash generation, we expect our leverage position will be relatively consistent with current levels, leaving us with ample continuing firepower. 
Based on our current expectations for continued recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide, we have increased our guidance for adjusted net revenue to now be in a range of $7.55 billion to $7.625 billion, reflecting growth of 12% to 13% over 2020. We expect adjusted operating margin expansion of up to 250 basis points compared to 2020 levels. 
This outlook is consistent with an adjusted operating margin expansion of up to 450 basis points on a normalized basis given the operating leverage in our business and expense synergy actions related to the TSYS merger. However, this is being partially offset by the reinstatement of certain expenses in 2021 that were temporarily reduced at the onset of COVID-19 for most of 2020. 
At the segment level, we have increased our expectations for adjusted net revenue growth for our Merchant Solutions segment to be in the high teens, which assumes the current pace of recovery continues worldwide. 
We expect underlying trends in our issuing business to be in the mid- to high single-digit range and above our mid-single-digit growth target. It is worth noting that our issuer business generated high single-digit growth on a normalized basis for the month of March as we began to lap the pandemic impact. 
As we discussed last quarter, Issuer is being impacted by 2 distinct and relatively equal sized headwinds. First, we are not anticipating a recovery in our commercial card business as we expect corporate travel to remain depressed throughout 2021. Second, we are absorbing a portfolio sale by one of our customers which will impact us for the remainder of the year. Taking these 2 items into account, we forecast our issuer business to deliver adjusted net revenue growth in the low single-digit range for the year. 
Lastly, incorporating the benefits of the incremental March stimulus, we are now forecasting adjusted net revenue growth for our Business and Consumer segment to be in the mid- to high-single digits for the full year, consistent with our long-term expectations for this business. This guidance takes into account lapping the benefits of the 2020 CARES Act, which will provide for a more difficult comparison in the second quarter of 2021. 
Regarding segment margins, we expect up to 250 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement for the total company to be driven largely by Merchant Solutions, while we expect Issuer and Business and Consumer to deliver normalized margin expansion consistent with the underlying profiles of these businesses. This follows the 500 and 400 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion delivered by Issuer and Business and Consumer, respectively, in 2020. 
From a quarterly phasing perspective, having now lapped muted growth characteristics in the first quarter given the start of the pandemic in mid-March 2020, we will experience the opposite effect in the second quarter before returning to more normalized rates of growth in the back half of the year. I highlight that while we expect to achieve our strongest adjusted revenue growth, adjusted margin expansion and adjusted earnings per share growth for the total company in the second quarter, our Business and Consumer segment will be lapping the impact of the CARES Act stimulus last year. While we anticipate Netspend to deliver modest adjusted net revenue growth for the second quarter, we expect adjusted operating margins to decline for that segment year-on-year as a result. On an absolute basis, we would expect Business and Consumer adjusted operating margins for the second quarter to be consistent with the levels achieved in the fourth quarter of 2020, a period that also saw more limited benefits from stimulus. 
Moving to nonoperating items. We continue to expect net interest expense to be slightly lower in 2021 relative to 2020, but we anticipate our adjusted tax rate will be relatively consistent with last year. 
Putting it all together, we now have increased our expected adjusted earnings per share for the full year to a range of $7.87 to $8.07, reflecting growth of 23% to 26% over 2020. Our raised outlook presumes we remain on a path toward recovery worldwide over the balance of the year, and it does not include any impact from the Zego and Worldline Austrian business acquisitions we announced today. We will further update our guidance when these transactions close, but it is worth noting now that we do not expect these transactions to have a discernible impact on adjusted earnings per share for 2021. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff."

So we can't be more pleased with our team on Integrated. 
I'd say on the omnichannel business, really pretty much the same thing. Our business accelerated sequentially in the first quarter of '21 relative to the fourth quarter of '20 and grew absolutely at the rate -- the pulls were up 20% year-over-year, again without lapping the pandemic pretty much from the first quarter of '20. So we feel really good about that performance as well. So we couldn't be more pleased. 
Listen, our home market is United States, it's 70% to 75% of the company. You really have to go, and you're pointing about the rest of geographies and the rest of the market, you really have to go kind of country-by-country to see what's happening. I would say we do see areas of growth in Asia Pacific. But, of course, India and Philippines are more difficult, as I'm sure everyone has been reading about the difficult -- the terrible situation in India. 
Canada, really, at the end of the quarter and really post the quarter, has enacted pretty strict lockdowns. But that's probably about 3% or 4% of the company, Andrew, just to kind of quantify what the size of that market is. And in Europe, it's really a mixed bag. I would say our business in Spain domestically is growing at very high rates. Notwithstanding broader macro issues across the European Union, the U.K. has really started to recover. But there are other markets, like in Continental Europe and our Czech Republic business, of course, we announced the deal today with Erste Bank, but that market also remains under substantial lockdown. 
So listen, I think the good news for us is we're growing right through it. We did mention today that ACTIVE and gaming, in some of our markets here in the United States, have recovered pretty substantially. They still present some headwinds relative to the rate of growth that we just announced today, but to be able to show 900 basis points of sequential expansion from the fourth to the first quarter of '21 in our Merchant business, I think is one of the most noteworthy things of today. Cameron and Paul, you guys want to add to that?"

The only other point I would make, just to top that off, Andrew, is just as it relates to new sales. In both of those businesses that you highlighted, in particular, Integrated and omni, continue to be very, very strong. 
In our e-com business here in the U.S. market, our e-com sales were up something like 330% year-over-year, so clearly demonstrating that the trends we've seen around consumer buying patterns as well as merchant adoption of omnichannel and e-commerce capabilities continues to be quite strong, even a year after, obviously, the onset of the pandemic. So we think that's a very positive sign as it relates to the future growth of the e-com and omni business. 
And then on the integrated front, again, our new sales in the quarter were 120% of our target, up something like 120% kind of year-over-year. So again, we're seeing great momentum in the business continuing as we enter the second quarter as well. 
So as Jeff highlighted, I think the strong new bookings and new sales performance we saw last year clearly contributed to the performance in Q1, and we -- it's nice to see that, that same execution has continued into 2021 as well."

So it's still a majority payments today, but the software elements of the business are growing more rapidly, and I would expect over time that they will flip and become the majority of the business long term. 
So it's about $30 billion of payment volume today. So it's a very healthy portfolio from a payment standpoint. The nice thing about the business is it's not that penetrated within its existing customer base from a payments perspective. And obviously, the ability to cross-sell software into that base of existing partners today as well as to take Global Payments software and sell into that environment with our own value-added services drive some meaningful revenue tailwinds, we think, for the business in the future."

So let me just start by saying by kind of not answering the question, but I do want to call out our relationship-led businesses. So they also had a very good quarter. So we produced high single-digit growth in our relationship-led businesses compared to the first quarter of '20, for which 85% in the first quarter of '20 had no pandemic. So I want to call that out. 
As we also said in our prepared remarks, we had record new sales in our relationship-led businesses in the first quarter of '21, again, coming out of pandemic. So I don't want to lose sight of that before we address your question more directly. 
Second, as it relates to your question, look, I don't think consumers are going to go backward. I don't think people are going to say, I want to spend more time in line. Where can we find the ATM to get more cash? There is no bull market for cash. I think what we've seen that pandemic do is accelerate 3 to 5 years behavioral change on the consumer side. 
Cameron just went a minute ago, in response to Andrew's question, the bookings growth in our e-com, omni businesses, which is extraordinary, again, not lapping the pandemic for the first quarter of 2020. 
So listen, I think at the end of the day, in my opinion, the answer to your question is, I just don't see the trends of safer commerce, contactless commerce, omnichannel acceptance, I don't see folks moving backwards. I think it's going to accelerate the underlying trends that we've seen over time. 
I'd also say relative to kind of credit-debit mix, I don't see that changing either. The only time that we've really seen debit cannibalized credit was back in the early '09 recession when credit was really tapped. So all that was left is debit. We really haven't seen that here. I do think you'll see alternative means of payment, of course, in Europe, where I know you're focused in particularly. We've got assets, account-to-account transactions. We've got real-time payments, that kind of thing. Of course, we've got afterpay and those types of installment payment plans, which I think we're a market leader in, both in our issuing business and our acquiring business. 
So I think there may be mix changes in terms of how people actually pay for things, but I don't think we're going to see debit cannibalized credit like we saw in '08, we have not seen that really throughout the pandemic, and I don't see people kind of going backwards on convenience of use."

So I would say, on balance, I would think it's probably easier to monetize the payment opportunity in the real estate space. There's obviously secular trends there that we think are very powerful around the digitization of the payment stream within real estate, whether it's recurring monthly rental payments, HOA fees or other one-off fees that lessees need to pay. So we think the opportunity to drive better penetration from a payment standpoint in that market is going to be easier than some of the other vertical markets we've been in. I think we view real estate really as the quintessential vertical market, where you have the intersection of software and drain payments where that nexus is very strong and obviously creates a significant opportunity for us to drive meaningful growth and share gains and, obviously, margin expansion over a period of time. 
We expect the business, to your second question, to generate roughly $100 million of revenue in 2021. It's growing double digits nicely. It sort of fits the rule of 40 for a software business very nicely today. And obviously, we think we can do a variety of things to accelerate that rate of revenue growth over time and scale the business more effectively by leveraging the broader Global Payments ecosystem."

The second reason, as we had outlined before when we said that we expected that positive decoupling to occur once things got to a much more kind of normalized basis, the only other thing I would highlight is, as you look at that overall revenue growth number, do recall that we have probably 300 basis points of headwind related to those 3 vertical market businesses that are still, while they've improved from the depths of the pandemic and we highlighted gaming as being now an absolute grower, we're still seeing some meaningful headwind related to the ACTIVE school business and the gaming business, that if you kind of looked at it [ ex ] those, you kind of add 300 basis points to the overall growth rate.

So even more decoupling than I think the sort of highlights represent. 
And the other thing I would say is, over time, I expect that decoupling continue partially because our international businesses are more exposed to domestic trends in those markets. So as those markets reopen, we're not as reliant upon the cross-border volume to drive revenue growth in those businesses. As domestic markets reopen internationally, we'll obviously see a nice tailwind as a result of that."

It's Cameron, and then I'll ask Paul maybe to jump in with a little bit more color as well. 
So I would say, maybe to start, even well before the pandemic, we've been equipping our sales professionals around the globe with the best technology, the best capabilities to be able to sell. And obviously, we think that paid meaningful dividends through the course of the pandemic in our ability to continue to sell at very strong levels, notwithstanding, obviously, the impact of the pandemic. And I think partly a credit to our sales teams in particular, they found new and innovative ways to continue to sell in a difficult environment. 
In particular our relationship-led sales professionals here in the U.S. market that really operate under a commission only model, they were very motivated and incentivized to go out and find creative ways to be able to sell into the marketplace. 
So the use of technology and deploying more technology towards the sales process itself as well as the ingenuity, I would say, of our sales professionals, I don't expect that to change post-pandemic. And I think a lot of the lessons we've learned through this process will allow us to continue to be very effective and very productive from a new sales point of view as a go-forward matter. 
I'll call out a few particular highlights on the first quarter bookings performance, and I'll ask Paul maybe to jump in. 
If I start with our U.S. relationship-led business, we had a record sales quarter, as Jeff and Paul highlighted in the prepared remarks. It was about 5% higher than our old record and up about 27% year-over-year, which I think is a really important metric as well, given that, again, kind of the 12 weeks of the first quarter of 2020 were really not impacted by the pandemic. So very strong performance from a new sales point. Again, with particular strength in our e-commerce, bill pay, text by pay solutions within our relationship-led channel. 
We also had great new booking performance in our payroll business as well. We had record sales in that business, up again 42% year-over-year. So very strong performance in our U.S. relationship-led payments and payroll business in the first quarter. 
Integrated, as I mentioned previously, they were above plan and well above last year's new sales performance and bookings performance in the first quarter as well. 
Within our vertical market business, we saw very strong, I'd say, booking trends across the business. TouchNet had record first quarter bookings performance, which I think is a very good sign as it relates to the university environment heading into the fall. 
We actually started to see some falling of new sales in our schools business, our lower school K-12. We had 3 significant new wins in the quarter from a new sales point of view. Obviously, we're still waiting and relying upon kids getting back in through K-12 environment for that business to recover fully. But obviously, it was encouraging to see new sales begin to fall in that business in the first quarter as well. 
And we also had record bookings in our enterprise SaaS QSR business in the first quarter as well. So again, good trends across the board, I would say, in our vertical market business. 
If we look internationally, again, despite the macro environment being challenging in some of the markets that we operate in, I would characterize new sales performance across the board internationally and sort of aggregating a bunch of different markets there. It was above plan for the first quarter above last year. Canada, for example, was up 40% year-over-year. 
So again, the trend of new booking performance being very strong, continued well into the first quarter and thus far in the second quarter as well. Paul, I don't know if you'd add any detail."

But I think our outlook is consistent with, to some degree, what we outlined the last time, which is that the trajectory that we were on going into the year and the trajectory that we kind of continue on is, as we've kind of said before, kind of a slow grind higher. And we continue to -- while we're very optimistic about the future and very pleased with the results, we also want to kind of see how things play out as it relates to particularly around the world where we have different kind of dynamics playing around the different geographies. 
But we've said before and it's still true, the top end of the range is not perfection. It does not assume any type of -- just kind of some massive kind of kick back to normal. But instead, a grind back to normal, with the third and fourth quarter kind of being a much more normal kind of -- or more normal environment. 
I would say as it relates to just March, we were very pleased with the kind of overall growth rates that we saw in March, and those were sequentially better on a monthly basis than, obviously, what we saw in February and January and particularly, some kind of more normalized kind of growth rate there. But that's the way I always frame it from an overall standpoint. Cameron, do you have anything to add on that?"

We assume that the trends that we're seeing in the business continue to flow through, through the balance of the year. We're encouraged by the performance in the first quarter and the underlying trends. Obviously, we remain very mindful of the fact that some markets around the globe are slower to recover or appear to be slower to recover from the pandemic than others, and those are markets that we have reasonably sizable businesses in. 
But I think as we sit here today, the trends in the business are quite favorable, and we're very optimistic about how we're positioned to perform through the balance of the year."

So you're stealing our thunder from the Investor Day that we're doing in September. But I would say that, and we'll set out a new target for what percentage of the business is coming from tech-enabled the next few years then. But I would say, generally, we crossed that 60% threshold last summer, 6 months earlier than we thought. These deals lay out a point or 2 to that number. But obviously, we're targeting well north of 70%, 75% of the company. Think about just directionally up from 60% last summer where we'd like to be longer term. And that's percentage of revenue, which means the vast majority of the growth, by definition, is coming from those areas. So we're really pleased. 
Our pipeline is full, and that includes a whole array of things, post-Zego, post-PAYONE, our pipeline remains full. It includes more software assets in it. So time will tell if we get those over the finish line. But I think you're directionally right in where we're going. 
I'll start with AWS and Cameron can comment on Google. Look, we couldn't have been more pleased with our relationship with AWS. We're absolutely on track for all the things that we outlined last August. We announced the relationship in the first place that stuff sells, we talked today about UMB, competitive takeaway, client somebody else for 3 decades. They're going to be our first instance in data and analytics in the cloud jointly with AWS. The Asian Bank we've referred to now, that testing environment is live, we'll go live in a year, another competitive takeaway. 
And I think what we said in our prepared remarks is we tripled the number of LOIs jointly with Amazon there in [indiscernible] stages today versus where we were at year-end of '20. So I think you're right to say that we're firing on all cylinders there, and we really couldn't be more pleased with the transition we've made there to cloud environment.

We're already in the midst of having conversations with a variety of medium- to enterprise-sized customers who are leveraging Google Cloud services today.

One, what stimulus have as it relates to our Business and Consumer business. And then the second, as it relates to stimulus across really all 3 of our segments. 
As it relates to stimulus in our Business and Consumer, it is a piece and the driving piece around us as it relates to our overall revenue outlook for that segment of moving to that kind of from mid-single digits kind of mid to high. So that's kind of -- you want to try to kind of quantify the impact of additional stimulus net of the effect that stimulus has on other products, on yield, the overall tax season picture, so that gives you kind of a quantification of kind of that difference between kind of mid single-digit growth for that business in that kind of more mid- to high kind of single-digit growth as it relates to just a revenue matter. And we've obviously kind of talked about the margin impact. You saw what we had for marginal impact in the first quarter. And then obviously that will play through in the second quarter the other direction as we grow over the stimulus in 2Q of last year of roughly kind of from a margin standpoint of kind of a similar size. 
I would say as it relates to stimulus across our overall business, I think time will tell. Clearly, you're getting some impact in volumes related to stimulus. We're just seeing it kind of across the board. I think it gets a little bit harder to kind of [ pick ] part that into the overall volume picture and say, well, how much is stimulus, how much is unemployment benefits, what all that kind of looks like. 
And so when we're looking at the overall volume landscape, obviously, we're taking some of that versus what we saw last year and the impact of stimulus and kind of embedding that into our overall picture. But outside of our business in consumer segment, it's very hard to kind of get discrete around what kind of revenue impact that's discretely having.

If you think about it and we've talked about this before, we're more exposed to credit than we are debit in our merchant business, and stimulus isn't really driving incremental credit spend. What we're really seeing in the Merchant business, I think, obviously, is the impact of the recovery as well as the fact that savings rates are at generational highs and there's a lot of pent-up demand. And obviously, we expect that trend to continue obviously as we progress through the end of 2021 and probably well into 2022, sitting here today. 
So certainly, on the margin, putting more dollars in consumers' pockets, it's going to be helpful to the Merchant business. But I don't view sort of the expansion we saw in Q4 to Q1 to really be driven predominantly by stimulus. I think it's more just a macro recovery in general and the fact that, obviously, consumers are very well positioned to be able to spend in the current environment as the recovery progresses."

We delivered a terrific second quarter, with each of adjusted net revenue, adjusted operating margin and adjusted earnings per share outperforming our targets. We are most pleased by the compounded rates of growth that we realized in the quarter, and are now forecasting for the full year compared to pre-pandemic 2019 levels. While we've not called back all of the impact of COVID-19 relative to our pre-pandemic expectations, we have made substantial progress and are far down that path. 
As we have throughout the pandemic, we continue to expand our competitive moat through leading strategic partnerships. First, we are excited to have agreed with our partners at Caixa Bank to acquire Bankia's payments businesses in Spain. Specifically, we will enhance our position in one of the most attractive acquiring markets in Europe, with the addition of Bankia's merchant business, consisting of roughly 100,000 customers in the region. This pending acquisition further enhances our distinctive distribution and will allow us to delight Bankia's customers with our market-leading technologies, providing us with significant cross-selling opportunities and deepening our presence with one of the leading institutions in Europe. 
This agreement follows our purchase of an additional 29% stake in our Comercia joint venture last October, which increased Global Payments ownership to 80% Additionally, our MoneyToPay joint venture has agreed to purchase Bankia's prepaid business, as we continue to execute on our strategy to expand and diversify our Netspend business into international markets. We expect both of these transactions to close in the fourth quarter. 
Second, we are delighted to announce that we have entered into a new collaboration with Amazon Web Services, AWS, for a unique distribution and cutting-edge technologies at NetSpend to substantially increase our target addressable markets and accelerate our strategy across our 3 pillars of digitization, internationalization and B2B expansion. Much as that we have done with our issuer business, we plan to leverage the AWS partner network and dedicated partner development specialists to bring NetSpend's B2C and B2B digital payment solutions, including program management, to reward a base of Neobanks, fintech start-ups and other e-commerce players, as well as to new geographies. This partnership will also provide an industry-leading cloud-based processing platform for Netspend's customers to access cutting-edge technologies with greater speed to market, security and flexibility. We are thrilled to deepen our go-to-market collaboration with one of the world's largest technology companies to continue our disruption of these markets. 
Third, we are pleased to have closed our acquisition of Zego in June, further capitalizing on the convergence of software and payments in one of the largest and most attractive vertical markets worldwide. As I highlighted last quarter, real estate is the quintessence of the type of market that we seek: sizable, global in scope, fragmented, and ripe for further software, digital commerce and payment penetration. And COVID-19 has accelerated the underlying trends that make this $6.5 billion target addressable market so attractive as we continue to expand our software-driven footprint. It is my great pleasure to welcome Zego team members to Global Payments. 
In addition to these strategic accomplishments, we produced yet another outstanding quarter of results. Since we began running the company in 2013, our main focus has been on 2 areas: enabling diverse, distinctive and defensible distribution; and developing market-leading technologies. We could not be more pleased with the momentum across our businesses, evident in our second quarter results and reflected in our increased guidance for 2021. It's worth noting that we have delivered the greatest value creation in our history over the last 8 years despite numerous new market entrants during the entirety of that period, public and private. And we have generated consistent financial and operating outperformance through a variety of macroeconomic cycles, including most recently, the financial impact of the first worldwide pandemic in over 100 years. The results are self-evident. 
We have record performance in the second quarter in our Merchant segment on several bases: absolute, sequential and year-over-year while, also producing strong growth versus pre-pandemic levels. Simply put, our payments businesses continue to significantly outperform and gain share, fueled by our long-held technology-enabled focus and solid ongoing execution. 
On a more granular basis, we saw a strong double-digit growth in new sales in both Global Payments Integrated and our vertical market businesses in the quarter. And our U.S. relationship-led business again achieved record new sales. This marks the third quarter out of the last 4 in which we have achieved such a high level of performance. Rather than impede our strategy, that pandemics for further share gains and catalyze the digital strategies we have had in place since 2013. 
Our omnichannel businesses accelerated yet again in the second quarter, with growth in excess of 20%, despite lapping the enhanced shift toward e-commerce globally that began with the start of the pandemic in early 2020. New customer signings this quarter include Foot Locker as a key customer in Europe that will leverage our unified commerce platform, or UCP, to modernize its payment acceptance capabilities. We are pleased to have also signed new global UCP partnerships with Hunter Douglas and Euronet Worldwide subsidiary, Z.com. 
Our ability to deliver a single API solution virtually around the world has been a key driver of our success. And our unique multinational footprint in both the virtual and the physical world has proven to be a differentiator versus both legacy and new market entrants. 
Within our vertical market businesses, we had a number of new key customer wins for a quick service restaurant business, including Freshers, Big Boy, Crystals and the FiesaGroup, while AMD and TouchNet continue to deliver record revenue performance, as they have throughout the pandemic. Notably, TouchNet continues to add new marquee colleges and universities domestically and internationally, including the Arkansas State University System and Sheldon College in Canada this quarter. 
We're also making great progress in our partnership with Google and remain on track to board Google as a merchant customer this quarter and expect to launch our business product that integrates Google solutions in our digital portal environment in the fourth quarter. 
Our issuer business delivered growth beyond the high end of our targeted long-term range. We are pleased to have signed a new multiyear partnership with Banco Carrefour in Brazil, the financial services arm of the country's leading supercenter retail chain, to provide a range of technologies for its credit card and digital accounts as well as to handle [ on us ] acquiring transactions. Recall that transaction optimization is one of our key post-merger initiatives. More to come on that at our investor conference. 
We also signed a letter of intent with a large global financial institution and long-standing partner in a new market in Lat Am that will mark another significant milestone for us in our continued expansion into the region. 
Further, we executed a multiyear extension with the U.K.'s largest retailer, TESSCO, enabled by our shared digital modernization vision for the future. 
Finally, we are pleased to have extended our relationship with Mercury Financial for a range of digital technologies. This relationship serves as further proof that our industry-leading platform offers the agility to support leading-edge fintech companies. 
TSYS recently launched a strategic go-to-market partnership with PricewaterhouseCoopers or PwC. As part of the TSYS partner program, we expect that our collaboration with PwC will diversify and expand our distribution and allow us to jointly offer innovative solutions, expertise and execution capabilities to clients of all sizes, across the full spectrum of Neobanks, fintech, start-ups and program managers. Again, diversification of distribution has been one of our key objectives since 2013, and we are using the same playbook with TSYS that we have successfully deployed in the past. 
We continue to capitalize on the broad and deep pipeline we have a good fortune to have in our issuer business. Today, we have 15 letters of intent with institutions worldwide, 6 of which are competitive takeaways. 
Turning to our unique collaboration. We now have 20 active prospects in our pipeline with AWS, up from a dozen last quarter and 4 at the end of 2020. These include a mix of new financial technology entrants and other nontraditional issuers in addition to large financial institutions. As growth accelerates in this market, we believe that we are the ones doing the disrupting. 
While buying out solutions may seem null to some, we have, in fact, been providing leading technologies to that segment of the market for decades in both our issuer and merchant segments. And we continue to deliver innovative installment payments products for customers. We are currently enabling our merchant customers in Canada in partnership with DesJardins with the Visa installment solution. CIBC will also launch a combined TSYS Visa installment solution in early 2022. And we signed a global referral agreement with Mastercard, supporting installment payments in June. 
Finally, in our Business and Consumer segment, we expect a unique co-sale arrangement with AWS to expand our distribution capabilities, again, much like we've been doing since 2013. And together with our issuer business, we intend to further disrupt the program management segment in the near future. This is yet another example of application of our strategies to legacy TSYS businesses, and we expect the same successes here as we have generated in other contexts.

Our financial performance in the second quarter of 2021 demonstrated meaningful sequential momentum and exceeded our expectations. These results highlight outstanding execution on our differentiated strategy of technology enablement. Spe",1294,"Thanks, Jeff. 
Our financial performance in the second quarter of 2021 demonstrated meaningful sequential momentum and exceeded our expectations. These results highlight outstanding execution on our differentiated strategy of technology enablement. 
Specifically, we delivered adjusted net revenue of $1.94 billion, representing 28% growth compared to the prior year and 10% growth compared to 2019. Adjusted operating margin for the second quarter was 41.8%, a 480 basis point improvement from the prior year despite the return of certain costs we temporarily reduced at the onset of the pandemic. The net result was adjusted earnings per share of $2.04 for the quarter, an increase of 56% compared to the prior year and a 35% improvement from the same period in 2019. 
Taking a closer look at our performance by segment. 
Merchant Solutions achieved adjusted net revenue of $1.29 billion for the second quarter, a 42% improvement from the prior year. We delivered an adjusted operating margin of 48.5% in this segment, an increase of 750 basis points from the same period in 2020, as we continue to benefit from the recovery and our improving technology-enabled business mix. 
We are pleased that our acquiring businesses globally generated 46% adjusted net revenue growth compared to the second quarter of 2020, led by strength in the U.S. Notably, our U.S. acquiring business, which includes our integrated and relationship-led channels, grew approximately 25% compared to the same period in 2019. These results were led by our integrated business, which produced a stellar quarter, generating a 53% adjusted net revenue improvement compared to 2020 and 35% growth relative to 2019. 
As for our own software businesses in the U.S., we are delighted with the overall portfolio delivered growth of roughly 30% compared to the prior year and achieved solid sequential improvement relative to the first quarter. As Jeff mentioned, our vertical markets businesses continue to see positive bookings trends, providing us with a favorable tailwind for the second half of 2021. 
Additionally, our worldwide e-commerce and omnichannel businesses saw growth in excess of 20% year-on-year, as our value proposition, including our unified commerce platform, or UCP, continues to resonate with customers. 
Regarding our international businesses, while these markets have been a bit slower to recover compared to the U.S. on an absolute basis, our portfolio of businesses across Europe and Asia contribute favorably to our overall merchant adjusted net revenue as a growth matter compared to 2020. These businesses also returned to growth on a combined basis when compared to 2019.  
Moving to Issuer Solutions. We are pleased to have delivered a record $446 million in adjusted net revenue for the second quarter, marking an 8% improvement from the prior year period. This strong performance was driven by the ongoing recovery in transaction volumes across many of our markets, while non-volume-based revenue increased mid-single digits during the period, led by our Output Services business, which grew at roughly 10% for the quarter. 
Our issuer business also achieved record second quarter adjusted operating income. And adjusted segment operating margin expanded 110 basis points from the prior year, also reaching a new second quarter record of 43.9%, as we continue to benefit from our efforts to drive efficiencies in this business. This is an impressive result, particularly given we achieved margin expansion of 640 basis points in the second quarter of 2020. Additionally, our issuer team signed 5 long-term contract extensions during the quarter, and our strong pipeline bodes well for future continued momentum going forward. 
Finally, our Business and Consumer Solutions segment delivered adjusted net revenue of $227 million, representing growth of 5%, despite lapping the benefit of the 2020 CARES Act last year. As a reminder, this business delivered double-digit growth in the second quarter of 2020, driven in part by our support of the disbursement of over $1.4 billion in stimulus funds during that period. Adjusted operating margin for this segment was 26.9%, which was also ahead of our expectations.  
The outstanding performance we delivered across our businesses serves as a further proof point that we continue to gain share as well as the alignment of our strategy with the accelerating digital trends coming out of the pandemic. We are also pleased that our integration continues to progress well. And we have now executed actions allowing for the achievement of annual run rate expense synergies of at least $400 million and annual run rate revenue synergies of at least $150 million that we have been targeting exactly as we said we would do and despite the pandemic. We will continue to deliver additional expense and revenue synergies over the coming periods as our efficiency efforts continue and we leverage the collaborative growth opportunities across our businesses. 
From a cash flow standpoint, we generated second quarter adjusted free cash flow of roughly $452 million or a little over $1 billion through the first 6 months and continue to expect adjusted free cash flow in excess of $2 billion for the year. We reinvested approximately $130 million in capital expenditures during the quarter and continue to expect capital expenditures in the $500 million to $600 million range for the full year. 
In June, we successfully closed our acquisition of Zego consistent with our expectations. And we expect this business will contribute roughly $50 million of adjusted net revenue to our Merchant segment in 2021. 
I would like to echo Jeff's excitement regarding the agreements we announced today to acquire Bankia's payments businesses in Spain, and we expect these transactions to close in the fourth quarter. Further, we remain on track to complete our purchase of Worldline's Pay One business in Austria in the second half of this year. 
We are pleased to have continued to return cash to our shareholders this quarter, with the repurchase of 1.5 million of our shares for approximately $290 million. Following our balanced deployment of capital this quarter, we ended the period with roughly $3.3 billion of liquidity and a leverage position of roughly 2.6x on a net debt basis, which is flat from the last quarter as expected. And this leaves us with continuing ample capacity going forward. 
Based on our current expectations for the continued global recovery, we are again increasing our guidance for adjusted net revenue to now be in a range of $7.7 billion to $7.73 billion, reflecting growth of 14% to 15% over 2020. We continue to expect adjusted operating margin expansion of up to 250 basis points compared to 2020 levels on a stand-alone basis. As a reminder, Zego will be a modest headwind to the upper bound of our margin target now that it is closed, as it does not currently operate at our margin levels despite having already achieved rule of 40 status. 
At the segment level, we are increasing our expectations for Merchant Solutions adjusted net revenue growth to be around 20% from high teens previously, which assumes the current pace of recovery continues worldwide. This marks the second consecutive quarter that we have raised our outlook for our merchant business. 
We are also increasing our outlook for our issuer business and now expect growth to be in the low to mid-single-digit range for 2021, up from our prior outlook from low single-digit growth. 
We continue to expect our Business and Consumer segment to achieve mid- to high single-digit growth for the full year, consistent with our long-term growth target for NetSpend. As a reminder, we increased our guidance for this segment on our first quarter earnings call in May despite lapping the impact of the 2020 Cares Act. Moving to nonoperating items. We continue to expect net interest expense to be slightly lower [Audio Gap]

And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff."

As we look ahead to next month, it is worth reflecting on how much we have evolved our business. Throughout much of the last 8 years, we have witnessed a multitude of new market entrants, newly public companies, shifting modes of competition and macroeconomic cycles to numerous account. Some said a number of times over the near last decade that our best days were behind us. The facts say quite the opposite. In fact, we have delivered the greatest value creation in our history during that period, and we believe we are poised today to continue our track record of outperformance. The second quarter and our raised guidance today are the most recent examples. Our rates of revenue growth and bookings trends underscore sustained share gains despite managing through an unprecedented crisis. One proof point, we now expect our U.S. payments business to roughly reach its original growth target for 2021 based on 2019 goals. In short, we grew right through the pandemic. More to follow in September. 
The reason for our success are straightforward: our distinctive strategies. The technology investments we have made over many years, the support of our market-leading partners and customers, our execution consistency, and the quality of our team members have allowed us to significantly expand our competitive moat. As painful as it has been, COVID-19 has reaffirmed the wisdom of our long-held beliefs in the digitization of our businesses. We believe that the best is yet to come. You can judge that for yourselves next month.

So I would say it's a few things, and I would start with just the efficacy of our strategy. Obviously, the technology-enabled businesses that we've been investing in for the last 7, 8-plus years now really continue to lead the way for growth across the business, including our integrated business, which grew 53% in the quarter and up 35% versus 2019 levels. 
In addition, our e-comm and omni business grew well over 20% this quarter. Again, topping performance from last year where it also grew in the high teens level. So again, relative to 2019, continuing to see very strong growth across the e-com and omnichannel of the business. 
So for me, it's really the strategy that we've been deploying that's driving growth. And I think we continue to see a lot of tailwinds in those businesses looking forward through the balance of 2021 and heading into 2022 and then beyond. I don't know if you want to add any more specific comments on that."

So we do not have share repurchases in the guide as a go-forward matter for the back half of the year. But we are always opportunistic as it relates to share repurchase. And so we want to make sure we have the capacity to execute if we choose to do that.

As we also said in the last quarter, Zego is a technology and software-driven business, very consistent with our strategy, particularly given the size of the real estate target addressable market. Yes. Notwithstanding that, going back to the premise of your question, that deal was not dilutive. And I think we announced it was immediately accretive, although really no discernible impact on earnings, but nonetheless, it's not dilutive. -- we look at many things. So it's target a what we would or wouldn't do in the abstract. But I would say is, since we've been burning the company in the last 8 years, we've not done a dilutive deal. I don't expect us to that's not the mindset we have shareholders and owners and managers of the business. So I really don't expect our strategy to change."

But largely speaking, we're expecting roughly 3Q and 4Q to be largely similar across our businesses. As we have said at the beginning of the year, we had expected the back half of the year to return to a much more normal kind of state. And so clearly, there are some reopenings that will continue to benefit kind of 3Q into 4Q as countries around the world kind of reopen from some of the closures. 
You're exactly right, Ashwin, as it relates to some of our vertical markets businesses. As I just commented, we're very pleased with the growth we saw in 2Q, but we would see more meaningful growth on those businesses in the back half of the year as we have more reopening and kind of more tailwind kind of impact as it relates to those businesses. So yes, those would be the dynamics between kind of Q2, Q3 to Q4 certainly in Merchant. 
And there wouldn't be anything I would necessarily call out across the other 2 businesses. Obviously, very pleased to raise the revenue guide on our issuer business, low single digits to low to mid-single digit, so talks about kind of improving fundamentals in the back half of the year there and pretty static state as it relates to our business in consumer once kind of the stimulus impact has been netted out of the first half and going into the back half.

As Paul highlighted, July sequentially is better than June as a trend matter. So I think we feel good about how things are continuing to progress. And those businesses are poised to continue to see strength in the back half of the year. 
If you just look at the overall guide from the Merchant segment, that roughly 20% growth in 2021 versus 2020. But back couple of quarters, kind of have to be around that same level to make the averages work for the whole year. So that gives you a sense as to how the business is performing, again, against tougher comps in Q3 and Q4 than we certainly faced in the second quarter. So I think that should give you a little bit of a sense as to the momentum that we have in those businesses. 
To Paul's point around the vertical market businesses, in particular, obviously, schools once we get back into, obviously, a normal school environment, hopefully quite high normal school environment here in August and September, those businesses -- that business is -- in particular, is poised to see a rebound in the back half of the year, as well as active. Active has seen very strong booking trends. Many of those events are occurring in the back half of 2021. So I think we feel very good about how that business is poised to recover. And again, advanced MD and TouchNet has continue to grow right through the pandemic, obviously, a double-digit pace throughout 2020 and 2021. So those businesses are obviously in a very healthy position overall. But getting a nice tailwind from active in schools in particular in the back half of the year will help the vertical market business continue to recover as an overall matter."

Let me first start with NetSpend because actually our new announcement today. It follows a very similar, I think, format, the issuer announcement almost exactly a year ago [ to ] today. But the one thing I will point out is that in NetSpend is that there's primarily a focus on our part and Amazon's part on B2B distribution, and I'd say, in particular, on program management with the scale that we have directed at neobanks, fintechs and start-ups. So while it is a similar template, it's a very targeted initiative, very much focused on B2B. And obviously, that's something on September 8 at our Virtual Investor Day that we'll be talking a lot about. 
In terms of your question on how we're doing on the issuers [ 5 ] book, we're really pleased we disclosed again yet today as we have for really the last year plus, what our LOI pipeline looks like outside of Amazon and with Amazon. I think what we said today is we have similarly 20 letters of intent with our colleagues over at AWS. And that's for the whole spectrum of potential issuers, again, including neobanks, fintechs and start-ups, as well as traditional financial institutions. 
And to give an update there, the one we singled out in Asia is in testing already and is live on a beta basis. And we expect to be fully live by the end of this calendar year. And that -- to give you a sense of progress, Ashwin, that 20, I think, is up from 4 at the end of calendar 2020. So we quintupled the number of LOIs that we have with neobanks, fintech start-ups and financial institutions, AWS really in a 6 -- through the end of second quarter, so kind of on a 6-month basis. So we couldn't be more pleased, and the fact that we're doing more business with AWS now in the form of Netspend should be a recognition, not just internally, but certainly of how happy we are with how things are progressing."

I think credit card account growth is as high as it's been, I think, since 2010. And obviously, on the yields of the pandemic, in a more normal operating environment, we clearly see credit outperforming. To your point, debit clearly outperformed in the midst of the pandemic. And by the way, a lot of that was prepaid debit as stimulus was funded on those types of accounts. So a lot of the debit growth was prepaid. But certainly, coming out of the pandemic, getting back to a normal operating environment, we would expect credit to drive growth and really outperform. And I think we see a lot of tailwinds, particularly for our merchant business, as a result of that heading in the back half of 2021 into 2022 as a result of that.

It's really, as we said before, on both the TYSYS side and the global side really around the world. So we've got a lot of respect for PayPal. We think they're a terrific company. 
As it relates specifically to iZettle and the physical point of sale. So iZettle in Europe for quite some time, David. In fact, when PayPal to the deal, I think it was mostly all European. Now they've announced, as you're implying, some migration in the United States. So our business is in Europe, let's just use the U.K. and London as one specific example, iZettle been there for some time. Our business has outperformed for many years throughout that period, both pre, post PayPal acquiring  iZettle and post. As it relates to the United States market, look, that market is competitive today. It was competitive yesterday. It's going to be even more competitive tomorrow. As Cameron pointed out, our growth in our U.S. business, just around the same growth as our worldwide acquiring business, around 46%. And it compares to the Visas and MasterCards, worldwide growth was like 35%. But for Visa and 33% for Mastercard. So whether iZettle was in Europe or iZettle Was in North America over the last number of years, certainly has in place anything like it been in terms of our growth. And I think what we'll be talking about next Monday at our virtual investor conference is the resilience of our business, our market share gains. Some of that, as you readily pointed out, was in our prepared remarks. But notwithstanding the coming and going, have many new smart competitors. Our business has been resilient re-dynamic and post, and we'll take you through the math and why we think that's going to continue. So it's a great company. But at the end of the day, I don't think that's all revision of our strategy when I know that."

Maybe I'll kick off and ask Paul to fill in some of the more explicit details. 
But if I step back and kind of think about where we are today, if you look at our pure acquiring businesses globally, they were up roughly 19% in the second quarter versus 2019 levels. In the U.S., that number was 25%. So again, I think we feel from a pure acquiring standpoint, we're on a pretty good trajectory. Now what still needs to come back to kind of get to '22 a more normalized rate of growth relative to 2019 or, to say it differently, where we would have been absent the pandemic, well, Europe is growing relative to 2019, but it's certainly growing at a pace lower than that which we've seen in the U.S. market. So Europe grew somewhere in the high single digits versus 2019 for the second quarter. So we still need a little more tailwind from Europe fully recovering. As you know, the U.K. didn't open up until mid-July. So as we get to the back half of the year, we're expecting to see a little more tailwind in Europe as it relates to growth and particularly relative to 2019 trends. And then, of course, Asia, which is a small part of the business, but it's still lagging relative to 2019 levels, largely because many markets continue to struggle with the pandemic remain closed. And of course, cross-border activity in Asia is very depressed and continues to be depressed because of the pandemic. 
So as we think about 2022, think the U.S. is on a pretty good trajectory to get back to something reasonably close to what we would have been absent the pandemic, given the outsized growth and the momentum we have in that business. We need Europe to continue to improve as the lockdowns and markets begin to reopen and you see more cross-border travel pick up. And then I'd say the same thing is true for Asia just given where it sits relative to the pandemic. 
I think the vertical markets are well poised to get back to reasonable levels compared to 2019 as we continue to see, again, a recovery in schools and a recovery in active in the back half of the year as those markets in particular reopen. 
So Paul, I don't know if you'd add anything more to that, but I think that gives a pretty good overview of the Merchant business."

But I would say, in particular, the non-U.S. businesses echo a lot of what Cameron said. So we only recently, which is to say really the second quarter heading into July and continuing in July, we've only recently seen kind of a reopening for issuer purposes of a lot of markets outside the United States. That will be a favorable comparison data, to answer your question, for the first half, obviously, of next year. And I'd add to that commercial card. So while commercial card, not surprisingly, is up versus '20, it's really not up versus '19. So I think it's a pretty good picture, Dave, heading into '22 on the issuer side as well because you do have those 2 elements of broader reopening outside the United States and commercial card relative to '19 starting normalize, that should be favorable tailwinds for the issuer business. And lastly, I'd say an issue we described again today is Ashwin asked. But those LOIs start to kick in. We start getting in the back half of 2022. We obviously also had announced Truist probably about 1.5 years ago now. I think we said at the time that's the back half 2022 event, which we continue to believe.

Now having said that, at the end of the day, we do think it's a great business. I think Paul alluded to this in his commentary. So if you think about it, it's already a rule of 40 growth really beyond that. So if you think about what we guided to when we did the deal at the time, kind of a double-digit organic revenue growth rate, with margins into the 20s. That's how you get to the rule of 40 number.

We certainly do look at -- and the economics obviously have worked out just fine in response to Dave's question too just a second ago. So I think we've got a plenty pipeline and certainly more for us to do. 
We do balance though our view of M&A with where the capital markets are and what our view of intrinsic value in our share price and everything else. So we have bought back about $1.5 billion of stock. Obviously not mutually exclusive. We did both at the same time, $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion. And we just reoff the authorization back to $1.5 billion. That's not in our guidance. Obviously, we balance our view as to where we would like to be in terms of growth than anything else. But I think it's important to consider that we think we're in a pretty healthy position heading into 2022 and the rest of '21 without more deals. So we think we're kind of where we want to be. As a strategy matter, I think we feel really kind of much the same. So there's plan stuff that we look at. But I can't think of a deal that we didn't do, James, because we said, gee, it's too expensive or it's not accretive enough or those other things. If we can't add more value with the strategic buyer, the thing that we're doing in terms of revenue, margin, earnings, then we're just not going to do it.

So as you think about the comments we made earlier as it relates to July, we did see sequential improvement in July relative to June. So I think we still feel very good about the momentum of the recovery overall. To be very clear, I don't think we've seen any real impact yet from the Delta variant. Obviously, we're monitoring it very closely, and it's a fluid environment. But I would say sitting here today, based on data that we have through the end of last week, the volume trends, again, for July were an improvement over what we saw in June sequentially most of the markets around the globe in which we operate, and particularly now in markets where we're seeing a reopening that's more recent, the U.K., Canada, for example. Obviously, I think they're poised to see stronger volume recoveries as we enter the back half of the year. 
So look, I don't think there's a lot of appetite for more widespread lockdowns, particularly here in the U.S., as it relates to the Delta variant. Markets outside of the U.S. may react differently. But again, for our business, those are going to be relatively small impacts. We're most focused on the U.S. as the 75% of our business.

That market grew the domestic volume in Spain, as a volume matter, grew 30% in the second quarter and 15% over 2019, again, despite continued obviously, restrictions throughout the country as a result of the pandemic. So the underlying secular trends in Spain remain incredibly attractive, which makes the timing for the Bankia acquisition particularly attractive for us as well. Bankia consists of about $100,000, predominantly small to medium-sized merchants, although they do venture more into the wires category as well. But I think the interesting thing about the Bankia portfolio it is more skewed towards domestic volume. So again, I think it's a really attractive addition to our joint venture.

The second thing I'd say, you saw our announcement and the expansion of our AWS relationship today into NetSpend. But whether it's at the issuing business or at the NetSpend business, we're very focused on program management. So to answer your second question, I think we need to be more vocal on program management. I think, historically, most of the revenue, the growth that we get in the issuing business is really with financial institutions and generally inside the United States and North America Western Europe, larger financial institutions. Key focal point of ours pre and now, of course, post AWS, both at NetSpend as well as issuer, is on program management.

So we really got 3 legs of the stool our strategy is in NetSpend. First is ongoing digitization. And I think NetSpend had re-dynamic a pretty good digital footprint and not surprised if anyone on the phone. The pandemic has really accelerated that. And I would say kind of high 20s, 30% of interactions today with consumers with Netspend are done online, being buying and spending resending with the card online, and we certainly expect AWS, of course, to continue to accelerate that given their footprint. The second is what I just described in response to your first question, which is really B2B and program management, but I'd be remiss if I didn't mention, it also includes IrwayDashta access, pay cards in our TIP solutions. So those are all obviously also in play on B2B. And the third leg of the stool is really what we get at most narrowly, which is internationalization. So a piece of that is MoneytoPay, the second piece we announced today with Bankia because that also includes a prepaid business, a debtor business as well. And the short answer to your question is it's gone really well. Our thesis on internationalization is, given who Global Payments is, the 38 countries we operate in, particularly on the acquiring side, as well as the relationships we have in those markets, a great example is Continental Europe with Spain, it allows us uniquely to expand what was really a U.S.-only business, which it is today for NetSpend and for some of the competitors and really bring it overseas. And now we're approaching 9 or 10 months post the initial closing of the MoneytoPay a JV with Caixa. I can tell you that we're running ahead of what we expected. I think our thesis that we can bring our management, our products, our technologies to those markets has rung true, the thesis that those markets are under-penetrated. Relative to the United States, it's also true. We have seen some benefit there on government spending too as we all kind of emerge from the pandemic, not just here in the United States, but overseas. So it's really working out better than we hoped, and we're really pleased to be where we are, especially with the kind of partners that we have."

So as we move forward in time, with AWS, it makes it easier to bring technology, product capability to the markets outside the U.S. as we continue the internationalization strategy for the NetSpend business."

We delivered a terrific second quarter with each of adjusted net revenue, adjusted operating margin and adjusted earnings per share outperforming our targets. We are most pleased by the compounded rates of growth that we realized in the quarter and are now forecasting for the full year compared to pre-pandemic 2019 levels. While we've not called back all of the impact of COVID-19 relative to our pre-pandemic expectations, we have made substantial progress and are far down that path.  
As we have throughout the pandemic, we continue to expand our competitive moat through leading strategic partnerships. First, we are excited to have agreed with our partners at CaixaBank to acquire Bankia's payments businesses in Spain. Specifically, we will enhance our position in one of the most attractive acquiring markets in Europe with the addition of Bankia's merchant business, consisting of roughly 100,000 customers in the region. This pending acquisition further enhances our distinctive distribution and will allow us to delight Bankia's customers with our market-leading technologies, providing us with significant cross-selling opportunities and deepening our presence with one of the leading institutions in Europe.  
This agreement follows our purchase of an additional 29% stake in our Comercia joint venture last October, which increased Global Payments' ownership to 80%. Additionally, our MoneyToPay joint venture has agreed to purchase Bankia's prepaid business as we continue to execute on our strategy to expand and diversify our Netspend business into international markets. We expect both of these transactions to close in the fourth quarter.  
Second, we are delighted to announce that we have entered into a new collaboration with Amazon Web Services, AWS, for a unique distribution and cutting-edge technologies at Netspend to substantially increase our target addressable markets and accelerate our strategy across our 3 pillars of digitization, internationalization and B2B expansion. Much as that we have done with our issuer business, we plan to leverage the AWS partner network and dedicated partner development specialists to bring Netspend's B2C and B2B digital payment solutions, including program management, toward a base of neobanks, fintech start-ups and other e-commerce players as well as to new geographies. This partnership will also provide an industry-leading cloud-based processing platform for Netspend's customers to access cutting-edge technologies with greater speed to market, security and flexibility. We are thrilled to deepen our go-to-market collaboration with one of the world's largest technology companies to continue our disruption of these markets.  
Third, we are pleased to have closed our acquisition of Zego in June, further capitalizing on the convergence of software and payments in one of the largest and most attractive vertical markets worldwide. As I highlighted last quarter, real estate is the quintessence of the type of market that we seek: sizable; global in scope; fragmented and ripe for further software, digital commerce and payment penetration. And COVID-19 has accelerated the underlying trends that make this $6.5 billion target addressable market so attractive as we continue to expand our software-driven footprint. It is my great pleasure to welcome Zego team members to Global Payments.  
In addition to these strategic accomplishments, we produced yet another outstanding quarter of results. Since we began running the company in 2013, our main focus has been on 2 areas: enabling diverse, distinctive and defensible distribution; and developing market-leading technologies. We could not be more pleased with the momentum across our businesses, evident in our second quarter results and reflected in our increased guidance for 2021. It's worth noting that we have delivered the greatest value creation in our history over the last 8 years despite numerous new market entrants during the entirety of that period, public and private. And we have generated consistent financial and operating outperformance through a variety of macroeconomic cycles, including, most recently, the financial impact of the first worldwide pandemic in over 100 years. 
The results are self-evident. We have record performance in the second quarter in our merchant segment on several bases, absolute, sequential and year-over-year, while also producing strong growth versus pre-pandemic levels. Simply put, our payments businesses continue to significantly outperform and gain share, fueled by our long-held technology-enabled focus and solid ongoing execution.  
On a more granular basis, we saw a strong double-digit growth in new sales in both Global Payments Integrated and our vertical market businesses in the quarter, and our U.S. relationship-led business again achieved record new sales. This marks the third quarter out of the last 4 in which we have achieved such a high level of performance. Rather than impede our strategy, the pandemic spurred further share gains and catalyzed the digital strategies we have had in place since 2013.  
Our omnichannel businesses accelerated yet again in the second quarter with growth in excess of 20% despite lapping the enhanced shift toward e-commerce globally that began with the start of the pandemic in early 2020. New customer signings this quarter include Foot Locker as a key customer in Europe that will leverage our unified commerce platform or UCP to modernize its payment acceptance capabilities. We are pleased to have also signed new global UCP partnerships with Hunter Douglas and Euronet Worldwide subsidiary, xe.com. Our ability to deliver a single API solution virtually around the world has been a key driver of our success. And our unique multinational footprint in both the virtual and the physical world has proven to be a differentiator versus both legacy and new market entrants.  
Within our vertical market businesses, we had a number of new key customer wins for our quick-service restaurant business, including Frisch's Big Boy, Krystal's and the Fiesta Group, while AMD and TouchNet continue to deliver record revenue performance as they have throughout the pandemic. Notably, TouchNet continues to add new marquee colleges and universities domestically and internationally, including the Arkansas State University system and Sheridan College in Canada this quarter. We're also making great progress in our partnership with Google and remain on track to board Google as a merchant customer this quarter and expect to launch our [ Run and Grow My Business ] product that integrates Google solutions in our digital portal environment in the fourth quarter.  
Our issuer business delivered growth beyond the high end of our targeted long-term range. We are pleased to have signed a new multiyear partnership with Banco Carrefour in Brazil, the financial services arm of the country's leading supercenter retail chain, to provide a range of technologies for its credit card and digital accounts as well as to handle on-us acquiring transactions. Recall that transaction optimization is one of our key post-merger initiatives. More to come on that at our investor conference.  
We also signed a letter of intent with a large global financial institution and long-standing partner in a new market in Lat Am that will mark another significant milestone for us in our continued expansion into the region. Further, we executed a multiyear extension with the U.K.'s largest retailer, Tesco, enabled by our shared digital modernization vision for the future. Finally, we are pleased to have extended our relationship with Mercury Financial for a range of digital technologies. This relationship serves as further proof that our industry-leading platform offers the agility to support leading-edge fintech companies. 
TSYS recently launched a strategic go-to-market partnership with PricewaterhouseCoopers or PwC. As part of the TSYS partner program, we expect that our collaboration with PwC will diversify and expand our distribution and allow us to jointly offer innovative solutions, expertise and execution capabilities to clients of all sizes, across the full spectrum of neobanks, fintech, start-ups and program managers. Again, diversification of distribution has been one of our key objectives since 2013, and we are using the same playbook with TSYS that we have successfully deployed in the past.  
We continue to capitalize on the broad and deep pipeline we have a good fortune to have in our issuer business. Today, we have 15 letters of intent with institutions worldwide, 6 of which are competitive takeaways.  
Turning to our unique collaboration. We now have 20 active prospects in our pipeline with AWS, up from a dozen last quarter and 4 at the end of 2020. These include a mix of new financial technology entrants and other nontraditional issuers in addition to large financial institutions. As growth accelerates in this market, we believe that we are the ones doing the disrupting.  
While buy now, pay later solutions may seem novel to some, we have, in fact, been providing leading technologies to that segment of the market for decades in both our issuer and merchant segments, and we continue to deliver innovative installment payments products for customers. We are currently enabling our merchant customers in Canada in partnership with Desjardins with a Visa installment solution. CIBC will also launch a combined TSYS, Visa installment solution in early 2022, and we signed a global referral agreement with Mastercard supporting installment payments in June.  
Finally, in our business and consumer segment, we expect a unique co-sale arrangement with AWS to expand our distribution capabilities, again, much like we've been doing since 2013. And together with our issuer business, we intend to further disrupt the program management segment in the near future. This is yet another example of application of our strategies to legacy TSYS businesses, and we expect the same successes here as we have generated in other contexts. Paul?"

Our financial performance in the second quarter of 2021 demonstrated meaningful sequential momentum and exceeded our expectations. These results highlight outstanding execution on our differentiated strategy of technology enablement. Specifi",1376,"Thanks, Jeff. Our financial performance in the second quarter of 2021 demonstrated meaningful sequential momentum and exceeded our expectations. These results highlight outstanding execution on our differentiated strategy of technology enablement. Specifically, we delivered adjusted net revenue of $1.94 billion, representing 28% growth compared to the prior year and 10% growth compared to 2019. Adjusted operating margin for the second quarter was 41.8%, a 480 basis point improvement from the prior year despite the return of certain costs we temporarily reduced at the onset of the pandemic. The net result was adjusted earnings per share of $2.04 for the quarter, an increase of 56% compared to the prior year and a 35% improvement from the same period in 2019.  
Taking a closer look at our performance by segment. Merchant Solutions achieved adjusted net revenue of $1.29 billion for the second quarter, a 42% improvement from the prior year. We delivered an adjusted operating margin of 48.5% in this segment, an increase of 750 basis points from the same period in 2020, as we continue to benefit from the recovery and our improving technology-enabled business mix.  
We are pleased that our acquiring businesses globally generated 46% adjusted net revenue growth compared to the second quarter of 2020, led by strength in the U.S. Notably, our U.S. acquiring business, which includes our integrated and relationship-led channels, grew approximately 25% compared to the same period in 2019. These results were led by our integrated business, which produced a stellar quarter, generating a 53% adjusted net revenue improvement compared to 2020 and 35% growth relative to 2019. 
As for our own software businesses in the U.S., we are delighted with the overall portfolio delivered growth of roughly 30% compared to the prior year and achieved solid sequential improvement relative to the first quarter. As Jeff mentioned, our vertical markets businesses continue to see positive bookings trends, providing us with a favorable tailwind for the second half of 2021. Additionally, our worldwide e-commerce and omnichannel businesses saw growth in excess of 20% year-on-year as our value proposition, including our unified commerce platform or UCP, continues to resonate with customers.  
Regarding our international businesses, while these markets have been a bit slower to recover compared to the U.S. on an absolute basis, our portfolio of businesses across Europe and Asia contribute favorably to our overall merchant adjusted net revenue as a growth matter compared to 2020. These businesses also returned to growth on a combined basis when compared to 2019.   
Moving to Issuer Solutions. We are pleased to have delivered a record $446 million in adjusted net revenue for the second quarter, marking an 8% improvement from the prior year period. This strong performance was driven by the ongoing recovery in transaction volumes across many of our markets while non-volume-based revenue increased mid-single digits during the period, led by our output service business, which grew at roughly 10% for the quarter. 
Our issuer business also achieved record second quarter adjusted operating income, and adjusted segment operating margin expanded 110 basis points from the prior year, also reaching a new second quarter record of 43.9% as we continue to benefit from our efforts to drive efficiencies in this business. This is an impressive result, particularly given we achieved margin expansion of 640 basis points in the second quarter of 2020. Additionally, our issuer team signed 5 long-term contract extensions during the quarter, and our strong pipeline bodes well for future continued momentum going forward.  
Finally, our Business and Consumer Solutions segment delivered adjusted net revenue of $227 million, representing growth of 5%, despite lapping the benefit of the 2020 CARES Act last year. As a reminder, this business delivered double-digit growth in the second quarter of 2020, driven in part by our support of the disbursement of over $1.4 billion in stimulus funds during that period. Adjusted operating margin for this segment was 26.9%, which was also ahead of our expectations.   
The outstanding performance we delivered across our businesses serves as a further proof point that we continue to gain share as well as the alignment of our strategy with the accelerating digital trends coming out of the pandemic. We are also pleased that our integration continues to progress well, and we have now executed actions allowing for the achievement of annual run rate expense synergies of at least $400 million and annual run rate revenue synergies of at least $150 million that we have been targeting exactly as we said we would do and despite the pandemic. We will continue to deliver additional expense and revenue synergies over the coming periods as our efficiency efforts continue and we leverage the collaborative growth opportunities across our businesses.  
From a cash flow standpoint, we generated second quarter adjusted free cash flow of roughly $452 million or a little over $1 billion through the first 6 months and continue to expect adjusted free cash flow in excess of $2 billion for the year. We reinvested approximately $130 million in capital expenditures during the quarter and continue to expect capital expenditures in the $500 million to $600 million range for the full year. 
In June, we successfully closed our acquisition of Zego, consistent with our expectations. And we expect this business will contribute roughly $50 million of adjusted net revenue to our merchant segment in 2021. I would like to echo Jeff's excitement regarding the agreements we announced today to acquire Bankia's payments businesses in Spain, and we expect these transactions to close in the fourth quarter. Further, we remain on track to complete our purchase of Worldline's PAYONE business in Austria in the second half of this year. 
We are pleased to have continued to return cash to our shareholders this quarter with the repurchase of 1.5 million of our shares for approximately $290 million. Following our balanced deployment of capital this quarter, we ended the period with roughly $3.3 billion of liquidity and a leverage position of roughly 2.6x on a net debt basis, which is flat from the last quarter as expected, and this leaves us with continuing ample capacity going forward.  
Based on our current expectations for the continued global recovery, we are again increasing our guidance for adjusted net revenue to now be in a range of $7.7 billion to $7.73 billion, reflecting growth of 14% to 15% over 2020. We continue to expect adjusted operating margin expansion of up to 250 basis points compared to 2020 levels on a stand-alone basis. As a reminder, Zego will be a modest headwind to the upper bound of our margin target now that it is closed as it does not currently operate at our margin levels despite having already achieved rule of 40 status.  
At the segment level, we are increasing our expectations for Merchant Solutions adjusted net revenue growth to be around 20% from high teens previously, which assumes the current pace of recovery continues worldwide. This marks the second consecutive quarter that we have raised our outlook for our merchant business. 
We are also increasing our outlook for our issuer business and now expect growth to be in the low to mid-single-digit range for 2021, up from our prior outlook of low single-digit growth. We continue to expect our Business and Consumer segment to achieve mid- to high single-digit growth for the full year, consistent with our long-term growth target for Netspend. As a reminder, we increased our guidance for this segment on our first quarter earnings call in May despite lapping the impact of the 2020 CARES Act. 
Moving to nonoperating items. We continue to expect net interest expense to be slightly lower in 2021 relative to 2020 while we anticipate our adjusted tax rate will be relatively consistent with last year. Putting it all together, we are increasing our expected adjusted earnings per share for the full year to a range of $8.07 to $8.20, reflecting growth of 26% to 28% over 2020. Our raised outlook presumes we remain on a path to recovery worldwide over the balance of the year. 
We look forward to updating you on our longer-term expectations for the business at our upcoming virtual investor conference, which we will host on Wednesday, September 8. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff."

As we look ahead to next month, it is worth reflecting on how much we have evolved our business. Throughout much of the last 8 years, we have witnessed a multitude of new market entrants, newly public companies, shifting modes of competition and macroeconomic cycles to numerous account. Some said a number of times over the near  last decade that our best days were behind us. The facts say quite the opposite. 
In fact, we have delivered the greatest value creation in our history during that period, and we believe we are poised today to continue our track record of outperformance. The second quarter and our raised guidance today are the most recent examples. Our rates of revenue growth and bookings trends underscore sustained share gains despite managing through an unprecedented crisis. One proof point, we now expect our U.S. payments business to roughly reach its original growth target for 2021 based on 2019 goals. In short, we grew right through the pandemic. More to follow in September.  
The reasons for our success are straightforward. Our distinctive strategies, the technology investments we have made over many years, the support of our market-leading partners and customers, our execution consistency and the quality of our team members have allowed us to significantly expand our competitive moat. As painful as it has been, COVID-19 has reaffirmed the wisdom of our long-held beliefs in the digitization of our businesses. We believe that the best is yet to come.

In addition, our e-comm and omni business grew well over 20% this quarter, again, topping performance from last year where it also grew in the high teens level. So again, relative to 2019, continuing to see very strong growth across the e-comm and omnichannels of the business.

So any color on whether you're expecting to do more buybacks versus M&A? 
And on the M&A front, I know, historically, you've been focused on doing accretive deals. But given where valuation for fintechs are, that seems to be becoming harder and harder. So just curious on your thoughts. Would you be open to doing something that's revenue growth accretive but perhaps earnings dilutive at this point if it makes sense for the long term? And if yes, like what are some of the areas that possibly might make sense for you to do?"

And we've said all along, our preference is to allocate capital to M&A. When an M&A opportunity is not in front of us, we will deploy capital on share repurchase, and we were very pleased to do so this quarter, much like we did last quarter. 
So we do not have share repurchases in the guide as a go-forward matter for the back half of the year, but we are always opportunistic as it relates to share repurchase. And so we want to make sure we have the capacity to execute if we choose to do that. Jeff, you want to talk about the M&A side?"

I think with today's announcement with Bankia, we've committed about USD 1.3 billion to M&A in the last 6 months while coming to about $1.5 billion on the buyback. So as we said in the press release, I think we've been very balanced between the 2. 
As we also said in the last quarter, Zego is a technology and software-driven business very consistent with our strategy, particularly given the size of the real estate target addressable market.  Notwithstanding that, going back to the premise of your question, that deal was not dilutive. And I think we announced it was immediately accretive. Although really no discernible impact on earnings, but nonetheless, it was not dilutive. 
We look at many things, so it's hard to say what we would or wouldn't do in the abstract. What I would say is, since we've been running the company in the last 8 years, we've not done a dilutive deal. I don't expect us to. That's not the mindset we have as shareholders and owners and managers of the business. So I really don't expect our strategy to change."

But largely speaking, we're expecting roughly 3Q and 4Q to be largely similar across our businesses. As we have said at the beginning of the year, we had expected the back half of the year to return to a much more normal kind of state. And so clearly, there are some reopenings that will continue to benefit kind of 3Q into 4Q as countries around the world kind of reopen from some of the closures. 
You're exactly right, Ashwin, as it relates to some of our vertical markets businesses. As I just commented, we're very pleased with the growth we saw in 2Q, but we would see more meaningful growth on those businesses in the back half of the year as we have more reopening and kind of more tailwind kind of impact as it relates to those businesses. So yes, those would be the dynamics between kind of Q2, Q3 to Q4 certainly in merchant. 
And there wouldn't be anything I would necessarily call out across the other 2 businesses. Obviously, very pleased to raise the revenue guide on our issuer business from low single digits to low to mid-single digit. So it talks about kind of improving fundamentals in the back half of the year there and pretty static state as it relates to our business in consumer once kind of the stimulus impact has been netted out of the first half and going into the back half.

I would only add just a couple of points. One is across the technology-enabled businesses, as I mentioned previously, going to the first part of your question, we're continuing to see very strong momentum in those businesses. As Paul highlighted, July sequentially is better than June as a trend matter. So I think we feel good about how things are continuing to progress, and those businesses are poised to continue to see strength in the back half of the year. 
If you just look at the overall guide from the merchant segment, that roughly 20% growth in 2021 versus 2020, the back couple of quarters kind of have to be around that same level to make the averages work for the whole year. So that gives you a sense as to how the business is performing, again, against tougher comps in Q3 and Q4 than we certainly faced in the second quarter. So I think that should give you a little bit of a sense as to the momentum that we have in those businesses.  
To Paul's point around the vertical market businesses in particular, obviously, schools, once we get back into, obviously, a normal school environment, hopefully quite high normal school environment here in August and September, those businesses -- that business in particular is poised to see a rebound in the back half of the year, as well as Active. ACTIVE has seen very strong booking trends. Many of those events are occurring in the back half of 2021. So I think we feel very good about how that business is poised to recover. 
And again, AdvancedMD and TouchNet has continued to grow right through the pandemic, obviously a double-digit pace throughout 2020 and 2021. So those businesses are obviously in a very healthy position overall. But getting a nice tailwind from ACTIVE and schools in particular in the back half of the year will help the vertical market business continue to recover as an overall matter."

Let me first start with Netspend, which is actually our new announcement today. It follows a very similar, I think, format to the issuer announcement almost exactly a year ago to the day. But the one thing I will point out is that -- in Netspend is that there's primarily a focus on our part and Amazon's part on B2B distribution and I'd say in particular on program management with the scale that we have directed at neobanks, fintechs and start-ups. So while it is a similar template, it's a very targeted initiative, very much focused on B2B. And obviously, that's something on September 8 at our Virtual Investor Day that we'll be talking a lot about. 
In terms of your question on how we're doing on the issuers by book, we're really pleased. We disclosed again yet today, as we have for really the last year plus, what our LOI pipeline looks like outside of Amazon and with Amazon. I think what we said today is we have something like 20 letters of intent with our colleagues over at AWS. And that's for the whole spectrum of potential issuers, again, including neobanks, fintechs and start-ups as well as traditional financial institutions. 
And to give an update there, the one we singled out in Asia is in testing already and is live on a beta basis and we expect to be fully live by the end of this calendar year. And that -- to give you a sense of progress, Ashwin, that 20, I think, is up from 4 at the end of calendar 2020. So we quintupled the number of LOIs that we have with neobanks, fintechs, start-ups and financial institutions with AWS really in a 6 -- through the end of second quarter, so kind of on a 6-month basis. So we couldn't be more pleased, and the fact that we're doing more business with AWS now in the form of Netspend should be a recognition not just internally but externally of how happy we are with how things are progressing."

And obviously, on the heels of the pandemic, in a more normal operating environment, we clearly see credit outperforming. 
To your point, debit clearly outperformed in the midst of the pandemic. And by the way, a lot of that was prepaid debit as stimulus was funded on those types of accounts. So a lot of the debit growth was prepaid. But certainly, coming out of the pandemic, getting back to a normal operating environment, we would expect credit to drive growth and really outperform. And I think we see a lot of tailwinds particularly for our merchant business as a result of that, heading in the back half of 2021, into 2022 as a result of that. 
And then of course, we see those same trends in our issuer business. I'll let Paul maybe touch a little bit on the metrics that we're seeing there, but I'd say, overall, we feel good about the growth in credit.

Let me just start by saying PayPal is a good partner of ours really, as we said before, on both the TSYS side and the global side really around the world. So we've got a lot of respect for PayPal. We think they're a terrific company. 
As it relates specifically to iZettle at the physical point of sale, so iZettle has been in Europe for quite some time, David. In fact, when PayPal did the deal, I think it was mostly all European. Now they've announced, as you're implying, some migration to the United States. So our businesses in Europe -- let's just use the U.K. and London as one specific example. iZettle has been there for some time, yet our business has outperformed for many years throughout that period, both pre PayPal acquiring iZettle and post. 
As it relates to the United States market, look, that market is competitive today. It was competitive yesterday. It's going to be even more competitive tomorrow. Yet as Cameron rightly pointed out, our growth in our U.S. business is just around the same growth as our worldwide acquiring business, around 46%. And it compares to Visa's and MasterCard's worldwide growth. It was like 35% for Visa and 33% for Mastercard. 
So whether iZettle was in Europe or iZettle was in North America, over the last number of years, it certainly hasn't made anything like a dent in terms of our growth. And I think what we'll be talking about next Monday at our virtual investor conference is the resilience of our business, our market share gains. Some of that, as you rightly pointed out, was in our prepared remarks. But notwithstanding the coming and going of many new [ smart ] competitors, our business has been resilient both pre pandemic and post, and we'll take you through the math and why we think that's going to continue. So it's a great company, but at the end of the day, I don't think that's [ important ] to our vision of our strategy, the one I noted."

Maybe I'll kick off and ask Paul to fill in some of the more explicit details. But if I step back and kind of think about where we are today, if you look at our pure acquiring businesses globally, they were up roughly 19% in the second quarter versus 2019 levels. In the U.S., that number was 25%. So again, I think we feel from a pure acquiring standpoint, we're on a pretty good trajectory. 
Now what still needs to come back to kind of get to '22 a more normalized rate of growth relative to 2019 or to say it differently, where we would have been absent the pandemic, well, Europe is growing relative to 2019, but it's certainly growing at a pace lower than that which we've seen in the U.S. market. So Europe grew somewhere in the high single digits versus 2019 for the second quarter. So we still need a little more tailwind from Europe fully recovering. As you know, the U.K. didn't open up until mid-July. 
So as we get to the back half of the year, we're expecting to see a little more tailwind in Europe as it relates to growth and particularly relative to 2019 trends. And then, of course, Asia, which is a small part of the business but is still lagging relative to 2019 levels largely because many markets that continue to struggle with the pandemic remain closed. And of course, cross-border activity in Asia is very depressed and continues to be depressed because of the pandemic. 
So as we think about 2022, we think the U.S. is on a pretty good trajectory to get back to something reasonably close to what we would have been absent the pandemic, given the outsized growth and the momentum we have in that business. We need Europe to continue to improve as the lockdowns end and markets begin to reopen and you see more cross-border travel pick up. And then I'd say the same thing is true for Asia just given where it sits relative to the pandemic. 
I think the vertical markets are well poised to get back to reasonable levels compared to 2019 as we continue to see, again, a recovery in schools and a recovery in ACTIVE in the back half of the year as those markets in particular reopen. So Paul, I don't know if you'd add anything more to that, but I think that gives a pretty good overview of the merchant business."

But I would say, in particular, the non-U.S. businesses echo a lot of what Cameron said. So we only recently -- which is to say really the second quarter heading into July and continuing in July, we've only recently seen kind of a reopening for issuer purposes of a lot of markets outside the United States. That will be a favorable comparison, to answer your question, for the first half, obviously of next year. 
And I'd add to that commercial card. So while commercial card, not surprisingly, is up versus '20, it's really not up versus '19. So I think it's a pretty good picture, Dave, heading into '22 on the issuer side as well because you do have those 2 elements of broader reopening outside the United States and commercial card relative to '19 starting to normalize. That should be favorable tailwinds for the issuer business. 
And lastly, I'll say on issuer, we described again today as Ashwin asked, but those LOIs start to kick in when you start getting into back half of 2022. We obviously also had announced Truist probably about 1.5 years ago now. I think we said at the time that's a back half of 2022 event, which we continue to believe.

So we also announced the acquisition of PAYONE's Austrian business in Worldline in the second quarter. And then, obviously, today, we announced Bankia as well. So I think what we said was the purchase price for Zego, just to get the math right, was about $930 million. There's also about $100 million of tax assets. So that nets you down about $825 million, Dave. So relative to the $100 million, we view it here as about 8x revenue. 
Now having said that, at the end of the day, we do think it's a great business. I think Paul alluded to this in his commentary. So if you think about it, it's already a rule of 40 growth and really beyond that. So if you think about what we guided to when we did the deal at the time, kind of a double-digit organic revenue growth rate with margins into the 20s. That's how you get to the rule of 40 number. So we think very attractive on that basis, but we view it at closer to 8x rather than your -- notional 10 you mentioned."

Is that causing you to look further afield or look for acquisitions that are maybe more tangential to what you have done historically? And if so, where are you seeing opportunities today? I think the ones that you've announced thus far, Zego and PAYONE as well as Bankia today, are quite interesting, but I just want to understand more kind of the mindset."

We certainly do look at -- and the economics obviously have worked out just fine, in response to Dave's question, too, just a second ago. So I think we've got a flaming pipeline and certainly more for us to do. 
We do balance though our view of M&A with where the capital markets are and what -- our view of intrinsic value in our share price and everything else. So we have bought back about $1.5 billion of stock. Obviously, not mutually exclusive. We did both at the same time, $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion. And we just re-upped the authorization back to $1.5 billion. That's not in our guidance. Obviously, we balance our view as to where we would like to be in terms of growth than anything else. But I think it's important to consider that we think we're in a pretty healthy position heading into 2022 and the rest of '21 without more deals. So we think we're kind of where we want to be. 
As a strategy matter, I think we feel really kind of much the same. So there's plenty of stuff that we look at. But I can't think of a deal that we didn't do, James, because we said, gee, it's too expensive or it's not accretive enough or those other things. If we can't add more value as a strategic buyer with the things that we're doing in terms of revenue, margin, earnings, then we're just not going to do it. I don't think it's a function of valuation so much as a function of our view of where we are in the strategy and our view of where the market is."

So as you think about the comments we made earlier as it relates to July, we did see sequential improvement in July relative to June. So I think we still feel very good about the momentum of the recovery overall. 
To be very clear, I don't think we've seen any real impact yet from the Delta variant. Obviously, we're monitoring it very closely, and it's a fluid environment. But I would say, sitting here today, based on data that we have through the end of last week, the volume trends, again, for July were an improvement over what we saw in June sequentially. In most of the markets around the globe in which we operate and particularly now in markets where we're seeing a reopening that's more recent, the U.K., Canada, for example, obviously, I think they're poised to see stronger volume recoveries as we enter the back half of the year. 
So look, I don't think there's a lot of appetite for more widespread lockdowns, particularly here in the U.S., as it relates to the Delta variant. Markets outside of the U.S. may react differently, but again, for our business, those are going to be relatively small impacts. We're most focused on the U.S. as 75% of our business. And I'd say, thus far, we haven't really seen any discernible impact, but it is something that we continue to monitor very closely through the balance of the year."

And then the second section would be both the overperformance in Q2 as well as continued kind of better performance in the back half, which underpin the guidance raise as it relates to the segment on the issuing side as well as merchant. 
So those would be the 2 components. There's a little bit of FX headwind relative to the back half versus the first half on a realized basis. We also don't have the same kind of stimulus impact in the first half versus the second half. But those would be the 2 components: the Zego of roughly $50 million and then the remaining piece of that is the performance."

As it relates to Bankia, I think the short answer to your question is yes, the exact same playbook that we've executed with Caixa and our Comercia joint venture over the last decade plus now. Obviously, we continue to be very excited about the Spanish market. It is one of the most attractive markets in Europe. Frankly, it's one of the most attractive markets globally. 
Just to give you a little bit of color. That market grew -- the domestic volume in Spain, as a volume matter, grew 30% in the second quarter and 15% over 2019, again, despite continued, obviously, restrictions throughout the country as a result of the pandemic. So the underlying secular trends in Spain remain incredibly attractive, which makes the timing for the Bankia acquisition particularly attractive for us as well. 
Bankia consists of about 100,000 predominantly small to medium-sized merchants, although they do venture more into the wires category as well. But I think the interesting thing about the Bankia portfolio is it's more skewed towards domestic volume. So again, I think it's a really attractive addition to our Comercia joint venture. That's going to allow us, again, to further expand distribution in this very attractive market and gives great cross-sell opportunities for the differentiated technology solutions we have in the Comercia joint venture today. So we're delighted to be able to announce that this morning, and a nice addition to our European business."

I think the key thesis behind the partnership with AWS just almost a year ago to the day now was first really just to modernize the architecture and technology. And as we've said in response to Ashwin's question, that's actually gone very well. And the second piece was the distribution. So of those 20 LOIs that we have pending with AWS, a number of those are with neobanks, fintechs and start-ups. And you're right, I don't think we would have been -- we would not be in the position we are today, I think, without that. And I would also say more broadly, if you back up, just our general shift from cloud-enabled technologies initially into cloud-native technologies is just selling very well with institutions of all sizes, including neobanks and fintechs, start-ups and the like. 
The second thing I'd say, you saw in our announcement the expansion of our AWS relationship today into Netspend. But whether it's at the issuing business or at the Netspend business, we're very focused on program management. So to answer your second question, I think we need to be more vocal on program management. I think historically, most of the revenue -- the growth that we get in the issuing business is really with financial institutions and generally inside the United States, North America and Western Europe, larger financial institutions. Key focal point of ours pre and now, of course, post AWS, both at Netspend as well as issuer, is on program management. That's a key part of the relationship with AWS going forward on the new partnership we announced today. So I would look for us to do more there, and we'll share more detail with you next month on September 8."

So we really got 3 legs of the stool of our strategy in Netspend. First is ongoing digitization. And I think Netspend had pre pandemic a pretty good digital footprint. And no surprise to anyone [ on the phone ], the pandemic has really accelerated that. And I would say kind of high 20s, 30% of interactions today with consumers with Netspend are done online, buying a card online, spending with the card online. And we certainly expect AWS, of course, to continue to accelerate that given their footprint. 
The second is what I just described in response to your first question, which is really B2B and program management. But I'd be remiss if I didn't mention it also includes [ inlay dash ] to access paycards and our tips solutions. So those are all obviously also in play on B2B. 
And the third leg of the stool is really what we get at most narrowly, which is internationalization. So a piece of that is MoneyToPay. The second piece, we announced today with Bankia because that also includes a prepaid business, a debit business as well. 
And the short answer to your question is it's gone really well. Our thesis on internationalization is -- given who Global Payments is, the 38 countries we operate in particularly on the acquiring side as well as the relationships we have in those markets, a great example is Continental Europe with Spain, it allows us uniquely to expand what was really a U.S.-only business, which it is today for Netspend and for some of the competitors, and really bring it overseas. And now that we're approaching 9 or 10 months post the initial closing of the MoneyToPay JV with Caixa, I can tell you that we're running ahead of what we expected. I think our thesis that we can bring our management, our products, our technologies to those markets has rung true. 
The thesis that those markets are under-penetrated relative to the United States is also true. We have seen some benefit there on government spending, too, as we all kind of emerge from the pandemic, not just here in the United States but overseas. So it's really working out better than we hoped, and we're really pleased to be where we are, especially with the kind of partners that we have."

We delivered a terrific second quarter with each of adjusted net revenue, adjusted operating margin and adjusted earnings per share outperforming our targets. We are most pleased by the compounded rates of growth that we realized in the quarter and are now forecasting for the full year compared to pre-pandemic 2019 levels. While we've not called back all of the impact of COVID-19 relative to our pre-pandemic expectations, we have made substantial progress and are far down that path.  
As we have throughout the pandemic, we continue to expand our competitive moat through leading strategic partnerships. First, we are excited to have agreed with our partners at CaixaBank to acquire Bankia's payments businesses in Spain. Specifically, we will enhance our position in one of the most attractive acquiring markets in Europe with the addition of Bankia's merchant business, consisting of roughly 100,000 customers in the region. This pending acquisition further enhances our distinctive distribution and will allow us to delight Bankia's customers with our market-leading technologies, providing us with significant cross-selling opportunities and deepening our presence with one of the leading institutions in Europe.  
This agreement follows our purchase of an additional 29% stake in our Comercia joint venture last October, which increased Global Payments' ownership to 80%. Additionally, our MoneyToPay joint venture has agreed to purchase Bankia's prepaid business as we continue to execute on our strategy to expand and diversify our Netspend business into international markets. We expect both of these transactions to close in the fourth quarter.  
Second, we are delighted to announce that we have entered into a new collaboration with Amazon Web Services, AWS, for a unique distribution and cutting-edge technologies at Netspend to substantially increase our target addressable markets and accelerate our strategy across our 3 pillars of digitization, internationalization and B2B expansion. Much as that we have done with our issuer business, we plan to leverage the AWS partner network and dedicated partner development specialists to bring Netspend's B2C and B2B digital payment solutions, including program management, to a broader base of neobanks, fintech start-ups and other e-commerce players as well as to new geographies. This partnership will also provide an industry-leading cloud-based processing platform for Netspend's customers to access cutting-edge technologies with greater speed to market, security and flexibility. We are thrilled to deepen our go-to-market collaboration with one of the world's largest technology companies to continue our disruption of these markets.  
Third, we are pleased to have closed our acquisition of Zego in June, further capitalizing on the convergence of software and payments in one of the largest and most attractive vertical markets worldwide. As I highlighted last quarter, real estate is the quintessence of the type of market that we seek: sizable; global in scope; fragmented; and ripe for further software, digital commerce and payment penetration. And COVID-19 has accelerated the underlying trends that make this $6.5 billion target addressable market so attractive as we continue to expand our software-driven footprint. It is my great pleasure to welcome Zego team members to Global Payments.  
In addition to these strategic accomplishments, we produced yet another outstanding quarter of results. Since we began running the company in 2013, our main focus has been on 2 areas: enabling diverse, distinctive and defensible distribution; and developing market-leading technologies. We could not be more pleased with the momentum across our businesses, evident in our second quarter results and reflected in our increased guidance for 2021. It's worth noting that we have delivered the greatest value creation in our history over the last 8 years despite numerous new market entrants during the entirety of that period, public and private. And we have generated consistent financial and operating outperformance through a variety of macroeconomic cycles, including, most recently, the financial impact of the first worldwide pandemic in over 100 years. 
The results are self-evident. We have record performance in the second quarter in our merchant segment on several bases, absolute, sequential and year-over-year, while also producing strong growth versus pre-pandemic levels. Simply put, our payments businesses continue to significantly outperform and gain share, fueled by our long-held technology-enabled focus and solid ongoing execution.  
On a more granular basis, we saw a strong double-digit growth in new sales in both Global Payments Integrated and our vertical market businesses in the quarter, and our U.S. relationship-led business again achieved record new sales. This marks the third quarter out of the last 4 in which we have achieved such a high level of performance. Rather than impede our strategy, the pandemic spurred further share gains and catalyzed the digital strategies we have had in place since 2013.  
Our omnichannel businesses accelerated yet again in the second quarter with growth in excess of 20% despite lapping the enhanced shift toward e-commerce globally that began with the start of the pandemic in early 2020. New customer signings this quarter include Foot Locker as a key customer in Europe that will leverage our Unified Commerce Platform or UCP to modernize its payment acceptance capabilities. We are pleased to have also signed new global UCP partnerships with Hunter Douglas and Euronet Worldwide subsidiary, Xe.com. Our ability to deliver a single API solution virtually around the world has been a key driver of our success. And our unique multinational footprint in both the virtual and the physical worlds has proven to be a differentiator versus both legacy and new market entrants.  
Within our vertical market businesses, we had a number of new key customer wins for our quick-service restaurant business, including Frisch's Big Boy, Krystal's and the Fiesta Group, while AMD and TouchNet continue to deliver record revenue performance as they have throughout the pandemic. Notably, TouchNet continues to add new marquee colleges and universities domestically and internationally, including the Arkansas State University System and Sheridan College in Canada this quarter. We're also making great progress in our partnership with Google and remain on track to board Google as a merchant customer this quarter and expect to launch our [ Run and Grow My Business ] product that integrates Google solutions in our digital portal environment in the fourth quarter.  
Our issuer business delivered growth beyond the high end of our targeted long-term range. We are pleased to have signed a new multiyear partnership with Banco Carrefour in Brazil, the financial services arm of the country's leading supercenter retail chain, to provide a range of technologies for its credit card and digital accounts as well as to handle on-us acquiring transactions. Recall that transaction optimization is one of our key post-merger initiatives. More to come on that at our investor conference.  
We also signed a letter of intent with a large global financial institution and long-standing partner in a new market in Lat Am that will mark another significant milestone for us in our continued expansion into the region. Further, we executed a multiyear extension with the U.K.'s largest retailer, Tesco, enabled by our shared digital modernization vision for the future. Finally, we are pleased to have extended our relationship with Mercury Financial for a range of digital technologies. This relationship serves as further proof that our industry-leading platform offers the agility to support leading-edge fintech companies. 
TSYS recently launched a strategic go-to-market partnership with PricewaterhouseCoopers or PwC. As part of the TSYS Partner Program, we expect that our collaboration with PwC will diversify and expand our distribution and allow us to jointly offer innovative solutions, expertise and execution capabilities to clients of all sizes, across the full spectrum of neobanks, fintech, start-ups and program managers. Again, diversification of distribution has been one of our key objectives since 2013, and we are using the same playbook with TSYS that we have successfully deployed in the past.  
We continue to capitalize on the broad and deep pipeline we have a good fortune to have in our issuer business. Today, we have 15 letters of intent with institutions worldwide, 6 of which are competitive takeaways.  
Turning to our unique collaboration. We now have 20 active prospects in our pipeline with AWS, up from a dozen last quarter and 4 at the end of 2020. These include a mix of new financial technology entrants and other nontraditional issuers in addition to large financial institutions. As growth accelerates in this market, we believe that we are the ones doing the disrupting.  
While buy now, pay later solutions may seem novel to some, we have, in fact, been providing leading technologies to that segment of the market for decades in both our issuer and merchant segments, and we continue to deliver innovative installment payments products for customers. We are currently enabling our merchant customers in Canada in partnership with Desjardins with a Visa installment solution. CIBC will also launch a combined TSYS Visa installment solution in early 2022, and we signed a global referral agreement with Mastercard supporting installment payments in June.  
Finally, in our business and consumer segment, we expect a unique co-sale arrangement with AWS to expand our distribution capabilities, again, much like we've been doing since 2013. And together with our issuer business, we intend to further disrupt the program management segment in the near future. This is yet another example of application of our strategies to legacy TSYS businesses, and we expect the same successes here as we have generated in other contexts. Paul?"

Our financial performance in the second quarter of 2021 demonstrated meaningful sequential momentum and exceeded our expectations. These results highlight outstanding execution on our differentiated strategy of technology enablement. Specifi",1376,"Thanks, Jeff. Our financial performance in the second quarter of 2021 demonstrated meaningful sequential momentum and exceeded our expectations. These results highlight outstanding execution on our differentiated strategy of technology enablement. Specifically, we delivered adjusted net revenue of $1.94 billion, representing 28% growth compared to the prior year and 10% growth compared to 2019. Adjusted operating margin for the second quarter was 41.8%, a 480 basis point improvement from the prior year despite the return of certain costs we temporarily reduced at the onset of the pandemic. The net result was adjusted earnings per share of $2.04 for the quarter, an increase of 56% compared to the prior year and a 35% improvement from the same period in 2019.  
Taking a closer look at our performance by segment. Merchant Solutions achieved adjusted net revenue of $1.29 billion for the second quarter, a 42% improvement from the prior year. We delivered an adjusted operating margin of 48.5% in this segment, an increase of 750 basis points from the same period in 2020, as we continue to benefit from the recovery and our improving technology-enabled business mix.  
We are pleased that our acquiring businesses globally generated 46% adjusted net revenue growth compared to the second quarter of 2020, led by strength in the U.S. Notably, our U.S. acquiring business, which includes our integrated and relationship-led channels, grew approximately 25% compared to the same period in 2019. These results were led by our integrated business, which produced a stellar quarter, generating a 53% adjusted net revenue improvement compared to 2020 and 35% growth relative to 2019. 
As for our own software businesses in the U.S., we are delighted with the overall portfolio delivered growth of roughly 30% compared to the prior year and achieved solid sequential improvement relative to the first quarter. As Jeff mentioned, our vertical markets businesses continue to see positive bookings trends, providing us with a favorable tailwind for the second half of 2021. Additionally, our worldwide e-commerce and omnichannel businesses saw growth in excess of 20% year-on-year as our value proposition, including our Unified Commerce Platform or UCP, continues to resonate with customers.  
Regarding our international businesses, while these markets have been a bit slower to recover compared to the U.S. on an absolute basis, our portfolio of businesses across Europe and Asia contribute favorably to our overall merchant adjusted net revenue as a growth matter compared to 2020. These businesses also returned to growth on a combined basis when compared to 2019.   
Moving to Issuer Solutions. We are pleased to have delivered a record $446 million in adjusted net revenue for the second quarter, marking an 8% improvement from the prior year period. This strong performance was driven by the ongoing recovery in transaction volumes across many of our markets while non-volume-based revenue increased mid-single digits during the period, led by our output service business, which grew at roughly 10% for the quarter. 
Our issuer business also achieved record second quarter adjusted operating income, and adjusted segment operating margin expanded 110 basis points from the prior year, also reaching a new second quarter record of 43.9% as we continue to benefit from our efforts to drive efficiencies in this business. This is an impressive result, particularly given we achieved margin expansion of 640 basis points in the second quarter of 2020. Additionally, our issuer team signed 5 long-term contract extensions during the quarter, and our strong pipeline bodes well for future continued momentum going forward.  
Finally, our Business and Consumer Solutions segment delivered adjusted net revenue of $227 million, representing growth of 5%, despite lapping the benefit of the 2020 CARES Act last year. As a reminder, this business delivered double-digit growth in the second quarter of 2020, driven in part by our support of the disbursement of over $1.4 billion in stimulus fund during that period. Adjusted operating margin for this segment was 26.9%, which was also ahead of our expectations.   
The outstanding performance we delivered across our businesses serves as a further proof point that we continue to gain share as well as the alignment of our strategy with the accelerating digital trends coming out of the pandemic. We are also pleased that our integration continues to progress well, and we have now executed actions allowing for the achievement of annual run rate expense synergies of at least $400 million and annual run rate revenue synergies of at least $150 million that we have been targeting exactly as we said we would do and despite the pandemic. We will continue to deliver additional expense and revenue synergies over the coming periods as our efficiency efforts continue and we leverage the collaborative growth opportunities across our businesses.  
From a cash flow standpoint, we generated second quarter adjusted free cash flow of roughly $452 million or a little over $1 billion through the first 6 months and continue to expect adjusted free cash flow in excess of $2 billion for the year. We reinvested approximately $130 million in capital expenditures during the quarter and continue to expect capital expenditures in the $500 million to $600 million range for the full year. 
In June, we successfully closed our acquisition of Zego, consistent with our expectations. And we expect this business will contribute roughly $50 million of adjusted net revenue to our merchant segment in 2021. I would like to echo Jeff's excitement regarding the agreements we announced today to acquire Bankia's payments businesses in Spain, and we expect these transactions to close in the fourth quarter. Further, we remain on track to complete our purchase of Worldline's PAYONE business in Austria in the second half of this year. 
We are pleased to have continued to return cash to our shareholders this quarter with the repurchase of 1.5 million of our shares for approximately $290 million. Following our balanced deployment of capital this quarter, we ended the period with roughly $3.3 billion of liquidity and a leverage position of roughly 2.6x on a net debt basis, which is flat from the last quarter as expected, and this leaves us with continuing ample capacity going forward.  
Based on our current expectations for the continued global recovery, we are again increasing our guidance for adjusted net revenue to now be in a range of $7.7 billion to $7.73 billion, reflecting growth of 14% to 15% over 2020. We continue to expect adjusted operating margin expansion of up to 250 basis points compared to 2020 levels on a stand-alone basis. As a reminder, Zego will be a modest headwind to the upper bound of our margin target now that it is closed as it does not currently operate at our margin levels despite having already achieved Rule of 40 status.  
At the segment level, we are increasing our expectations for Merchant Solutions adjusted net revenue growth to be around 20% from high teens previously, which assumes the current pace of recovery continues worldwide. This marks the second consecutive quarter that we have raised our outlook for our merchant business. 
We are also increasing our outlook for our issuer business and now expect growth to be in the low to mid-single-digit range for 2021, up from our prior outlook of low single-digit growth. We continue to expect our Business and Consumer segment to achieve mid- to high single-digit growth for the full year, consistent with our long-term growth target for Netspend. As a reminder, we increased our guidance for this segment on our first quarter earnings call in May despite lapping the impact of the 2020 CARES Act. 
Moving to nonoperating items. We continue to expect net interest expense to be slightly lower in 2021 relative to 2020 while we anticipate our adjusted tax rate will be relatively consistent with last year. Putting it all together, we are increasing our expected adjusted earnings per share for the full year to a range of $8.07 to $8.20, reflecting growth of 26% to 28% over 2020. Our raised outlook presumes we remain on a path to recovery worldwide over the balance of the year. 
We look forward to updating you on our longer-term expectations for the business at our upcoming Virtual Investor Conference, which we will host on Wednesday, September 8. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff."

As we look ahead to next month, it is worth reflecting on how much we have evolved our business. Throughout much of the last 8 years, we have witnessed a multitude of new market entrants, newly public companies, shifting modes of competition and macroeconomic cycles too numerous to count. Some said a number of times over the near  last decade that our best days were behind us. The facts say quite the opposite. 
In fact, we have delivered the greatest value creation in our history during that period, and we believe we are poised today to continue our track record of outperformance. The second quarter and our raised guidance today are the most recent examples. Our rates of revenue growth and bookings trends underscore sustained share gains despite managing through an unprecedented crisis. One proof point, we now expect our U.S. payments business to roughly reach its original growth target for 2021 based on 2019 goals. In short, we grew right through the pandemic. More to follow in September.  
The reasons for our success are straightforward. Our distinctive strategies, the technology investments we have made over many years, the support of our market-leading partners and customers, our execution consistency and the quality of our team members have allowed us to significantly expand our competitive moat. As painful as it has been, COVID-19 has reaffirmed the wisdom of our long-held beliefs in the digitization of our businesses. We believe that the best is yet to come. You can judge that for yourselves next month. Winnie?"

In addition, our e-comm and omni business grew well over 20% this quarter, again, topping performance from last year where it also grew in the high teens level. So again, relative to 2019, continuing to see very strong growth across the e-comm and omnichannels of the business. So for me, it's really the strategy that we've been deploying that's driving growth. And I think we continue to see a lot of tailwinds in those businesses looking forward through the balance of 2021 and heading into 2022 and then beyond.

And on the M&A front, I know, historically, you've been focused on doing accretive deals. But given where valuation for fintechs are, that seems to be becoming harder and harder. So just curious on your thoughts. Would you be open to doing something that's revenue growth accretive but perhaps earnings dilutive at this point if it makes sense for the long term? And if yes, like what are some of the areas that possibly might make sense for you to do?"

When an M&A opportunity is not in front of us, we will deploy capital on share repurchase, and we were very pleased to do so this quarter, much like we did last quarter. 
So we do not have share repurchases in the guide as a go-forward matter for the back half of the year, but we are always opportunistic as it relates to share repurchase. And so we want to make sure we have the capacity to execute if we choose to do that. Jeff, you want to talk about the M&A side?"

So as we said in the press release, I think we've been very balanced between the 2. 
As we also said in the last quarter, Zego is a technology and software-driven business, very consistent with our strategy, particularly given the size of the real estate target addressable market.  Notwithstanding that, going back to the premise of your question, no, that deal was not dilutive. And I think we announced it was immediately accretive. Although really no discernible impact on earnings, but nonetheless, it was not dilutive. 
We look at many things, so it's hard to say what we would or wouldn't do in the abstract. What I would say is, since we've been running the company in the last 8 years, we've not done a dilutive deal. I don't expect us to. That's not the mindset we have as shareholders and owners and managers of the business. So I really don't expect our strategy to change."

But largely speaking, we're expecting roughly 3Q and 4Q to be largely similar across our businesses. As we have said at the beginning of the year, we had expected the back half of the year to return to a much more normal kind of state. And so clearly, there are some reopenings that will continue to benefit kind of 3Q into 4Q as countries around the world kind of reopen from some of the closures. 
You're exactly right, Ashwin, as it relates to some of our vertical markets businesses. As I just commented, we're very pleased with the growth we saw in 2Q, but we would see more meaningful growth on those businesses in the back half of the year as we have more reopening and kind of more tailwind kind of impact as it relates to those businesses. So yes, those would be the dynamics between kind of Q2, Q3 to Q4 certainly in merchant. 
And there wouldn't be anything I would necessarily call out across the other 2 businesses. Obviously, very pleased to raise the revenue guide on our issuer business from low single digits to low to mid-single digit. So it talks about kind of improving fundamentals in the back half of the year there and pretty static state as it relates to our business in consumer once kind of the stimulus impact has been netted out of the first half and going into the back half.

As Paul highlighted, July sequentially is better than June as a trend matter. So I think we feel good about how things are continuing to progress, and those businesses are poised to continue to see strength in the back half of the year. 
If you just look at the overall guide from the merchant segment, that roughly 20% growth in 2021 versus 2020, the back couple of quarters kind of have to be around that same level to make the averages work for the whole year. So that gives you a sense as to how the business is performing, again, against tougher comps in Q3 and Q4 than we certainly faced in the second quarter. So I think that should give you a little bit of a sense as to the momentum that we have in those businesses.  
To Paul's point around the vertical market businesses in particular, obviously, schools, once we get back into, obviously, a normal school environment, hopefully quasi-normal school environment here in August and September, those businesses -- that business in particular is poised to see a rebound in the back half of the year, as well as ACTIVE. ACTIVE has seen very strong booking trends. Many of those events are occurring in the back half of 2021. So I think we feel very good about how that business is poised to recover. 
And again, AdvancedMD and TouchNet has continued to grow right through the pandemic, obviously a double-digit pace throughout 2020 and 2021. So those businesses are obviously in a very healthy position overall. But getting a nice tailwind from ACTIVE in schools in particular in the back half of the year will help the vertical market business continue to recover as an overall matter."

Let me first start with Netspend, which is actually our new announcement today. It follows a very similar, I think, format to the issuer announcement almost exactly a year ago today. But the one thing I will point out is that -- in Netspend is that there's primarily a focus on our part and Amazon's part on B2B distribution and I'd say in particular on program management with the scale that we have directed at neobanks, fintechs and start-ups. So while it is a similar template, it's a very targeted initiative, very much focused on B2B. And obviously, that's something on September 8 at our Virtual Investor Day that we'll be talking a lot about. 
In terms of your question on how we're doing on the issuers side, look, we're really pleased. We disclosed again yesterday, as we have for really the last year plus, what our LOI pipeline looks like outside of Amazon and with Amazon. I think what we said today is we have something like 20 letters of intent with our colleagues over at AWS. And that's for the whole spectrum of potential issuers, again, including neobanks, fintechs and start-ups as well as traditional financial institutions. 
And to give an update there, the one we singled out in Asia is in testing already and is live on a beta basis and we expect to be fully live by the end of this calendar year. And that -- to give you a sense of progress, Ashwin, that 20, I think, is up from 4 at the end of calendar 2020. So we quintupled the number of LOIs that we have with neobanks, fintechs, start-ups and financial institutions with AWS really in a 6 -- through the end of second quarter, so kind of on a 6-month basis. So we couldn't be more pleased, and the fact that we're doing more business with AWS now in the form of Netspend should be a recognition not just internally but externally of how happy we are with how things are progressing."

I think credit card account growth is as high as it's been, I think, since 2010. And obviously, on the heels of the pandemic, in a more normal operating environment, we clearly see credit outperforming. 
To your point, debit clearly outperformed in the midst of the pandemic. And by the way, a lot of that was prepaid debit as stimulus was funded on those types of accounts. So a lot of the debit growth was prepaid. But certainly, coming out of the pandemic, getting back to a normal operating environment, we would expect credit to drive growth and really outperform. And I think we see a lot of tailwinds particularly for our merchant business as a result of that, heading in the back half of 2021, into 2022 as a result of that. 
And then of course, we see those same trends in our issuer business. I'll let Paul maybe touch a little bit on the metrics that we're seeing there, but I'd say, overall, we feel good about the growth in credit. And obviously, as we've talked about throughout the pandemic, our book in the merchant side is more skewed towards credit, so that obviously provides a nice tailwind for the merchant business through the coming years.

Let me just start by saying PayPal is a good partner of ours really, as we said before, on both the TSYS side and the global side really around the world. So we've got a lot of respect for PayPal. We think they're a terrific company. 
As it relates specifically to iZettle at the physical point of sale, so iZettle has been in Europe for quite some time, David. In fact, when PayPal did the deal, I think it was mostly all European. Now they've announced, as you're implying, some migration to the United States. So our businesses in Europe -- let's just use the U.K. and London as one specific example. iZettle has been there for some time, yet our business has outperformed for many years throughout that period, both pre, post PayPal acquiring iZettle -- and post. 
As it relates to the United States market, look, that market is competitive today. It was competitive yesterday. It's going to be even more competitive tomorrow. Yet as Cameron rightly pointed out, our growth in our U.S. business is just around the same growth as our worldwide acquiring business, around 46%. And it compares to the Visa's and MasterCard's worldwide growth. It was like 35% for Visa and 33% for Mastercard. 
So whether iZettle was in Europe or iZettle was in North America, over the last number of years, it certainly hasn't placed anything like a dent in terms of our growth. And I think what we'll be talking about next month, David, at our Virtual Investor Conference is the resilience of our business, our market share gains. Some of that, as you rightly pointed out, was in our prepared remarks. But notwithstanding the coming and going of many new smart competitors, our business has been resilient both pre pandemic and post, and we'll take you through the math in why we think that's going to continue. So it's a great company, but at the end of the day, I don't think that's [important] to our vision of our strategy, the one I noted."

Maybe I'll kick off and ask Paul to fill in some of the more explicit details. But if I step back and kind of think about where we are today, if you look at our pure acquiring businesses globally, they were up roughly 19% in the second quarter versus 2019 levels. In the U.S., that number was 25%. So again, I think we feel from a pure acquiring standpoint, we're on a pretty good trajectory. 
Now what still needs to come back to kind of get to '22 a more normalized rate of growth relative to 2019 or to say it differently, where we would have been absent the pandemic, well, Europe is growing relative to 2019, but it's certainly growing at a pace lower than that which we've seen in the U.S. market. So Europe grew somewhere in the high single digits versus 2019 for the second quarter. So we still need a little more tailwind from Europe fully recovering. As you know, the U.K. didn't open up until mid-July. 
So as we get to the back half of the year, we're expecting to see a little more tailwind in Europe as it relates to growth and particularly relative to 2019 trends. And then, of course, Asia, which is a small part of the business but it's still lagging relative to 2019 levels largely because many markets continue to struggle with the pandemic remain closed. And of course, cross-border activity in Asia is very depressed and continues to be depressed because of the pandemic. 
So as we think about 2022, we think the U.S. is on a pretty good trajectory to get back to something reasonably close to what we would have been absent the pandemic, given the outsized growth and the momentum we have in that business. We need Europe to continue to improve as the lockdowns end and markets begin to reopen and you see more cross-border travel pick up. And then I'd say the same thing is true for Asia just given where it sits relative to the pandemic. 
I think the vertical markets are well poised to get back to reasonable levels compared to 2019 as we continue to see, again, a recovery in schools and a recovery in ACTIVE in the back half of the year as those markets in particular reopen. So Paul, I don't know if you'd add anything more to that, but I think that gives a pretty good overview of the merchant business."

But I would say, in particular, the non-U.S. businesses echo a lot of what Cameron said. So we only recently -- which is to say really the end of second quarter heading into July and continuing in July, we've only recently seen kind of a reopening for issuer purposes of a lot of markets outside the United States. That will be a favorable comparison, Dave, to answer your question, for the first half, obviously of next year. 
And I'd add to that commercial card. So while commercial card, not surprisingly, is up versus '20, it's really not up versus '19. So I think it's a pretty good picture, Dave, heading into '22 on the issuer side as well because you do have those 2 elements of broader reopening outside the United States and commercial card relative to '19 starting to normalize that should be favorable tailwinds for the issuer business. 
And lastly, I'll say on issuer, we described again today as Ashwin asked, but those LOIs start to kick in when you start getting into back half of 2022. We obviously also had announced Truist probably about 1.5 years ago now. I think we said at the time that's a back half of 2022 event, which we continue to believe.

So I think what we said was the purchase price for Zego, just to get the math right, was about $930 million. There's also about $100 million of tax assets. So that nets you down about $825 million, Dave. So relative to the $100 million, we view it here as about 8x revenue. 
Now having said that, at the end of the day, we do think it's a great business. I think Paul alluded to this in his commentary. So if you think about it, it's already at Rule of 40 growth and really beyond that. So if you think about what we guided to when we did the deal at the time, kind of a double-digit organic revenue growth rate with margins into the 20s. That's how you get to the Rule of 40 number. So we think very attractive on that basis, but we view it, Dave, closer to 8x rather than your – the notional 10 you mentioned."

We certainly do look at -- and the economics obviously have worked out just fine, in response to Dave's question, too, just a second ago. So I think we've got a flaming pipeline and certainly more for us to do. 
We do balance though our view of M&A with where the capital markets are and what our view of intrinsic value in our share price and everything else. So we have bought back about $1.5 billion of stock. Obviously, not mutually exclusive. We did both at the same time, $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion. And we just re-upped the authorization back to $1.5 billion. That's not in our guidance. Obviously, we balance our view as to where we would like to be in terms of growth [and anything else]. But I think it's important to consider that we think we're in a pretty healthy position heading into 2022 and the rest of '21 without more deals. So we think we're kind of where we want to be. 
As a strategy matter, I think we feel really kind of much the same. So there's plenty of stuff that we look at. But I can't think of a deal that we didn't do, James, because we said, gee, it's too expensive or it's not accretive enough or those other things. If we can't add more value as a strategic buyer with the things that we're doing in terms of revenue, margin, earnings, then we're just not going to do it.

To be very clear, I don't think we've seen any real impact yet from the Delta variant. Obviously, we're monitoring it very closely, and it's a fluid environment. But I would say, sitting here today, based on data that we have through the end of last week, the volume trends, again, for July were an improvement over what we saw in June sequentially. In most of the markets around the globe in which we operate and particularly now in markets where we're seeing a reopening that's more recent, the U.K., Canada, for example, obviously, I think they're poised to see stronger volume recoveries as we enter the back half of the year. 
So look, I don't think there's a lot of appetite for more widespread lockdowns, particularly here in the U.S., as it relates to the Delta variant. Markets outside of the U.S. may react differently, but again, for our business, those are going to be relatively small impacts. We're most focused on the U.S. with 75% of our business.

As it relates to Bankia, I think the short answer to your question is yes, the exact same playbook that we've executed with Caixa and our Comercia joint venture over the last decade plus now. Obviously, we continue to be very excited about the Spanish market. It is one of the most attractive markets in Europe. Frankly, it's one of the most attractive markets globally. 
Just to give you a little bit of color. That market grew -- the domestic volume in Spain, as a volume matter, grew 30% in the second quarter and 15% over 2019, again, despite continued, obviously, restrictions throughout the country as a result of the pandemic. So the underlying secular trends in Spain remain incredibly attractive, which makes the timing for the Bankia acquisition particularly attractive for us as well. 
Bankia consists of about 100,000 predominantly small to medium-sized merchants, although they do venture more into the large category as well. But I think the interesting thing about the Bankia portfolio is it's more skewed towards domestic volume. So again, I think it's a really attractive addition to our Comercia joint venture. That's going to allow us, again, to further expand distribution in this very attractive market and gives great cross-sell opportunities for the differentiated technology solutions we have in the Comercia joint venture today. So we're delighted to be able to announce that this morning, and a nice addition to our European business."

I'm just kind of wondering, are those the kind of deals that as you've discussed before, you perhaps might not have gotten without the AWS partnership? And what sort of capabilities do they require that may be different from your traditional issuing business?"

I think the key thesis behind the partnership with AWS just almost a year ago to the day now was first really just to modernize the architecture and technology. And as we've said in response to Ashwin's question, that's actually gone very well. And the second piece was the distribution. So of those 20 LOIs that we have pending with AWS, a number of those are with neobanks, fintechs and start-ups. And you're right, I don't think we would have been -- we would not be in the position we are today, I think, without that. And I would also say more broadly, if you back up, just our general shift from cloud-enabled technologies initially into cloud-native technologies is just selling very well with institutions of all sizes, including neobanks and fintechs and start-ups and the like. 
The second thing I'd say, you saw in our announcement the expansion of our AWS relationship today into Netspend. But whether it's at the issuing business or at the Netspend business, we're very focused on program management. So to answer your second question, I think we need to be more vocal on program management. I think historically, most of the revenue -- the growth that we get in the issuing business is really with financial institutions and generally inside the United States, North America and Western Europe, larger financial institutions. Key focal point of ours pre and now, of course, post AWS, both at Netspend as well as issuer, is on program management. That's a key part of the relationship with AWS going forward on the new partnership we announced today. So I would look for us to do more there, and we'll share more detail with you next month on September 8."

So we really got 3 legs of the stool as far as strategy is in Netspend. First is ongoing digitization. And I think Netspend had pre pandemic a pretty good digital footprint. And not surprising to anyone on this phone, the pandemic has really accelerated that. And I would say kind of high 20s, 30% of interactions today with consumers with Netspend are done online, buying a card online, spending with the card online. And we certainly expect AWS, of course, to continue to accelerate that given their footprint. 
The second is what I just described in response to your first question, which is really B2B and program management. But I'd be remiss if I didn't mention it also includes [ inlay dash ] to access paycards and our tips solutions. So those are all obviously also in play on B2B. 
And the third leg of the stool is really what we get at most narrowly, which is internationalization. So a piece of that is MoneyToPay. The second piece, we announced today with Bankia because that also includes a prepaid business, a debit business as well. 
And the short answer to your question is it's gone really well. Our thesis on internationalization is -- given who Global Payments is, the 38 countries we operate in particularly on the acquiring side as well as the relationships we have in those markets, a great example is Continental Europe with Spain, it allows us uniquely to expand what was really a U.S.-only business, which it is today for Netspend and for some of the competitors, and really bring it overseas. And now that we're approaching 9 or 10 months post the initial closing of the MoneyToPay JV with Caixa, I can tell you that we're running ahead of what we expected. I think our thesis that we can bring our management, our products, our technologies to those markets has rung true. 
The thesis that those markets are under-penetrated relative to the United States is also true. We have seen some benefit there on government spending, too, as we all kind of emerge from the pandemic, not just here in the United States but overseas. So it's really working out better than we hoped, and we're really pleased to be where we are, especially with the kind of partners that we have."

So as we move forward in time, with AWS, it makes it easier to bring technology, product capability to the markets outside of the U.S. as we continue the internationalization strategy for the Netspend business."

We delivered a terrific second quarter with each of adjusted net revenue, adjusted operating margin and adjusted earnings per share outperforming our targets. We are most pleased by the compounded rates of growth that we realized in the quarter and are now forecasting for the full year compared to pre-pandemic 2019 levels. While we've not called back all of the impact of COVID-19 relative to our pre-pandemic expectations, we have made substantial progress and are far down that path.  
As we have throughout the pandemic, we continue to expand our competitive moat through leading strategic partnerships. First, we are excited to have agreed with our partners at CaixaBank to acquire Bankia's payments businesses in Spain. Specifically, we will enhance our position in one of the most attractive acquiring markets in Europe with the addition of Bankia's merchant business, consisting of roughly 100,000 customers in the region. This pending acquisition further enhances our distinctive distribution and will allow us to delight Bankia's customers with our market-leading technologies, providing us with significant cross-selling opportunities and deepening our presence with one of the leading institutions in Europe.  
This agreement follows our purchase of an additional 29% stake in our Comercia joint venture last October, which increased Global Payments' ownership to 80%. Additionally, our MoneyToPay joint venture has agreed to purchase Bankia's prepaid business as we continue to execute on our strategy to expand and diversify our Netspend business into international markets. We expect both of these transactions to close in the fourth quarter.  
Second, we are delighted to announce that we have entered into a new collaboration with Amazon Web Services, AWS, for a unique distribution and cutting-edge technologies at Netspend to substantially increase our target addressable markets and accelerate our strategy across our 3 pillars of digitization, internationalization and B2B expansion. Much as that we have done with our issuer business, we plan to leverage the AWS partner network and dedicated partner development specialists to bring Netspend's B2C and B2B digital payment solutions, including program management, to a broader base of neobanks, fintech start-ups and other e-commerce players as well as to new geographies. This partnership will also provide an industry-leading cloud-based processing platform for Netspend's customers to access cutting-edge technologies with greater speed to market, security and flexibility. We are thrilled to deepen our go-to-market collaboration with one of the world's largest technology companies to continue our disruption of these markets.  
Third, we are pleased to have closed our acquisition of Zego in June, further capitalizing on the convergence of software and payments in one of the largest and most attractive vertical markets worldwide. As I highlighted last quarter, real estate is the quintessence of the type of market that we seek: sizable; global in scope; fragmented; and ripe for further software, digital commerce and payment penetration. And COVID-19 has accelerated the underlying trends that make this $6.5 billion target addressable market so attractive as we continue to expand our software-driven footprint. It is my great pleasure to welcome Zego team members to Global Payments.  
In addition to these strategic accomplishments, we produced yet another outstanding quarter of results. Since we began running the company in 2013, our main focus has been on 2 areas: enabling diverse, distinctive and defensible distribution; and developing market-leading technologies. We could not be more pleased with the momentum across our businesses, evident in our second quarter results and reflected in our increased guidance for 2021. It's worth noting that we have delivered the greatest value creation in our history over the last 8 years despite numerous new market entrants during the entirety of that period, public and private. And we have generated consistent financial and operating outperformance through a variety of macroeconomic cycles, including, most recently, the financial impact of the first worldwide pandemic in over 100 years. 
The results are self-evident. We have record performance in the second quarter in our merchant segment on several bases, absolute, sequential and year-over-year, while also producing strong growth versus pre-pandemic levels. Simply put, our payments businesses continue to significantly outperform and gain share, fueled by our long-held technology-enabled focus and solid ongoing execution.  
On a more granular basis, we saw a strong double-digit growth in new sales in both Global Payments Integrated and our vertical market businesses in the quarter, and our U.S. relationship-led business again achieved record new sales. This marks the third quarter out of the last 4 in which we have achieved such a high level of performance. Rather than impede our strategy, the pandemic spurred further share gains and catalyzed the digital strategies we have had in place since 2013.  
Our omnichannel businesses accelerated yet again in the second quarter with growth in excess of 20% despite lapping the enhanced shift toward e-commerce globally that began with the start of the pandemic in early 2020. New customer signings this quarter include Foot Locker as a key customer in Europe that will leverage our Unified Commerce Platform or UCP to modernize its payment acceptance capabilities. We are pleased to have also signed new global UCP partnerships with Hunter Douglas and Euronet Worldwide subsidiary, Xe.com. Our ability to deliver a single API solution virtually around the world has been a key driver of our success. And our unique multinational footprint in both the virtual and the physical worlds has proven to be a differentiator versus both legacy and new market entrants.  
Within our vertical market businesses, we had a number of new key customer wins for our quick-service restaurant business, including Frisch's Big Boy, Krystal's and the Fiesta Group, while AMD and TouchNet continue to deliver record revenue performance as they have throughout the pandemic. Notably, TouchNet continues to add new marquee colleges and universities domestically and internationally, including the Arkansas State University System and Sheridan College in Canada this quarter. We're also making great progress in our partnership with Google and remain on track to board Google as a merchant customer this quarter and expect to launch our [ Run and Grow My Business ] product that integrates Google solutions in our digital portal environment in the fourth quarter.  
Our issuer business delivered growth beyond the high end of our targeted long-term range. We are pleased to have signed a new multiyear partnership with Banco Carrefour in Brazil, the financial services arm of the country's leading supercenter retail chain, to provide a range of technologies for its credit card and digital accounts as well as to handle on-us acquiring transactions. Recall that transaction optimization is one of our key post-merger initiatives. More to come on that at our investor conference.  
We also signed a letter of intent with a large global financial institution and long-standing partner in a new market in Lat Am that will mark another significant milestone for us in our continued expansion into the region. Further, we executed a multiyear extension with the U.K.'s largest retailer, Tesco, enabled by our shared digital modernization vision for the future. Finally, we are pleased to have extended our relationship with Mercury Financial for a range of digital technologies. This relationship serves as further proof that our industry-leading platform offers the agility to support leading-edge fintech companies. 
TSYS recently launched a strategic go-to-market partnership with PricewaterhouseCoopers or PwC. As part of the TSYS Partner Program, we expect that our collaboration with PwC will diversify and expand our distribution and allow us to jointly offer innovative solutions, expertise and execution capabilities to clients of all sizes, across the full spectrum of neobanks, fintech, start-ups and program managers. Again, diversification of distribution has been one of our key objectives since 2013, and we are using the same playbook with TSYS that we have successfully deployed in the past.  
We continue to capitalize on the broad and deep pipeline we have a good fortune to have in our issuer business. Today, we have 15 letters of intent with institutions worldwide, 6 of which are competitive takeaways.  
Turning to our unique collaboration. We now have 20 active prospects in our pipeline with AWS, up from a dozen last quarter and 4 at the end of 2020. These include a mix of new financial technology entrants and other nontraditional issuers in addition to large financial institutions. As growth accelerates in this market, we believe that we are the ones doing the disrupting.  
While buy now, pay later solutions may seem novel to some, we have, in fact, been providing leading technologies to that segment of the market for decades in both our issuer and merchant segments, and we continue to deliver innovative installment payments products for customers. We are currently enabling our merchant customers in Canada in partnership with Desjardins with a Visa installment solution. CIBC will also launch a combined TSYS Visa installment solution in early 2022, and we signed a global referral agreement with Mastercard supporting installment payments in June.  
Finally, in our business and consumer segment, we expect a unique co-sale arrangement with AWS to expand our distribution capabilities, again, much like we've been doing since 2013. And together with our issuer business, we intend to further disrupt the program management segment in the near future. This is yet another example of application of our strategies to legacy TSYS businesses, and we expect the same successes here as we have generated in other contexts. Paul?"

Our financial performance in the second quarter of 2021 demonstrated meaningful sequential momentum and exceeded our expectations. These results highlight outstanding execution on our differentiated strategy of technology enablement. Specifi",1376,"Thanks, Jeff. Our financial performance in the second quarter of 2021 demonstrated meaningful sequential momentum and exceeded our expectations. These results highlight outstanding execution on our differentiated strategy of technology enablement. Specifically, we delivered adjusted net revenue of $1.94 billion, representing 28% growth compared to the prior year and 10% growth compared to 2019. Adjusted operating margin for the second quarter was 41.8%, a 480 basis point improvement from the prior year despite the return of certain costs we temporarily reduced at the onset of the pandemic. The net result was adjusted earnings per share of $2.04 for the quarter, an increase of 56% compared to the prior year and a 35% improvement from the same period in 2019.  
Taking a closer look at our performance by segment. Merchant Solutions achieved adjusted net revenue of $1.29 billion for the second quarter, a 42% improvement from the prior year. We delivered an adjusted operating margin of 48.5% in this segment, an increase of 750 basis points from the same period in 2020, as we continue to benefit from the recovery and our improving technology-enabled business mix.  
We are pleased that our acquiring businesses globally generated 46% adjusted net revenue growth compared to the second quarter of 2020, led by strength in the U.S. Notably, our U.S. acquiring business, which includes our integrated and relationship-led channels, grew approximately 25% compared to the same period in 2019. These results were led by our integrated business, which produced a stellar quarter, generating a 53% adjusted net revenue improvement compared to 2020 and 35% growth relative to 2019. 
As for our own software businesses in the U.S., we are delighted with the overall portfolio delivered growth of roughly 30% compared to the prior year and achieved solid sequential improvement relative to the first quarter. As Jeff mentioned, our vertical markets businesses continue to see positive bookings trends, providing us with a favorable tailwind for the second half of 2021. Additionally, our worldwide e-commerce and omnichannel businesses saw growth in excess of 20% year-on-year as our value proposition, including our Unified Commerce Platform or UCP, continues to resonate with customers.  
Regarding our international businesses, while these markets have been a bit slower to recover compared to the U.S. on an absolute basis, our portfolio of businesses across Europe and Asia contribute favorably to our overall merchant adjusted net revenue as a growth matter compared to 2020. These businesses also returned to growth on a combined basis when compared to 2019.   
Moving to Issuer Solutions. We are pleased to have delivered a record $446 million in adjusted net revenue for the second quarter, marking an 8% improvement from the prior year period. This strong performance was driven by the ongoing recovery in transaction volumes across many of our markets while non-volume-based revenue increased mid-single digits during the period, led by our output service business, which grew at roughly 10% for the quarter. 
Our issuer business also achieved record second quarter adjusted operating income, and adjusted segment operating margin expanded 110 basis points from the prior year, also reaching a new second quarter record of 43.9% as we continue to benefit from our efforts to drive efficiencies in this business. This is an impressive result, particularly given we achieved margin expansion of 640 basis points in the second quarter of 2020. Additionally, our issuer team signed 5 long-term contract extensions during the quarter, and our strong pipeline bodes well for future continued momentum going forward.  
Finally, our Business and Consumer Solutions segment delivered adjusted net revenue of $227 million, representing growth of 5%, despite lapping the benefit of the 2020 CARES Act last year. As a reminder, this business delivered double-digit growth in the second quarter of 2020, driven in part by our support of the disbursement of over $1.4 billion in stimulus fund during that period. Adjusted operating margin for this segment was 26.9%, which was also ahead of our expectations.   
The outstanding performance we delivered across our businesses serves as a further proof point that we continue to gain share as well as the alignment of our strategy with the accelerating digital trends coming out of the pandemic. We are also pleased that our integration continues to progress well, and we have now executed actions allowing for the achievement of annual run rate expense synergies of at least $400 million and annual run rate revenue synergies of at least $150 million that we have been targeting exactly as we said we would do and despite the pandemic. We will continue to deliver additional expense and revenue synergies over the coming periods as our efficiency efforts continue and we leverage the collaborative growth opportunities across our businesses.  
From a cash flow standpoint, we generated second quarter adjusted free cash flow of roughly $452 million or a little over $1 billion through the first 6 months and continue to expect adjusted free cash flow in excess of $2 billion for the year. We reinvested approximately $130 million in capital expenditures during the quarter and continue to expect capital expenditures in the $500 million to $600 million range for the full year. 
In June, we successfully closed our acquisition of Zego, consistent with our expectations. And we expect this business will contribute roughly $50 million of adjusted net revenue to our merchant segment in 2021. I would like to echo Jeff's excitement regarding the agreements we announced today to acquire Bankia's payments businesses in Spain, and we expect these transactions to close in the fourth quarter. Further, we remain on track to complete our purchase of Worldline's PAYONE business in Austria in the second half of this year. 
We are pleased to have continued to return cash to our shareholders this quarter with the repurchase of 1.5 million of our shares for approximately $290 million. Following our balanced deployment of capital this quarter, we ended the period with roughly $3.3 billion of liquidity and a leverage position of roughly 2.6x on a net debt basis, which is flat from the last quarter as expected, and this leaves us with continuing ample capacity going forward.  
Based on our current expectations for the continued global recovery, we are again increasing our guidance for adjusted net revenue to now be in a range of $7.7 billion to $7.73 billion, reflecting growth of 14% to 15% over 2020. We continue to expect adjusted operating margin expansion of up to 250 basis points compared to 2020 levels on a stand-alone basis. As a reminder, Zego will be a modest headwind to the upper bound of our margin target now that it is closed as it does not currently operate at our margin levels despite having already achieved Rule of 40 status.  
At the segment level, we are increasing our expectations for Merchant Solutions adjusted net revenue growth to be around 20% from high teens previously, which assumes the current pace of recovery continues worldwide. This marks the second consecutive quarter that we have raised our outlook for our merchant business. 
We are also increasing our outlook for our issuer business and now expect growth to be in the low to mid-single-digit range for 2021, up from our prior outlook of low single-digit growth. We continue to expect our Business and Consumer segment to achieve mid- to high single-digit growth for the full year, consistent with our long-term growth target for Netspend. As a reminder, we increased our guidance for this segment on our first quarter earnings call in May despite lapping the impact of the 2020 CARES Act. 
Moving to nonoperating items. We continue to expect net interest expense to be slightly lower in 2021 relative to 2020 while we anticipate our adjusted tax rate will be relatively consistent with last year. Putting it all together, we are increasing our expected adjusted earnings per share for the full year to a range of $8.07 to $8.20, reflecting growth of 26% to 28% over 2020. Our raised outlook presumes we remain on a path to recovery worldwide over the balance of the year. 
We look forward to updating you on our longer-term expectations for the business at our upcoming Virtual Investor Conference, which we will host on Wednesday, September 8. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff."

As we look ahead to next month, it is worth reflecting on how much we have evolved our business. Throughout much of the last 8 years, we have witnessed a multitude of new market entrants, newly public companies, shifting modes of competition and macroeconomic cycles too numerous to count. Some said a number of times over the near  last decade that our best days were behind us. The facts say quite the opposite. 
In fact, we have delivered the greatest value creation in our history during that period, and we believe we are poised today to continue our track record of outperformance. The second quarter and our raised guidance today are the most recent examples. Our rates of revenue growth and bookings trends underscore sustained share gains despite managing through an unprecedented crisis. One proof point, we now expect our U.S. payments business to roughly reach its original growth target for 2021 based on 2019 goals. In short, we grew right through the pandemic. More to follow in September.  
The reasons for our success are straightforward. Our distinctive strategies, the technology investments we have made over many years, the support of our market-leading partners and customers, our execution consistency and the quality of our team members have allowed us to significantly expand our competitive moat.

In addition, our e-comm and omni business grew well over 20% this quarter, again, topping performance from last year where it also grew in the high teens level. So again, relative to 2019, continuing to see very strong growth across the e-comm and omnichannels of the business. So for me, it's really the strategy that we've been deploying that's driving growth.

So as we said in the press release, I think we've been very balanced between the 2. 
As we also said in the last quarter, Zego is a technology and software-driven business, very consistent with our strategy, particularly given the size of the real estate target addressable market.  Notwithstanding that, going back to the premise of your question, no, that deal was not dilutive. And I think we announced it was immediately accretive. Although really no discernible impact on earnings, but nonetheless, it was not dilutive. 
We look at many things, so it's hard to say what we would or wouldn't do in the abstract. What I would say is, since we've been running the company in the last 8 years, we've not done a dilutive deal. I don't expect us to. That's not the mindset we have as shareholders and owners and managers of the business. So I really don't expect our strategy to change."

But largely speaking, we're expecting roughly 3Q and 4Q to be largely similar across our businesses. As we have said at the beginning of the year, we had expected the back half of the year to return to a much more normal kind of state. And so clearly, there are some reopenings that will continue to benefit kind of 3Q into 4Q as countries around the world kind of reopen from some of the closures. 
You're exactly right, Ashwin, as it relates to some of our vertical markets businesses. As I just commented, we're very pleased with the growth we saw in 2Q, but we would see more meaningful growth on those businesses in the back half of the year as we have more reopening and kind of more tailwind kind of impact as it relates to those businesses. So yes, those would be the dynamics between kind of Q2, Q3 to Q4 certainly in merchant. 
And there wouldn't be anything I would necessarily call out across the other 2 businesses. Obviously, very pleased to raise the revenue guide on our issuer business from low single digits to low to mid-single digit. So it talks about kind of improving fundamentals in the back half of the year there and pretty static state as it relates to our business in consumer once kind of the stimulus impact has been netted out of the first half and going into the back half.

I would only add just a couple of points. One is across the technology-enabled businesses, as I mentioned previously, going to the first part of your question, we're continuing to see very strong momentum in those businesses. As Paul highlighted, July sequentially is better than June as a trend matter. So I think we feel good about how things are continuing to progress, and those businesses are poised to continue to see strength in the back half of the year. 
If you just look at the overall guide from the merchant segment, that roughly 20% growth in 2021 versus 2020, the back couple of quarters kind of have to be around that same level to make the averages work for the whole year. So that gives you a sense as to how the business is performing, again, against tougher comps in Q3 and Q4 than we certainly faced in the second quarter. So I think that should give you a little bit of a sense as to the momentum that we have in those businesses.  
To Paul's point around the vertical market businesses in particular, obviously, schools, once we get back into, obviously, a normal school environment, hopefully quasi-normal school environment here in August and September, those businesses -- that business in particular is poised to see a rebound in the back half of the year, as well as ACTIVE. ACTIVE has seen very strong booking trends. Many of those events are occurring in the back half of 2021. So I think we feel very good about how that business is poised to recover. 
And again, AdvancedMD and TouchNet has continued to grow right through the pandemic, obviously a double-digit pace throughout 2020 and 2021. So those businesses are obviously in a very healthy position overall. But getting a nice tailwind from ACTIVE in schools in particular in the back half of the year will help the vertical market business continue to recover as an overall matter."

Let me first start with Netspend, which is actually our new announcement today. It follows a very similar, I think, format to the issuer announcement almost exactly a year ago today. But the one thing I will point out is that -- in Netspend is that there's primarily a focus on our part and Amazon's part on B2B distribution and I'd say in particular on program management with the scale that we have directed at neobanks, fintechs and start-ups. So while it is a similar template, it's a very targeted initiative, very much focused on B2B. And obviously, that's something on September 8 at our Virtual Investor Day that we'll be talking a lot about. 
In terms of your question on how we're doing on the issuers side, look, we're really pleased. We disclosed again yesterday, as we have for really the last year plus, what our LOI pipeline looks like outside of Amazon and with Amazon. I think what we said today is we have something like 20 letters of intent with our colleagues over at AWS. And that's for the whole spectrum of potential issuers, again, including neobanks, fintechs and start-ups as well as traditional financial institutions. 
And to give an update there, the one we singled out in Asia is in testing already and is live on a beta basis and we expect to be fully live by the end of this calendar year. And that -- to give you a sense of progress, Ashwin, that 20, I think, is up from 4 at the end of calendar 2020. So we quintupled the number of LOIs that we have with neobanks, fintechs, start-ups and financial institutions with AWS really in a 6 -- through the end of second quarter, so kind of on a 6-month basis. So we couldn't be more pleased, and the fact that we're doing more business with AWS now in the form of Netspend should be a recognition not just internally but externally of how happy we are with how things are progressing."

I think credit card account growth is as high as it's been, I think, since 2010. And obviously, on the heels of the pandemic, in a more normal operating environment, we clearly see credit outperforming. 
To your point, debit clearly outperformed in the midst of the pandemic. And by the way, a lot of that was prepaid debit as stimulus was funded on those types of accounts. So a lot of the debit growth was prepaid. But certainly, coming out of the pandemic, getting back to a normal operating environment, we would expect credit to drive growth and really outperform. And I think we see a lot of tailwinds particularly for our merchant business as a result of that, heading in the back half of 2021, into 2022 as a result of that. 
And then of course, we see those same trends in our issuer business. I'll let Paul maybe touch a little bit on the metrics that we're seeing there, but I'd say, overall, we feel good about the growth in credit.

Let me just start by saying PayPal is a good partner of ours really, as we said before, on both the TSYS side and the global side really around the world. So we've got a lot of respect for PayPal. We think they're a terrific company. 
As it relates specifically to iZettle at the physical point of sale, so iZettle has been in Europe for quite some time, David. In fact, when PayPal did the deal, I think it was mostly all European. Now they've announced, as you're implying, some migration to the United States. So our businesses in Europe -- let's just use the U.K. and London as one specific example. iZettle has been there for some time, yet our business has outperformed for many years throughout that period, both pre, post PayPal acquiring iZettle -- and post. 
As it relates to the United States market, look, that market is competitive today. It was competitive yesterday. It's going to be even more competitive tomorrow. Yet as Cameron rightly pointed out, our growth in our U.S. business is just around the same growth as our worldwide acquiring business, around 46%. And it compares to the Visa's and MasterCard's worldwide growth. It was like 35% for Visa and 33% for Mastercard. 
So whether iZettle was in Europe or iZettle was in North America, over the last number of years, it certainly hasn't placed anything like a dent in terms of our growth. And I think what we'll be talking about next month, David, at our Virtual Investor Conference is the resilience of our business, our market share gains. Some of that, as you rightly pointed out, was in our prepared remarks. But notwithstanding the coming and going of many new smart competitors, our business has been resilient both pre pandemic and post, and we'll take you through the math in why we think that's going to continue. So it's a great company, but at the end of the day, I don't think that's [important] to our vision of our strategy, the one I noted."

So Europe grew somewhere in the high single digits versus 2019 for the second quarter. So we still need a little more tailwind from Europe fully recovering. As you know, the U.K. didn't open up until mid-July. 
So as we get to the back half of the year, we're expecting to see a little more tailwind in Europe as it relates to growth and particularly relative to 2019 trends. And then, of course, Asia, which is a small part of the business but it's still lagging relative to 2019 levels largely because many markets continue to struggle with the pandemic remain closed. And of course, cross-border activity in Asia is very depressed and continues to be depressed because of the pandemic. 
So as we think about 2022, we think the U.S. is on a pretty good trajectory to get back to something reasonably close to what we would have been absent the pandemic, given the outsized growth and the momentum we have in that business. We need Europe to continue to improve as the lockdowns end and markets begin to reopen and you see more cross-border travel pick up. And then I'd say the same thing is true for Asia just given where it sits relative to the pandemic. 
I think the vertical markets are well poised to get back to reasonable levels compared to 2019 as we continue to see, again, a recovery in schools and a recovery in ACTIVE in the back half of the year as those markets in particular reopen. So Paul, I don't know if you'd add anything more to that, but I think that gives a pretty good overview of the merchant business."

But I would say, in particular, the non-U.S. businesses echo a lot of what Cameron said. So we only recently -- which is to say really the end of second quarter heading into July and continuing in July, we've only recently seen kind of a reopening for issuer purposes of a lot of markets outside the United States. That will be a favorable comparison, Dave, to answer your question, for the first half, obviously of next year. 
And I'd add to that commercial card. So while commercial card, not surprisingly, is up versus '20, it's really not up versus '19. So I think it's a pretty good picture, Dave, heading into '22 on the issuer side as well because you do have those 2 elements of broader reopening outside the United States and commercial card relative to '19 starting to normalize that should be favorable tailwinds for the issuer business. 
And lastly, I'll say on issuer, we described again today as Ashwin asked, but those LOIs start to kick in when you start getting into back half of 2022. We obviously also had announced Truist probably about 1.5 years ago now. I think we said at the time that's a back half of 2022 event, which we continue to believe. So I think you're going to get -- similar to comments that Cameron made on merchant, you are going to get a nice tailwind heading into 2022 on issuer as well."

So we also announced the acquisition of PAYONE's Austrian business in Worldline in the second quarter. And then, obviously, today, we announced Bankia as well. So I think what we said was the purchase price for Zego, just to get the math right, was about $930 million. There's also about $100 million of tax assets. So that nets you down about $825 million, Dave. So relative to the $100 million, we view it here as about 8x revenue. 
Now having said that, at the end of the day, we do think it's a great business. I think Paul alluded to this in his commentary. So if you think about it, it's already at Rule of 40 growth and really beyond that. So if you think about what we guided to when we did the deal at the time, kind of a double-digit organic revenue growth rate with margins into the 20s. That's how you get to the Rule of 40 number. So we think very attractive on that basis, but we view it, Dave, closer to 8x rather than your – the notional 10 you mentioned."

So no, we're not -- the answer to your question is no, we're not looking further afield. We've got plenty of blue sky in front of us.

We certainly do look at -- and the economics obviously have worked out just fine, in response to Dave's question, too, just a second ago. So I think we've got a flaming pipeline and certainly more for us to do. 
We do balance though our view of M&A with where the capital markets are and what our view of intrinsic value in our share price and everything else. So we have bought back about $1.5 billion of stock. Obviously, not mutually exclusive. We did both at the same time, $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion. And we just re-upped the authorization back to $1.5 billion. That's not in our guidance. Obviously, we balance our view as to where we would like to be in terms of growth [and anything else]. But I think it's important to consider that we think we're in a pretty healthy position heading into 2022 and the rest of '21 without more deals. So we think we're kind of where we want to be. 
As a strategy matter, I think we feel really kind of much the same. So there's plenty of stuff that we look at. But I can't think of a deal that we didn't do, James, because we said, gee, it's too expensive or it's not accretive enough or those other things. If we can't add more value as a strategic buyer with the things that we're doing in terms of revenue, margin, earnings, then we're just not going to do it. I don't think it's a function of valuation so much as a function of our view of where we are in the strategy and our view of where the market is."

So as you think about the comments we made earlier as it relates to July, we did see sequential improvement in July relative to June. So I think we still feel very good about the momentum of the recovery overall. 
To be very clear, I don't think we've seen any real impact yet from the Delta variant. Obviously, we're monitoring it very closely, and it's a fluid environment. But I would say, sitting here today, based on data that we have through the end of last week, the volume trends, again, for July were an improvement over what we saw in June sequentially. In most of the markets around the globe in which we operate and particularly now in markets where we're seeing a reopening that's more recent, the U.K., Canada, for example, obviously, I think they're poised to see stronger volume recoveries as we enter the back half of the year. 
So look, I don't think there's a lot of appetite for more widespread lockdowns, particularly here in the U.S., as it relates to the Delta variant. Markets outside of the U.S. may react differently, but again, for our business, those are going to be relatively small impacts. We're most focused on the U.S. with 75% of our business. And I'd say, thus far, we haven't really seen any discernible impact, but it is something that we continue to monitor very closely through the balance of the year."

And then the second section would be both the overperformance in Q2 as well as continued kind of better performance in the back half, which underpin the guidance raise as it relates to the segment on the issuing side as well as merchant. 
So those would be the 2 components. There's a little bit of FX headwind relative to the back half versus the first half on a realized basis. We also don't have the same kind of stimulus impact in the first half versus the second half.

As it relates to Bankia, I think the short answer to your question is yes, the exact same playbook that we've executed with Caixa and our Comercia joint venture over the last decade plus now. Obviously, we continue to be very excited about the Spanish market. It is one of the most attractive markets in Europe. Frankly, it's one of the most attractive markets globally. 
Just to give you a little bit of color. That market grew -- the domestic volume in Spain, as a volume matter, grew 30% in the second quarter and 15% over 2019, again, despite continued, obviously, restrictions throughout the country as a result of the pandemic. So the underlying secular trends in Spain remain incredibly attractive, which makes the timing for the Bankia acquisition particularly attractive for us as well. 
Bankia consists of about 100,000 predominantly small to medium-sized merchants, although they do venture more into the large category as well. But I think the interesting thing about the Bankia portfolio is it's more skewed towards domestic volume. So again, I think it's a really attractive addition to our Comercia joint venture. That's going to allow us, again, to further expand distribution in this very attractive market and gives great cross-sell opportunities for the differentiated technology solutions we have in the Comercia joint venture today. So we're delighted to be able to announce that this morning, and a nice addition to our European business."

I think the key thesis behind the partnership with AWS just almost a year ago to the day now was first really just to modernize the architecture and technology. And as we've said in response to Ashwin's question, that's actually gone very well. And the second piece was the distribution. So of those 20 LOIs that we have pending with AWS, a number of those are with neobanks, fintechs and start-ups. And you're right, I don't think we would have been -- we would not be in the position we are today, I think, without that. And I would also say more broadly, if you back up, just our general shift from cloud-enabled technologies initially into cloud-native technologies is just selling very well with institutions of all sizes, including neobanks and fintechs and start-ups and the like. 
The second thing I'd say, you saw in our announcement the expansion of our AWS relationship today into Netspend. But whether it's at the issuing business or at the Netspend business, we're very focused on program management. So to answer your second question, I think we need to be more vocal on program management. I think historically, most of the revenue -- the growth that we get in the issuing business is really with financial institutions and generally inside the United States, North America and Western Europe, larger financial institutions. Key focal point of ours pre and now, of course, post AWS, both at Netspend as well as issuer, is on program management. That's a key part of the relationship with AWS going forward on the new partnership we announced today. So I would look for us to do more there, and we'll share more detail with you next month on September 8."

So we really got 3 legs of the stool as far as strategy is in Netspend. First is ongoing digitization. And I think Netspend had pre pandemic a pretty good digital footprint. And not surprising to anyone on this phone, the pandemic has really accelerated that. And I would say kind of high 20s, 30% of interactions today with consumers with Netspend are done online, buying a card online, spending with the card online. And we certainly expect AWS, of course, to continue to accelerate that given their footprint. 
The second is what I just described in response to your first question, which is really B2B and program management. But I'd be remiss if I didn't mention it also includes [ inlay dash ] to access paycards and our tips solutions. So those are all obviously also in play on B2B. 
And the third leg of the stool is really what we get at most narrowly, which is internationalization. So a piece of that is MoneyToPay. The second piece, we announced today with Bankia because that also includes a prepaid business, a debit business as well. 
And the short answer to your question is it's gone really well. Our thesis on internationalization is -- given who Global Payments is, the 38 countries we operate in particularly on the acquiring side as well as the relationships we have in those markets, a great example is Continental Europe with Spain, it allows us uniquely to expand what was really a U.S.-only business, which it is today for Netspend and for some of the competitors, and really bring it overseas. And now that we're approaching 9 or 10 months post the initial closing of the MoneyToPay JV with Caixa, I can tell you that we're running ahead of what we expected. I think our thesis that we can bring our management, our products, our technologies to those markets has rung true. 
The thesis that those markets are under-penetrated relative to the United States is also true. We have seen some benefit there on government spending, too, as we all kind of emerge from the pandemic, not just here in the United States but overseas. So it's really working out better than we hoped, and we're really pleased to be where we are, especially with the kind of partners that we have."

We delivered record third quarter results despite the incremental challenges that emerged during the period from COVID-19, highlighting the resiliency of our business model and our ongoing track record of execution across market cycles. 
We also surpassed $2 billion of quarterly asset net revenue for the first time in our history, with record margins and produced all-time high quarterly adjusted earnings per share and adjusted free cash flow. 
As we detailed at our investor conference just a short time ago on September 8, the trend toward accelerated digitization coming out of the pandemic has benefited our business by reinforcing that mode of competition. And this quarter provided further proof points of the wisdom of our approach to drive differentiated growth across the 4 pillars of our strategy. 
First, we extended long-standing relationships with both CITI and CIBC as a reflection of our prowess as a top quartile Software-as-a-Service or SaaS technology company with unmatched worldwide payments expertise. Our durable partnerships with some of the most sophisticated and complex institutions globally speak to our competitiveness well into the remainder of this decade. 
Starting with CITI, we are delighted to have furthered our relationship with one of our largest commercial card customers for another 8 years. This agreement highlights a key element of what is already today a successful B2B business at scale. More on this new pillar to our strategy in a moment. We're also pleased to have renewed our additional relationship with CIBC, a top 10 customer in North America, that spans both its consumer credit and debit portfolios for an extended term. 
As we discussed in September, we also continue to build our pipelines with AWS to include additional fintech neobanks and embedded finance players spanning multiple geographies. We now have 25 active prospects in our issuer pipeline with AWS, up from 20 last quarter and 4 at the end of 2020. We also currently have 10 letters of intent with institutions worldwide, 6 of which are competitive takeaways. 2 of our LOIs have gone to contract with London-based [ Tenex ] to integrate its cloud native capabilities, allowing us to collaborate on modern core banking in issuing solutions for Neobank and traditional financial institution. 
Optimization Solutions. It's worth noting that Virgin Money is also a significant competitive takeaway for us. Simply put, we're winning in our Issuer Solutions business because we are selling more market-leading technologies to more distinctive and defensible distribution channels in more markets than we ever have previously. 
In our vertical markets businesses where we lead with SaaS at the top of the funnel, we're delighted to announce our new partnership with Mercedes-Benz Stadium in September. As we highlighted, we believe that we were successful because of our ability to seamlessly and uniquely combine software hardware and payments across in-person, mobile and online channels. We expect to facilitate a best-in-class fan experience through market-leading commerce enablement solutions. We're now in pilot with Mercedes-Benz Stadium, and we expect to be fully live early in 2022. We're gratified that after canvassing the payments landscape in an extensive RFP including with a full spectrum of new market entrants, this sophisticated institution terminated their existing relationships and chose us for our software and payment technologies with a commitment well into the back half of this decade. 
Further, across our merchant technology-enabled businesses, our POS software solutions generated revenue growth of nearly 70% compared to 2019 in the third quarter. 
In our central education business in Australia, grew over 50% versus 2019 despite lockdowns in that market. 
In addition to the key win at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, our Zego business delivered record bookings in the third quarter and also had notable successes with Subway, Water Berger, Bojangles, RBI and Wendy's, spanning software hardware payments and data and analytics. These results highlight the benefits we're seeing from the accelerated digitization in our markets. Our e-commerce and omnichannel businesses drove growth in excess of 20% again this quarter. This business is another example of pandemic-induced accelerated digitization benefiting us with current growth rates 1/3 faster than pre-COVID levels. A few examples of notable success here this quarter. We broadened our relationship with Uber and Uber Eats into an additional market in Asia Pacific beyond Taiwan. We expanded our long-standing relationship with the Swatch Group to now include e-commerce alongside the solutions we provide in store today across North America and Asia Pacific. And we went in line with Google as a merchant in multiple markets in Asia Pacific exactly as we said we would. We remain on track to launch Google run and grow my business this quarter, and we're already working on the launch of the next phase to help our merchants grow faster by connecting additional Google services including online ordering, retail inventory and reservations to our digital platform. 
These solutions will, over time, drive more consumers to our merchants and dramatically expand our value proposition with 1 of the leading technology players worldwide. 
We're also very pleased to announce today that we have extended and expanded the scope of our relationship with PayPal, one of the most sophisticated payments companies globally. This multiyear partnership leverages our unparalleled e-commerce technology footprint across cross-border North America, Europe and Asia Pacific, and it will dramatically expand our target addressable markets over its term. 
We've added new geographies additional verticals in support of quick currencies for the first time. Together with CITI, Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Virgin Money and CIBC what better testament to our current and future competitiveness. 
As we said in September, we continue to benefit from ongoing innovation in our ecosystem, including buying a pay later or BNPL technologies. We expect to enable more than 1.5 billion BNPL transactions this year alone, and we anticipate issuing more than 50 million virtual cards with more than $23 billion in volume. It's a market we know well because it's a market that we've been serving for decades globally. 
As BNPL continues to grow, we believe we're well positioned given our presence worldwide and our unique offerings to benefit. 
Examples of our exposure include through network initiatives, traditional issuers, private label or charge card and program management, virtual card issuance, nontraditional issuers, including fintech, start-ups and neobanks unique, collaborations with AWS and Google, large existing scale players looking to expand BNPL globally into new markets and with added functionality and of course, the acceptance from our unmatched virtual and physical footprint with BNPL is just one of the many services at the point of sale in our commerce enablement ecosystem. At the end of the day, the enemy is cash and check, and further digitization, including BNPL, is the mode of competition. 
Our ability throughout the pandemic to sustainably expand our rates of growth relative to our markets, has been indicative of our technology leadership. This quarter was no exception with our global merchant acquiring businesses delivering 900 basis points of outperformance relative to the credit trends reported by the card networks last week. Our consistent track record of share gains during the pandemic is something we highlighted at our investor conference. 
I'm also delighted to report that we have successfully closed our acquisition of MineralTree in October after having announced our formal entry into the BB market in September. 
As we highlighted then, we have many of the elements of the B2B offering post our merger with TSYS in 2019. And the addition of Mineral Tree's digitized payable solutions serves to enhance our B2B product suite and expands our opportunity set in one of the largest and most underpenetrated markets in software and payments. We intend to further scale our business rapidly. 
In addition to Mineral tree and the extension of our commercial partnership with CITI, we had several other notable B2B achievements in the third quarter. These included new relationship with WeatherTech in our Heartland business for B2B as well as B2C acceptance, near 50% payroll solutions growth in the third quarter compared to 2019 and a tenfold increase in the number of customer locations using our tip solution from our Business and Consumer segment for disbursement since the beginning of the pandemic. 
We continue to have tremendous firepower to conduct strategic transactions with billions of available capacity. Of course, this is on top of the $2.5 billion we have already invested over the last year during a pandemic, in acquisitions consistent with our strategic focus, including our emphasis on faster growth geographies. In addition to the nearly $2 billion we've returned to shareholders over the last year. 
To that end, we are pleased to have now closed our acquisition of Bankia's merchant acquiring business together with our partners at Caixa Bank last month, deepening our presence in one of the most attractive markets in Europe. 
And through our Erste joint venture, we also very recently closed our acquisition of Worldline's Pay1 Austrian POS acquiring assets, enabling us to bring our distinctive distribution and market-leading technologies at scale to get another attractive market. And our pipeline remains full despite the investments we've already made over the last 12 months, the majority of which has been in software assets and furtherance of our long-standing technology enablement thesis.

Specifically, we delivered record quarterly adjusted revenue of just over",1296,"Thanks, Jeff. Our financial performance in the third quarter of 2021 exceeded our expectations despite incremental headwinds from COVID-19 and the Delta variant during the period. 
Specifically, we delivered record quarterly adjusted revenue of just over $2 billion, representing 15% growth compared to the prior year and 10% growth compared to 2019. 
Adjusted operating margin for the third quarter was a record 42.8%, a 170 basis point improvement from the prior year and a 420 basis point improvement relative to 2019. The net result was record quarterly adjusted earnings per share of $2.18 for both the prior year and 2019. 
Taking a closer look at our performance by segment. Merchant Solutions achieved adjusted net revenue of $1.36 billion for the third quarter, a 21% improvement from the prior year and a 13% improvement compared to 2019. We are also pleased that our acquiring businesses globally generated 22% and 19% in adjusted net revenue growth compared to the third quarter of 2020 and 2019, respectively. This was led by continued strength in the U.S. while we also benefited from improving trends in international markets, including Spain, Central Europe and Greater China. Focusing on our technology-enabled portfolio, we continue to see consistent growth in our Global Payments Integrated business, as we deliver a vertically fluent suite of commerce enablement solutions across dozens of vertical markets. 
As we highlighted at the investor conference, a number of our businesses, including our integrated business have grown right through COVID-19 and are now at levels that we would have otherwise expected them to achieve absent the downturn. Our worldwide e-commerce and omnichannel solutions delivered growth in excess of 20% year-on-year once again this quarter as we continue to benefit from our unique ability to seamlessly blend the physical and virtual worlds and create frictionless experiences for our customers on a global basis. 
As for our own software businesses in the U.S., we are pleased that the overall portfolio delivered strong sequential improvement as the recovery begins to take root in some of the more impacted vertical markets. Given the positive booking trends we have seen throughout the pandemic, including this quarter, we are confident that the business is most impacted by COVID-19 in this portfolio remain on a path to recovery. We delivered an adjusted operating margin of 49.3% in the Merchant Solutions segment, an increase of 200 basis points from the same period in 2020 and as we continue to bid from the underlying strength of our business mix and the realization of cost synergies related to the merger. 
Moving to Issuer Solutions. We are pleased to have delivered $458 million in adjusted net revenue, a 6% improvement from the third quarter of 2020. This performance was driven by the continued recovery in transaction volumes as well as growth in accounts on file, while nonvolume-based revenue increased mid-single digits during the period including low double-digit growth in our Output Services business again this quarter. Issuer adjusted operating margins of 43.4% were up slightly from the prior year. 
As you may recall, Issuer Solutions achieved margin expansion of 500 basis points in the third quarter of 2020 over 2019, fueled by our focus on driving efficiencies in the business. 
We are also pleased that our issuer team signed 5 long-term contract extensions during the quarter and our strong pipeline, including the growing list of opportunities we have in collaboration with AWS continues to bode well for our future performance. 
Finally, our Business and Consumer Solutions segment delivered adjusted net revenue of $208 million, representing growth of 2% on a reported basis for the third quarter. Adjusting for the stimulus benefits and higher unemployment volumes last year, our adjusted net revenue growth was in line with our targeted growth range for the quarter. 
Adjusted operating margin for Business and Consumer Solutions was consistent with the prior year at 25.6% after expanding more than 700 basis points during the third quarter of 2020 as a direct result of our efforts to streamline costs and drive greater operational efficiencies at net spend. 
Further, we are pleased with the early progress we are making on our strategic partnership we announced last quarter with AWS in this business. While we also launched and began selling our earned wage access solution to existing B2B clients and into new vertical markets during the period. 
The outstanding performance we delivered across our businesses this quarter serves as a further proof point that we continue to gain share and that our 4-pillar strategy positions us well to capitalize on the accelerating digital trends coming out of the pandemic. From a cash flow standpoint, we generated roughly $850 million during the third quarter and remain on track with our target to convert roughly 100% of adjusted earnings to adjusted free cash flow. 
We invested approximately $132 million in capital expenditures during the quarter, in line with our expectations. 
We've now successfully closed our acquisitions of MineralTree, Bankia's merchant services business and Worldline's PAYONE assets consistent with our expectations. We expect the contribution from these acquisitions to adjusted net revenue to be immaterial in the fourth quarter. We are pleased to have also returned cash to our shareholders this quarter through the repurchase of approximately $4.2 million of our shares for approximately $741 million. We ended the period with roughly $2.5 billion of liquidity after repurchase activity and funding of the Bankia acquisition. Our leverage position roughly 2.6x on a net debt basis, consistent with the prior quarter. 
We remain encouraged by the trends we are seeing in the business, and we are raising the lower end of our guidance for adjusted revenue to now be in a range of $7.71 billion to $7.73 billion, reflecting growth of 14% to 15% over 2020. We are adding $10 million to the bottom of the range despite anticipating an incremental headwind from foreign exchange rates since our last report and absorbing the impact of the Delta bearing of COVID-19. 
We also continue to expect adjusted operating margin expansion of up to 250 basis points compared to 2020 levels, excluding the impact of our already announced and closed acquisitions. 
As previously discussed, we expect those transactions to result in a headwind to our margin performance, and we now expect adjusted operating margin expansion of around 200 basis points for the year. 
At the segment level, we continue to expect Merchant Solutions adjusted net revenue growth to be around 20% for 2021. We also continue to expect our issuer business to deliver growth in the low to mid-single-digit range and for our business and consumer segment to be in the mid- to high single-digit range for the full year. 
Moving to nonoperating items. We still expect net interest expense to be slightly lower in 2021 relative to 2020. While we anticipate our adjusted tax rate will be relatively consistent with last year. 
Putting it all together, we now expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year to be in a range of $8.10 to $8.20, reflecting growth of 27% to 28% over 2020, which is up from $8.07 to $8.20 previously. Our outlook assumes the macro environment remains stable worldwide over the balance of the year and now includes an incremental headwind from currency. 
Finally, we are pleased that our unique strategies that capitalize on the acceleration of digitizing in payments, our ongoing technology-enabled mix shift, our exposure to expanding cans, including now B2B and our track record of disruptive M&A provided us with the confidence to raise our cycle guidance at our September 8 investor conference. In particular, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share growth in the 17% to 20% range over the next 3 to 5 years on a compounded basis. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff."

Our formal entry into the B2B market reinforces the existing leg of our stool, including software primacy, a leading e-commerce franchise and an unmatched presence in many of the most attractive markets worldwide. These strategies are complementary and interrelated and provide us with substantial and incremental growth opportunities for years to come. The record results for the third quarter that we reported today and our rate cycle guidance in September are expressions of our confidence in our strategies and are the most recent examples and best evidence of their success. We just delivered a record quarter on any number of bases in the best year in our history during the midst of a once-in-a-century pandemic. I think you can see why we view the glass as full.

And second, on the distribution side. As it relates to the existing customers, there really has not been any change in the competitive landscape. I would say we continue to believe that we win kind of 80% of the jump balls that come up. I think we announced today that we've got 10 folks in the hopper on the issuing side, 6 of which are competitive takeaways as before the LOIs that we've recently signed. So we really don't view that as changing. I'd also say that -- before it's the second part of your question, I'd also say that our partnership in collaboration with AWS really does sell in the marketplace. So in the last quarter, we've met with a number of our large financial institution customers. And I think the public cloud first centric approach that we've taken with AWS starting a year a quarter ago, really sells and resonates. I would say, as we said, the time, Tien-Tsin dramatically expands our target addressable market, I think we last August. But certainly, with large FIs and across the spectrum really does resonate. We think we're ahead there based on feedback from our customer base. 
On the second part of what you said, I would say the vast majority of those prospects, and there was a page on this engine in our investor conference. The vast majority of those prospects are in neobanks, fintechs and start-ups. So we certainly have a number of prospects on the traditional FI side, particularly in light of the Amazon relationship. I would say the vast majority of what we're looking at there on the co-sale side. with AWS and now also with 10 and PwC really center around neobanks, fintechs and start-ups, and that $25 million number represents the vast majority.

First, a little bit in the U.S. I think we saw a very good trend in the U.S., not withstanding COVID, but we certainly did see in certain verticals, some impacted from the Delta variant in the third quarter. I would say more specifically, we saw that in Europe and Asia Pacific and probably more predominantly in Asia Pacific. Markets like the U.K., obviously, we're struggling with the Delta variant. They've now started to kind of come back a little bit more. In Asia Pacific, Australia had a number of shutdowns during the quarter that we had to grapple with from a financial standpoint, from a revenue standpoint. But I would say, overall, most of that was absorbed in the third quarter. And as we've gotten to October, we're seeing October trends slightly better than what we saw in the third quarter and even coming out of September, which was a better month than we saw in August.

So I think balance between the 2 is essentially what we've been doing and I would expect that to continue. On the M&A side, look, I think we look at most things that fit our strategic thesis that's been consistent over the last year. So we look at things that are in the software space. We obviously now look at things that are in the B2B space post the MineralTree announcement. As we said time last month, we're actually in September, MineralTree, it was probably 1 of our first dilutive deals, and we're absorbing that, both in our annual numbers as well as in our cycle guide. That certainly has expanded [indiscernible] as to what we're looking at, looking at new geographies, e-com and the like. So I don't think that's changed, Ramsey. I think we've got the full suite of opportunities. And I said in my prepared remarks, our pipeline now was saying the fact that we announced the closure of a bunch of deals today. Our pipeline continues to remain full."

So we're really pleased with the PayPal announcement today. This expansion as well as extension is for a multiyear term. So we're really pleased with that. I would say there's a few differences before I get to the crypto comment. The first thing I'd say is we're adding additional geographies as part of the relationship. The second, we're adding additional vertical markets, where we can go together jointly to market with PayPal, which also is an expansion. And the third obviously is what you asked about around crypto. Now crypto is really 2 pieces, Ramsey. The first piece is if you're using a PayPal digital wallet and you're buying crypto in the wall at Bank card sources, particularly anywhere in the world, but especially for these luster purposes, North America and Europe, that will be us helping to facilitate those purchases on behalf of PayPal. And the second part of the crypto stuff is PayPal needs an acceptance at things like clean base to the extent that you're going online, buying crypto at something like a coin base and use PayPal as a pay button to procure that purchase to the extent that it's bank card related that also is something that we expect to have a hand in. So those are new things for us. Those things are hard to do on the acceptance side, especially on a worldwide basis. So we're pleased to be in a position to do that. And I would say, if you back up early and say, okay, what does it mean? Our view of our relationship with PayPal is that this expansion and extension really doubles the size of our addressable market with PayPal who we're obviously very pleased to be part of.

I'll jump in and I'll ask Jeff and Paul to add any color that they would like to. Maybe I'll just start with sort of baseline in things. As I mentioned earlier, the overall vertical market business grew up roughly 16%, 17% versus Q3 of 2020. It's still down slightly versus 2019 levels, call it, mid-single digits. As I mentioned earlier, we do expect it to turn positive versus 2019 as we get to the fourth quarter. So I'll start with maybe some of the more positive vertical trends that we've seen. AdvancedMD, TouchNet. And again, our QSR business all reported very strong growth as they consistently have throughout the pandemic in the third quarter. Touch net AdvancedMD, both up mid-teens in the quarter. Our QSR business was up probably mid-30s versus 2020 levels. Again, we've seen a nice rebound in that business. And then relative to 2019, TouchNet's up 20-plus percent; AdvancedMD, up almost 30% in our QSR business is up almost 10%, call it, 8% to 10%, somewhere in that ballpark versus 2019 levels. So I'm pleased with where those, obviously, vertical markets are trending, how they performed throughout the pandemic. We continue to have excellent momentum in those as we head to 2022. 
Now obviously, we have seen more impact as we talked about earlier in our K-12 school business in active and in our Gaming business over the course of the pandemic. School and active continue to be below 2019 levels. We are seeing improvement sequentially, but the road to recovery for those businesses is obviously going to be a little more long tailed than what we're seeing in other vertical markets. Gaming in this quarter was flat versus 2019. So it has come back quite well. It was up meaningfully over 2020 levels on was 30% in the quarter, and it got flat versus 2019. And again, we expect that to turn positive in the fourth quarter. So I would say, overall, the business is in the right direction. The verticals that have been more heavily impacted are going to have a little longer road to recovery. The sequential trends are good, and we expect to see that continuing heading into 2022. So I'll pause there and maybe just turn my attention to bookings trends because that continues to be a very good story for the vertical market businesses. We saw excellent new booking trends in the quarter. Our recurring revenues in that business. Bookings were up 35% year-over-year. AdvancedMD recorded a booking record of nearly 50% year-over-year. Our Xenial SaaS solutions were up almost 50% year-over-year and TouchNet was up almost 35% year-over-year. And active and schools continue to see good booking trends despite obviously the overall macro continuing to weigh on those businesses. Active bookings were up in the mid-teens year-over-year. And our school business had positive booking trends in the quarter as well. So as we think about the business overall, the bookings trends we've seen in this quarter, and frankly, what we've seen throughout the course of 2021 give us a lot of confidence that from a momentum perspective, we're obviously building a nice backlog of business. And as the macro in the more heavily impacted verticals improves, we obviously have a lot of tailwinds for the vertical market channel heading into 2022 and 2023."

So I guess I would start off by kind of adding on what Cameron said is that starting in the fourth quarter, this turns into a growth tailwind for us. And we've talked for several quarters now of this vertical market there because of the components of the business being somewhere about 300 to 400 basis points headwind to our segment margin over the last several quarters. And starting in the fourth quarter with the kind of sequential quarter growth we're seeing, this turns into a tailwind. And I think, as Cameron said, with all the bookings success that kind of we've had we're expecting that essentially 300 to 400 basis point headwind to kind of turn into kind of a commensurate kind of tailwind as we move into 2022. Obviously, we're in that planning process right now, and we'll kind of get more kind of discrete levels of insight as we talk about the 2022 guide. But the key point is exactly what kind of Cameron said is kind of headwind turning into a tailwind as we move to next year. 
And just in general, as we look to the 2022 guide, you kind of once again, kind of go back to what we said at our Investor Day around our cycle guidance as it relates to revenue growth, those are the levels that we're targeting at or even slightly better at the levels that we're targeting at for next year as a revenue growth matter."

So yes, both as a third quarter matter, the growth that we saw there, obviously, we're still looking to kind of get back to where the pre-COVID levels would be in that business, and we're trending in that direction.

From a kind of issuer perspective, typically, the fourth quarter with holiday spend and the way that business is constructed, that typically is a strong report. I would say that in general, that has become lesser of a seasonal outlier in the fourth quarter, just the way that business is and where we have certain pricing bundled and now that that's lesser of an impact there. And then obviously, in our business and consumer there's obviously kind of different kind of moving parts now with all the stimulus kind of comparisons, specifically tax season and the first quarter and depending on how that kind of plays out into the second quarter has been kind of the seasonal call out as it relates to that business. So at a consolidated level, I wouldn't call out anything unique that's changed on the seasonality side, but those are the kind of ways to think about it at the segment level."

If you think about our strategy, it's really centered around commerce enablement. And whether we're working with a software partner or we're working, obviously, with our own technology stack from a software standpoint where we go to market and verticals with our own capabilities. The objective is to continue to bring more merchants into our ecosystem, leveraging technology. And once you're in our ecosystem, obviously, finding new ways to provide solutions to them to help them run their businesses more effectively and obviously help them drive more top of funnel opportunities for their business. 
So our partnership with Google is clearly at the center of that strategy in terms of how we deliver more value-added services and more capabilities to our customers across, again, both our owned software portfolio. Our traditional merchant acquiring businesses and then, of course, our own -- our partnered software portfolio as well. So obviously, there's a lot of opportunities in front of us as we continue to execute against that strategy. We are launching run and grow my business this quarter. We expect that to ramp next year, and we're launching Phase 2 of that, as Jeff highlighted, hopefully, in the middle part of next year as we bring online ordering inventory and reservations into that ecosystem. From a -- you raised Simon attendance, it's a great example of where we can take a solution from one market into another. We're selling time and attendance now across a few of our vertical market businesses that came out of our payroll solutions. And looking to bring that to a number of our integrated partners as well as the way to which we can, again, attach more opportunities to those partnership relationships. 
On the integrated front, I'd also note that, that strategy is also key to winning new ISV partners because one 1 of the ways we're able to differentiate ourselves versus just offering how and its revenue share offer a larger pie from a revenue standpoint that we ultimately end up splitting with those ISVs because we can bring more solutions to the table. It makes the ISVs offering more attractive. It gives us more opportunity to grow and scale with the ISV. And as I always like to say, we'd rather be focused on how to divide up a larger pie versus more finally slicing an existing pie that's not growing. 
So I think as it relates to the overall merchant strategy highlighted what's really key, which is driving more commerce enablement by attaching more of our offerings to merchant relations that come through whatever distribution channel we're selling through into the market."

So that's part of the value-added services that you asked about that Cameron tied to. And I think all that stuff is working. And I think if you look at our results in the third quarter, mid-camas up 13% in the third quarter volumes or up 20% versus 2019. So it's the commerce enablement that Cameron is describing in response to your question, which is to say the virtuous circle of software at the top of the funnel, the cross-sells, the data analytics, the new partnerships, all that stuff is resulting in clearly above-market growth on the stats I just gave and what we put in the press release.

We delivered record third quarter results despite the incremental challenges that emerged during the period from COVID-19, highlighting the resiliency of our business model and our ongoing track record of execution across market cycles.",1579,"Thanks, Winnie. We delivered record third quarter results despite the incremental challenges that emerged during the period from COVID-19, highlighting the resiliency of our business model and our ongoing track record of execution across market cycles.  
We also surpassed $2 billion of quarterly adjusted net revenue for the first time in our history, with record margins and produced all-time high quarterly adjusted earnings per share and adjusted free cash flow.  
As we detailed at our investor conference, just a short time ago on September 8, the trend toward accelerated digitization coming out of the pandemic has benefited our business by reinforcing that mode of competition. And this quarter provided further proof points of the wisdom of our approach to drive differentiated growth across the 4 pillars of our strategy.  
First, we extended long-standing relationships with both CITI and CIBC as a reflection of our prowess as a top quartile Software-as-a-Service or SaaS technology company with unmatched worldwide payments expertise. Our durable partnerships with some of the most sophisticated and complex institutions globally speak to our competitiveness well into the remainder of this decade.  
Starting with CITI, we are delighted to have furthered our relationship with one of our largest commercial card customers for another 8 years. This agreement highlights a key element of what is already today a successful B2B business at scale. More on this new pillar to our strategy in a moment.
We're also pleased to have renewed our additional relationship with CIBC, a top 10 customer in North America, that spans both its consumer credit and debit portfolios for an extended term.  
As we discussed in September, we also continue to build our pipelines with AWS to include additional fintech neobanks and embedded finance players spanning multiple geographies. We now have 25 active prospects in our issuer pipeline with AWS, up from 20 last quarter and 4 at the end of 2020. We also currently have 10 letters of intent with institutions worldwide, 6 of which are competitive takeaways. 2 of our recent  [ LOIs ] have gone to contract. 
We're also excited to announce that together with AWS, we signed an agreement with London-based 10x to integrate its cloud native core banking platform with TSYS' payments as service capabilities, allowing us to collaborate on modern core banking in issuing solutions for Neobank and traditional financial institution customers.
As we announced at our investor conference, we now have a terrific partner in Virgin Money for our first use case, combining issuing and acquiring capabilities to offer transaction stream optimization solutions. It's worth noting that Virgin Money is also a significant competitive takeaway for us. 
Simply put, we're winning in our Issuer Solutions business because we are selling more market-leading technologies and more distinctive and defensible distribution channels in more markets than we ever have previously. 
In our vertical markets businesses where we lead with SaaS at the top of the funnel, we were delighted to announce our new partnership with Mercedes-Benz Stadium in September. As we highlighted, we believe that we were successful because of our ability to seamlessly and uniquely combine software, hardware and payments across in person mobile and online channels. We expect to facilitate a best-in-class fan experience through market-leading commerce enablement solutions. 
We're now in a pilot with Mercedes-Benz Stadium and we expect to be fully live early in 2022. We're gratified that after canvasing the payments landscape in an extensive RFP, including with a full spectrum of new market entrants. This sophisticated institution terminated their existing relationships and chose us for our software and payment technologies with a commitment well into the back half of this decade. 
Further, across our merchant technology-enabled businesses, our POS software solutions generated revenue growth of nearly 70% compared to 2019 in the third quarter. And our Central education business in Australia grew over 50% versus 2019 despite lockdowns in that market. In addition to the key win at Mercedes-Benz stadium, our [indiscernible] business delivered record bookings in the third quarter and also had notable successes with Subway, Whataburger, Bojangles, RBI and Wendy's, spanning software hardware payments and data and analytics. These results highlight the benefits we're seeing from the accelerated digitization in our markets. 
Our e-commerce and omnichannel businesses drove growth in excess of 20% again this quarter. This business is another example of pandemic-induced accelerated digitization benefiting us with current growth rates 1/3 faster than pre-COVID levels. 
A few examples of notable success here this quarter. We broadened our relationship with Uber and Uber Eats into an additional market in Asia Pacific beyond Taiwan. We expanded our long-standing relationship with the Swatch Group to now include e-commerce alongside the solutions we provide in store today across North America and Asia Pacific. And we went in line with Google as a merchant in multiple markets in Asia Pacific exactly as we said we would. We remain on track to launch Google run and grow my business this quarter, and we're already working on the launch of the next phase to help our merchants grow faster by connecting additional Google services including online ordering, retail inventory and reservations to our digital platform.  
These solutions will, over time, drive more consumers to our merchants and dramatically expand our value proposition with one of the leading technology players worldwide.  
We're also very pleased to announce today that we have extended and expanded the scope of our relationship with PayPal, one of the most sophisticated payments companies globally. This multiyear partnership leverages our unparalleled e-commerce technology footprint across cross-border North America, Europe and Asia Pacific, and it will dramatically expand our target addressable markets over its term.  
We've added new geographies, additional verticals and support crypto currencies for the first time. Together with CITI, Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Virgin Money and CIBC what better testament to our current and future competitiveness.  
As we said in September, we continue to benefit from ongoing innovation in our ecosystem, including buy now and pay later or BNPL technologies. We expect to enable more than 1.5 billion BNPL transactions this year alone, and we anticipate issuing more than 50 million virtual cards with more than $23 billion in volume. It's a market we know well because it's a market that we've been serving for decades globally.  
As BNPL continues to grow, we believe we're well positioned given our presence worldwide and our unique offerings to benefit.  
Examples of our exposure include through network initiatives, traditional issuers, private label or charge card and program management, virtual card issuance, nontraditional issuers, including fintech, start-ups and neobanks unique, unique collaborations with AWS and Google, large existing scale players looking to expand BNPL globally into new markets and with added functionality and of course, the acceptance from our unmatched virtual and physical footprint with BNPL as just one of the many services at the point of sale in our commerce enablement ecosystem. 
At the end of the day, the enemy is cash and check, and further digitization, including BNPL, is the mode of competition.  
Our ability throughout the pandemic to sustainably expand our rates of growth relative to our markets, has been indicative of our technology leadership. This quarter was no exception with our global merchant acquiring businesses delivering 900 basis points of outperformance relative to the credit trends reported by the card networks last week. Our consistent track record of share gains during the pandemic is something we highlighted at our investor conference.  
I'm also delighted to report that we have successfully closed our acquisition of MineralTree in October after having announced our formal entry into the BB market in September.  
As we highlighted then, we have many of the elements of the B2B offering post our merger with TSYS in 2019. And the addition of Mineral Tree's digitized payable solutions serves to enhance our B2B product suite and expands our opportunity set in one of the largest and most underpenetrated markets in software and payments. We intend to further scale our business rapidly.  
In addition to MineralTree and the extension of our commercial partnership with CITI, we had several other notable B2B achievements in the third quarter. These included new relationship with WeatherTech in our Heartland business for B2B as well as B2C acceptance, near 50% payroll solutions growth in the third quarter compared to 2019 and a tenfold increase in the number of customer locations using our tip solution from our Business and Consumer segment for disbursement since the beginning of the pandemic.  
We continue to have tremendous firepower to conduct strategic transactions with billions of available capacity. Of course, this is on top of the $2.5 billion we have already invested over the last year during a pandemic, in acquisitions consistent with our strategic focus, including our emphasis on faster growth geographies. In addition to the nearly $2 billion we've returned to shareholders over the last year.  
To that end, we are pleased to have now closed our acquisition of Bankia's merchant acquiring business together with our partners at CaixaBank last month, deepening our presence in one of the most attractive markets in Europe.  
And through our Erste joint venture, we also very recently closed our acquisition of Worldline's PAYONE Austrian POS acquiring assets, enabling us to bring our distinctive distribution and market-leading technologies at scale to get another attractive market. And our pipeline remains full despite the investments we've already made over the last 12 months. The majority of which has been in software assets in furtherance of our long-standing technology enablement thesis. Paul?"

Our financial performance in the third quarter of 2021 exceeded our expectations despite incremental headwinds from COVID-19 and the Delta variant during the period.  
Specifically, we delivered record quarterly adjusted revenue of just over $2 billion, representing 15% growth compared to the prior year and 10% growth compared to 2019.  
Adjusted operating margin for the third quarter was a record 42.8%, a 170 basis point improvement from the prior year and a 420 basis point improvement relative to 2019. The net result was record quarterly adjusted earnings per share of $2.18, an increase of 28% compared to the same period for both the prior year and 2019.  
Taking a closer look at our performance by segment. Merchant Solutions achieved adjusted net revenue of $1.36 billion for the third quarter, a 21% improvement from the prior year and a 13% improvement compared to 2019. We are also pleased that our acquiring businesses globally generated 22% and 19% adjusted net revenue growth compared to the third quarter of 2020 and 2019, respectively. This was led by continued strength in the U.S. while we also benefited from improving trends in international markets, including Spain, Central Europe and Greater China. Focusing on our technology-enabled portfolio, we continued to see consistent growth in our Global Payments Integrated business, as we deliver a vertically fluent suite of commerce enablement solutions across dozens of vertical markets.  
As we highlighted at the investor conference, a number of our businesses, including our integrated business have grown right through COVID-19 and are now at levels that we would have otherwise expected them to achieve absent the downturn. Our worldwide e-commerce and omnichannel solutions delivered growth in excess of 20% year-on-year once again this quarter as we continue to benefit from our unique ability to seamlessly blend the physical and virtual worlds and create frictionless experiences for our customers on a global basis.  
As for our own software businesses in the U.S., we are pleased that the overall portfolio delivered strong sequential improvement as the recovery begins to take root in some of the more impacted vertical markets. Given the positive booking trends we have seen throughout the pandemic, including this quarter, we are confident that the business is most impacted by COVID-19 in this portfolio remain on a path to recovery. We delivered an adjusted operating margin of 49.3% in the Merchant Solutions segment, an increase of 200 basis points from the same period in 2020 as we continue to benefit from the underlying strength of our business mix and the realization of cost synergies related to the merger.  
Moving to Issuer Solutions. We are pleased to have delivered $458 million in adjusted net revenue, a 6% improvement from the third quarter of 2020. This performance was driven by the continued recovery in transaction volumes as well as growth in accounts on file, while nonvolume-based revenue increased mid-single digits during the period including low double-digit growth in our Output Services business again this quarter. Issuer adjusted operating margins of 43.4%, were up slightly from the prior year.  
As you may recall, Issuer Solutions achieved margin expansion of 500 basis points in the third quarter of 2020 over 2019, fueled by our focus on driving efficiencies in the business.  
We are also pleased that our issuer team signed 5 long-term contract extensions during the quarter and our strong pipeline, including the growing list of opportunities we have in collaboration with AWS continues to bode well for our future performance.  
Finally,  our Business and Consumer Solutions segment delivered adjusted net revenue of $208 million, representing growth of 2% on a reported basis for the third quarter. Adjusting for the stimulus benefits and higher unemployment volumes last year, our adjusted net revenue growth was in line with our targeted growth range for the quarter.  
Adjusted operating margin for Business and Consumer Solutions was consistent with the prior year at 25.6% after expanding more than 700 basis points during the third quarter of 2020 as a direct result of our efforts to streamline costs and drive greater operational efficiencies at net spend.  
Further, we are pleased with the early progress we are making on our strategic partnership we announced last quarter with AWS in this business. While we also launched and began selling our earned wage access solution to existing B2B clients and into new vertical markets during the period.  
The outstanding performance we delivered across our businesses this quarter serves as a further proof point that we continue to gain share and that our 4-pillar strategy positions us well to capitalize on the accelerating digital trends coming out of the pandemic. From a cash flow standpoint, we generated roughly $850 million during the third quarter and remain on track with our target to convert roughly 100% of adjusted earnings to adjusted free cash flow.  
We invested approximately $132 million in capital expenditures during the quarter, in line with our expectations.  
We've now successfully closed our acquisitions of MineralTree, Bankia's merchant services business and Worldline's PAYONE Austrian assets consistent with our expectations. We expect the contribution from these acquisitions to adjusted net revenue to be immaterial in the fourth quarter. We are pleased to have also returned cash to our shareholders this quarter through the repurchase of approximately 4.2 million of our shares for approximately $741 million. We ended the period with roughly $2.5 billion of liquidity after repurchase activity and funding of the Bankia acquisition. Our leverage position was roughly 2.6x on a net debt basis, consistent with the prior quarter.  
We remain encouraged by the trends we are seeing in the business, and we are raising the lower end of our guidance for adjusted revenue to now be in a range of $7.71 billion to $7.73 billion, reflecting growth of 14% to 15% over 2020. We are adding $10 million to the bottom of the range despite anticipating an incremental headwind from foreign exchange rates since our last report and absorbing the impact of the Delta variant of COVID-19.  
We also continue to expect adjusted operating margin expansion of up to 250 basis points compared to 2020 levels, excluding the impact of our already announced and closed acquisitions.  
As previously discussed, we expect those transactions to result in a headwind to our margin performance, and we now expect adjusted operating margin expansion of around 200 basis points for the year.  
At the segment level, we continue to expect Merchant Solutions adjusted net revenue growth to be around 20% for 2021. We also continue to expect our issuer business to deliver growth in the low to mid-single-digit range and for our business and consumer segment to be in the mid- to high single-digit range for the full year.  
Moving to nonoperating items. We still expect net interest expense to be slightly lower in 2021 relative to 2020. While we anticipate our adjusted tax rate will be relatively consistent with last year.  
Putting it all together, we now expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year to be in a range of $8.10 to $8.20, reflecting growth of 27% to 28% over 2020, which is up from $8.07 to $8.20 previously. Our outlook assumes the macro environment remains stable worldwide over the balance of the year and now includes an incremental headwind from currency.  
Finally, we are pleased that our unique strategies that capitalize on the acceleration of digitizing in payments, our ongoing technology-enabled mix shift, our exposure to expanding cans, including now B2B and our track record of disruptive M&A provided us with the confidence to raise our cycle guidance at our September 8 investor conference. In particular, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share growth in the 17% to 20% range over the next 3 to 5 years on a compounded basis.  
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff."

Our strategy has been centered on digitization since we started running the company a little over 8 years ago. By accelerating the underlying trends to our technology enablement, the pandemic has reaffirmed the wisdom of our approach, and we now target 3/4 of our business from these channels over the next cycle as we said in September. Our formal entry into the B2B market reinforces the existing legs of our stool, including software primacy, a leading e-commerce franchise and an unmatched presence in many of the most attractive markets worldwide. 
These strategies are complementary and interrelated and provide us with substantial and incremental growth opportunities for years to come. The record results for the third quarter that we reported today and our rate cycle guidance in September are expressions of our confidence in our strategies and are the most recent examples and best evidence of their success. We just delivered a record quarter on any number of bases in the best year in our history during the midst of a once-in-a-century pandemic. I think you can see why we view the glass as full. We exit the pandemic better off than we entered it. Judge for yourself. Winnie?"

So we're really pleased with the performance this year in the issuing business in particular, and we continue to make very good progress in AWS on 2 fronts. First, on the technology side.

I would say we continue to believe that we win kind of 80% of the jump balls that come up. I think we announced today that we've got 10 folks in the hopper on the issuing side, 6 of which are competitive takeaways as before the LOIs that we've recently signed. So we really don't view that as changing. 
I'd also say that -- before it's the second part of your question, I'd also say that our partnership in collaboration with AWS really does sell in the marketplace. So in the last quarter, we've met with a number of our large financial institution customers. And I think the public cloud first centric approach that we've taken with AWS starting a year a quarter ago, really sells and resonates. I would say, as we said, the time, Tien-Tsin, dramatically expands our target addressable market, I think we service 3x last August. But certainly, with large FIs and across the spectrum really does resonate, we think we're ahead there based on feedback from our customer base. 
On the second part of what you said, I would say the vast majority of those prospects, and there was a page on this engine in our investor conference. The vast majority with those prospects are neobanks, fintechs and start-ups. So we certainly have a number of prospects on the traditional FI side, particularly in light of the Amazon relationship. I would say the vast majority of what we're looking at there on the co-sale side, with AWS and now also with 10x and PwC really center around neobanks, fintechs and start-ups, and that 25 number represents the vast majority.

First, a little bit in the U.S. I think we saw a very good trend in the U.S., notwithstanding COVID, but we certainly did see in certain verticals, some impacted from the Delta variant in the third quarter. I would say more specifically, we saw that in Europe and Asia Pacific and probably more predominantly in Asia Pacific. 
Markets like the U.K., obviously, we're struggling with the Delta variant. They've now started to kind of come back a little bit more. In Asia Pacific, Australia had a number of shutdowns during the quarter that we had to grapple with from a financial standpoint, from a revenue standpoint. But I would say, overall, most of that was absorbed in the third quarter. And as we've gotten to October, we're seeing October trends slightly better than what we saw in the third quarter and even coming out of September, which was a better month than we saw in August. So the trends continue to look favorable, October being slightly better than what we saw in the third quarter.

So on capital allocation, I think you should look at what we've done in the last 12 months as being a really good indicator of kind of where we're focused. So in the last 12 months, as we said in our prepared remarks, we've invested $2.5 billion in M&A, primarily I think 60% of which is around cloud SaaS-based technologies. But we did that while returning nearly $2 billion in capital to our shareholders also during the last 12 months. So I'd say from a capital allocation point of view imply think describe the math on the repurchases, I don't really think that's -- I don't really think that's changed. 
So I think balance between the 2 is essentially what we've been doing and I would expect that to continue. On the M&A side, look, I think we look at most things that fit our strategic thesis that's been consistent over the last year. So we look at things that are in the software space. We obviously now look at things that are in the B2B space post the MineralTree announcement. As we said time last month, we're actually in September, MineralTree, it was probably one of our first dilutive deals, and we're absorbing that, both in our annual numbers as well as in our cycle guide. That certainly has expanded at 10 as to what we're looking at, looking at new geographies, e-com and the like. So I don't think that's changed, Ramsey.

This expansion as well as extension is for a multiyear term. So we're really pleased with that. I would say there's a few differences before I get to the crypto comment. The first thing I'd say is we're adding additional geographies as part of the relationship. The second, we're adding additional vertical markets, where we can go together jointly to market with PayPal, which also is an expansion. And the third obviously is what you asked about around crypto. Now crypto is really 2 pieces, Ramsey. The first piece is if you're using a PayPal digital wallet and you're buying crypto in the wall at Bank card sources, particularly anywhere in the world, but especially for these luster purposes, North America and Europe, that will be us helping to facilitate those purchases on behalf of PayPal. 
And the second part of the crypto stuff is PayPal as a means of acceptance, things like Coinbase to the extent that you're going online, buying crypto at something like a Coinbase and use PayPal as a pay button to procure that purchase to the extent that it's bank card related that also is something that we expect to have a hand in. 
So those are new things for us. Those things are hard to do on the acceptance side, especially on a worldwide basis. So we're pleased to be in a position to do that. And I would say, if you back up early and say, okay, what does it mean? Our view of our relationship with PayPal is that this expansion and extension really doubles the size of our addressable market with PayPal who we're obviously very pleased to be part of.

As I mentioned earlier, the overall vertical market business, it was up roughly 16%, 17% versus Q3 of 2020. It's still down slightly versus 2019 levels, call it, mid-single digits. 
As I mentioned earlier, we do expect it to turn positive versus 2019 as we get to the fourth quarter. So I'll start with maybe some of the more positive vertical trends that we've seen. AdvancedMD, TouchNet, and again, our QSR business, all reported very strong growth as they consistently have throughout the pandemic in the third quarter. TouchNet, AdvancedMD, both up mid-teens in the quarter. Our QSR business was up probably mid-30s versus 2020 levels. Again, we've seen a nice rebound in that business. And then relative to 2019, TouchNet's up 20-plus percent; AdvancedMD was up almost 30% and our QSR business is up almost 10%, call it, 8% to 10%, somewhere in that ballpark versus 2019 levels. So I'm pleased with where those, obviously, vertical markets are trending, how they performed throughout the pandemic. We continue to have excellent momentum in those as we head to 2022. 
Now obviously, we have seen more impact as we talked about earlier in our K-12 school business in active and in our gaming business over the course of the pandemic. School and active continue to be below 2019 levels. We are seeing improvement sequentially, but the road to recovery for those businesses is obviously going to be a little more long tailed than what we're seeing in other vertical markets. Gaming in this quarter was flat versus 2019. So it has come back quite well. It was up meaningfully over 2020 levels, almost 30% in the quarter, and it got flat versus 2019. And again, we expect that to turn positive in the fourth quarter. 
So I would say, overall, the business is in the right direction. The verticals that have been more heavily impacted are going to have a little longer road to recovery. The sequential trends are good, and we expect to see that continuing heading into 2022. So I'll pause there and maybe just turn my attention to bookings trends because that continues to be a very good story for the vertical market businesses. We saw excellent new booking trends in the quarter. Our recurring revenues in that business bookings were up 35% year-over-year. AdvancedMD recorded a booking record of nearly 50% year-over-year. Our Xenial SaaS solutions were up almost 50% year-over-year and TouchNet was up almost 35% year-over-year. 
And active and schools continue to see good booking trends despite obviously the overall macro continuing to weigh on those businesses. Active bookings were up in the mid-teens year-over-year. And our school business had positive booking trends in the quarter as well. So as we think about the business overall, the bookings trends we've seen in this quarter, and frankly, what we've seen throughout the course of 2021 give us a lot of confidence that from a momentum perspective, we're obviously building a nice backlog of business. And as the macro in the more heavily impacted verticals improves, we obviously have a lot of tailwinds for the vertical market channel heading into 2022 and 2023."

So I guess I would start off by kind of adding on what Cameron said is that starting in the fourth quarter, this turns into a growth tailwind for us. And we've talked for several quarters now of this vertical market there because of the components of the business being somewhere about 300 to 400 basis points headwind to our segment margin over the last several quarters. And starting in the fourth quarter with the kind of sequential quarter growth we're seeing, this turns into a tailwind. 
And I think, as Cameron said, with all the bookings success that kind of we've had we're expecting that essentially 300 to 400 basis point headwind to kind of turn into kind of a commensurate kind of tailwind as we move into 2022. Obviously, we're in that planning process right now, and we'll kind of get more kind of discrete levels of insight as we talk about the 2022 guide. But the key point is exactly what kind of Cameron said is kind of headwind turning into a tailwind as we move to next year. 
And just in general, as we look to the 2022 guide, and you kind of, once again, kind of go back to what we said at our Investor Day around our cycle guidance as it relates to revenue growth. Those are the levels that we're targeting at or even slightly better at the levels that we're targeting at for next few years as a revenue growth matter."

If you think about our strategy, it's really centered around commerce enablement. And whether we're working with a software partner or we're working, obviously, with our own technology stack from a software standpoint where we go to market and verticals with our own capabilities. The objective is to continue to bring more merchants into our ecosystem, leveraging technology. And once you're in our ecosystem, obviously, finding new ways, provide solutions to them and help them run their businesses more effectively and obviously help them drive more top of funnel opportunities for their business. 
So our partnership with Google is clearly at the center of that strategy in terms of how we deliver more value-added services and more capabilities to our customers across, again, both our owned software portfolio, our traditional merchant acquiring businesses and then, of course, our own -- our partnered software portfolio as well. 
So obviously, there's a lot of opportunities in front of us as we continue to execute against that strategy. We are launching run and grow my business this quarter. We expect that to ramp next year, and we're launching Phase 2 of that, as Jeff highlighted, hopefully, in the middle part of next year as we bring in online ordering inventory and reservations into that ecosystem. From a -- you raised time and attendance, it's a great example of where we can take a solution from one market into another. We're selling time and attendance now across a few of our vertical market businesses that came out of our payroll solutions. And looking to bring that to a number of our integrated partners as well as the way to which we can, again, attach more opportunities to those partnership relationships. 
On the integrated front, I'd also note that strategy is also key to winning new ISV partners because one of the ways we're able to differentiate ourselves versus just offering [indiscernible] its revenue share offer a larger pie from a revenue standpoint that we ultimately end up splitting with those ISVs because we can bring more solutions to the table. It makes the ISVs offering more attractive. It gives us more opportunity to grow and scale with the ISV. And as I always like to say, we'd rather be focused on how to divide up a larger pie versus more finally slicing an existing pie that's not growing. 
So I think as it relates to the overall merchant strategy highlighted what's really key, which is driving more commerce enablement by attaching more of our offerings to merchant relations that come through whatever distribution channel we're selling through into the market."

So that's part of the value-added services that you asked about and the Cameron tied to. And I think all that stuff is working. And I think if you look at our results in the third quarter, mid-camas up 13% in the third quarter, volumes were up 20% versus 2019. So it's the commerce enablement that Cameron is describing in response to your question, which is to say the virtuous circle of software at the top of the funnel, the cross-sells, the data analytics, the new partnerships, all that stuff is resulting in clearly above-market growth on the stats I just gave and what we put in the press release.
