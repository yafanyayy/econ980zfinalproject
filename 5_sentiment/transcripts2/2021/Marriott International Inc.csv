He was an exceptional visionary leader, but more importantly, an exceptional human being. He will be deeply missed. 
As you are aware, Arne decided to reduce his schedule to fully focus on his health earlier this month. In consultation with the Board, Arne asked Stephanie Linnartz, Group President of Consumer Operations, Technology and Emerging Businesses, and Tony Capuano, Group President of Global Development, Design and Operations Services, 2 long time members of our leadership team, to jointly oversee the company's day-to-day operations. Stephanie and Tony will continue in this capacity until our Board appoints a new President and CEO, which is expected to occur in the next 2 weeks. 
Stephanie and Tony are joining us on our call this morning. 
As usual, we have Leeny Oberg, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Betsy Dahm, our Vice President, Investor Relations, with us as well. 
I will remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts, and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Statements in our comments and the press release we issued earlier today are effective only today and will not be updated as actual events unfold. 
Please also note that unless otherwise stated, our RevPAR and occupancy comments reflect system-wide constant currency year-over-year changes for comparable hotels and include hotels temporarily closed due to COVID 19.

I feel incredibly fortunate to have worked with such a wonderful and talented leader and to count Arne as a good friend. 
So many of you have reached out to us with your condolences for his family and for Marriott, and have shared your fond memories with him. And we've been comforted by your kind words. 
Stephanie, Tony and I wanted to share a few stories with you about Arne as well this morning. In hospitality business, work inherently includes a lot of travel. Those days, when Arne was on the road, he would lead an early morning group run around the hotel's neighborhood with his many associates as we're interested. As a solo runner, I would join the crew and watch Arne somehow find a way to spend time with every runner in the group, to run ahead with the quick runners and then run back to the walkers and find a way to connect with each and every person. We'd ask them about their families, their roles at Marriott, and their points of view about their markets. 
The run would be over at 6:30, and then he would move on to a full day of meetings and at least 5 more hotel tours. You could tell he fed on these connections with people, and that he cared about them deeply. I've learned so much from him, and I'll miss him tremendously. 
We're all committed to honoring our incredible leader by building on its legacy. And we, of course, want to update you on our business this morning as we move the company forward. Today, we will cover our usual earnings call topics with Stephanie focusing on the customer and demand side of the business, and Tony discussing our rooms growth and development trends. I'll cover our financial results and liquidity. 
Given the uncertainty around the pace of vaccinations and therefore, demand recovery, we will not be providing earnings guidance today. We will, however, share what we can about our outlook for 2021 in a few key areas. We'll plan to take your questions after our prepared remarks. And now I'll turn it over to Stephanie."

Arne was an incredible leader, both for Marriott and the industry, and he was fun in a competitive way. Like Leeny, I also remember the countless times we ran together. And he would always beat me, always. But what I will remember the most about Arne was his humility, his lack of ego and his passion for developing others. Arne and I attended the World Economic Forum in Davos together for the past 6 years. 
The first year I attended, I went to everything with Arne, taking it all in and learning so much from all of his interactions. The second year we went pretty much as soon as we arrived, he pushed me out of the nest, so to speak. He encouraged me to schedule my own meetings and do my own media interview. He believed I was ready. And in typical Arne fashion, he empowered me to grow. He knew it was best for me and for the company. 
That's what true leadership is. Believing in your team and helping your teammates believe in themselves. I am honored to have worked with him, and we are all committed to building on his legacy. 
I know Arne would want us to talk about business. So let me start us off. COVID-19 has impacted our business to an extent we never imagined, making 2020 by far the most challenging year in our company's history. Full year worldwide RevPAR declined 60%, with average occupancy of just over 35% compared to 73% for full year 2019. The in 2020, occupancy and year-over-year RevPAR changes showed steady improvement from the trough in April through the summer and into the early fall. However, with spikes in COVID cases in many markets around the world, we saw the global pace of recovery flatten in the fourth quarter, and in the first few weeks of 2021. Currently, over 94% of our hotels are open. 
Recovery trajectories to date have varied greatly by region. Mainland China, where there has generally been a sense that the viruses under control, has led the recovery and strongly exemplifies the resiliency of demand. Occupancy reached 60% in July and remained above that level through the end of 2020. Fourth quarter RevPAR in Mainland China was only down 12% year-over-year. We saw additional proof points of the ability for demand to recover quickly in other areas as well during the fourth quarter, including the Maldives and Dubai. 
Occupancy in both markets jumped to over 60% in December after their government's eased travel entry restrictions. In the fourth quarter, many countries around the world reinstituted strict temporary limitations on traveling and gathering to combat rising virus cases. Demand in the U.S. was clearly sensitive to spikes in COVID cases in government travel advisories, as we saw during the traditionally travel-heavy holiday period from Thanksgiving through New Year. 
Many cities in Europe also shut down. Similarly, in China, we have recently seen several markets essentially on lockdown in January and February for several weeks at a time in order to fight the spread of the virus, leading to a meaningful drop in occupancy in these markets. Overall, occupancy in Mainland China year-to-date has fallen to an average of around 40%. The good news is that once these temporary shutdowns are lifted, we have seen demand return quickly. For example, occupancy in Chengdu and Qingdao recently jumped from around 20% to over 60% in just 2 weeks after their local governments announced the virus outbreaks were under control, and removed travel restrictions. 
Our worldwide occupancy and year-over-year RevPAR decline in January were roughly the same as we saw in December. Looking ahead to the rest of 2021, booking windows remain very short, and there is still a large amount of uncertainty. While vaccines are slowly rolling out, the pace is too uncertain to be able to predict when occupancy will move meaningfully higher. But as the year progresses, assuming wider distribution of effective vaccines, we are optimistic that the pace of recovery will pick up speed and accelerate throughout the year. 
In the U.S. and Canada, we are encouraged to see some small green shoots of increased demand for corporate and leisure transient bookings as well as in-group lead volume. While still down meaningfully year-over-year, transient booking pace and visits to our direct booking sites have been improving recently. Occupancy over President's Day weekend, was the strongest we have had for a long weekend since the beginning of the pandemic, led by leisure demand. And we are also starting to see a bit of momentum behind special corporate bookings. 
Group revenue pace in the U.S. and Canada for 2021 is also still down significantly compared to group revenue pace for 2020 at the same time last year. So the declines are less severe for the second half of the year. 
In January, we had a very strong month for group bookings in '22 and beyond. Additionally, this business was booked at average daily rates, 11% higher than business booked in January 2020 for stays in 2021 and beyond. These are encouraging signs that there is strong demand for travel in future years once real progress has been made in containing the virus. 
As we think about marketing in this environment, our teams continue to analyze the latest consumer trends to help shape our recovery strategy. We are keenly focused on personalization and localization, on capturing more leisure as well as leisure travel as the lines between work and home blur, and on increasingly leveraging our digital-direct channels, and in particular, our Marriott Bonvoy app. 
We recently released our updated, redesigned Bonvoy app with the goal of better meeting the travel shopping needs of today's leisure traveler. The power of the Bonvoy platform has become even more evident during the pandemic as many of our more than 147 million members have continued to interact with us in ways other than staying in our hotels. 
Our Marriott Bonvoy credit card holders have remained particularly engaged. Global credit card spending on our cards for 2020 was down only 16% year-over-year, and marked contrast to the steeper decline in RevPAR. And while not material from a financial perspective, one of the most significant expanded offerings to members recently has been our whole home rental platform, Homes & Villas by Marriott International, or HVMI. 
We grew the number of units on the platform from around 2,000 at launch less than 2 years ago to approximately 25,000 today. And we saw increased demand from our Marriott Bombay members, with over 90% of HVMI room nights in 2020 booked by members. We continue to focus on driving demand to our hotels and are engaging with our members, with creative content and special offers, including our escape to luxury and Bonvoy Escapes promotions. 
Additionally, early last year, we extended elite member status through early 2022, and we recently credited our accounts with another deposit of Elite Night credits to give them a head start towards elite status in 2022. 
Before I turn the call over to Tony, I want to thank our incredible team of associates around the world. Who have shown true dedication and resilience throughout these challenging times. Tony?"

One of my favorite trips with him sums up how truly special and unique he really was. After we acquired Starwood in 2016, Arne wanted his senior leadership team to do an 8-day world wind trip around the world. He wanted to visit as many properties as we could to welcome our new associates and show them that the Marriott people-first culture was real. And he wanted each of us there with him. As we toured property after property, Arne made a point to meet as many people as possible, to shake every hand and to look each person he met in the eye. He was so sincere and genuine. He also made sure to spend time with his leadership team outside of these meetings. 
In particular, I remember one overnight flight to the Middle East. Towards morning, Arne woke us all up and brought us to the lounge in the back of the plane, so we could just spend time together and enjoy each other's company. This was classic Arne. He wanted to build a cohesive team that while not afraid of some spirited debate, truly liked and respected each other, and it worked. Our jobs are infinitely easier because we're all rowing in the same direction. 
Now being the humble person that he was, I think Arne would say that we need to move on to the business. So let me now talk about our rooms growth. In 2020, we added nearly 63,000 rooms worldwide for rooms growth of 4.6% on a gross basis. Room openings in the year were impacted by slower construction time lines and supply chain issues as well as some owners temporarily waiting to open their hotels due to COVID-19. Asia Pacific was the one region where we opened more rooms in 2020 than we did in 2019, adding over 18,000 rooms with gross rooms growth of over 8% versus year-end 2019. 
In China, we recently opened our 50th hotel in Shanghai, the J.W. Marriott Shanghai function, a phenomenal accomplishment as our international growth continues to strengthen. On a net basis, including deletions of 1.5%, our global distribution grew by 3.1% year-over-year. Deletions were generally in line with the average levels we've seen over the last 3 years despite a number of hotels exiting our system for COVID-19-related reasons. 
While signings for full year 2020 were not as robust as we had expected at the beginning of the year. Our overall pipeline continues to lead the industry, totaling over 498,000 rooms at year-end. We also benefited from continued momentum in our residential branding business. And had another strong year for residential signings, a testament to the power of our brands. 
For the full year 2021, assuming progress is made in containing the virus, we expect gross rooms growth to accelerate to approximately 6%. While we have seen some delayed construction starts and could continue to see some delays in openings, 46% of our pipeline is already under construction. Additionally, we anticipate benefiting from the backlog of openings that were pushed from 2020 into this year. We also expect to see a meaningful impact from conversions this year as owners and their lenders seek to incremental top and bottom line benefits from being part of the Marriott system. 
We are extremely pleased with our recently announced conversion deal in CALA, that is expected to add 19 resorts and nearly 7,000 rooms to our all-inclusive portfolio. Our biggest deal yet, in CALA. These hotels fit perfectly with our focus on leisure, currently the strongest segment of demand. And while they were not in our year-end pipeline, these properties are all anticipated to join our system during 2021. 
Let's now shift to our 2021 outlook for net rooms growth, not including the approximate 100 basis point, onetime headwind from the 89 Service Properties Trust, or SVC, mostly limited service hotels that are leaving our system by the end of March, we expect deletions of 1.5% to 2%. That's slightly higher than we have experienced recently due to the potential for more COVID-19-related exits. 
Coupled with our gross rooms growth expectation, we expect net rooms growth of roughly 3% to 3.5%, including the exiting SVC rooms. We have already received interest from multiple owners, not new deals in those markets and look forward to the opportunity to replace many of the first-generation limited-service SVC hotels with newer product. 
A key component of our demand recovery strategy is remaining keenly focused on the health and safety of our guests and associates. We first introduced our heightened cleanliness standards in April of last year. Since then, we've been increasingly leveraging contactless technologies such as mobile and web check-in, mobile key and mobile chat to reimagine the guest stay experience for this environment. 
Last month, we began rolling out additional health protocol options for group meetings at certain properties, including on-site temperature checks and providing for COVID testing capabilities. We have also remained focused on working closely with our owner and franchisee community to help them navigate these challenging times and have taken many steps to significantly lower their costs in this environment. These steps include waving FF&E contributions for most hotels with lender consent, reducing certain fixed charges for programs and services and extending the delay on renovations. 
We are also working with hotels on payment plans when necessary. And we are very pleased that the vast majority of our hotels are paying their bills. 
I also wanted to acknowledge our associates this morning. They have exemplified the Marriott culture throughout the pandemic, whether it's looking after first responders, prepping meals for those in need or hosting blood drives at our hotels. They are a remarkable team, and we could not be more proud. 
I will now turn the call back over to Leeny to talk about our fourth quarter financials in more detail."
31148,702236279,2215274,"Marriott International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2021",2021-02-18,"Earnings Calls","Marriott International, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tony.

As Stephanie noted, Mainland China continued to lead the recovery. Leisure remains the strongest driver of demand in Mainland China. And in the fourth quarter, stays in the leisure segment were up double digits year-over-year for the second quarter in a row. Business transient and group demand in the region also continued to rebound well in the fourth quarter, and we've been pleased to see this evidence of pent-up demand across all travel segments. In fact, group stays comprised around 20% of overall room nights in the fourth quarter, back in line with 2019's distribution. 
Demand in the rest of Asia Pacific also continued to improve in the fourth quarter, with occupancy reaching 35%, up 10 percentage points from the third quarter primarily driven by domestic leisure travel in Australia, South Korea and Japan as well as economic reopening efforts in countries like the Maldives and India. 
In the U.S. and Canada, leisure and drive to destinations remained the strongest markets throughout the fourth quarter. RevPAR declined 65% in the quarter in line with the year-over-year third quarter decline, with occupancy of 35%, just below third quarter's level of 37%. The seasonal decline in occupancy that typically happens during the fourth quarter was less pronounced in 2020, given the overall lower level of business travel. 
Trends in EMEA were mixed. Fourth quarter occupancy in the Middle East and Africa reached 36%, an 11 percentage point improvement from third quarter, reflecting strong domestic leisure demand in many major markets in the Middle East. The recovery in Europe took a step back in the last few months of 2020 as most countries reimpose restrictions after major second waves of the virus. 
During the fourth quarter, roughly 1/3 of our hotels in Europe were temporarily closed, and occupancy fell to 15%. In CALA, around 20% of hotels were closed during the fourth quarter, resort properties, particularly in Mexico, drove an improvement in occupancy to 24% in the region, up from 15% in the third quarter. 
With global RevPAR down 64%, our fourth quarter gross fee revenues totaled $423 million, a decline of 57% versus the year ago quarter, largely in line with the year-over-year decline we saw in the third quarter. Over 60% of the $44 million of fourth quarter incentive management fees were earned in Asia Pacific, of which 3 quarters were earned in Greater China. Over 95% of our hotels in Greater China had positive gross operating profit in the fourth quarter, with over 90% generating positive profits for the full year. These results reflect the strong rebound in demand when the virus is under better control and our ability to help our owners control costs. 
Within franchise fees, our non-RevPAR-related franchise fees continue to be resilient, totaling $133 million in the fourth quarter, down 15% from the year ago quarter, with credit card branding fees down 18%. Fourth quarter G&A improved by 31% year-over-year, reflecting our significant cost reduction efforts. In the fourth quarter, our total income tax provision was a benefit of $150 million, primarily due to the favorable resolution of pre-acquisition Starwood tax audit. 
We reported fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $317 million, down 65% versus the fourth quarter of last year, essentially the same decline as in the third quarter. 
I'll now turn to cash burn. As we've described on prior calls, our monthly cash burn rate was only slightly negative in the fourth quarter, even with RevPAR down 64%. The impact of the company's $130 million 401(k) match payment in October and higher cash interest due to the timing of payments were partially offset by continued strong receivables collection efforts and robust loyalty cash flows. 
We've been pleased with the strength of our cash generation in 2020 in light of the dramatic reduction in revenues. 
Our full year financials show net cash provided by operating activities of $1.6 billion, which included the onetime $920 million of proceeds from our amended co-brand credit card agreements. Subtracting out the $920 million as well as all investment spending, we still generated positive operating cash flow, a strong performance in the year when RevPAR was down 60%. These results show the true power of our asset-light business model, and are a testament to our company's ability to quickly and effectively adapt to a significant and rapid change in demand. 
Loyalty was a key piece of the equation, generating over $500 million of net cash flow in 2020 after being a net user of cash in 2019. This year's positive cash generation from loyalty is on top of our credit card-related fees, including an EBITDA as well as the $920 million of cash received from our amended co-brand credit card agreement. The loyalty program benefited from strong cash inflows from our credit card programs given the resilience of consumer credit card spending. While the loyalty program's operating cost and redemption expenses were down significantly. Redemption expenses were much lower than usual in terms of both volume of nights and the rate paid hotels for redemptions given the low occupancy environment. 
At the end of the fourth quarter, our net liquidity was approximately $4.4 billion after the paydown of over $600 million of debt during the quarter. The company's net liquidity represents roughly $800 million in available cash balances, plus $3.6 billion undrawn on our revolver. We believe our liquidity position and resilient cash flow from operations comfortably position us to meet our short- and long-term obligations. 
I also want to briefly discuss the $243 million fourth quarter charge related to the Sheraton brand Chicago [indiscernible]. Shortly after the Starwood deal closed, we granted the hotel owner a onetime right to put the leasehold interest to Marriott in 2022 for $300 million in cash. Given the current environment, we have determined the put is likely to be exercised, so we increased our liability. We have the right to defer the closing on the pit until late 2024. 
Moving on to full year 2021, while we won't be giving RevPAR or earnings guidance, I'll provide a bit of color on certain items where we do have some visibility. Starting with the top line. At current RevPAR levels for full year 2021, we expect the sensitivity of a 1 point change in RevPAR compared to 2019 RevPAR on our fees could be between $35 million and $40 million per year. 
Please note that given the nominal level of RevPAR in 2020, the impact of a 1 percentage point change in 2021 RevPAR compared to 2020 RevPAR could be more like $15 million to $20 million. 
As we saw throughout 2020, the relationship is not linear, given the variability of IMF and the inclusion of non-RevPAR-related franchise fees as well. In order for us to start earning IMF in the U.S. and other markets where IMF stand aside to owner priorities, we'll need to see substantial improvement in RevPAR levels. We anticipate that the majority of IMFs in 2021 will again be earned in international markets. We expect our non-RevPAR-related fees to remain resilient and show strong year-over-year growth in 2021. 
We expect G&A to total $775 million to $800 million in 2021. Note that the cash component of G&A will be lower than this range given noncash stock compensation. Interest expense is anticipated to be roughly $430 million for the full year. 
Turning to several other major items that will impact cash flow. Our cash taxes are expected to be $275 million to $300 million for full year 2021. Investment spending, excluding amounts expected to be reimbursed over time, is anticipated to total $375 million to $450 million for the full year. We anticipate another $200 million of investment spending that is expected to be reimbursed over time for total investment spending of $575 million to $650 million as compared to $375 million in 2020. 
Approximately $220 million of the total spending in 2021 is for maintenance, CapEx and our new headquarters. Total investment spending includes capital and technology expenditures, loan advances, contract acquisition costs and other investing activities. We expect cash flows from the loyalty program to be roughly neutral in 2021, even after the reduced payments we will receive from the co-brand credit card companies that effectively repay roughly 1/3 of the $920 million received in 2020. 
In closing, while the timing of a full recovery is unpredictable, we are optimistic that we will see notable progress over the course of this year. We've seen real evidence of the pent-up demand for travel, and we look forward to welcoming more and more guests to our hotels. 
We'll now open the line for questions."

We're also, on the group front, seeing some positive trends as it relates to group cancels. They've really slowed for the second half of 2021, and they are at normal levels for 2022 plus. We're also seeing some great trends on lead volume. While it's certainly behind 2019, it's improving. As a matter of fact, over the last 45 days, lead volume has increased 20 to 30 percentage points. So a significant improvement from what we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2020.

And I should note, most of those groups that were booked into the future years at those higher rates were in-house groups versus citywides. We haven't quite seen citywide bookings come back yet. So I think that the story on the group front just underscores the point that there will be a return to meetings and group business. It may be slower than we would like but that we're seeing the demand. And as you can imagine, Shaun, we're talking to our customers all the time. Meeting planners, our top accounts. And they all want to get back out on the road and travel. We're also seeing, in China, some quite positive things on the group front. As a matter of fact, the bookings in China, group bookings were up to 20% of our room nights, again, which was encouraging. China is a great story. It shows that there's pent-up demand for travel. Six weeks after this virus was announced in China, people started booking room nights again, started with leisure. But then quickly towards as the year moved on, moved to both business travel and group. And of course, much of it -- most of it was domestic, but still strong demand. So we're very encouraged as to what we're seeing on the group front."

Arne was obviously a talented executive, and everybody respected him for what he's done over the years at Marriott and the lodging industry. But I remember him as just being a good man in how we treated everybody so respectfully and something to aspire to for everybody else. So I know it's a big loss for you guys. So I just wanted to mention that. So my question is for you, Tony. I was hoping on the gross rooms outlook commentary for this year, if you can go through the composition of the gross rooms. How much of it is conversions? How much of it is new construction? And of the new construction, I guess, how much of it is pre-COVID advantage versus any limited service -- new construction that maybe think about it as commencing since March of last year. And then as you think about investment spend for the balance of what's in the pipeline, ex the 2021 gross rooms openings, do you think that accelerates in '22 and beyond relative to what you're spending this year?"

Well, first of all, thank you for your kind sentiments, most appreciated. I think as we think about 2021 openings, obviously, we've indicated in our prepared remarks, an acceleration to about 6% gross openings. And to state the obvious, there's more limited visibility than we've had into the markets, pre COVID. But there's a number of factors, I think, that give us some measure of comfort that support our guidance. I think, number one, we've got about 230,000 rooms under construction around the world as we sit here today. You also heard us talk a little bit about the Sunwing all-inclusive project, adding 7,000 rooms. That gives us almost 100 basis points of growth in gross openings in 2021. To your point, there were a number of hotels under construction last year that had been targeted for 2020 openings, and they slipped principally because of COVID-related construction delays. And we expect a significant number of those hotels to open in 2021. And then I think the last thing I would say is that while it's certainly early days, we're only 10 or 11 weeks into the year, we're seeing some encouraging signs related to accelerating conversions activity. If you look at the fourth quarter of 2020, about 21% of our signings were conversions. And that was the highest percentage contribution from conversions that we had seen since the first quarter of 2019. And so we did go back and take a look at some previous cycles. And in fact, at the last peak, we saw conversions spike all the way up to about 24% of total signings. And I think that's quite encouraging as well. The only other thing I would add, Joe, that also gives us some measure of comfort. We've seen from quarter-to-quarter since the pandemic started, a relatively steady level of rooms under construction. And obviously, we've shared that with you in each of the quarterly calls."

But when you think about the kind of classic typical investment either per deal or per average key in a full year, I would say we are not seeing any sort of meaningful increase in the amount of investment that were needed to put into deals. And obviously, when you look at our pipeline, for example, in the U.S., which is 80% limited service. There, typically, the investment is far less and so I think while you would expect that our investment will increase a bit relative to the really low 2020 levels. I would not expect it to see it take kind of meaningful step-up relative to the overall numbers of rooms."

Since our launch, the market reaction from the development community has been quite significant. I think one of the things that gives us so much enthusiasm about the Sunwing announcement. Beyond the fact that it's great rapid increase in our footprint. It has accelerated the volume of inquiries we're getting about new opportunities, particularly on the conversion side. And Sunwing is a terrific partner for us.

And if we see something that makes sense, we'll use the same lens that we've always applied to the evaluation of bolt-on acquisitions. Does it fill a gap for us in terms of either geographic distribution or segment, and are the economics compelling. I also -- maybe the last fine point I would put on that not only for individual hotel transactions, but for M&A transactions. The financing markets are challenging at best.

So Leeny, you mentioned G&A $775 million $800 million range. Can you help us think about the different levers of costs that were removed, and how you may expect some of these to return perhaps in 2022 and beyond a more robust recovery?

So first of all, on the corporate G&A front, when you look at these levels compared to the 2019 levels, you're looking at a high teens reduction in comparison. And you do need to remember that both of those numbers include bad debt. And while in the long run, bad debt is a cash cost. It is kind of in the year for the year, often not a cash cost because it's a reserve taken. And again, it's a little bit hard to predict exactly where that will go in '21. And I think you would normally expect in this environment, it might be a little bit higher than normal levels. And certainly in '19, it was not even anything to worry about. But overall, I would say, from a cash perspective, you would see that our cash cost on a G&A front with the $775 million to $800 million is -- that reduction is a bit higher than the high teens sort of number that I've described on the expense line. And when I think about it going forward, Steven, I would say a couple of things. First of all, obviously, I would expect that some will need to be added back as we move forward into a much improved picture for our industry. But I will also say that we undertook some work in 2020 that was while extraordinarily painful and difficult, I think, was a reflection that we view that it will take some time for the industry to recover. And we really need to put ourselves in a position where we could make these cost savings last a very long time, if not permanently. So while you could see costs go up a bit more than inflation, I think you will see most of these savings be sustainable. And similarly, on the hotel front, we've done a lot of work to do things that are both temporary and sustainable on the cost front. We've obviously done some temporary reductions in fixed cost at the hotel level. We've obviously done some, again, really painful work in the way of furloughs, et cetera. But we've also done some really innovative things around how to better staff the hotels, how to better get our work done, how to manage some of the programmatic costs that go to those hotels. And I think those, again, will be sustainable. When I think about -- in '21, what we've tried to do is [Audio Gap] to as much of the margins that we had in '19 as possible. So while I think the hotel margins will obviously suffer from a reduction in revenues compared to '19 at the hotel level. We think we have been able to save the vast majority of that margin decline through the work that we've done. And then obviously, as we move into a much more normal picture, there will be sustainable savings that allow us to get to a profitability point that returns back to where it was much quicker."

And obviously, amongst the select service hotels, quite a few of them are actually cash flow positive. We have arranged payment plans for a large number of our hotels. And when you think about it typically means they pay us in 30 days. And to be able to stretch that out over several months is a big help. And we're seeing there, again, overwhelmingly that they are making payments on those payment plans. And while there are obviously -- we need to get back to where there's substantial recovery to get them to a much better spot. For the moment, they are hanging in there, and they are able to pay some down and work with us to be able to navigate through this time. But I do agree with you, we are paying incredible attention to our cost on property and working with the owners to try to find ways to do even more. And a whole lot of this depends on what the owner's particular situation is, too, in terms of how well capitalized, what is the debt structure and what kind of market they're in. But overwhelmingly, we have seen really strong performance.

So I would say there can be some true structural reasons why in those markets, government regulations, actually, in some cases, require that the hotel has been closed. So I think one of the things that we've all learned over the last year is that, in many cases, even down at levels of 10% to 15% occupancy, a hotel can be better off being open than it is closed, from a cash flow perspective. And we've, again, done everything we can. Most of our charges, as you know, are based on revenues. So that floats with the occupancy. So I think in general, we would, as you see things start to pick up a little bit.

I think beyond 2021, we're going to need to get a bit further into the economic recovery. We're going to have to see how quickly the financing markets rebound and how quickly construction starts begin to pick up. As I said, we do have 230,000 rooms under construction. But it is interesting. As I talk with our transactors around the world. The good news is we're generally not seeing much in the way of fallout of under construction pipe -- projects from the pipeline. I think if there's going to be an impact, it will likely be further impact on the length of the construction cycle. And so it's a little tough to know what that looks like in '22. I am hopeful that in the next couple of quarters, that visibility will improve a little bit. But I just don't think we've got great visibility beyond '21 at this point."

Yes, we always say, we're overwhelmingly done with the integration. And we're kind of hopeful that this is the last bit. But when we acquired the company, Starwood's management agreements for the Sheraton Grand Chicago and the Westin Times Square included very broad cross-brand territorial, which actually -- when you think about it, meant that for the rest of our 28 brands, we were severely limited in those areas. So soon after we did the deal, we entered into a settlement agreement with a hotel owner where basically we granted that owner a onetime right to put the leasehold interest in the hotel to Marriott in 2022 for $300 million in cash. Now it's worth noting that there is a ground lease underneath this hotel. We actually don't have to buy that if we want to buy that land, we'll have the right to for an additional $200 million, but it is worth noting that there is a ground lease on the hotel as well. But this is providing the interest in the hotel. The other interesting part is that given the current economic conditions, we believe that the put is probable of being exercised. And as a result, we needed to reflect what we think is the current value. And obviously, all these markets are struggling, and that resulted in this charge. The other thing that's worth noting is that we actually have the right to not actually close on the put until late 2024. So even though it could get put to us in 2022, we wouldn't necessarily have to buy it until the end of '24. And so it's actually worth noting that also part of the impairment that we had in the contract, the amortization line reflects the fact that. Frankly, right now, if you ask us, we would expect that we would defer that purchase. Until the end of '24 and continue to manage the hotel until the end of '24 to take into consideration the fact that we don't buy it until then. The other part that I guess I'll add is that since that agreement was signed, we've actually added 4,000 rooms in the Chicago and New York markets. So while it is painful and clearly, a direct result of COVID. We do think that in the broad picture, it's really important for us to be able to have the capability to expand our brands in those really important markets."

Yes, we really are excited about HVMI, primarily as an offering for our Marriott Bonvoy members. We launched that business in 2019 with about 2,000 homes, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks. And the reason we launched the business is we were talking to our Marriott Bonvoy members. And 8 out of 10 of them said not only -- not that they were just thinking about renting a home, but they actually had done it through another platform. So we knew it was an offering they wanted that we didn't have. And we knew it would be complementary to our core hotel business. 
So we launched the business in 2019. We've grown it to 25,000 homes. There is about -- there's a couple of million homes in the segment in which we play in. I think it's really important when we talk about HVMI to make some distinctions from other platforms. 
First of all, we only have whole homes. We also -- it's not an open platform like some of the other players. You can't just put a home on there. We only work with professional housing management companies. And we have very, very strict standards about what type of premium and luxury homes will allow on the platform, standards around amenities, design aesthetic, service levels, safety, security, et cetera. So we are very strict about which homes to get on the platform. And one of the most important things about HVMI is you can earn loyalty points and burn loyalty points there. I mentioned in the prepared remarks that 90% of our bookings are coming from loyalty members. Also, 30% of the bookings are redemptions. People were redeeming their Marriott Bonvoy points. And we saw the business do well, particularly during last summer because people wanted a whole home. 40% of our HVMI destinations are actually new to Marriott. They're where we don't have hotels, and many of them are in more remote locations, which really was quite attractive during COVID. So we're excited about the offering, and we see it as complementary to our core business and a tremendous value proposition for Marriott Bonvoy members."

And our retail rates, we don't really differ between business and leisure. We do have some negotiated volume discounts for corporate accounts. But the key to pricing really is about occupancy rebounding. And right now, that's the challenge. I mean, in terms of ADR, it fell very steeply in April and May of last year. And that was driven by very low occupancies, and we had caregiver rates and the like in our hotels. But the occupancy did tick up throughout the year. Of course, it varies market to market. In general, last year, we saw luxury ADR hold up best with extended stay ADR next. And again, it really does get to compression. I think it will be interesting to watch this recovery. If demand comes back much more quickly than we anticipated, we may be able to grow ADR faster than we did coming out of the last downturn.

Stephanie, Tony and I wanted to share a few stories with you about Arne as well this morning. In hospitality business, work inherently includes a lot of travel. Those days, when Arne was on the road, he would lead an early morning group run around the hotel's neighborhood with his many associates as we're interested. As a solo runner, I would join the crew and watch Arne somehow find a way to spend time with every runner in the group, to run ahead with the quick runners and then run back to the walkers and find a way to connect with each and every person. He'd ask them about their families, their roles at Marriott, and their points of view about their markets.  
The run would be over at 6:30, and then he would move on to a full day of meetings and at least 5 more hotel tours. You could tell he's fed on these connections with people, and that he cared about them deeply. I've learned so much from him, and I'll miss him tremendously.  
We're all committed to honoring our incredible leader by building on its legacy. And we, of course, want to update you on our business this morning as we move the company forward. Today, we will cover our usual earnings call topics with Stephanie focusing on the customer and demand side of the business, and Tony discussing our rooms growth and development trends. I'll cover our financial results and liquidity.  
Given the uncertainty around the pace of vaccinations and therefore, demand recovery, we will not be providing earnings guidance today. We will, however, share what we can about our outlook for 2021 in a few key areas. We'll plan to take your questions after our prepared remarks. And now I'll turn it over to Stephanie."

Arne was an incredible leader, both for Marriott and the industry, and he was fun in a competitive way. Like Leeny, I also remember the countless times we ran together. And he would always beat me, always. But what I will remember the most about Arne was his humility, his lack of ego and his passion for developing others. Arne and I attended the World Economic Forum in Davos together for the past 6 years.  
The first year I attended, I went to everything with Arne, taking it all in and learning so much from all of his interactions. The second year we went, pretty much as soon as we arrived, he pushed me out of the nest, so to speak. He encouraged me to schedule my own meetings and do my own media interview. He believed I was ready. And in typical Arne fashion, he empowered me to grow. He knew it was best for me and for the company. That's what true leadership is. Believing in your team and helping your teammates believe in themselves. I am honored to have worked with him, and we are all committed to building on his legacy. 
I know Arne would want us to talk about business. So let me start us off. COVID-19 has impacted our business to an extent we never imagined, making 2020 by far the most challenging year in our company's history. Full year worldwide RevPAR declined 60%, with average occupancy of just over 35% compared to 73% for full year 2019. In 2020, occupancy and year-over-year RevPAR changes showed steady improvement from the trough in April through the summer and into the early fall. However, with spikes in COVID cases in many markets around the world, we saw the global pace of recovery flatten in the fourth quarter and in the first few weeks of 2021. Currently, over 94% of our hotels are open. 
Recovery trajectories to date have varied greatly by region. Mainland China, where there has generally been a sense that the virus is under control, has led the recovery and strongly exemplifies the resiliency of demand. Occupancy reached 60% in July and remained above that level through the end of 2020. Fourth quarter RevPAR in Mainland China was only down 12% year-over-year. 
We saw additional proof points of the ability for demand to recover quickly in other areas as well during the fourth quarter, including the Maldives and Dubai. Occupancy in both markets jumped to over 60% in December after their governments eased travel/entry restrictions. 
In the fourth quarter, many countries around the world reinstituted strict temporary limitations on traveling and gathering to combat rising virus cases. Demand in the U.S. was clearly sensitive to spikes in COVID cases in government travel advisories, as we saw during the traditionally travel-heavy holiday period from Thanksgiving through New Year.  
Many cities in Europe also shut down. Similarly, in China, we have recently seen several markets essentially on lockdown in January and February for several weeks at a time in order to fight the spread of the virus, leading to a meaningful drop in occupancy in these markets. Overall, occupancy in Mainland China year-to-date has fallen to an average of around 40%. 
The good news is that once these temporary shutdowns are lifted, we have seen demand return quickly. For example, occupancy in Chengdu and Qingdao recently jumped from around 20% to over 60% in just 2 weeks after their local governments announced the virus outbreaks were under control and removed travel restrictions.  
Our worldwide occupancy and year-over-year RevPAR decline in January were roughly the same as we saw in December. Looking ahead to the rest of 2021, booking windows remain very short, and there is still a large amount of uncertainty. While vaccines are slowly rolling out, the pace is too uncertain to be able to predict when occupancy will move meaningfully higher. But as the year progresses, assuming wider distribution of effective vaccines, we are optimistic that the pace of recovery will pick up speed and accelerate throughout the year.  
In the U.S. and Canada, we are encouraged to see some small green shoots of increased demand for corporate and leisure transient bookings as well as in group lead volume. While still down meaningfully year-over-year, transient booking pace and visits to our direct booking sites have been improving recently. Occupancy over President's Day weekend was the strongest we have had for a long weekend since the beginning of the pandemic, led by leisure demand. And we are also starting to see a bit of momentum behind special corporate bookings.  
Group revenue pace in the U.S. and Canada for 2021 is also still down significantly compared to group revenue pace for 2020 at the same time last year. So the declines are less severe for the second half of the year. In January, we had a very strong month for group bookings in '22 and beyond. Additionally, this business was booked at average daily rates, 11% higher than business booked in January 2020 for stays in 2021 and beyond. These are encouraging signs that there is strong demand for travel in future years once real progress has been made in containing the virus.  
As we think about marketing in this environment, our teams continue to analyze the latest consumer trends to help shape our recovery strategy. We are keenly focused on personalization and localization, on capturing more leisure as well as leisure travel as the lines between work and home blur, and on increasingly leveraging our digital-direct channels, and in particular, our Marriott Bonvoy app. We recently released our updated, redesigned Bonvoy app with the goal of better meeting the travel shopping needs of today's leisure traveler. 
The power of the Bonvoy platform has become even more evident during the pandemic as many of our more than 147 million members have continued to interact with us in ways other than staying in our hotels. 
Our Marriott Bonvoy credit card holders have remained particularly engaged. Global credit card spending on our cards for 2020 was down only 16% year-over-year, and marked contrast to the steeper decline in RevPAR. And while not material from a financial perspective, one of the most significant expanded offerings to members recently has been our whole home rental platform, Homes & Villas by Marriott International, or HVMI.  
We grew the number of units on the platform from around 2,000 at launch less than 2 years ago to approximately 25,000 today. And we saw increased demand from our Marriott Bonvoy members, with over 90% of HVMI room nights in 2020 booked by members. 
We continue to focus on driving demand to our hotels and are engaging with our members. With creative content and special offers, including our Escape to Luxury and Bonvoy Escapes promotions. Additionally, early last year, we extended elite member status through early 2022, and we recently credited their accounts with another deposit of Elite Night credits to give them a head start towards elite status in 2022.  
Before I turn the call over to Tony, I want to thank our incredible team of associates around the world who have shown true dedication and resilience throughout these challenging times. Tony?"

One of my favorite trips with him sums up how truly special and unique he really was. After we acquired Starwood in 2016, Arne wanted his senior leadership team to do an 8-day world wind trip around the world. He wanted to visit as many properties as we could to welcome our new associates and show them that the Marriott people-first culture was real. And he wanted each of us there with him. As we toured property after property, Arne made a point to meet as many people as possible, to shake every hand and to look each person he met in the eye. He was so sincere and genuine. 
He also made sure to spend time with his leadership team outside of these meetings. In particular, I remember one overnight flight to the Middle East. Towards morning, Arne woke us all up and brought us to the lounge in the back of the plane, so we could just spend time together and enjoy each other's company. This was classic Arne. He wanted to build a cohesive team that while not afraid of some spirited debate, truly liked and respected each other, and it worked. Our jobs are infinitely easier because we're all rowing in the same direction.  
Now being the humble person that he was, I think Arne would say that we need to move on to the business. So let me now talk about our rooms growth. In 2020, we added nearly 63,000 rooms worldwide for rooms growth of 4.6% on a gross basis. Room openings in the year were impacted by slower construction time lines and supply chain issues as well as some owners temporarily waiting to open their hotels due to COVID-19. Asia Pacific was the one region where we opened more rooms in 2020 than we did in 2019, adding over 18,000 rooms with gross rooms growth of over 8% versus year-end 2019.  
In China, we recently opened our 50th hotel in Shanghai, the J.W. Marriott Shanghai function, a phenomenal accomplishment as our international growth continues to strengthen. On a net basis, including deletions of 1.5%, our global distribution grew by 3.1% year-over-year. Deletions were generally in line with the average levels we've seen over the last 3 years despite a number of hotels exiting our system for COVID-19-related reasons.  
While signings for full year 2020 were not as robust as we had expected at the beginning of the year, our overall pipeline continues to lead the industry, totaling over 498,000 rooms at year-end. We also benefited from continued momentum in our residential branding business, and had another strong year for residential signings, a testament to the power of our brands.  
For the full year 2021, assuming progress is made in containing the virus, we expect gross rooms growth to accelerate to approximately 6%. While we have seen some delayed construction starts and could continue to see some delays in openings, 46% of our pipeline is already under construction. Additionally, we anticipate benefiting from backlog of openings that were pushed from 2020 into this year. We also expect to see a meaningful impact from conversions this year as owners and their lenders seek the incremental top and bottom line benefits from being part of the Marriott system.  
We are extremely pleased with our recently announced conversion deal in CALA, that is expected to add 19 resorts and nearly 7,000 rooms to our all-inclusive portfolio. Our biggest deal yet in CALA. These hotels fit perfectly with our focus on leisure, currently the strongest segment of demand. And while they were not in our year-end pipeline, these properties are all anticipated to join our system during 2021.  
Let's now shift to our 2021 outlook for net rooms growth. Not including the approximate 100 basis point onetime headwind from the 89 Service Properties Trust, or SVC, mostly limited service hotels that are leaving our system by the end of March, we expect deletions of 1.5% to 2%. That's slightly higher than we have experienced recently due to the potential for more COVID-19-related exits.  
Coupled with our gross rooms growth expectation, we expect net rooms growth of roughly 3% to 3.5%, including the exiting SVC rooms. We have already received interest from multiple owners in that new deals in those markets and look forward to the opportunity to replace many of the first-generation limited-service SVC hotels with newer product.  
A key component of our demand recovery strategy is remaining keenly focused on the health and safety of our guests and associates. We first introduced our heightened cleanliness standards in April of last year. Since then, we've been increasingly leveraging contactless technologies such as mobile and web check-in, mobile key and mobile chat to reimagine the guest stay experience for this environment.  
Last month, we began rolling out additional health protocol options for group meetings at certain properties, including on-site temperature checks and providing for COVID testing capabilities. We have also remained focused on working closely with our owner and franchisee community to help them navigate these challenging times and have taken many steps to significantly lower their costs in this environment. These steps include waving FF&E contributions for most hotels with lender consent, reducing certain fixed charges for programs and services and extending the delay on renovations. We are also working with hotels on payment plans when necessary, and we are very pleased that the vast majority of our hotels are paying their bills.  
I also wanted to acknowledge our associates this morning. They have exemplified the Marriott culture throughout the pandemic, whether it's looking after first responders, prepping meals for those in need or hosting blood drives at our hotels. They are a remarkable team, and we could not be more proud.  
I will now turn the call back over to Leeny to talk about our fourth quarter financials in more detail."
31148,702236279,2215414,"Marriott International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2021",2021-02-18,"Earnings Calls","Marriott International, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tony.

As Stephanie noted, Mainland China continued to lead the recovery. Leisure remains the strongest driver of demand in Mainland China. And in the fourth quarter, stays in the leisure segment were up double digits year-over-year for the second quarter in a row. Business transient and group demand in the region also continued to rebound well in the fourth quarter, and we've been pleased to see this evidence of pent-up demand across all travel segments. In fact, group stays comprised around 20% of overall room nights in the fourth quarter, back in line with 2019's distribution.  
Demand in the rest of Asia Pacific also continued to improve in the fourth quarter, with occupancy reaching 35%, up 10 percentage points from the third quarter, primarily driven by domestic leisure travel in Australia, South Korea and Japan as well as economic reopening efforts in countries like the Maldives and India.  
In the U.S. and Canada, leisure and drive to destinations remained the strongest markets throughout the fourth quarter. RevPAR declined 65% in the quarter in line with the year-over-year third quarter decline, with occupancy of 35%, just below third quarter's level of 37%. The seasonal decline in occupancy that typically happens during the fourth quarter was less pronounced in 2020, given the overall lower level of business travel.  
Trends in EMEA were mixed. Fourth quarter occupancy in the Middle East and Africa reached 36%, an 11 percentage point improvement from third quarter, reflecting strong domestic leisure demand in many major markets in the Middle East. The recovery in Europe took a step back in the last few months of 2020 as most countries reimpose restrictions after major second waves of the virus.  
During the fourth quarter, roughly 1/3 of our hotels in Europe were temporarily closed, and occupancy fell to 15%. In CALA, around 20% of hotels were closed during the fourth quarter, resort properties, particularly in Mexico, drove an improvement in occupancy to 24% in the region, up from 15% in the third quarter.  
With global RevPAR down 64%, our fourth quarter gross fee revenues totaled $423 million, a decline of 57% versus the year ago quarter, largely in line with the year-over-year decline we saw in the third quarter. Over 60% of the $44 million of fourth quarter incentive management fees were earned in Asia Pacific, of which 3 quarters were earned in Greater China. Over 95% of our hotels in Greater China had positive gross operating profit in the fourth quarter, with over 90% generating positive profits for the full year. These results reflect the strong rebound in demand when the virus is under better control and our ability to help our owners control costs.  
Within franchise fees, our non-RevPAR-related franchise fees continue to be resilient, totaling $133 million in the fourth quarter, down 15% from the year ago quarter, with credit card branding fees down 18%. 
Fourth quarter G&A improved by 31% year-over-year, reflecting our significant cost reduction efforts. 
In the fourth quarter, our total income tax provision was a benefit of $150 million, primarily due to the favorable resolution of pre-acquisition Starwood tax audit.  
We reported fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $317 million, down 65% versus the fourth quarter of last year, essentially the same decline as in the third quarter.  
I'll now turn to cash burn. As we've described on prior calls, our monthly cash burn rate was only slightly negative in the fourth quarter, even with RevPAR down 64%. The impact of the company's $130 million 401(k) match payment in October and higher cash interest due to the timing of payments were partially offset by continued strong receivables collection efforts and robust loyalty cash flows. We've been pleased with the strength of our cash generation in 2020 in light of the dramatic reduction in revenues.  
Our full year financials show net cash provided by operating activities of $1.6 billion, which included the onetime $920 million of proceeds from our amended co-brand credit card agreements. Subtracting out the $920 million as well as all investment spending, we still generated positive operating cash flow, a strong performance in the year when RevPAR was down 60%. These results show the true power of our asset-light business model, and are a testament to our company's ability to quickly and effectively adapt to a significant and rapid change in demand.  
Loyalty was a key piece of the equation, generating over $500 million of net cash flow in 2020 after being a net user of cash in 2019. This year's positive cash generation from loyalty is on top of our credit card-related fees, including an EBITDA as well as the $920 million of cash received from our amended co-brand credit card agreement. The loyalty program benefited from strong cash inflows from our credit card programs given the resilience of consumer credit card spending, while the loyalty program's operating cost and redemption expenses were down significantly. Redemption expenses were much lower than usual in terms of both volume of nights and the rate paid hotels for redemptions given the low occupancy environment.  
At the end of the fourth quarter, our net liquidity was approximately $4.4 billion after the paydown of over $600 million of debt during the quarter. The company's net liquidity represents roughly $800 million in available cash balances, plus $3.6 billion undrawn on our revolver. We believe our liquidity position and resilient cash flow from operations comfortably position us to meet our short- and long-term obligations.  
I also want to briefly discuss the $243 million fourth quarter charge related to the Sheraton Grand Chicago put. Shortly after the Starwood deal closed, we granted the hotel owner a onetime right to put the leasehold interest to Marriott in 2022 for $300 million in cash. Given the current environment, we have determined the put is likely to be exercised, so we increased our liability. We have the right to defer the closing on the put until late 2024.  
Moving on to full year 2021, while we won't be giving RevPAR or earnings guidance, I'll provide a bit of color on certain items where we do have some visibility. Starting with the top line. At current RevPAR levels for full year 2021, we expect the sensitivity of a 1 point change in RevPAR compared to 2019 RevPAR on our fees could be between $35 million and $40 million per year.  
Please note that given the nominal level of RevPAR in 2020, the impact of a 1 percentage point change in 2021 RevPAR compared to 2020 RevPAR could be more like $15 million to $20 million.  
As we saw throughout 2020, the relationship is not linear, given the variability of IMS and the inclusion of non-RevPAR-related franchise fees as well. In order for us to start earning IMS in the U.S. and other markets where IMS stand aside to owner priorities, we'll need to see substantial improvement in RevPAR levels. We anticipate that the majority of IMS' in 2021 will again be earned in international markets. We expect our non-RevPAR-related fees to remain resilient and show strong year-over-year growth in 2021.  
We expect G&A to total $775 million to $800 million in 2021. Note that the cash component of G&A will be lower than this range given noncash stock compensation. Interest expense is anticipated to be roughly $430 million for the full year.  
Turning to several other major items that will impact cash flow. Our cash taxes are expected to be $275 million to $300 million for full year 2021. The investment spending, excluding amounts expected to be reimbursed over time, is anticipated to total $375 million to $450 million for the full year. We anticipate another $200 million of investment spending that is expected to be reimbursed over time for total investment spending of $575 million to $650 million as compared to $375 million in 2020.  
Approximately $220 million of the total spending in 2021 is for maintenance, CapEx and our new headquarters. Total investment spending includes capital and technology expenditures, loan advances, contract acquisition costs and other investing activities. We expect cash flows from the loyalty program to be roughly neutral in 2021, even after the reduced payments we will receive from the co-brand credit card companies that effectively repay roughly 1/3 of the $920 million received in 2020.  
In closing, while the timing of a full recovery is unpredictable, we are optimistic that we will see notable progress over the course of this year. We've seen real evidence of the pent-up demand for travel, and we look forward to welcoming more and more guests to our hotels.  
We'll now open the line for questions."

So as it relates to our group business, we are encouraged to see some really positive trends. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks that the -- on end of the fourth quarter of 2020, our group pace for 2021, it was down negative 57%. But the second half of the year was down just 25% to 30%. We're also, on the group front, seeing some positive trends as it relates to group cancels. They've really slowed for the second half of 2021, and they are at normal levels for 2022 plus. 
We're also seeing some great trends on lead volume. While it's certainly behind 2019, it's improving. As a matter of fact, over the last 45 days, lead volume has increased 20 to 30 percentage points. So a significant improvement from what we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2020. 
The other thing I'd note on the group from -- we're starting to see a pickup in what I'd call more normal types of groups. So as an example, we're starting to see some incentive meetings book in the fourth quarter of this year. 
And to your question about rate, yes, January was not only a strong booking month, which was terrific. Actually, the best months we've had in a couple of years, but the rate was up for futures, 11%. And I should note, most of those groups that were booked into the future years at those higher rates were in-house groups versus citywides. We haven't quite seen citywide bookings come back yet. 
So I think that the story on the group front just underscores the point that there will be a return to meetings and group business. It may be slower than we would like but we're seeing the demand. And as you can imagine, Shaun, we're talking to our customers all the time, meeting planners, our top accounts. And they all want to get back out on the road and travel. 
We're also seeing, in China, some quite positive things on the group front. As a matter of fact, the bookings in China, group bookings, were up to 20% of our room nights, again, which was encouraging. China is a great story. It shows that there's pent-up demand for travel. Six weeks after this virus was announced in China, people started booking room nights again, started with leisure. But then quickly towards as the year moved on, moved to both business travel and group. And of course, much of it -- most of it was domestic, but still strong demand. So we're very encouraged as to what we're seeing on the group front."

So I just wanted to mention that. 
So my question is for you, Tony. I was hoping on the gross rooms outlook commentary for this year, if you can go through the composition of the gross rooms. How much of it is conversions? How much of it is new construction? And of the new construction, I guess, how much of it is pre-COVID advantage versus any limited-service new construction that maybe think about it as commencing since March of last year? And then as you think about investment spend for the balance of what's in the pipeline, ex the 2021 gross rooms openings, do you think that accelerates in '22 and beyond relative to what you're spending this year?"

Well, first of all, thank you for your kind sentiments, most appreciated. I think as we think about 2021 openings, obviously, we've indicated in our prepared remarks, an acceleration to about 6% gross openings. And to state the obvious, there's more limited visibility than we've had into the markets pre COVID. But there's a number of factors, I think, that give us some measure of comfort that support our guidance. I think, number one, we've got about 230,000 rooms under construction around the world as we sit here today. You also heard us talk a little bit about the Sunwing all-inclusive project, adding 7,000 rooms. That gives us almost 100 basis points of growth in gross openings in 2021. 
To your point, there were a number of hotels under construction last year that had been targeted for 2020 openings, and they slipped principally because of COVID-related construction delays. And we expect a significant number of those hotels to open in 2021. 
And then I think the last thing I would say is that while it's certainly early days, we're only 10 or 11 weeks into the year, we're seeing some encouraging signs related to accelerating conversions activity. If you look at the fourth quarter of 2020, about 21% of our signings were conversions. And that was the highest percentage contribution from conversions that we had seen since the first quarter of 2019. And so we did go back and take a look at some previous cycles. And in fact, at the last peak, we saw conversions spike all the way up to about 24% of total signings. And I think that's quite encouraging as well. 
The only other thing I would add, Joe, that also gives us some measure of comfort, we've seen from quarter-to-quarter since the pandemic started, a relatively steady level of rooms under construction. And obviously, we've shared that with you in each of the quarterly calls."

But when you think about the kind of classic typical investment either per deal or per average key in a full year, I would say we are not seeing any sort of meaningful increase in the amount of investment that were needed to put into deals. And obviously, when you look at our pipeline, for example, in the U.S., which is 80% limited service, there, typically, the investment is far less. And -- so I think while you would expect that our investment will increase a bit relative to the really low 2020 levels, I would not expect it to see it take kind of meaningful step-up relative to the overall numbers of rooms."

And then I might ask Stephanie to chime in from a demand and a leisure perspective. 
On the transaction side, as we talked about when we launched into the all-inclusive space, it was frustrating for us to see the pace of growth in the all-inclusive space, certainly in CALA, but even in Southeast Asia and some of the Eastern European resort markets, and not to have a platform to compete for those opportunities. Since our launch, the market reaction from the development community has been quite significant. I think one of the things that gives us so much enthusiasm about the Sunwing announcement, beyond the fact that it's great, rapid increase in our footprint, it has accelerated the volume of inquiries we're getting about new opportunities, particularly on the conversion side. And Sunwing is a terrific partner for us. They have been in the all-inclusive space much longer than we have, and we think it is going to be a very symbiotic relationship where we both have a lot to teach each other.

So first of all, on the corporate G&A front, when you look at these levels compared to the 2019 levels, you're looking at a high-teens reduction in comparison. And you do need to remember that both of those numbers include bad debt. And while in the long run, bad debt is a cash cost, it is kind of in the year for the year, often not a cash cost because it's a reserve taken. And again, it's a little bit hard to predict exactly where that will go in '21. And I think you would normally expect in this environment, it might be a little bit higher than normal levels. And certainly in '19, it was not even anything to worry about. But overall, I would say, from a cash perspective, you would see that our cash cost on a G&A front with the $775 million to $800 million is -- that reduction is a bit higher than the high teens sort of number that I've described on the expense line. 
And when I think about it going forward, Stephen, I would say a couple of things. First of all, obviously, I would expect that some will need to be added back as we move forward into a much improved picture for our industry. But I will also say that we undertook some work in 2020 that while extraordinarily painful and difficult, I think was a reflection that we view that it will take some time for the industry to recover. And we really need to put ourselves in a position where we could make these cost savings last a very long time, if not permanently. So while you could see costs go up a bit more than inflation, I think you will see most of these savings be sustainable. 
And similarly, on the hotel front, we've done a lot of work to do things that are both temporary and sustainable on the cost front. We've obviously done some temporary reductions in fixed cost at the hotel level. We've obviously done some, again, really painful work in the way of furloughs, et cetera. But we've also done some really innovative things around how to better staff the hotels, how to better get our work done, how to manage some of the programmatic costs that go to those hotels. And I think those, again, will be sustainable. 
When I think about in '21, what we've tried to do is [Audio Gap] to as much of the margins that we had in '19 as possible. So while I think the hotel margins will obviously suffer from a reduction in revenues compared to '19 at the hotel level. We think we have been able to save the vast majority of that margin decline through the work that we've done. And then obviously, as we move into a much more normal picture, there will be sustainable savings that allow us to get to a profitability point that returns back to where it was much quicker."

And obviously, amongst the select service hotels, quite a few of them are actually cash flow positive. We have arranged payment plans for a large number of our hotels. And when you think about it typically, Smedes, they pay us in 30 days. And to be able to stretch that out over several months is a big help. And we're seeing there, again, overwhelmingly that they are making payments on those payment plans. And while there are obviously -- we need to get back to where there's substantial recovery to get them to a much better spot. 
For the moment, they are hanging in there, and they are able to pay some down and work with us to be able to navigate through this time. But I do agree with you, we are paying incredible attention to our cost on property and working with the owners to try to find ways to do even more. And a whole lot of this depends on what the owner's particular situation is, too, in terms of how well capitalized, what is the debt structure and what kind of market they're in.

And then also in Caribbean and Latin America, where 11% of the hotels are closed. So I would say there can be some true structural reasons why in those markets, government regulations, actually, in some cases, require that the hotels been closed. 
So I think one of the things that we've all learned over the last year is that, in many cases, even down at levels of 10% to 15% occupancy, a hotel can be better off being open than it is closed, from a cash flow perspective. And we've, again, done everything we can. Most of our charges, as you know, are based on revenues. So that floats with the occupancy. 
So I think, in general, we would, as you see things start to pick up a little bit, hopefully, as the vaccinations continue to progress even more, then you will start to see these remaining closed hotels open up."

As I said, we do have 230,000 rooms under construction. But it is interesting, as I talk with our transactors around the world, the good news is we're generally not seeing much in the way of fallout of under construction pipe -- projects from the pipeline. I think if there's going to be an impact, it will likely be further impact on the length of the construction cycle. And so it's a little tough to know what that looks like in '22. I am hopeful that in the next couple of quarters, that visibility will improve a little bit. But I just don't think we've got great visibility beyond '21 at this point."

Yes, we always say, we're overwhelmingly done with the integration. And we're kind of hopeful that this is the last bit. But when we acquired the company, Starwood's management agreements for the Sheraton Grand Chicago and the Westin Times Square included very broad cross-brand territorial, which actually -- when you think about it, meant that for the rest of our 28 brands, we were severely limited in those areas. 
So soon after we did the deal, we entered into a settlement agreement with a hotel owner where basically we granted that owner a onetime right to put the leasehold interest in the hotel to Marriott in 2022 for $300 million in cash. Now it's worth noting that there is a ground lease underneath this hotel. We actually don't have to buy that. If we want to buy that land, we'll have the right to for an additional $200 million, but it is worth noting that there is a ground lease on the hotel as well. But this is for buying the interest in the hotel. 
The other interesting part is that given the current economic conditions, we believe that the put is probable of being exercised. And as a result, we needed to reflect what we think is the current value. And obviously, all these markets are struggling, and that resulted in this charge. 
The other thing that's worth noting is that we actually have the right to not actually close on the put until late 2024. So even though it could get put to us in 2022, we wouldn't necessarily have to buy it until the end of '24. And so it's actually worth noting that also part of the impairment that we had in the contract, the amortization line reflects the fact that, frankly, right now, if you ask us, we would expect that we would defer that purchase until the end of '24 and continue to manage the hotel until the end of '24 to take into consideration the fact that we don't buy it until then. 
The other part that I guess I'll add is that since that agreement was signed, we've actually added 4,000 rooms in the Chicago and New York markets.

Yes, we really are excited about HVMI, primarily as an offering for our Marriott Bonvoy members. We launched that business in 2019 with about 2,000 homes as I mentioned in the prepared remarks. And the reason we launched the business is we were talking to our Marriott Bonvoy members and 8 out of 10 of them said not only -- not that they were just thinking about renting a home, but they actually had done it through another platform. So we knew it was an offering they wanted that we didn't have. And we knew it would be complementary to our core hotel business. 
So we launched the business in 2019. We've grown it to 25,000 homes. There is about a couple of million homes in the segment in which we play in. I think it's really important when we talk about HVMI to make some distinction from other platform. First of all, we only have whole homes. We also -- it's not an open platform like some of the other players. You can't just put a home on there. We only work with professional housing management companies, and we have very, very strict standards about what type of premium and luxury homes we'll allow on the platform, standards around amenities, design aesthetic, service levels, safety, security, et cetera. So we are very strict about which homes get on the platform. 
And one of the most important things about HVMI is you can earn loyalty points and burn loyalty points there. Yes, I mentioned in the prepared remarks that 90% of our bookings are coming from loyalty members. Also 30% of the bookings are redemptions. People redeeming their Marriott Bonvoy points. And we saw the business do well, particularly during last summer because people wanted a whole home. 40% of our HVMI destinations are actually new to Marriott. They're where we don't have hotels, and many of them are in more remote locations, which really was quite attractive during COVID. So we're excited about the offering, and we see it as complementary to our core business and a tremendous value proposition for our Marriott Bonvoy members."

But I think, broadly speaking, looking at our business model and the way we generate cash, that I think the fundamental strategy is still the same, which is grow absolutely the best way we can with really efficient use of capital, resulting in a business model that generates significant excess cash over and above what we need to reinvest in the business.

And our retail rates, we don't really differ between business and leisure. We do have some negotiated volume discounts for corporate accounts. But the key to pricing really is about occupancy rebounding. And right now, that's the challenge. I mean, in terms of ADR, it fell very steeply in April and May of last year. And that was driven by very low occupancies, and we had caregiver rates and the like in our hotels. But the occupancy did tick up throughout the year. Of course, it varies market to market. In general, last year, we saw luxury ADR hold up best with extended stay ADR next. And again, it really does get to compression. I think it will be interesting to watch this recovery. If demand comes back much more quickly than we anticipated, we may be able to grow ADR faster than we did coming out of the last downturn.

The senior leadership team and I have worked together for many years. We are all committed to building on Arne's legacy and advancing the strategy we've put in place to navigate the pandemic, drive towards recovery and grow our business. 
Global RevPAR is currently still substantially below pre-pandemic levels, and certain countries continue to experience concerning levels of COVID cases. Yet more and more people are getting vaccinated every day, and demand is rebounding rapidly in some of our largest regions. Over 95% of our hotels are open globally, and we've seen overall worldwide occupancy improve every month this year. In March, we saw the largest month-over-month sequential increase in global occupancy since the beginning of the pandemic. Occupancy reached over 45% up 9 percentage points from occupancy in February. March Global RevPAR was down 53% compared to March of 2019, 8 percentage points better than February's decline. Global occupancy in April rose again to around 48%. RevPAR for April declined roughly 50% compared to the same month in 2019. 
We remain very encouraged by the strong recovery in Mainland China. While several markets were impacted by strict government-mandated lockdowns in January and February of this year, demand recovered quickly once COVID cases were under control and restrictions were relaxed. Occupancy in March was 66%, almost flat to the same time in 2019. Importantly, despite limited international travel into Mainland China, we saw robust demand from both leisure and business guests in March. Leisure transient room nights were above prepandemic levels for the third quarter in a row. Business transient room nights surpassed pre-pandemic levels in March, up 5% versus March 2019. While group room nights in March still trailed the same month in 2019, demand in this segment stepped up significantly after restrictions on large gatherings were lifted mid-month. 
Seeing these trends in Mainland China running near prepandemic levels gives us confidence in strong full recoveries across all customer segments in other regions as conditions improve. We've seen demand pick up quickly and meaningfully in countries with early and swift vaccine rollouts, like the U.S., the UAE and Qatar and in places where airlift has improved or travel restrictions have been relaxed, like Mexico, Macau and the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
While room nights overall are still heavily weighted to leisure, the resilience of demand is clear. And whether it's from conversations with business leaders, customers, friends or family, we know there is a significant amount of pent-up demand for all types of travel given that so many trips had to be put on hold over the past year. For example, when the EU recently announced that they expect to be open to vaccinated U.S. travelers this summer, our reservation center saw an immediate surge in call volume. 
In the U.S., occupancy has increased swiftly this year with the acceleration of vaccine rollouts. In March, the U.S. and Canada region had the second highest occupancy behind Greater China at 49%. The domestic rebound is still being primarily led by leisure transient demand. Special corporate and group bookings in the U.S. and Canada remain meaningfully below prepandemic levels but are slowly recovering. In March, special corporate bookings for all future stays exceeded February's bookings by 25%, the largest sequential monthly increase in this customer segment since the pandemic began. And special corporate bookings took another nice leg up in April, improving 13% over March. 
Group bookings for the U.S. and Canada also continue to pick up as meeting planners are increasingly optimistic about the recovery and are feeling more confident that they can plan events, especially in 2022 and beyond. At the end of the first quarter, group revenue on the books for 2022 was down less than 15% compared to prepandemic levels as compared to group revenue on the books as of the end of the first quarter of 2019 for 2020. Perhaps more importantly, rates for group room nights booked in the first quarter for 2022 and 2023 are currently 6% and 10%, respectively, above prepandemic levels. demonstrating that we are not trading rate for occupancy. 
Turning to other regions. Demand continues to improve in the Middle East and Africa. March occupancy reached 45% driven primarily by local leisure staycations, sporting events and room blocks for medical personnel related to vaccine rollouts. 
The recoveries across Asia Pacific, excluding China, or APAC, and the Caribbean and Latin America, or CALA, have been more uneven. In APAC, Strong demand in Australia and the Maldives has been offset by rising COVID cases in other countries like India and Japan. In CALA, while many resort properties are enjoying strong demand, especially from U.S. leisure travelers, urban markets remain challenged. In Europe, given rising COVID cases and strict restrictions in many countries, 25% of the region's hotels are currently closed and the recovery has been much more muted. 
Our marketing teams are employing localized and personalized marketing strategies that utilize our direct channels to help capture more leisure as well as leisure travel as the lines between work and home blur. We are especially focused on leveraging our powerful Marriott Bonvoy loyalty program and on enhancing the platform through new expanded collaborations that help make the program even stickier for our 150 million members. 
Interacting with our members who are not yet ready to stay in a hotel has been a priority for us through the pandemic. Our co-branded credit card holders have been particularly engaged, and new cardholder acquisitions are improving as well. Helped by popular spending incentives, first quarter global credit card spending was down just 5% versus the first quarter of 2019. We continue to grow our global co-brand portfolio with the recent introduction of new cards in South Korea and in Mexico, bringing the total number of countries with co-brand cards to 7. The early results from these recent launches have been excellent and are a strong testament to the power of our brands and the Bonvoy platform in markets around the world. 
Another way Bonvoy members have been engaging with us is through the whole home rental platform, Homes & Villas by Marriott International, or HVMI. While HVMI does not have a material impact on our financials, it is complementary to our portfolio of hotel brands. With roughly 30,000 listings, It continues to grow and is a popular way for members to earn and redeem points. 
We also recently announced a new program with Uber, allowing members in the U.S. to earn loyalty points in high-frequency activities like ride-hailing and food delivery. Early engagement for this program has been quite strong. 
The health and safety of our guests and associates is extremely important to us. We first rolled out our elevated cleanliness standards over a year ago. Since then, we've continued to evolve our contactless experience and leveraged technologies such as mobile and web check-in and mobile key to help meet the changing needs of our guests while also driving productivity. We are currently testing contactless arrival kiosks and contactless grab-and-go marketplaces at several select-service properties across the U.S. as part of our efforts to further streamline our operations and enhance the guest experience. 
Over the past year, we've ramped up engagement with our owner and franchisee community through multiple channels of communication. We've worked very hard to help owners lower their costs and maximize hotel operating margins in this low occupancy environment. We continue to work closely to align on priorities as we navigate the recovery together. 
Turning to development. Our pace of signings has picked up and is dramatically better than it was for much of last year. Our conversion activity was particularly strong in the quarter. As we talked about on our last call, In February, we signed a conversion deal in CALA for approximately 7,000 all-inclusive rooms, positioning us to be a top 10 player in the popular and fast-growing all-inclusive space. 
Given our impressive roster of conversion-friendly brands and the meaningful benefits associated with being part of the Marriott system, we expect our momentum around conversions will continue. We added over 23,500 rooms to our system in the first quarter, 60% more than the first quarter of last year. 31% of the rooms added were from conversions, the highest percent in any quarter over the last 6 years. 
Looking ahead to the full year, we still expect gross rooms growth could accelerate to approximately 6% and net rooms growth could be roughly 3% to 3.5%. While we and the industry are still seeing some delays in construction starts, 45% of our industry-leading pipeline of approximately 491,000 rooms is already under construction. Our net rooms growth expectation includes a onetime 100 basis points headwind on from the 88 Service Properties Trust, or SVC hotels, that left our system in the first quarter. We look forward to replacing the mostly limited service first-generation SVC hotels with newer product and are already in active discussions for new deals in nearly 3/4 of the portfolio's markets. 
Before I turn the call over to Leeny to talk about our financials in more detail, I want to say that our hearts are with everyone who have lost colleagues, friends or family because of COVID-19. We have all witnessed the devastation caused by this pandemic and it's hard to see the alarmingly high number of COVID cases in too many countries today. 
I also want to recognize our amazing team of associates around the world who have worked tirelessly through these uncertain times. I couldn't be prouder of their dedication, determination and resilience during this crisis. They have redefined what it means to truly take care of each other and our guests. 
I do believe that Marriott will continue to see improving global trends and that we can all look ahead with real optimism. We are seeing wonderful signs that demand for travel is undeniably resilient. While some regions will recover faster than others, based on the progress we've seen to date, I am confident that it is not a question of if demand will return to pre-COVID levels. It is really only a question of when. Leeny?"

Our gross fee revenues totaled $445 million for the quarter down 29% compared to the year ago quarter. Franchise fees of $306 million declined only 26% year-over-year with our non-RevPAR-related fees proving to be particularly steady. They totaled $141 million in the first quarter, up slightly over the year ago quarter. Credit card branding fees were $81 million, down only 12% year-over-year. And we are also seeing strong performance in our branded residences business where fees were $11 million higher than a year ago. Incentive management fees, or IMFs, were $33 million in the quarter. Around 45% of our IMFs were earned in Asia Pacific, mostly from hotels in Greater China. 
In the first quarter, which has traditionally been the seasonally lowest quarter of the year, adjusted EBITDA was $296 million. G&A improved by 22% versus the first quarter of last year primarily due to $50 million of lower bad debt expense and $14 million of lower guarantee reserves. Expenses in the 2021 first quarter included $14 million of additional nonrecurring executive compensation related to leadership changes. 
As Tony mentioned, we've been working closely with our hotel owners to rightsize costs at our hotels, given their low occupancy levels. We are pleased that we've been able to reduce hotel breakeven occupancy levels significantly. Many of our initiatives to streamline operations and improve productivity, such as more efficient management staffing levels at many of our managed hotels, will remain in place after the pandemic and should help offset wage inflation. Additionally, we are currently assessing post-COVID renovation and brand standards with a view towards finding more ways to improve hotel profitability while preserving the quality and experiences guests expect of our brands when they stay with us. 
While the operating environment has been quite challenging for more than a year, we've been pleased that the vast majority of our hotels continue to pay their bills. We have even seen the number of hotels on payment plans come down meaningfully over the last several months as occupancy has improved. 
Turning to our cash flow. Even in this low RevPAR environment, cash provided by operating activities was $27 million in the quarter. That amount reflects in part the impact of roughly $90 million of reduced cash payments from the co-brand credit card companies. As you may remember, the company received $920 million of cash in May 2020 as part of amendments to our credit card agreements, and we will, therefore, see lower cash payments for the remainder of '21 through '23. If you add back that roughly $90 million and also deduct capital and technology expenditures, loan advances and other investing activities of $39 million in the quarter, the company generated positive cash flows of around $78 million. We've been very pleased with the strength of our cash generation throughout the pandemic. It's a clear reflection of our ability to quickly and effectively adapt our business and a real testament to the power of our asset-light business model. 
At the end of the first quarter, our net liquidity improved to approximately $4.7 billion, representing $600 million in available cash balances plus $4.1 billion of unused borrowing capacity on our revolver. During the quarter, we increased our weighted average debt maturity with a 10-year $1.1 billion bond issuance that has a 2.85% coupon. We also retired $750 million of senior notes. 
As we look ahead to the rest of 2021 assuming continued progress with vaccinations and an improving consumer and macroeconomic environment in many regions around the world, we believe that the pace of the global recovery will continue to accelerate. While trends will vary by region, we expect overall leisure demand will strengthen further into the summer months. In the U.S. and Canada, reservations at our resort hotels are particularly strong. Booked transient room nights for stays 30 days out or more are now over 60% above 2019 levels. And on top of that, rates are almost 20% higher than 2019 level. Occupancy on the books for our resorts in the region is higher relative to the same time in 2019 for every month through the end of the year. We believe transient, business transient and group will continue to slowly improve for now. And then business demand could really accelerate in the fall as more businesses reopen. with business transient returning faster than group given the lead time that generally required for booking group business. 
As we think about the cadence of RevPAR recovery, ADR is also a key factor. It's encouraging to see that where demand has rebounded swiftly, ADR has come back quickly as well. In March, Hainan, the popular resort market in China, achieved occupancy of 79% driving ADR 40% above 2019 levels and resulting in March RevPAR over 1.5x higher than 2019 levels. Here in the U.S., occupancy across our 34 luxury resorts rose to 59% in March, leading to ADR up 26% over March of 2019. Similarly, certain resort properties in Caribbean destinations such as the Ritz-Carlton St. Thomas and the Ritz-Carlton Reserve, Dorado Beach in Puerto Rico saw record first quarter ADR as a result of sudden surges in occupancy. 
While we feel optimistic about the recovery trajectory ahead, there is still too much uncertainty about timing to be able to give specific RevPAR or earnings guidance. But I will again provide color on specific items where we do have some visibility. Starting with the top line. At current RevPAR levels for full year 2021, we expect the sensitivity of a 1-point change in RevPAR versus 2019 RevPAR on our fees could be between $35 million and $40 million per year. Please note that given the nominal level of RevPAR in 2020, the impact of a 1 percentage point change in '21 RevPAR compared to 2020 could be more like $15 million to $20 million. As we have seen, the relationship is not linear given the variability of IMF and the inclusion of non-RevPAR-related franchise fees, 
For us to start earning meaningful levels of IMF in the U.S. and other markets where IMF stand aside to owner priorities, we still need to see significant improvement in RevPAR. We expect our non-RevPAR-related fees to continue to show the impact of improved credit card spending and strong fees from our branded residences. We now expect full year G&A to be at the top end of the range we shared last quarter or roughly $800 million primarily due to the additional nonrecurring executive compensation associated with our recent changes in leadership and higher outside legal fees. This is significantly lower than G&A in 2019, and I'll also note that the cash component of G&A will be meaningfully below this range given noncash stock compensation. Interest expense is still anticipated to be roughly $430 million for the full year. Full year cash taxes are now expected to be $300 million to $325 million. 
Another element related to our company's cash flow is the loyalty program. As leisure demand has accelerated and been particularly strong for our resort properties, we've seen loyalty redemption nights pick up nicely. We expect this trend could continue as our Bonvoy members are excited to travel again. Even if redemptions do increase, given our focus on carefully controlling program administrative costs, we anticipate that full year cash flows from the loyalty program could be positive before factoring in the reduced payment we will receive from the credit card companies. After factoring in these reduced payments, which are expected to effectively repay around 1/3 of the total $920 million we received in 2020, cash flows from loyalty could be modestly negative. 
Our expectation for 2021 investment spending has not changed. Full year investment spending, excluding amounts expected to be reimbursed over time, is anticipated to total $375 million to $450 million for the year. We anticipate another $200 million of investment spending that is expected to be reimbursed over time. This would lead to total investment spending of $575 million to $650 million as compared to $375 million in 2020. As a reminder, approximately $220 million of the total spending in 2021 is for maintenance capital and our new headquarters. Total investment spending includes capital and technology expenditures, loan advances, contract acquisition costs and other investing activities. 
In closing, we are pleased with our progress so far this year and are increasingly confident that the pace of recovery will improve significantly from here. We hear from so many people who are eager to get back on the road, and we look forward to welcoming more and more guests at our hotels. We'll now open the line for questions."

Well, as we've said for a while, the fluidity of the market makes it pretty tough for us to look much beyond the end of 2021.

On the mix of full service versus limited service, maybe I would point to the current pipeline. So if you look at the current pipeline today, interestingly, about 40% of the global pipeline is full service. And even within that 40%, 25% of those full-service rooms are in the luxury tier. And I think that's quite encouraging for us. As you know, the fees coming out of a new luxury hotel can easily be 10x that of a limited service hotel. And so I think we continue to focus certainly on the metric of gross and net rooms because that's an important metric. But as you've heard me, Joe, say for years, looking at the composition of those rooms is every bit as important."

You're right, and this is obviously a pretty fluid situation. So kind of the first part of this is around the dramatic changes that we made last year, which obviously cut down to the very bare bone of what we needed to do at a hotel to manage with extraordinarily low levels of occupancy. But then as you've seen demand pick back up, particularly in the resort hotels, we've obviously added back meaningfully more in the way of services for our guests. But to your point, we've also got the reality that guests also have their own views on what they feel comfortable with as it relates to housekeeping. And so we have made sure that there are choices for them to be able to, for example, in a luxury hotel, continue to have daily housekeeping, while, if they are not comfortable with somebody coming in with their stay, then they can have that, too. 
Our view is that we will continue to be looking at this really with an eye towards occupancy in a variety of markets where we're going to need to be flexible. But I do think by the end of the year, Shaun, that we will have been able to make some decisions as we look forward about how we'll manage this as occupancy really gets back closer to being normal. And in that regard, we do believe that there are some things that we can do to improve the productivity of the hotels. It obviously varies a lot by the tier. What is expected at a select service hotel is very different from a beach luxury hotel. But I do expect as we get into '22 that we will have reestablished where we are on the brand standards. As you know, renovations is also a whole another topic. And there, we've got to make sure that we're taking into consideration the dramatically lower cash reserves that the hotel owners have and picking our spots and making sure that we're picking the renovation work that is critical to the customer experience."

Just as a quick reminder, we've got 66 owned lease hotels, of which 20 are owned. And I think it varies so much depending on what is going on in the occupancies of these various markets. So just to give you a sense, CALA and EMEA are where we've got really the toughest time for occupancy right now for our owned leased hotels. And for that, if you think about the Elegant acquisition where we had Those hotels compared to a year ago in the first quarter, they obviously had a dramatic change in their profitability year-over-year in the first quarter and, similarly, in Europe, But at the same time, I think in the U.S., what we're seeing is with the improved demand situation that those owned lease profits are in better shape. 
So broadly speaking, the other thing to remember is that in the first quarter, we also had $17 million of termination fees, which actually helped your owned lease line. And that tends to be, in a given year, something like $45 million in that ballpark. So I think it, for better for worse, is going to depend very much on what happens in CALA as well as in EMEA to see these owned lease numbers rebound"

But interestingly, What we see is that by the time you get to 2022, we really aren't seeing cancellations there. And frankly, even when you look at the pace between Q3 and Q4, you see a notable difference. 
And when you look at the ADR in the U.S., for example, for system-wide, you're actually looking at ADR from group pace being up versus '19 starting in Q3 of 2021 all the way through '22 and overall revenue being, from a group pace standpoint, 20 points better in Q4 than it is in Q3. So we do believe by the time we get to '22, there is a lot of pent-up demand and that, from all that we hear from our corporate clients and association clients, that people are very anxious to be back in the groups. But whether that feels comfortable exactly in Q3 or exactly in Q4 is where we do sense hesitancy, but that once you get past '21, that there is a full expectation that people will be getting back into doing their group business."

So our revenue management system is designed to be that dynamic, and we've spent a lot -- we've paid a lot of attention to making sure that we adjust it for what has happened to business over the last 1.5 years. And so I think from our perspective, we're very pleased with what we see in terms of rate discipline, the group numbers that we talked to you about, what we've seen on the special corporate side, which is that this year rates stayed essentially flat. 
So it is something that we're paying really close attention to and market by market is -- right? This is very much something that happens depending on exactly what's going on for a particular tier in a particular market. So we are very careful to be looking to make sure that as we see the pickup in demand that we're adjusting for rate extremely quickly."

And we're confident that we're going to get there and hopefully sooner rather than later. 
When we think about capital return, I'll also point out that we have worked hard to extend our weighted average maturities on our debt over the past 1.5 years, which I think does put us in good position to be thinking about capital return once we get our leverage ratios back where we want them to be, I can't predict exactly when that will be. And I think when you ask about the question of will we be keeping them at a different level, I think a lot of this does depend on how we see business coming back and the stability of it.

On the hotel margin side, as you've heard us talk about before, so much of how we hold on to these margins depends on how fast demand comes back because we do believe that there's some work that we've done that will permanently help keep some of this margin improvement. But obviously, depending on how long it takes for demand and ADR to come back, you've obviously got annual wage inflation risks that start to cut against some of the savings that we've come up with. So in that -- from that respect, we do watch really carefully. I'd say roughly 50% of a full service cost structure is related to labor, and we are watching that very carefully as we see demand come back and look at all the things that we've done on the productivity side. But the pace there is very much around how quickly demand comes back. So far, from what we can tell, we do like what we see in terms of the pop-back on rate and feel good about our ability to hold on to some of these savings in a more permanent way. But obviously, wage inflation is something that we see, and frankly, it has typically been the case that when you have inflation on wages, you often also have inflation on ADR, which helps to offset that. On the development side, I'll turn it over to Tony."

The senior leadership team and I have worked together for many years. We are all committed to building on Arne's legacy and advancing the strategy we've put in place to navigate the pandemic, drive towards recovery and grow our business.  
Global RevPAR is currently still substantially below pre-pandemic levels, and certain countries continue to experience concerning levels of COVID cases. Yet more and more people are getting vaccinated every day, and demand is rebounding rapidly in some of our largest regions. Over 95% of our hotels are open globally, and we've seen overall worldwide occupancy improve every month this year. 
In March, we saw the largest month-over-month sequential increase in global occupancy since the beginning of the pandemic. Occupancy reached over 45%, up 9 percentage points from occupancy in February. March Global RevPAR was down 53% compared to March of 2019, 8 percentage points better than February's decline. Global occupancy in April rose again to around 48%. RevPAR for April declined roughly 50% compared to the same month in 2019.  
We remain very encouraged by the strong recovery in Mainland China. While several markets were impacted by strict government-mandated lockdowns in January and February of this year, demand recovered quickly once COVID cases were under control and restrictions were relaxed. Occupancy in March was 66%, almost flat to the same time in 2019. Importantly, despite limited international travel into Mainland China, we saw robust demand from both leisure and business guests in March. Leisure transient room nights were above pre-pandemic levels for the third quarter in a row. Business transient room nights surpassed pre-pandemic levels in March, up 5% versus March 2019. While group room nights in March still trailed the same month in 2019, demand in this segment stepped up significantly after restrictions on large gatherings were lifted mid-month.  
Seeing these trends in Mainland China running near pre-pandemic levels gives us confidence in strong full recoveries across all customer segments in other regions as conditions improve. We've seen demand pick up quickly and meaningfully in countries with early and swift vaccine rollouts, like the U.S., the UAE and Qatar, and in places where airlift has improved or travel restrictions have been relaxed, like Mexico, Macau and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  
While room nights overall are still heavily weighted to leisure, the resilience of demand is clear. And whether it's from conversations with business leaders, customers, friends or family, we know there is a significant amount of pent-up demand for all types of travel given that so many trips had to be put on hold over the past year. For example, when the EU recently announced that they expect to be open to vaccinated U.S. travelers this summer, our reservation center saw an immediate surge in call volume.  
In the U.S., occupancy has increased swiftly this year with the acceleration of vaccine rollouts. In March, the U.S. and Canada region had the second highest occupancy behind Greater China at 49%. The domestic rebound is still being primarily led by leisure transient demand. Special corporate and group bookings in the U.S. and Canada remain meaningfully below pre-pandemic levels but are slowly recovering. In March, special corporate bookings for all future stays exceeded February's bookings by 25%, the largest sequential monthly increase in this customer segment since the pandemic began. And special corporate bookings took another nice leg up in April, improving 13% over March.  
Group bookings for the U.S. and Canada also continue to pick up as meeting planners are increasingly optimistic about the recovery and are feeling more confident that they can plan events, especially in 2022 and beyond. At the end of the first quarter, group revenue on the books for 2022 was down less than 15% compared to pre-pandemic levels as compared to group revenue on the books as of the end of the first quarter of 2019 for 2020. Perhaps more importantly, rates for group room nights booked in the first quarter for 2022 and 2023 are currently 6% and 10%, respectively, above pre-pandemic levels, demonstrating that we are not trading rate for occupancy.  
Turning to other regions. Demand continues to improve in the Middle East and Africa. March occupancy reached 45% driven primarily by local leisure staycations, sporting events and room blocks for medical personnel related to vaccine rollouts.  
The recoveries across Asia Pacific, excluding China, or APAC, and the Caribbean and Latin America, or CALA, have been more uneven. In APAC, strong demand in Australia and the Maldives has been offset by rising COVID cases in other countries like India and Japan. In CALA, while many resort properties are enjoying strong demand, especially from U.S. leisure travelers, urban markets remain challenged.  
In Europe, given rising COVID cases and strict restrictions in many countries, 25% of the region's hotels are currently closed and the recovery has been much more muted.  
Our marketing teams are employing localized and personalized marketing strategies that utilize our direct channels to help capture more leisure as well as bleisure travel as the lines between work and home blur. We are especially focused on leveraging our powerful Marriott Bonvoy loyalty program and on enhancing the platform through new expanded collaborations that help make the program even stickier for our 150 million members.  
Interacting with our members who are not yet ready to stay in a hotel has been a priority for us through the pandemic. Our co-branded credit card holders have been particularly engaged, and new cardholder acquisitions are improving as well. Helped by popular spending incentives, first quarter global credit card spending was down just 5% versus the first quarter of 2019. 
We continued to grow our global co-brand portfolio with the recent introduction of new cards in South Korea and in Mexico, bringing the total number of countries with co-brand cards to 7. The early results from these recent launches have been excellent and are a strong testament to the power of our brands and the Bonvoy platform in markets around the world.  
Another way Bonvoy members have been engaging with us is through the whole home rental platform, Homes & Villas by Marriott International, or HVMI. While HVMI does not have a material impact on our financials, it is complementary to our portfolio of hotel brands. With roughly 30,000 listings, it continues to grow and is a popular way for members to earn and redeem points.  
We also recently announced a new program with Uber, allowing members in the U.S. to earn loyalty points in high-frequency activities like ride-hailing and food delivery. Early engagement for this program has been quite strong.  
The health and safety of our guests and associates is extremely important to us. We first rolled out our elevated cleanliness standards over a year ago. Since then, we've continued to evolve our contactless experience and leveraged technologies such as mobile and web check-in and mobile key to help meet the changing needs of our guests while also driving productivity. We are currently testing contactless arrival kiosks and contactless grab-and-go marketplaces at several select-service properties across the U.S. as part of our efforts to further streamline our operations and enhance the guest experience.  
Over the past year, we've ramped up engagement with our owner and franchisee community through multiple channels of communication. We've worked very hard to help owners lower their costs and maximize hotel operating margins in this low occupancy environment. We continue to work closely to align on priorities as we navigate the recovery together.  
Turning to development. Our pace of signings has picked up and is dramatically better than it was for much of last year. Our conversion activity was particularly strong in the quarter. As we talked about on our last call, In February, we signed a conversion deal in CALA for approximately 7,000 all-inclusive rooms, positioning us to be a top 10 player in the popular and fast-growing all-inclusive space.  
Given our impressive roster of conversion-friendly brands and the meaningful benefits associated with being part of the Marriott system, we expect our momentum around conversions will continue. We added over 23,500 rooms to our system in the first quarter, 60% more than the first quarter of last year. 31% of the rooms added were from conversions, the highest percent in any quarter over the last 6 years.  
Looking ahead to the full year, we still expect gross rooms growth could accelerate to approximately 6%, and net rooms growth could be roughly 3% to 3.5%. While we and the industry are still seeing some delays in construction starts, 45% of our industry-leading pipeline of approximately 491,000 rooms is already under construction. Our net rooms growth expectation includes a onetime 100 basis points headwind on from the 88 Service Properties Trust, or SVC hotels, that left our system in the first quarter. We look forward to replacing the mostly limited service first-generation SVC hotels with newer product and are already in active discussions for new deals in nearly 3/4 of the portfolio's markets.  
Before I turn the call over to Leeny to talk about our financials in more detail, I want to say that our hearts are with everyone who have lost colleagues, friends or family because of COVID-19. We have all witnessed the devastation caused by this pandemic and it's hard to see the alarmingly high number of COVID cases in too many countries today.  
I also want to recognize our amazing team of associates around the world who have worked tirelessly through these uncertain times. I couldn't be prouder of their dedication, determination and resilience during this crisis. They have redefined what it means to truly take care of each other and our guests.  
I do believe that Marriott will continue to see improving global trends and that we can all look ahead with real optimism. We are seeing wonderful signs that demand for travel is undeniably resilient. While some regions will recover faster than others, based on the progress we've seen to date, I am confident that it is not a question of if demand will return to pre-COVID levels, it is really only a question of when. Leeny?"

Our gross fee revenues totaled $445 million for the quarter, down 29% compared to the year ago quarter. Franchise fees of $306 million declined only 26% year-over-year with our non-RevPAR-related fees proving to be particularly steady. They totaled $141 million in the first quarter, up slightly over the year ago quarter. Credit card branding fees were $81 million, down only 12% year-over-year. And we are also seeing strong performance in our branded residences business where fees were $11 million higher than a year ago. Incentive management fees, or IMFs, were $33 million in the quarter. Around 45% of our IMFs were earned in Asia Pacific, mostly from hotels in Greater China.  
In the first quarter, which has traditionally been the seasonally lowest quarter of the year, adjusted EBITDA was $296 million. G&A improved by 22% versus the first quarter of last year primarily due to $50 million of lower bad debt expense and $14 million of lower guarantee reserves. Expenses in the 2021 first quarter included $14 million of additional nonrecurring executive compensation related to leadership changes.  
As Tony mentioned, we've been working closely with our hotel owners to rightsize costs at our hotels, given their low occupancy levels. We are pleased that we've been able to reduce hotel breakeven occupancy levels significantly. Many of our initiatives to streamline operations and improve productivity, such as more efficient management staffing levels at many of our managed hotels, will remain in place after the pandemic and should help offset wage inflation. Additionally, we are currently assessing post-COVID renovation and brand standards with a view towards finding more ways to improve hotel profitability while preserving the quality and experiences guests expect of our brands when they stay with us.  
While the operating environment has been quite challenging for more than a year, we've been pleased that the vast majority of our hotels continue to pay their bills. We have even seen the number of hotels on payment plans come down meaningfully over the last several months as occupancy has improved.  
Turning to our cash flow. Even in this low RevPAR environment, cash provided by operating activities was $27 million in the quarter. That amount reflects in part the impact of roughly $90 million of reduced cash payments from the co-brand credit card companies. As you may remember, the company received $920 million of cash in May 2020 as part of amendments to our credit card agreements, and we will, therefore, see lower cash payments for the remainder of '21 through '23. If you add back that roughly $90 million and also deduct capital and technology expenditures, loan advances and other investing activities of $39 million in the quarter, the company generated positive cash flows of around $78 million. 
We've been very pleased with the strength of our cash generation throughout the pandemic. It's a clear reflection of our ability to quickly and effectively adapt our business and a real testament to the power of our asset-light business model.  
At the end of the first quarter, our net liquidity improved to approximately $4.7 billion, representing $600 million in available cash balances plus $4.1 billion of unused borrowing capacity on our revolver. During the quarter, we increased our weighted average debt maturity with a 10-year $1.1 billion bond issuance that has a 2.85% coupon, and we also retired $750 million of senior notes.  
As we look ahead to the rest of 2021, assuming continued progress with vaccinations and an improving consumer and macroeconomic environment in many regions around the world, we believe that the pace of the global recovery will continue to accelerate. While trends will vary by region, we expect overall leisure demand will strengthen further into the summer months. 
In the U.S. and Canada, reservations at our resort hotels are particularly strong. Booked transient room nights for stays 30 days out or more are now over 60% above 2019 levels. And on top of that, rates are almost 20% higher than 2019 level. Occupancy on the books for our resorts in the region is higher relative to the same time in 2019 for every month through the end of the year. We believe transient, business transient and group will continue to slowly improve for now. 
And then business demand could really accelerate in the fall as more businesses reopen, with business transient returning faster than group given the lead time that generally required for booking group business.  
As we think about the cadence of RevPAR recovery, ADR is also a key factor. It's encouraging to see that where demand has rebounded swiftly, ADR has come back quickly as well. In March, Hainan, the popular resort market in China, achieved occupancy of 79%, driving ADR 40% above 2019 levels and resulting in March RevPAR over 1.5x higher than 2019 levels. 
Here in the U.S., occupancy across our 34 luxury resorts rose to 59% in March, leading to ADR up 26% over March of 2019. Similarly, certain resort properties in Caribbean destinations such as the Ritz-Carlton St. Thomas and the Ritz-Carlton Reserve, Dorado Beach in Puerto Rico saw record first quarter ADR as a result of sudden surges in occupancy.  
While we feel optimistic about the recovery trajectory ahead, there is still too much uncertainty about timing to be able to give specific RevPAR or earnings guidance. But I will again provide color on specific items where we do have some visibility. 
Starting with the top line. At current RevPAR levels for full year 2021, we expect the sensitivity of a 1 point change in RevPAR versus 2019 RevPAR on our fees could be between $35 million and $40 million per year. Please note that given the nominal level of RevPAR in 2020, the impact of a 1 percentage point change in '21 RevPAR compared to 2020 could be more like $15 million to $20 million. As we have seen, the relationship is not linear given the variability of IMF and the inclusion of non-RevPAR-related franchise fees. 
For us to start earning meaningful levels of IMF in the U.S. and other markets where IMF stand aside to owner priorities, we still need to see significant improvement in RevPAR. We expect our non-RevPAR-related fees to continue to show the impact of improved credit card spending and strong fees from our branded residences. We now expect full year G&A to be at the top end of the range we shared last quarter or roughly $800 million primarily due to the additional nonrecurring executive compensation associated with our recent changes in leadership and higher outside legal fees. This is significantly lower than G&A in 2019, and I'll also note that the cash component of G&A will be meaningfully below this range given noncash stock compensation.  
Interest expense is still anticipated to be roughly $430 million for the full year. Full year cash taxes are now expected to be $300 million to $325 million.  
Another element related to our company's cash flow is the loyalty program. As leisure demand has accelerated and been particularly strong for our resort properties, we've seen loyalty redemption nights pick up nicely. We expect this trend could continue as our Bonvoy members are excited to travel again. Even if redemptions do increase, given our focus on carefully controlling program administrative costs, we anticipate that full year cash flows from the loyalty program could be positive before factoring in the reduced payment we will receive from the credit card companies. After factoring in these reduced payments, which are expected to effectively repay around 1/3 of the total $920 million we received in 2020, cash flows from loyalty could be modestly negative.  
Our expectation for 2021 investment spending has not changed. Full year investment spending, excluding amounts expected to be reimbursed over time, is anticipated to total $375 million to $450 million for the year. We anticipate another $200 million of investment spending that is expected to be reimbursed over time. This would lead to total investment spending of $575 million to $650 million as compared to $375 million in 2020. 
As a reminder, approximately $220 million of the total spending in 2021 is for maintenance capital and our new headquarters. Total investment spending includes capital and technology expenditures, loan advances, contract acquisition costs and other investing activities.  
In closing, we are pleased with our progress so far this year and are increasingly confident that the pace of recovery will improve significantly from here. We hear from so many people who are eager to get back on the road, and we look forward to welcoming more and more guests at our hotels. 
We'll now open the line for questions."

Well, as we've said for a while, the fluidity of the markets makes it pretty tough for us to look much beyond the end of 2021. We continue to feel confident in the forecast we've given you for 6% gross rooms growth through the end of 2021 and 3% to 3.5% net rooms growth, 4% to 4.5% if you back out the onetime headwind from SVC. 
On the mix of full service versus limited service, maybe I would point to the current pipeline. So if you look at the current pipeline today, interestingly, about 40% of the global pipeline is full service. And even within that 40%, 25% of those full-service rooms are in the luxury tier. And I think that's quite encouraging for us. As you know, the fees coming out of a new luxury hotel can easily be 10x that of a limited service hotel. And so I think we continue to focus certainly on the metric of gross and net rooms because that's an important metric. But as you've heard me, Joe, say for years, looking at the composition of those rooms is every bit as important."

You're right, and this is obviously a pretty fluid situation.

You're right, and this is obviously a pretty fluid situation. 
So kind of the first part of this is around the dramatic changes that we made last year, which, obviously, cut down to the very bare bone of what we needed to do at a hotel to manage with extraordinarily low levels of occupancy. But then as you've seen demand pick back up, particularly in the resort hotels, we've obviously added back meaningfully more in the way of services for our guests. 
But to your point, we've also got the reality that guests also have their own views on what they feel comfortable with as it relates to housekeeping. And so we have made sure that there are choices for them to be able to, for example, in a luxury hotel, continue to have daily housekeeping, while, if they are not comfortable with somebody coming in with their stay, then they can have that, too. 
Our view is that we will continue to be looking at this really with an eye towards occupancy in a variety of markets where we're going to need to be flexible. But I do think by the end of the year, Shaun, that we will have been able to make some decisions as we look forward about how we'll manage this as occupancy really gets back closer to being normal. And in that regard, we do believe that there are some things that we can do to improve the productivity of the hotels. It obviously varies a lot by the tier. What is expected at a select service hotel is very different from a beach luxury hotel. But I do expect as we get into '22 that we will have reestablished where we are on the brand standards. 
As you know, renovations is also a whole another topic. And there, we've got to make sure that we're taking into consideration the dramatically lower cash reserves that the hotel owners have and picking our spots and making sure that we're picking the renovation work that is critical to the customer experience."

Just as a quick reminder, we've got 66 owned, leased hotels, of which, 20 are owned. And I think it varies so much depending on what is going on in the occupancies of these various markets. 
So just to give you a sense, CALA and EMEA are where we've got really the toughest time for occupancy right now for our owned, leased hotels. And for that, if you think about the Elegant acquisition where we had those hotels compared to a year ago in the first quarter, they obviously had a dramatic change in their profitability year-over-year in the first quarter and similarly in Europe. But at the same time, I think in the U.S., what we're seeing is with the improved demand situation that those owned, leased profits are in better shape. 
So broadly speaking, the other thing to remember is that in the first quarter, we also had $17 million of termination fees, which actually helped your owned, leased line. And that tends to be, in a given year, something like $45 million, in that ballpark. So I think it, for better for worse, is going to depend very much on what happens in CALA as well as in EMEA to see these owned lease numbers rebound."

So I think -- again, I think for all of us, we are all seeing that the comfort people have around travel is now moving in the right direction but there is still uncertainty.

So I think -- again, I think for all of us, we are all seeing that the comfort people have around travel is now moving in the right direction but there is still uncertainty. And as you've got different vaccination rates in different part of the world, and even within the U.S. -- at different rates in the U.S., there is still some concern around getting everyone together in a large group. But interestingly, what we see is that by the time you get to 2022, we really aren't seeing cancellations there. And frankly, even when you look at the pace between Q3 and Q4, you see a notable difference. 
And when you look at the ADR in the U.S., for example, for system-wide, you're actually looking at ADR from group pace being up versus '19 starting in Q3 of 2021 all the way through '22 and overall revenue being, from a group pace standpoint, 20 points better in Q4 than it is in Q3. 
So we do believe by the time we get to '22, there is a lot of pent-up demand and that, from all that we hear from our corporate clients and association clients, that people are very anxious to be back in the groups. But whether that feels comfortable exactly in Q3 or exactly in Q4 is where we do sense hesitancy, but that once you get past '21, that there is a full expectation that people will be getting back into doing their group business."

I guess I think the first thing is to look at where we did talk about some of our March numbers, which was when you saw that occupancy rebound dramatically, you also saw a rate respond extremely well and very dynamically. 
So our revenue management system is designed to be that dynamic, and we've spent a lot -- we've paid a lot of attention to making sure that we adjust it for what has happened to business over the last 1.5 years. And so I think from our perspective, we're very pleased with what we see in terms of rate discipline, the group numbers that we talked to you about, what we've seen on the special corporate side, which is that this year, rates stayed essentially flat. 
So it is something that we're paying really close attention to and market by market is -- right? This is very much something that happens depending on exactly what's going on for a particular tier in a particular market. So we are very careful to be looking to make sure that as we see the pickup in demand that we're adjusting for rate extremely quickly."

And we're confident that we're going to get there and hopefully sooner rather than later. 
When we think about capital return, I'll also point out that we have worked hard to extend our weighted average maturities on our debt over the past 1.5 years, which I think does put us in good position to be thinking about capital return once we get our leverage ratios back where we want them to be. I can't predict exactly when that will be. And I think when you ask about the question of will we be keeping them at a different level, I think a lot of this does depend on how we see business coming back and the stability of it.

On the hotel margin side, as you've heard us talk about before, so much of how we hold on to these margins depends on how fast demand comes back. Because we do believe that there's some work that we've done that will permanently help keep some of this margin improvement. But obviously, depending on how long it takes for demand and ADR to come back, you've obviously got annual wage inflation risks that start to cut against some of the savings that we've come up with. So in that -- from that respect, we do watch really carefully. 
I'd say roughly 50% of a full service cost structure is related to labor, and we are watching that very carefully as we see demand come back and look at all the things that we've done on the productivity side. But the pace there is very much around how quickly demand comes back. 
So far, from what we can tell, we do like what we see in terms of the pop-back on rate and feel good about our ability to hold on to some of these savings in a more permanent way. But obviously, wage inflation is something that we see, and frankly, it has typically been the case that when you have inflation on wages, you often also have inflation on ADR, which helps to offset that.

I am very pleased with our second quarter results and the accelerating pace of the global recovery. The tremendous overall improvement we saw in both occupancy and rate in the quarter demonstrate a basic premise, people love to travel and to stay at our hotels.
Demand grew steadily throughout the second quarter. Worldwide occupancy gained 6 percentage points in the month of June compared to May and topped 55%. Average daily rate in June was down only 13% from June 2 years ago. As a result, global RevPAR has risen meaningfully and swiftly from the depths of the pandemic when RevPAR was down 90% to down just 38% in June compared to the same month in 2019. 
Recovery time lines vary by region, given uneven vaccination trends, virus caseloads and travel restrictions, yet we remain encouraged by the incredible resilience of travel demand, demonstrated by the rapid return of guests in areas where rules have been eased and people feel they can travel safely. This can be seen most keenly in Mainland China, the first major market where RevPAR has recovered to prepandemic levels. RevPAR in the second quarter was driven by very strong demand, resulting in ADR exceeding 2019 levels. Occupancy reached 71% in April and 68% in May before dipping to roughly 60% in June due to small COVID outbreaks and strict lockdowns in certain markets. Demand recovered quickly once the restrictions were lifted, as we've seen throughout the last year. July RevPAR is again expected to exceed 2019 levels.
Perhaps most encouragingly, in April, for the first time since the pandemic began, leisure transient, business transient and group room nights in Mainland China were all ahead of 2019 levels. This is especially impressive given the absence of international arrivals due to stringent border restrictions. 
The U.S. and Canada accounts for roughly 2/3 of our rooms. And in this region, lodging demand grew impressively during the quarter, led by increasingly strong leisure demand as the number of vaccinated people continued to rise. U.S. leisure room nights in the second quarter were 15% higher than in the second quarter of 2019. And we are seeing more blending of trip purpose with the more flexible work from home or anywhere trend.
Total U.S. occupancy reached over 63% in June, with ADR down just 11% versus June of 2019. Our strong momentum has continued into the first 3.5 weeks of July, with U.S. occupancy reaching 67% and ADR down only 2% compared to July of '19. July RevPAR for this period was down around 16% versus July of 2019. The U.S. is also seeing increasing signs of recovery in both special corporate and group demand. While special corporate booking levels in the first 3.5 weeks of July are still down around 45% compared to the same period in '19, we are optimistic that we've turned a corner.
U.S. special corporate bookings rose 23% in June over May and then rose another 27% in the first 3.5 weeks of July as compared to the first 3.5 weeks of June, with improvement widespread across industries and lengthening booking windows. Many of our corporate customers are telling us they are beginning to get back on the road this summer, and we expect to see a step-up in business travel post Labor Day as children go back to in-person learning and workers increasingly return to the office.
Group bookings in the U.S. have also gained momentum. U.S. group bookings made for all future dates were down 29% in June compared to those made in June of '19, a large improvement from down 56% in March of '21 versus March of '19. And for the first time since the pandemic started, group bookings made in the month of June or any time in 2021 exceeded in-the-year bookings made in the same month of 2019. At the end of the second quarter, group revenue pace versus '19 was down 31% for the fourth quarter of this year, improving to down 21% for the first quarter of '22 and then down 12% for the second quarter of '22. However, it's still early, and we expect bookings made closer to the event date will increase group revenue on the books for these time periods. Most importantly, our sales team is holding on to average daily rate. ADR for group bookings is almost flat for the fourth quarter and 3% higher for full year 2022 compared to the same periods in 2019. 
In other regions of the world, demand in the second quarter improved over the first quarter in the Middle East and Africa, in the Caribbean and Latin America and in Europe. Middle East, Africa is benefiting from relatively high vaccination rates in many countries in the Middle East. Occupancy strengthened to 47% in June, largely driven by staycations in the UAE and quarantine business. Occupancy in Caribbean and Latin America improved meaningfully during the quarter, rising to 45% in June. While urban destinations continue to struggle, given slow vaccination rates and high COVID case counts, many of our resort properties in the Caribbean and Mexico are flourishing as they benefit from easing international travel restrictions and their close proximity to the U.S.
Europe's recovery is still lagging given its heavy reliance on international guests, slower border reopenings and shifting restrictions that change on short notice. Yet, with the EU easing many travel restrictions beginning in May and an increasing number of hotels reopening, occupancy doubled in just 3 months, reaching 31% in June.
The recovery in Asia Pacific, excluding China, stalled in the second quarter as countries such as Japan, India, South Korea and Australia imposed strict lockdowns in response to sharp rises in delta variant cases and low vaccination rates. Encouragingly, the recovery is now picking up steam again as caseloads in some countries like India have started to decline.
Shifting to the development front. Our pipeline stood at nearly 478,000 rooms at the end of the second quarter. Openings were strong, with nearly 25,000 rooms added to our system during the quarter. And deal signings were also healthy. Additionally, less than 2% of rooms fell out of the pipeline, one of the lowest levels we've seen in the last 3 years. We are very pleased with our momentum around conversions as well. Conversions accounted for 26% of rooms added in the first half of this year and have been a meaningful contributor to signings. We continue to have the largest pipeline of global rooms under construction.
We are also seeing great momentum around our branded residential business, with a record 18 residential properties expected to open during the year. For the full year, we expect that gross rooms growth will accelerate to approximately 6%. And with more visibility into anticipated full year deletions, we now expect 2021 net rooms growth to be towards the higher end of our previous expectation of 3% to 3.5%. As a reminder, this estimate includes the 100 basis point headwind from the 88 Service Properties Trust hotels that left our system earlier this year. We are pleased with the continued progress on replacing those hotels with new products. We are now in conversations for 80% of those locations, with signed or approved deals for nearly 20%.
We continue to enhance and expand Marriott Bonvoy into an immersive travel platform that includes multiple products and offerings that enable us to provide value to our members beyond hotel stays. The program grew to over 153 million members at the end of the quarter. 
Homes & Villas by Marriott International, or HVMI, which currently has around 35,000 whole-home listings, has been an attractive offering and tool for engaging with members throughout the pandemic. With nearly 40% of listings in markets where we don't have distribution, HVMI is expanding the number of destination options for our guests. Over 90% of HVMI room nights in the quarter were booked by Bonvoy members.
Our co-branded credit card holders were very active in the second quarter, with global card spending surpassing the same period in 2019. Global card acquisitions were also strong, reaching 2019 levels. Our recent credit card launches in South Korea and Mexico have seen strong initial interest from consumers in those markets. The South Korean card issuer, Shinhan Financial Group, touted the launch of our card as one of the most successful premium card launches they have ever had. Our total co-brand credit card fees in the second quarter surpassed those in the same quarter of 2019 for the first time since the pandemic began.
We've also been very pleased with our successful Uber collaboration in the U.S. The number of members linking their accounts to date has far exceeded our expectations. Activated accounts were already averaging 6 transactions in just the first 10 weeks, demonstrating our ability to drive real engagement with our Marriott Bonvoy members beyond the hotel stay.
We're always working on innovative ways to enhance our guests' full travel experience. Just last week, we became the first major hotel company to provide U.S.-based customers with the opportunity to purchase travel insurance. Guests can now buy travel insurance when they make a reservation through Marriott's website or mobile app by linking to approved products sold by Alliance partners. As part of this distribution agreement, Marriott will earn commissions from Alliance.
In another effort to connect with Bonvoy members beyond the hotel stay, we are piloting a program that allows members to earn and redeem points at food and beverage outlets in select hotels, even if the member is not staying in the hotel. The program is currently in over 200 outlets in Asia Pacific and the Middle East, with expansion to over 500 outlets expected by the end of the year.
We also remain keenly focused on engaging with another key constituency, our owner and franchisee community. We have worked closely with them throughout the pandemic to help lower costs significantly. With some meaningful improvement in demand, profitability for many hotel owners accelerated in the second quarter. As the recovery continues, we are aligning with our owners and franchisees to balance 2 important goals as we think about our path forward: maximizing hotel-level cash flow and driving great guest experiences, as Leeny will discuss in more detail.
We are also working to address the labor challenges we are seeing, mainly in the U.S. in markets such as Southern Florida, Texas and Arizona, where demand has rebounded quickly. To that end, we are increasing our social and targeted marketing of Marriott as a best employer with career advancement opportunities as well as holding job fairs to reach qualified candidates. Hiring tools, including onetime sign-on bonuses and temporary incentives, sometimes in combination with base salary adjustments in select markets, are also being successfully employed.
Before I turn the call over to Leeny, I want to thank our amazing team of associates around the world. I have spent time in Los Angeles, Miami and New York over the last couple of weeks as I've been getting back on the road again. It has been wonderful to visit our hotels and to meet with so many of our associates and see firsthand their passion and resilience.
These have been challenging times, but we are looking forward with optimism. While the time line is uncertain, I am confident that our business will fully recover and continue to grow from there. Leeny?"
31148,1674961130,2360455,"Marriott International, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2021",2021-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Marriott International, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tony.

Our second quarter results reflected the strong pace of the global recovery and the incredible resilience of our business model. Worldwide occupancy came in at 51%, a significant increase of 13 percentage points over the first quarter of this year. We also saw a meaningful improvement in our average daily rate decline versus pre-pandemic levels, with ADR down 17% in the quarter compared to the second quarter of 2019.
We are optimistic that rate recovery will occur faster than in prior downturns, when ADR gains lagged occupancy gains. It's been very encouraging to see that in Mainland China ADR has come back in tandem with demand. Elsewhere, ADR has also been particularly strong in areas where occupancy has rebounded quickly. In Aruba, Puerto Rico and Mexico, over half of our 28 luxury and upper upscale comparable resorts saw record high ADRs for the month of June.
In the rest of the U.S., robust demand across our 34 comparable luxury resorts drove ADR for those hotels, up more than 40% above June 2019 levels. Demand in Greece rose quickly after travel restrictions were eased in April, leading to a 20% premium in ADR for the quarter versus the same period in 2019.
Global RevPAR declined 44% compared to the second quarter of 2019, a more than 15 percentage point improvement compared to the first quarter RevPAR decline versus the 2019 first quarter. We recorded gross fee revenues of $642 million in the second quarter. Our non-RevPAR-related fees again proved to be quite resilient. Totaling $160 million in the second quarter, these fees have now fully recovered to second quarter of 2019 levels.
Our residential branding fees were strong again this quarter at $14 million. Incentive management fees, or IMF, totaled $55 million in the quarter. Almost half of our IMFs were earned in Asia Pacific, mostly from hotels in Mainland China. Around 30% of our IMFs were earned in the U.S. and Canada region, with a number of U.S. luxury hotels generating more incentive fees than in the second quarter of 2019.
Second quarter G&A and other expense was 18% lower than in the second quarter of 2019, primarily as a result of our significant restructuring activities undertaken last year. We had a tax benefit of $41 million in the quarter due to releasing $118 million of reserves related to the favorable resolution of pre-acquisition Starwood tax audit. We continue to believe that going forward our core tax rate will be around 22% to -- 22% to 24%, absent any legislative changes to corporate tax rate. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was $558 million, which included $22 million of German government support for certain of our leased and joint venture hotels.
I also want to highlight the sale of the St. Regis in the quarter, a joint venture in which we held a minority interest. It's encouraging to see transactions like this occurring, and we expect to receive a total of at least $36 million in after-tax cash proceeds from the sale. We will continue to operate the hotel under a long-term management agreement.
At the hotel level, our numerous cost reduction and productivity enhancement efforts have significantly lowered breakeven occupancy levels around the world, even further than we anticipated when the pandemic got underway. As a result of these efforts as well as the strong recovery progress, the financial condition of many of our owners and franchisees continues to strengthen, as does our accounts receivable collections performance.
Over 95% of our managed comp hotels in Mainland China had positive gross operating profit, or GOP, in the second quarter. Our GOP margin for managed comp hotels in this region expanded over 200 basis points versus margins in the second quarter of 2019. The strong margin expansion exemplifies the beneficial impact of our recent cost reduction and productivity enhancement efforts, given operations have fully come back in Mainland China with the recovery and demand.
These results also reflect our strong top line performance, driven by meaningful share gains in the region, thanks to our strong distribution, especially in the valuable luxury space, our popular brands and our powerful loyalty platform. In the U.S., the number of managed hotels with positive GOP improved significantly in the quarter as demand increased. Approximately 90% reported positive GOP in the second quarter, up from about 60% just 1 quarter ago. As occupancies increase, we are working closely with our hotel owners around the world to balance maximizing hotel profitability while also driving guest satisfaction. We're being thoughtful about how and whether to bring back costs, programs and amenities that were reduced or eliminated as we navigated the depth of the pandemic.
For example, we've already reinstated accountability for our intent to recommend scores with accountable brand standard audits resuming next year. We also introduced a new set of renovation rules, which will allow for additional deferrals of some renovations as well as reduced scopes for certain properties. We're considering how best to evolve housekeeping brand standards across each of our hotel brand tiers while ensuring guest expectations are met. We do believe that once business has fully recovered and operations are fully backed, there will be permanent areas of margin improvement, primarily related to our productivity enhancements and the increased use of contactless technologies such as mobile check-in and mobile key.
As we look ahead to the rest of the year, while we are keeping a close eye on variant strains, we're optimistic about the continued global recovery. Our momentum has continued into July, and we expect an uptick in business travel this fall. We expect that when improved ease of international travel occurs that will also fuel further recovery in lodging demand.
While there's still too much uncertainty to be able to give specific RevPAR or earnings guidance, I'd like to provide color on specific items where we do have some visibility. Starting with the top line, at current RevPAR levels, we still expect the sensitivity of a 1-point change in full year 2021 RevPAR versus 2019 to be $35 million to $40 million of fees. As we've seen, the relationship is not linear given the variability of IMF. We expect our non-RevPAR-related fees to continue to benefit from strong co-brand credit card fees and robust fees from our branded resident sales. We still expect full year G&A to be roughly $800 million, significantly lower than in 2019. And interest expense is still anticipated to be around $430 million. Full year cash taxes are now expected to be $325 million to $350 million.
A key component of cash flow is the loyalty program. With the acceleration of leisure demand, we've continued to see redemption nights pick up nicely, especially in our resort destination. We remain focused on carefully controlling Bonvoy program administrative costs, and we still anticipate that full year cash flows from the loyalty program could be positive before factoring in the reduced payments we will receive from the credit card companies. After factoring in these reduced payments, which are expected to effectively repay around 1/3 of the total $920 million we received in 2020, we continue to expect that cash flows from loyalty overall could be modestly negative.
With better visibility and our continued disciplined approach to investment spending, we're lowering the top end of our full year investment spending expectation and narrowing the range to $575 million to $625 million. Total investment spending includes capital and technology expenditures, loan advances, contract acquisition costs and other investing activities.
We're focused on bringing our credit statistics back in line with our historically strong investment-grade levels. Our leverage ratios continue to improve as Marriott's asset-light business model is showing its resilient cash flow characteristics. We expect continued improvements in cash flow generation as the recovery progresses.
I also want to add my appreciation for our incredible team of global associates who have worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic. They truly exemplify the Marriott spirit to serve and take care culture. In closing, we could not be more pleased with our progress in the quarter, and we look forward to the continued return of guests to our 7,800 hotels around the world. 
We're happy to take your questions."

And I'll say a couple of things. I think one of the things that is the most consistent in Greater China and the U.S. is the reality that the overwhelming percentage of travelers that stay at our hotels in those 2 regions are domestic. And so we're seeing -- obviously, you're seeing some of the same trends in the U.S. that we saw earlier in Mainland China, which is that when people feel comfortable to travel, the demand picks up really, really quickly, albeit with leisure being the strongest. And clearly, that is quite helpful for the hotel's occupancy levels because they're not traveling outside their country. But I will say that I think the trends have been remarkably similar in terms of the pace of ADR recovery at the same time.
And I think the other thing that I'll point out that is interesting is that in Mainland China you do see markets, when they do have a pop in some COVID cases, they do shut down demand very quickly because the cities are closed down. We haven't obviously seen that same impact in the U.S. because the population is more varied in terms of kind of the travel and the way cities are shut down or not shut down. So in that regard, it's perhaps been a little bit more fluid in the U.S. But we have seen really terrific similarities in these markets where the occupancy is so much based on domestic travel.
I think the other thing I'll point out is that the F&B recovery in Greater China, I think, does point out the real strength of our hotel brands there. And that, I think, has been really impressive as well."

So a couple of things. First of all, I was speaking about Mainland China. And there, I think the interesting thing is that, with RevPAR back to essentially similar levels in 2019, we are producing GOP margins that are 200 basis points better. So I think that shows you some of the work that we've been able to do on the cost-management side and productivity enhancement side that, that would tell you that those are kind of good margins to think about going forward.
I think in the U.S., Robin, the interesting thing here is that we've got a lot of those similar productivity and cost enhancements that we've done here, which would lead you to some similar sort of conclusions. I think the thing you have to think about is how quickly do labor costs and benefit cost increase.
So as we talked about before, if ADR recovers really quickly, and you've got these productivity and cost enhancements in place, you've probably got a similar opportunity in the U.S. for those similar kinds of numbers that we talked about in Mainland China. But again, a lot of this depends on how quickly it all comes back in the U.S. and also what's going on with wage rates and benefit costs."

Some of our guests that are dipping their toes back into travel are still a bit hesitant about having housekeepers in the room, and they appreciate the choice of housekeeping at their discretion. Others are vaccinated and feeling encouraged about the safety of travel, and they would prefer a more conventional housekeeping solution.

But the biggest chunk of them that make up, again when you think about it going back to 2019, call it, $579 million. The biggest chunk is obviously the credit card. And that is going to overwhelmingly relate to both the number of cardholders and the amount they spend on their co-brand cards.
And as we talked about today, their spending has actually gone back to 2019 levels, and you saw the similar thing happened to our co-brand fees. So I think both the power of Bonvoy, combined with kind of general level of consumer spend and health of the economy, particularly obviously the U.S. since these fees are overwhelmingly driven by the U.S. cardholders, is how you should think about that. I think you're going to continue to see outsized growth in our residential branding fees, although they are obviously meaningfully smaller. But timeshare fees is much more of a stable number because, as you know, those are overwhelmingly fixed. So I think the biggest driver is really how you think about consumer credit card spend on our co-brand cards."

I think the data that is perhaps most telling from our perspective is some of the statistics we shared with you on special corporate bookings. As we mentioned, those bookings rose 23% in June as we compare to May. And then again, it's just the first 3.5 weeks of July, but we saw another 27% increase in those first 3.5 weeks of July versus the same 3.5 weeks in June. And so the magnitude and the steadiness of the growth in special corporate bookings, I think, is quite encouraging.
And then you've heard us talk about this before. This blending of trip purpose continues to be a real and measurable phenomenon. And we think it's good for our business, and we think it will continue well beyond the end of the pandemic. With all that said, we will continue to be vigilant as we watch the pace of vaccinations around the world, the effectiveness of those vaccinations relative to the delta variant and monitor the impacts of that on our business."

There's still a wide swath across all the big segments of group business for 2022.
The other thing to point out is that we still are in a position where the room nights are -- the current pace for group is still down for '22. It's just down a lot less than it used to be. And that it also -- we're seeing strong rate, where rate is actually up compared to '19.

And then on your third question, I'm not sure I necessarily agree with that for the simple reason that what's driving margin, certainly, there's the cost side, but there is the top line piece as well. And while it's a single data point, we saw over 4th of July weekend U.S. resort ADR up about 10%. But if you carve out just the luxury tier -- Jackie has to keep me honest here -- but I think we were up close to 35% in ADR.

I am very pleased with our second quarter results and the accelerating pace of the global recovery. The tremendous overall improvement we saw in both occupancy and rate in the quarter demonstrate a basic prem",1901,"Thank you, Jackie, and good morning, everyone. I am very pleased with our second quarter results and the accelerating pace of the global recovery. The tremendous overall improvement we saw in both occupancy and rate in the quarter demonstrate a basic premise, people love to travel and to stay at our hotels.
Demand grew steadily throughout the second quarter. Worldwide occupancy gained 6 percentage points in the month of June compared to May and topped 55%. Average daily rate in June was down only 13% from June 2 years ago. As a result, global RevPAR has risen meaningfully and swiftly from the depths of the pandemic when RevPAR was down 90% to down just 38% in June compared to the same month in 2019. 
Recovery time lines vary by region, given uneven vaccination trends, virus caseloads and travel restrictions, yet we remain encouraged by the incredible resilience of travel demand, demonstrated by the rapid return of guests in areas where rules have been eased and people feel they can travel safely. This can be seen most keenly in Mainland China, the first major market where RevPAR has recovered to pre-pandemic levels. RevPAR in the second quarter was driven by very strong demand, resulting in ADR exceeding 2019 levels. Occupancy reached 71% in April and 68% in May before dipping to roughly 60% in June due to small COVID outbreaks and strict lockdowns in certain markets. Demand recovered quickly once the restrictions were lifted, as we've seen throughout the last year. July RevPAR is again expected to exceed 2019 levels.
Perhaps most encouragingly, in April, for the first time since the pandemic began, leisure transient, business transient and group room nights in Mainland China were all ahead of 2019 levels. This is especially impressive given the absence of international arrivals due to stringent border restrictions.
The U.S. and Canada accounts for roughly 2/3 of our rooms. And in this region, lodging demand grew impressively during the quarter, led by increasingly strong leisure demand as the number of vaccinated people continued to rise. U.S. leisure room nights in the second quarter were 15% higher than in the second quarter of 2019, though we are seeing more blending of trip purpose with the more flexible work from home or anywhere trend.
Total U.S. occupancy reached over 63% in June, with ADR down just 11% versus June of 2019. Our strong momentum has continued into the first 3.5 weeks of July, with U.S. occupancy reaching 67% and ADR down only 2% compared to July of '19. July RevPAR for this period was down around 16% versus July of 2019. The U.S. is also seeing increasing signs of recovery in both special corporate and group demand. While special corporate booking levels in the first 3.5 weeks of July are still down around 45% compared to the same period in '19, we are optimistic that we've turned a corner.
U.S. special corporate bookings rose 23% in June over May and then rose another 27% in the first 3.5 weeks of July as compared to the first 3.5 weeks of June, with improvement widespread across industries and lengthening booking windows. Many of our corporate customers are telling us they are beginning to get back on the road this summer, and we expect to see a step-up in business travel post Labor Day as children go back to in-person learning and workers increasingly return to the office.
Group bookings in the U.S. have also gained momentum. U.S. group bookings made for all future dates were down 29% in June compared to those made in June of '19, a large improvement from down 56% in March of '21 versus March of '19. And for the first time since the pandemic started, group bookings made in the month of June for any time in 2021 exceeded in-the-year bookings made in the same month of 2019. At the end of the second quarter, group revenue pace versus '19 was down 31% for the fourth quarter of this year, improving to down 21% for the first quarter of '22 and then down 12% for the second quarter of '22. However, it's still early, and we expect bookings made closer to the event date will increase group revenue on the books for these time periods. Most importantly, our sales team is holding on to average daily rate. ADR for group bookings is almost flat for the fourth quarter and 3% higher for full year 2022 compared to the same periods in 2019.
In other regions of the world, demand in the second quarter improved over the first quarter in the Middle East and Africa, in the Caribbean and Latin America and in Europe. Middle East, Africa is benefiting from relatively high vaccination rates in many countries in the Middle East. Occupancy strengthened to 47% in June, largely driven by staycations in the UAE and quarantine business. Occupancy in Caribbean and Latin America improved meaningfully during the quarter, rising to 45% in June. While urban destinations continue to struggle, given slow vaccination rates and high COVID case counts, many of our resort properties in the Caribbean and Mexico are flourishing as they benefit from easing international travel restrictions and their close proximity to the U.S.
Europe's recovery is still lagging given its heavy reliance on international guests, slower border reopenings and shifting restrictions that change on short notice. Yet, with the EU easing many travel restrictions beginning in May and an increasing number of hotels reopening, occupancy doubled in just 3 months, reaching 31% in June.
The recovery in Asia Pacific, excluding China, stalled in the second quarter as countries such as Japan, India, South Korea and Australia imposed strict lockdowns in response to sharp rises in Delta variant cases and low vaccination rates. Encouragingly, the recovery is now picking up steam again as caseloads in some countries like India have started to decline.
Shifting to the development front. Our pipeline stood at nearly 478,000 rooms at the end of the second quarter. Openings were strong, with nearly 25,000 rooms added to our system during the quarter, and deal signings were also healthy. Additionally, less than 2% of rooms fell out of the pipeline, one of the lowest levels we've seen in the last 3 years. We are very pleased with our momentum around conversions as well. Conversions accounted for 26% of rooms added in the first half of this year and have been a meaningful contributor to signings. We continue to have the largest pipeline of global rooms under construction.
We are also seeing great momentum around our branded residential business, with a record 18 residential properties expected to open during the year. For the full year, we expect that gross rooms growth will accelerate to approximately 6%. And with more visibility into anticipated full year deletions, we now expect 2021 net rooms growth to be towards the higher end of our previous expectation of 3% to 3.5%. As a reminder, this estimate includes the 100 basis point headwind from the 88 Service Properties Trust hotels that left our system earlier this year. We are pleased with the continued progress on replacing those hotels with new product. We are now in conversations for 80% of those locations, with signed or approved deals for nearly 20%.
We continue to enhance and expand Marriott Bonvoy into an immersive travel platform that includes multiple products and offerings that enable us to provide value to our members beyond hotel stays. The program grew to over 153 million members at the end of the quarter. 
Homes & Villas by Marriott International, or HVMI, which currently has around 35,000 whole-home listings, has been an attractive offering and tool for engaging with members throughout the pandemic. With nearly 40% of listings in markets where we don't have distribution, HVMI is expanding the number of destination options for our guests. Over 90% of HVMI room nights in the quarter were booked by Bonvoy members.
Our co-branded credit card holders were very active in the second quarter, with global card spending surpassing the same period in 2019. Global card acquisitions were also strong, reaching 2019 levels. Our recent credit card launches in South Korea and Mexico have seen strong initial interest from consumers in those markets. The South Korean card issuer, Shinhan Financial Group, touted the launch of our card as one of the most successful premium card launches they have ever had. Our total co-brand credit card fees in the second quarter surpassed those in the same quarter of 2019 for the first time since the pandemic began.
We've also been very pleased with our successful Uber collaboration in the U.S. The number of members linking their accounts to date has far exceeded our expectations. Activated accounts were already averaging 6 transactions in just the first 10 weeks, demonstrating our ability to drive real engagement with our Marriott Bonvoy members beyond the hotel stay.
We're always working on innovative ways to enhance our guests' full travel experience. Just last week, we became the first major hotel company to provide U.S.-based customers with the opportunity to purchase travel insurance. Guests can now buy travel insurance when they make a reservation through Marriott's website or mobile app by linking to approved products sold by Alliance Partners. As part of this distribution agreement, Marriott will earn commissions from Alliance.
In another effort to connect with Bonvoy members beyond the hotel stay, we are piloting a program that allows members to earn and redeem points at food and beverage outlets in select hotels, even if the member is not staying in the hotel. The program is currently in over 200 outlets in Asia Pacific and the Middle East, with expansion to over 500 outlets expected by the end of the year.
We also remain keenly focused on engaging with another key constituency, our owner and franchisee community. We have worked closely with them throughout the pandemic to help lower costs significantly. With some meaningful improvement in demand, profitability for many hotel owners accelerated in the second quarter. As the recovery continues, we are aligning with our owners and franchisees to balance 2 important goals as we think about our path forward: maximizing hotel-level cash flow and driving great guest experiences, as Leeny will discuss in more detail.
We are also working to address the labor challenges we are seeing, mainly in the U.S. in markets such as Southern Florida, Texas and Arizona, where demand has rebounded quickly. To that end, we are increasing our social and targeted marketing of Marriott as a best employer with career advancement opportunities as well as holding job fairs to reach qualified candidates. Hiring tools, including onetime sign-on bonuses and temporary incentives, sometimes in combination with base salary adjustments in select markets, are also being successfully employed.
Before I turn the call over to Leeny, I want to thank our amazing team of associates around the world. I have spent time in Los Angeles, Miami and New York over the last couple of weeks as I've been getting back on the road again. It has been wonderful to visit our hotels and to meet with so many of our associates and see firsthand their passion and resilience. These have been challenging times, but we are looking forward with optimism. While the time line is uncertain, I am confident that our business will fully recover and continue to grow from there.

Our second quarter results reflected the strong pace of the global recovery and the incredible resilience of our business model. Worldwide occupancy came in at 51%, a significant increase of 13 percentage points over the first quarter of this year. We also saw a meaningful improvement in our average daily rate decline versus pre-pandemic levels, with ADR down 17% in the quarter compared to the second quarter of 2019. We are optimistic that rate recovery will occur faster than in prior downturns, when ADR gains lagged occupancy gains. 
It's been very encouraging to see that in Mainland China, ADR has come back in tandem with demand. Elsewhere, ADR has also been particularly strong in areas where occupancy has rebounded quickly. In Aruba, Puerto Rico and Mexico, over half of our 28 luxury and upper upscale comparable resorts saw record high ADRs for the month of June. In the rest of the U.S., robust demand across our 34 comparable luxury resorts drove ADR for those hotels, up more than 40% above June 2019 levels. Demand in Greece rose quickly after travel restrictions were eased in April, leading to a 20% premium in ADR for the quarter versus the same period in 2019.
Global RevPAR declined 44% compared to the second quarter of 2019, a more than 15 percentage point improvement compared to the first quarter RevPAR decline versus the 2019 first quarter. We recorded gross fee revenues of $642 million in the second quarter. Our non-RevPAR-related fees again proved to be quite resilient. Totaling $160 million in the second quarter, these fees have now fully recovered to second quarter of 2019 levels.
Our residential branding fees were strong again this quarter at $14 million. Incentive management fees, or IMF, totaled $55 million in the quarter. Almost half of our IMFs were earned in Asia Pacific, mostly from hotels in Mainland China. Around 30% of our IMFs were earned in the U.S. and Canada region, with a number of U.S. luxury hotels generating more incentive fees than in the second quarter of 2019.
Second quarter G&A and other expense was 18% lower than in the second quarter of 2019, primarily as a result of our significant restructuring activities undertaken last year. We had a tax benefit of $41 million in the quarter due to releasing $118 million of reserves related to the favorable resolution of pre-acquisition Starwood tax audit. We continue to believe that going forward our core tax rate will be around 22% to 24%, absent any legislative changes to corporate tax rate. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was $558 million, which included $22 million of German government support for certain of our leased and joint venture hotels.
I also want to highlight the sale of the Punta Mita St Regis in the quarter, a joint venture in which we held a minority interest. It's encouraging to see transactions like this occurring, and we expect to receive a total of at least $36 million in after-tax cash proceeds from the sale. We will continue to operate the hotel under a long-term management agreement.
At the hotel level, our numerous cost reduction and productivity enhancement efforts have significantly lowered breakeven occupancy levels around the world, even further than we anticipated when the pandemic got underway. As a result of these efforts as well as the strong recovery progress, the financial condition of many of our owners and franchisees continues to strengthen as does our accounts receivable collections performance.
Over 95% of our managed comp hotels in Mainland China had positive gross operating profits, or GOP, in the second quarter. Our GOP margin for managed comp hotels in this region expanded over 200 basis points versus margins in the second quarter of 2019. The strong margin expansion exemplifies the beneficial impact of our recent cost reduction and productivity enhancement efforts, given operations have fully come back in Mainland China with the recovery in demand.
These results also reflect our strong top line performance, driven by meaningful share gains in the region, thanks to our strong distribution, especially in the valuable luxury space, our popular brands and our powerful loyalty platform. In the U.S., the number of managed hotels with positive GOP improved significantly in the quarter as demand increased. Approximately 90% reported positive GOP in the second quarter, up from about 60% just 1 quarter ago. As occupancies increase, we are working closely with our hotel owners around the world to balance maximizing hotel profitability while also driving guest satisfaction. We're being thoughtful about how and whether to bring back costs, programs and amenities that were reduced or eliminated as we navigated the depth of the pandemic.
For example, we've already reinstated accountability for our intent to recommend scores with accountable brand standard audits resuming next year. We also introduced a new set of renovation rules, which will allow for additional deferrals of some renovations as well as reduced scopes for certain properties. We're considering how best to evolve housekeeping brand standards across each of our hotel brand tiers while ensuring guest expectations are met. We do believe that once business has fully recovered and operations are fully backed, there will be permanent areas of margin improvement, primarily related to our productivity enhancements and the increased use of contactless technologies such as mobile check-in and mobile key.
As we look ahead to the rest of the year, while we are keeping a close eye on variant strains, we're optimistic about the continued global recovery. Our momentum has continued into July, and we expect an uptick in business travel this fall. We expect that when improved ease of international travel occurs, that will also fuel further recovery in lodging demand.
While there's still too much uncertainty to be able to give specific RevPAR or earnings guidance, I'd like to provide color on specific items where we do have some visibility. Starting with the top line, at current RevPAR levels, we still expect the sensitivity of a 1-point change in full year 2021 RevPAR versus 2019 to be $35 million to $40 million of fees. As we've seen, the relationship is not linear given the variability of IMF. We expect our non-RevPAR-related fees to continue to benefit from strong co-brand credit card fees and robust fees from our branded resident sales. We still expect full year G&A to be roughly $800 million, significantly lower than in 2019, and interest expense is still anticipated to be around $430 million. Full year cash taxes are now expected to be $325 million to $350 million.
A key component of cash flow is the loyalty program. With the acceleration of leisure demand, we've continued to see redemption nights pick up nicely, especially in our resort destination. We remain focused on carefully controlling Bonvoy program administrative costs, and we still anticipate that full year cash flows from the loyalty program could be positive before factoring in the reduced payments we will receive from the credit card companies. After factoring in these reduced payments, which are expected to effectively repay around 1/3 of the total $920 million we received in 2020, we continue to expect that cash flows from loyalty overall could be modestly negative.
With better visibility and our continued disciplined approach to investment spending, we're lowering the top end of our full year investment spending expectation and narrowing the range to $575 million to $625 million. Total investment spending includes capital and technology expenditures, loan advances, contract acquisition costs and other investing activities.
We're focused on bringing our credit statistics back in line with our historically strong investment-grade levels. Our leverage ratios continue to improve as Marriott's asset-light business model is showing its resilient cash flow characteristics. We expect continued improvements in cash flow generation as the recovery progresses.
I also want to add my appreciation for our incredible team of global associates who have worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic. They truly exemplify the Marriott's spirit to serve and take care of culture. In closing, we could not be more pleased with our progress in the quarter, and we look forward to the continued return of guests to our 7,800 hotels around the world.

I think one of the things that is the most consistent in Greater China and the U.S. is the reality that the overwhelming percentage of travelers that stay at our hotels in those 2 regions are domestic. And so we're seeing -- obviously, you're seeing some of the same trends in the U.S. that we saw earlier in Mainland China, which is that when people feel comfortable to travel, the demand picks up really, really quickly, albeit with leisure being the strongest. And clearly, that is quite helpful for the hotel's occupancy levels because they're not traveling outside their country. But I will say that I think the trends have been remarkably similar in terms of the pace of ADR recovery at the same time.
And I think the other thing that I'll point out that is interesting is that in Mainland China you do see markets, when they do have a pop in some COVID cases, they do shut down demand very quickly because the cities are closed down. We haven't obviously seen that same impact in the U.S. because the population is more varied in terms of kind of the travel and the way cities are shut down or not shut down. So in that regard, it's perhaps been a little bit more fluid in the U.S. But we have seen really terrific similarities in these markets where the occupancy is so much based on domestic travel.
I think the other thing I'll point out is that the F&B recovery in Greater China, I think, does point out the real strength of our hotel brands there and that, I think, has been really impressive as well."

But the biggest chunk of them that make up, again, when you think about it going back to 2019, call it, $579 million, the biggest chunk is obviously the credit cards. And that is going to overwhelmingly relate to both the number of cardholders and the amount they spend on their co-brand cards. And as we talked about today, their spending has actually gone back to 2019 levels, and you saw the similar thing happened to our co-brand fees. So I think both the power of Bonvoy combined with kind of general level of consumer spend and health of the economy, particularly obviously, the U.S. since these fees are overwhelmingly driven by the U.S. cardholders, is how you should think about that. I think you're going to continue to see outsized growth in our residential branding fees, although they are obviously meaningfully smaller. But timeshare fees is much more of a stable number because, as you know, those are overwhelmingly fixed. So I think the biggest driver is really how you think about consumer credit card spend on our co-brand cards."

But at the margin, where we're seeing the strongest kind of in the period for the period demand is in both the smaller and medium-sized groups as well as the social groups, where, in many cases, they've put off having events for a year and now coming forward. But again, when we think about the big chunks of business, we've still got -- I mean, I'm sure you've heard from Gaylord about their bookings. There's still a wide swath across all the big segments of group business for 2022.
The other thing to point out is that we still are in a position where the room nights are -- that are the current pace for group is still down for '22. It's just down a lot less than it used to be. And that it also -- we're seeing strong rate, where rate is actually up compared to '19. And with each progressing quarter, you see those nights improve as you move farther and farther away from Q3 of 2021, where there's still obviously some concern around these variants."

And how are the guest requests for nightly housekeeping trending? We had heard from someone else that they had doubled over the last 3 to 6 months, where the guests are proactively asking for that.
And then I guess the second part of that is simply, should we expect that the guest-facing experience at luxury and upper upscale hotels will be very similar to where it was eventually in 2019? And therefore, the best opportunity for margin improvement on the housekeeping side might be at select service hotels? Is that a fair way to think about it?"

I think, on your first question, the housekeeping protocols will really continue to be driven by guest preference and will likely vary as you kind of move up and down the quality tiers. On your second point, I think I tend to agree with you that in the luxury and upper upscale tier I think the guest expectations should be much more similar to what they saw in a pre-pandemic environment.
And then on your third question, I'm not sure I necessarily agree with that for the simple reason that what's driving margin, certainly, there's the cost side, but there is the top line piece as well. And while it's a single data point, we saw over 4th of July weekend U.S. resort ADR up about 10%. But if you carved out just the luxury tier, Jackie, you'll have to keep me honest here, but I think we were up close to 35% in ADR. And so at that sort of premium in rate, you should expect some meaningful margin improvement even if you're back to pre-pandemic service levels."

I do think, going forward, this blending of trip purpose that you've heard me talk about, we continue to think it's great for our business and our industry, and we continue to think it's here to stay for quite a while. We are optimistic about the return of business travel. We talk to about 700 corporate travel managers every month, and we are hearing anecdotally from our customers, particularly those that are in customer service businesses, law firms, accounting firms, consulting firms, that it is critical to their business that they be on the road and in person with their customers.
If anything, going forward, I do think it may be a bit more difficult to determine precisely looking at a guest walking through the lobby exactly what their trip purpose is. We're not asking you at the front desk are you here for business, are you here for leisure or both. But I do think you'll see a lengthening of stay as a result of this blending of trip purposes.

Over the past few months, I've been fortunate to have spent the majority of my time back on the road. I've been speaking with our associates, meeting with customers, attending industry conferences and engaging with our owners and franchisees, as I've been doing this week here in Orlando. My travels have taken me to Europe, the Caribbean and Latin America and many parts of the country here in the U.S. It's been wonderful to see so many people traveling again and to witness firsthand the resilience of global travel. 
This resilience was clearly evident during the third quarter. The strong global RevPAR recovery momentum we experienced in the spring continued into the summer, thanks to sustained robust leisure demand and impressive average daily rates. July worldwide RevPAR reached a new peak since the beginning of the pandemic, down just 23% compared to 2019 levels. Occupancy in July rose to 61%, an increase of over 500 basis points from June, while ADR was down less than 3% versus July of 2019. In August, global demand softened a bit primarily as a result of the impact of the Delta variant and the subsequent delay in many companies return to the office. However, demand stabilized in September before rising once again in October. Recovery trajectories remain varied by region and have been on RevPAR in all of our regions, except for Greater China improved in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. 
The recovery in Greater China has been choppier given its 0 COVID-19 policy. Mainland China was the first market to see RevPAR return to pre-pandemic levels a quarter ago. And RevPAR rose again in July to 11% above July of 2019. But demand then fell significantly in August after the government imposed strict lockdowns in response to small regional COVID outbreaks, leading to a meaningful decline in RevPAR for the month. Demand then swiftly rose again in September as soon as those restrictions were lifted. 
In the U.S. and Canada, third quarter RevPAR performance improved meaningfully to down less than 20% compared to the same quarter 2019. Results were driven by elevated leisure demand and ADR nearly at 2019 levels. Total occupancy reached 67% in July, retrenched a bit in August and held steady in September before rising again in October. Third quarter RevPAR in the U.S. and Canada improved across all brand tiers and all market segments, primary, secondary and tertiary. While primary markets are still the most challenged,  these markets saw the largest RevPAR gains during the quarter as demand in gateway cities like New York continued to rise. 
Group demand accelerated nicely in the U.S. and Canada in the quarter. Group room revenues for the quarter were down 46% versus the third quarter of 2019, a significant improvement compared to the second quarter's decline of 76% versus the same time period in '19. Group bookings have also been increasing. In the year, for the year, U.S. managed group bookings beat 2019 levels for each of the last 5 months through October, as event booking windows have shortened during the pandemic. Most importantly, group ADR has continued to rise. And for full year 2022 is currently pacing nearly 4% above prepandemic levels. 
In the U.S. and Canada, special corporate was the segment most impacted by the Delta variant during the quarter, given the delay in return to office time lines. As a reminder, the special corporate segment represents business transient customers who book at prenegotiated rates. We estimate this segment has been accounting for roughly half of business transient room nights. Although we can't know with certainty the trip purpose for transient bookings other than special corporate. The Special Corporate segment, therefore, gives us the best indication of business demand trends. Special corporate bookings showed steady recovery each month this year until we saw a slight pullback in the back half of the third quarter. The gradual upward trajectory returned in October with bookings versus 2019 growing each week during the month. Special corporate bookings are currently down less than 40% compared to the same time frame in 2019. From conversations with our corporate customers, we know that many of them, especially those with more client-facing jobs are increasingly eager to get back on the road. 
We expect the recovery in business transient to gradually continue as more workers return to the office, guest visitation policies are relaxed and greater numbers of employees are permitted to travel again. We also expect the traditional business trip to continue to evolve with a blurring of the lines between business and leisure travel. In the Middle East and Africa, third quarter RevPAR came in less than 20% below pre-pandemic levels, led by strong performance in the UAE and Qatar. RevPAR third quarter 2019 levels in Qatar, thanks to preparations for the 2022 World Cup, while RevPAR in the UAE was nearly even with 2019, largely benefiting from staycations. 
Europe's recovery took another large step forward in the quarter. Occupancy doubled in 1 quarter to reach 47% as many key international borders reopened, entry restrictions eased and almost all hotels were once again open. The Caribbean and Latin America posted third quarter RevPAR 18% below 2019 levels. Demand for our resort properties remained robust, particularly in the Caribbean and Mexico. 
Urban destinations while slowly improving, still lagged. Historically, the third quarter is the region's softest quarter seasonally, yet many resorts saw record occupancy in ADRs and our luxury ADR in the region for the quarter was ahead of 2019 levels by 32%.  The recovery in Asia Pacific, excluding China, advanced more slowly in the third quarter. Results were mixed across countries, though India saw a meaningful improvement in demand as COVID caseloads dropped and restrictions lifted. Encouragingly, many countries in the region have recently taken significant steps to reopen travel such as announcing new vaccinated travel lanes. Demands in October accelerated nicely as a result. 
Developer sentiment continues to improve in step with the global recovery and the pace of signings has picked up meaningfully this year. At the end of September, our pipeline stood at nearly 477,000 rooms. Gross room openings through the third quarter of this year exceeded the first 9 months of 2019 by 25% and surpassed the same period last year by almost 50%, and deletions from the pipeline remain at the low end of our long-term trend. Conversions remain a meaningful driver of rooms growth. Given our impressive roster of conversion-friendly brands and the meaningful top and bottom line benefits associated with being part of the Marriott system. We've already added more conversion rooms in the first 9 months of this year than we did in all of 2019. Accounting for over 30% of all signings in the first 9 months of this year, compared to around 15% of signings prepandemic, conversions are expected to be a significant contributor to growth over the next several years. 
For the full year, we still expect that gross rooms growth will accelerate to around 6%. With more clarity around our estimated full year deletions, we now expect 2021 net rooms growth will be approximately 3.5%. The attractiveness of our brands, our increasing development activity, our momentum around conversions and our industry-leading pipeline give us confidence that we will see meaningful rooms growth going forward. We expect that over the next several years, we will get back to our typical mid-single-digit net rooms growth that we demonstrated prior to the pandemic. However, the exact timing is hard to predict and will depend on a host of factors related to the global recovery, including the lending environment and evolving supply chain dynamics. Supply chain issues have pushed some openings and construction starts out a few months, but the deals continue to move forward. 
Turning to Marriott Bonvoy. Global enrollments driven by digital sign-ups accelerated during the quarter, growing the program to 157 million members as of the end of September. We remain extremely focused on fostering engagement with our members. We recently rolled out numerous successful special promotions such as our Second Annual Week of Wonders and the relaunch of Marriott Bonvoy Moments, where members can use points to gain VIP access to a broad variety of experiences. Additionally, we just announced several loyalty program updates, including status, award endpoint extensions, which should further encourage members to stay with us as global travel rebounds. Since the start of the pandemic, we've grown our share of bookings coming through our digital and other direct channels. Over 76% of our global room nights in the first 3 quarters of the year were booked through our direct channels with around half of these booked through our digital channels. 
In closing, I firmly believe that the long-term recovery is on track.  The resilience of travel and consumers' desire to visit our 7,900 global properties is undeniable. And I'm looking ahead with a lot of optimism about our future. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Leeny. Leeny?"

We're pleased with our third quarter results, which reflect the continued meaningful improvement in the global recovery. Third quarter worldwide RevPAR was down 26% compared to the same quarter in 2019 despite the impact of the Delta variant in the latter half of the quarter. In comparison, global RevPAR declined 44% in the second quarter versus the same period in 2019. Worldwide occupancy rose to 58% in the third quarter and ADR was only 4% below the third quarter of 2019. We've been very pleased to see rate almost back at pre-pandemic levels in just 20 months. In comparison, global ADR had lagged the recovery in RevPAR in prior downturns taking around 5 years to rebound after the 2009 recession and around 4 years to recover post 9/11. 
Importantly, the recovery in rate has not just been driven by customer mix. Our third quarter retail or rack rate in the U.S. and Canada was essentially flat with the third quarter of 2019. Gross fee revenue reached $776 million in the third quarter. Our non-RevPAR-related franchise fees were again particularly strong, totaling $173 million in the third quarter, 19% ahead of 2019 levels. Credit card branding fees of $113 million were up 11% compared to the 2019 third quarter on the back of strong new account acquisitions and robust global card spending. Our residential branding fees also had another outstanding quarter, totaling $18 million. 
Incentive management fees or IMF, totaled $53 million in the quarter. Over 40% of IMS were earned at resort properties with IMFs from our luxury resorts around the world up almost 30% compared to the third quarter of 2019. We were pleased to see positive results from our owned and leased portfolio in the quarter, primarily due to improved performance at hotels in the U.S. and Europe. Third quarter G&A and other expense totaled $212 million and were impacted by compensation true-ups and additional legal expenses. We continue to realize meaningful savings from the significant restructuring activities undertaken last year, and we still expect full year G&A and other to be roughly $800 million down 15% to 2019 levels. We also recorded a $164 million pretax loss on extinguishment of debt during the quarter associated with the repurchase of $1 billion of our 5.75% senior notes due in May 2025. 
As part of our balance sheet management, we are focused on bringing down our average interest rate, lengthening our average debt maturities and reducing our debt balances. Over the last 18 months, we have reduced our outstanding net debt by $1.4 billion. At the hotel level, we have significantly improved margins and lowered break-even occupancy levels around the world. In the third quarter, even with RevPAR for managed properties in the U.S. and Canada down 27% versus pre-pandemic levels, 97% of our managed hotels in the region had positive GOP or gross operating profit. 
We're proud of the work our teams have done in maximizing margins during the pandemic. We expect many of the cost reduction and productivity enhancement initiatives we have implemented will be maintained as occupancies continued to rise. Given the current labor environment, we are keeping a close eye on wage and benefit inflation as associates are hired back and open positions are filled, but our cost reduction efforts could offset this inflation in future years. 
As demand continues to rise, we're working closely with our owners and franchisees to maximize hotel profitability while delivering the outstanding guest experiences our customers expect from our brands. We're close to completing an extensive review of our brand standards and are already implementing numerous changes intended to help reduce hotel operating expenses while improving flexibility based on customer needs as occupancies rise. 
Looking ahead, we are still not in a position to be able to give specific RevPAR or earnings guidance, but I would like to share some general observations and provide color on certain additional items where we do have some visibility. We're optimistic about the pace of global recovery as we look ahead into next year as more markets reopen around the world with meaningful continued improvement in business transient and group demand, continued growth in leisure demand and healthy levels of ADR, we expect to make substantial progress in closing the gap to 2019 RevPAR levels by the end of next year, assuming no major setbacks in the pandemic recovery. 
To further help your modeling for 2021 and  as a reminder, the fourth and the first quarters of the year historically have seen lower demand in the second and third quarters. In 2019, global occupancy fell around 6 percentage points from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. 
Turning to fees. At current RevPAR levels, we still expect the sensitivity of a 1-point change in full year 2021 RevPAR versus 2019 could be $35 million to $40 million of fees. As we have seen, the relationship is not linear given the variabilities of IMF and the inclusion of non-RevPAR-related franchise fees. We expect our non-RevPAR-related fees to continue to benefit from strong credit card and residential branding fees. Interest expense is now anticipated to be around $420 million. Full year cash taxes are now expected to be $350 million to $375 million. Our anticipated full year cash flow from the loyalty program has not changed from our expectation a quarter ago. We still expect it to be positive for the full year before factoring in the reduced payments we will receive from the credit card companies. 
After factoring in these reduced payments, which are expected to effectively repay around 1/3 of the total $920 million we received in 2020. We continue to anticipate modestly negative cash flows from loyalty. We remain focused on carefully watching capital expenditures, and we now expect full year investment spending of $525 million to $550 million, below our expectation of $575 million to $625 million that we shared last quarter. Total investment spending includes capital and technology expenditures loan advances, contract acquisition costs and other investing activities. 
As we think about capital allocation, retaining our investment-grade credit rating remains a top priority.  We're making excellent progress bringing our credit ratios back in line as we continue to generate positive cash flow and manage our spending levels. Assuming this progress continues, we could be in a position to restart capital returns in the back half of 2022. We're very enthusiastic about how our business is performing, and we're happy now to take your questions. Operator?"

So the biggest improvement we expect or that we saw this quarter came from business transient, which has already picked up even a bit in October.  We're quite encouraged. Special corporate bookings have improved each week in October when we compare them to 2019. And because you asked for a little bit of granularity, I can tell you that new special corporate bookings in October for some of our key customer categories had some really nice growth. And I'll give you 2 examples.  Accounting and consulting grew 35% over what we saw last month, and technology business grew about 31% versus last month. When I slip to group, which was the second part of your question, at the end of September, group revenue was pacing down around 43% versus '19. But we think we could see some improvement from that level given the volume of last-minute bookings, which have played quite a significant recent trend.  In the quarter, fourth quarter bookings in October were above October of '19 by the highest percentage we've seen since the pandemic began. 
And maybe the last thing I would tell you on group that is also quite encouraging. When we look at the group that's on the books for 2022,  the ADR for that group is up about 3% -- almost 4% relative to the group that was on the books for 2019."

We are really pleased with the progress that we're making in that regard, probably happened faster than we might have imagined a year ago. And so with that in mind, we are feeling increasingly confident that we'll be able to turn to returning capital to shareholders, perhaps with continued progress in the recovery in the back half of 2022. 
When we think about the mix of dividends versus share repurchases, I think it's instructive to look at what we did in the Great Recession, which is that we -- as we move closer and closer to that 3 to 3.5x range, we reinstituted a modest, a smaller -- smaller than it was before, cash dividend and then return to the normal level of cash dividend before we began share repurchases. And Tony and I will be talking about that to the Board and continuing to have a dialogue, but I don't think that that's a pretty good framework for you to consider as we move forward. 
I think from a kind of rationale, David, I think one of the things we really like about the 3 to 3.5x level for us is the flexibility that it then gives us when we see an opportunistic investment come our way. And so we do want to return to that area knowing that when those come up, we want to be able to take advantage of them.

So naturally, that has come back to a higher level this year as -- and redemptions have also grown meaningfully. 
But again, I think over time, you'll continue to see some variation quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. But over time, the general direction is net neutral to the company."

Financing for acquisitions and conversions of existing assets continues to be pretty readily available. Construction financing for new builds is more challenging.  The construction financing that is out there as we've seen in other more conventional down markets tends to rely heavily on relationship lending, tends to rely heavily on quality of sponsorship and tends to rely heavily on the quality of the brand affiliation. 
In terms of additional investment, we are not seeing any sort of remarkable spike in the use of the company's balance sheet.

Over the past few months, I've been fortunate to have spent the majority of my time back on the road. I've been speaking with our associates, meeting with customers, attending industry conferences and engaging with our owners and franchisees, as I've been doing this week here in Orlando. 
My travels have taken me to Europe, the Caribbean and Latin America and many parts of the country here in the U.S. It's been wonderful to see so many people traveling again and to witness firsthand the resilience of global travel. This resilience was clearly evident during the third quarter. The strong global RevPAR recovery momentum we experienced in the spring continued into the summer, thanks to sustained robust leisure demand and impressive average daily rates. 
July worldwide RevPAR reached a new peak since the beginning of the pandemic, down just 23% compared to 2019 levels. Occupancy in July rose to 61%, an increase of over 500 basis points from June, while ADR was down less than 3% versus July of 2019. In August, global demand softened a bit, primarily as a result of the impact of the Delta variant and the subsequent delay in many companies' return to the office. However, demand stabilized in September before rising once again in October. 
Recovery trajectories remain varied by region and have been. RevPAR in all of our regions, except for Greater China, improved in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. The recovery in Greater China has been choppier, given its zero-COVID-19 policy. 
Mainland China was the first market to see RevPAR return to pre-pandemic levels a quarter ago, and RevPAR rose again in July to 11% above July of 2019. But demand then fell significantly in August after the government imposed strict lockdowns in response to small regional COVID outbreaks, leading to a meaningful decline in RevPAR for the month. Demand then swiftly rose again in September as soon as those restrictions were lifted.  
In the U.S. and Canada, third quarter RevPAR performance improved meaningfully to down less than 20% compared to the same quarter 2019. Results were driven by elevated leisure demand and ADR nearly at 2019 levels. Total occupancy reached 67% in July, retrenched a bit in August and held steady in September before rising again in October. 
Third quarter RevPAR in the U.S. and Canada improved across all brand tiers and all market segments: primary, secondary and tertiary. While primary markets are still the most challenged,  these markets saw the largest RevPAR gains during the quarter as demand in gateway cities like New York continued to rise. 
Group demand accelerated nicely in the U.S. and Canada in the quarter. Group room revenues for the quarter were down 46% versus the third quarter of 2019, a significant improvement compared to the second quarter's decline of 76% versus the same time period in '19. 
Group bookings have also been increasing. In the year for the year, U.S. managed group bookings beat 2019 levels for each of the last 5 months through October, as event booking windows have shortened during the pandemic. Most importantly, group ADR has continued to rise. And for full year 2022, it's currently pacing nearly 4% above pre-pandemic levels.  
In the U.S. and Canada, special corporate was the segment most impacted by the Delta variant during the quarter, given the delay in return to office time lines. As a reminder, the special corporate segment represents business transient customers who book at prenegotiated rates. We estimate this segment has been accounting for roughly half of business transient room nights. Although we can't know with certainty the trip purpose for transient bookings other than special corporate, the special corporate segment, therefore, gives us the best indication of business demand trends. 
Special corporate bookings showed steady recovery each month this year until we saw a slight pullback in the back half of the third quarter. The gradual upward trajectory returned in October, with bookings versus 2019 growing each week during the month. Special corporate bookings are currently down less than 40% compared to the same time frame in 2019. 
From conversations with our corporate customers, we know that many of them, especially those with more client-facing jobs, are increasingly eager to get back on the road. We expect the recovery in business transient to gradually continue as more workers return to the office, guest visitation policies are relaxed and greater numbers of employees are permitted to travel again. We also expect the traditional business trip to continue to evolve, with a blurring of the lines between business and leisure travel. 
In the Middle East and Africa, third quarter RevPAR came in less than 20% below pre-pandemic levels, led by strong performance in the UAE and Qatar. RevPAR topped third quarter 2019 levels in Qatar, thanks to preparations for the 2022 World Cup, while RevPAR in the UAE was nearly even with 2019, largely benefiting from staycations. 
Europe's recovery took another large step forward in the quarter. Occupancy doubled in 1 quarter to reach 47% as many key international borders reopened, entry restrictions eased and almost all hotels were once again open. The Caribbean and Latin America posted third quarter RevPAR 18% below 2019 levels. 
Demand for our resort properties remained robust, particularly in the Caribbean and Mexico. Urban destinations, while slowly improving, still lagged. Historically, the third quarter is the region's softest quarter seasonally, yet many resorts saw record occupancy in ADRs, and our luxury ADR in the region for the quarter was ahead of 2019 levels by 32%.  
The recovery in Asia Pacific, excluding China, advanced more slowly in the third quarter. Results were mixed across countries, though India saw a meaningful improvement in demand as COVID caseloads dropped and restrictions lifted. Encouragingly, many countries in the region have recently taken significant steps to reopen travel, such as announcing new vaccinated travel lanes. Demands in October accelerated nicely as a result.  
Developer sentiment continues to improve, in step with the global recovery, and the pace of signings has picked up meaningfully this year. At the end of September, our pipeline stood at nearly 477,000 rooms. Gross room openings through the third quarter of this year exceeded the first 9 months of 2019 by 25% and surpassed the same period last year by almost 50%, and deletions from the pipeline remain at the low end of our long-term trend. 
Conversions remain a meaningful driver of rooms growth, given our impressive roster of conversion-friendly brands and the meaningful top and bottom line benefits associated with being part of the Marriott system. We've already added more conversion rooms in the first 9 months of this year than we did in all of 2019. Accounting for over 30% of all signings in the first 9 months of this year compared to around 15% of signings pre-pandemic, conversions are expected to be a significant contributor to growth over the next several years.  
For the full year, we still expect that gross rooms growth will accelerate to around 6%. With more clarity around our estimated full year deletions, we now expect 2021 net rooms growth will be approximately 3.5%. The attractiveness of our brands, our increasing development activity, our momentum around conversions and our industry-leading pipeline give us confidence that we will see meaningful rooms growth going forward. 
We expect that over the next several years, we will get back to our typical mid-single-digit net rooms growth that we demonstrated prior to the pandemic. However, the exact timing is hard to predict and will depend on a host of factors related to the global recovery, including the lending environment and evolving supply chain dynamics. Supply chain issues have pushed some openings and construction starts out a few months, but the deals continue to move forward.  
Turning to Marriott Bonvoy. Global enrollments, driven by digital sign-ups, accelerated during the quarter, growing the program to 157 million members as of the end of September. We remain extremely focused on fostering engagement with our members. We recently rolled out numerous successful special promotions, such as our second annual Week of Wonders and the relaunch of Marriott Bonvoy Moments, where members can use points to gain VIP access to a broad variety of experiences. 
Additionally, we just announced several loyalty program updates, including status, award and point extensions, which should further encourage members to stay with us as global travel rebounds. Since the start of the pandemic, we've grown our share of bookings coming through our digital and other direct channels. Over 76% of our global room nights in the first 3 quarters of the year were booked through our direct channels, with around half of these booked through our digital channels.  
In closing, I firmly believe that the long-term recovery is on track. The resilience of travel and consumers' desire to visit our 7,900 global properties is undeniable, and I'm looking ahead with a lot of optimism about our future. 
At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Leeny. Leeny?"

We're pleased with our third quarter results, which reflect the continued meaningful improvement in the global recovery. Third quarter worldwide RevPAR was down 26% compared to the same quarter in 2019 despite the impact of the Delta variant in the latter half of the quarter. In comparison, global RevPAR declined 44% in the second quarter versus the same period in 2019. Worldwide occupancy rose to 58% in the third quarter and ADR was only 4% below the third quarter of 2019. 
We've been very pleased to see rate almost back at pre-pandemic levels in just 20 months. In comparison, global ADR had lagged the recovery in RevPAR in prior downturns, taking around 5 years to rebound after the 2009 recession and around 4 years to recover post 9/11. Importantly, the recovery in rate has not just been driven by customer mix. Our third quarter retail or rack rate in the U.S. and Canada was essentially flat with the third quarter of 2019. 
Gross fee revenue reached $776 million in the third quarter. Our non-RevPAR-related franchise fees were again particularly strong, totaling $173 million in the third quarter, 19% ahead of 2019 levels. Credit card branding fees of $113 million were up 11% compared to the 2019 third quarter on the back of strong new account acquisitions and robust global card spending. Our residential branding fees also had another outstanding quarter, totaling $18 million. 
Incentive management fees or IMF, totaled $53 million in the quarter. Over 40% of IMFs were earned at resort properties, with IMFs from our luxury resorts around the world up almost 30% compared to the third quarter of 2019. We were pleased to see positive results from our owned and leased portfolio in the quarter, primarily due to improved performance at hotels in the U.S. and Europe. 
Third quarter G&A and other expense totaled $212 million and were impacted by compensation true-ups and additional legal expenses. We continue to realize meaningful savings from the significant restructuring activities undertaken last year, and we still expect full year G&A and other to be roughly $800 million, down 15% to 2019 levels. 
We also recorded a $164 million pretax loss on extinguishment of debt during the quarter associated with the repurchase of $1 billion of our 5.75% senior notes due in May 2025. As part of our balance sheet management, we are focused on bringing down our average interest rate, lengthening our average debt maturities and reducing our debt balances. Over the last 18 months, we have reduced our outstanding net debt by $1.4 billion. 
At the hotel level, we have significantly improved margins and lowered break-even occupancy levels around the world. In the third quarter, even with RevPAR for managed properties in the U.S. and Canada down 27% versus pre-pandemic levels, 97% of our managed hotels in the region had positive GOP or gross operating profit. 
We're proud of the work our teams have done in maximizing margins during the pandemic. We expect many of the cost reduction and productivity enhancement initiatives we have implemented will be maintained as occupancies continued to rise. Given the current labor environment, we are keeping a close eye on wage and benefit inflation as associates are hired back and open positions are filled, but our cost reduction efforts could offset this inflation in future years.  
As demand continues to rise, we're working closely with our owners and franchisees to maximize hotel profitability, while delivering the outstanding guest experiences our customers expect from our brands. We're close to completing an extensive review of our brand standards and are already implementing numerous changes intended to help reduce hotel operating expenses, while improving flexibility based on customer needs as occupancies rise. Looking ahead, we are still not in a position to be able to give specific RevPAR or earnings guidance, but I would like to share some general observations and provide color on certain additional items where we do have some visibility. 
We're optimistic about the pace of global recovery as we look ahead into next year as more markets reopen around the world. With meaningful continued improvement in business transient and group demand, continued growth in leisure demand and healthy levels of ADR, we expect to make substantial progress in closing the gap to 2019 RevPAR levels by the end of next year, assuming no major setbacks in the pandemic recovery. To further help your modeling for 2021, as a reminder, the fourth and the first quarters of the year historically have seen lower demand than the second and third quarters. In 2019, global occupancy fell around 6 percentage points from the third quarter to the fourth quarter.  
Turning to fees. At current RevPAR levels, we still expect the sensitivity of a 1-point change in full year 2021 RevPAR versus 2019 could be $35 million to $40 million of fees. As we have seen, the relationship is not linear given the variabilities of IMFs and the inclusion of non-RevPAR-related franchise fees. We expect our non-RevPAR-related fees to continue to benefit from strong credit card and residential branding fees. Interest expense is now anticipated to be around $420 million. Full year cash taxes are now expected to be $350 million to $375 million. 
Our anticipated full year cash flow from the loyalty program has not changed from our expectation a quarter ago. We still expect it to be positive for the full year before factoring in the reduced payments we will receive from the credit card companies. After factoring in these reduced payments, which are expected to effectively repay around 1/3 of the total $920 million we received in 2020, we continue to anticipate modestly negative cash flows from loyalty. 
We remain focused on carefully watching capital expenditures, and we now expect full year investment spending of $525 million to $550 million, below our expectation of $575 million to $625 million that we shared last quarter. Total investment spending includes capital and technology expenditures loan advances, contract acquisition costs and other investing activities. 
As we think about capital allocation, retaining our investment-grade credit rating remains a top priority. We're making excellent progress bringing our credit ratios back in line as we continue to generate positive cash flow and manage our spending levels. Assuming this progress continues, we could be in a position to restart capital returns in the back half of 2022.

So the biggest improvement we expect or that we saw this quarter came from business transient, which has already picked up even a bit in October.  We're quite encouraged. Special corporate bookings have improved each week in October when we compare them to 2019. 
And because you asked for a little bit of granularity, I can tell you that new special corporate bookings in October for some of our key customer categories had some really nice growth. And I'll give you 2 examples. Accounting and consulting grew 35% over what we saw last month, and technology business grew about 31% versus last month. 
When I slip to group, which was the second part of your question, at the end of September, group revenue was pacing down around 43% versus '19. But we think we could see some improvement from that level given the volume of last-minute bookings, which have been quite a significant recent trend.  In the quarter, fourth quarter, bookings in October were above October of '19 by the highest percentage we've seen since the pandemic began.  
And maybe the last thing I would tell you on growth -- on group, excuse me, that is also quite encouraging. When we look at the group that's on the books for 2022,  the ADR for that group is up about 3%, almost 4%, relative to the group that was on the books for 2019."

Now what I can tell you is we are, with increasing confidence, feeling like in the midterm, we're going to get back to that mid-single-digit rooms growth.

I think, number one, the continued unpredictability of the pandemic. But maybe more impactful, we have seen some delays in construction starts, some of which have been direct results of interruption to the supply chain. But again, those feel like short-term impediments. 
And in fact, it's interesting if you look at the pipeline, both in Q2 and Q3, the fallout we saw was the lowest we've seen in the last 3 years. So that would certainly suggest that, while we may have to struggle through a bit of these short-term delays, it actually bolsters our confidence in our ability to get back to that mid-single-digit growth rate."

And the only other thing I'll say is that, while ADR is still not back to 2019 levels, traditionally, in our business, we have been able to see that ADR tends to be able to hold on to inflation, that we've seen ADR increases that are at least inflation, if not higher.

So first of all, similar messages to what you've heard before, which, maintaining our investment-grade credit rating is a top priority for Marriott. We do want to continue to get our credit ratios back to the 3 to 3.5x levels of debt-to-EBITDAR. We are really pleased with the progress that we're making in that regard. It probably happened faster than we might have imagined a year ago. And so with that in mind, we are feeling increasingly confident that we'll be able to turn to returning capital to shareholders, perhaps with continued progress in the recovery in the back half of 2022. 
When we think about the mix of dividends versus share repurchases, I think it's instructive to look at what we did in the Great Recession, which is that we -- as we move closer and closer to that 3 to 3.5x range, we reinstituted a modest, a smaller than -- smaller-than-it-was-before cash dividend and then return to the normal level of cash dividend before we began share repurchases. And Tony and I will be talking about that to the Board and continuing to have a dialogue, but I don't think that, that's a pretty good framework for you to consider as we move forward. 
I think from a kind of rationale, David, I think one of the things we really like about the 3 to 3.5x level, for us, is the flexibility that it then gives us when we see an opportunistic investment come our way. And so we do want to return to that area knowing that when those come up, we want to be able to take advantage of them.

So naturally, that has come back to a higher level this year as -- and redemptions have also grown meaningfully.

So maybe I'll remind you, we got a question on this topic a quarter ago. And I think the specific question we got was, within our portfolio, in terms of the economics to MI or to Marriott from a fee perspective, how would a luxury hotel like a Ritz-Carlton compare to a lower-tier product like a Fairfield Inn? And the response we gave a quarter ago was, obviously, subject to variability by geography, but it's about 10x. 
We see about 10x the fee potential in a luxury hotel that we typically achieve in a select service hotel. They are more complex projects. They are more capital-intensive projects. The complexities of getting them financed are not insignificant. But as evidenced by the volume of luxury and upper upscale in our portfolio, the strength of our brands, I think, command pretty effective ability to source debt for those projects."

I think when you look at our retail rates across the portfolio, we are essentially back to 2019 levels. And that's another statistical illustration of the strength of our pricing power.
